Koyambedu wholesale market, Chennais hub of perishable goods, gets nearly 550 loads of vegetables from neighbouring States daily.R. Jamuna, a resident of Nolambur, said: I am adding more green and seasonal vegetables to the menu. Until a few weeks ago, many vegetables, such as broad beans and carrots, were priced at over Rs.70 a kg.While retail traders in smaller markets are glad that more customers are visiting their shops, wholesalers in Koyambedu note that sales have not picked up much as other neighbouring places like Tiruttani get produce from local areas. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the prices have dropped by 10 per cent this winter compared to last year because of sufficient water in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Many retailers from other places such as Tindivanam, Sulurpet, Arakkonam, Puducherry and Chengalpet usually source vegetables from Koyambedu. They do not frequent market now as they get produce from local areas for the past few days, he said.Retailers like P. Sundarraj of MKB Nagar say there has been an increase in the number of customers by at least 40 per cent ever since the cost dropped a week ago. Many people are buying vegetables like carrots, beans, peas and broad beans as they are much cheaper now, he said. The prices may remain stable till March. Several vegetables such as cabbage, radish, onion and tomato are priced within Rs. 30 a kg after many months. Drumstick is perhaps among the few costly vegetables, sold for Rs.80 per kg."

However, the farmers have started using the light trap method to control insects. Many of cereal crops such as sorghum, rice and maize and vegetable crops such as tomato and brinjal attract insects and pests. Horticultural crops and pulse crops also attract insects.Agricultural officials and researchers say that one light trap was enough for controlling most of the insects that might attack the crop. It can be used from the stage of planting to harvest. As per the method, the traps should be placed at a centre of field for three hours between 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., as insects are active mainly during this period.J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur, told The Hindu that light trap was a vital tool to trap both the sexes of insects. It could reduce the carryover pest population substantially. Many farmers in Karur district had started placing light traps to kill insects.P. Baskar, a farmer at Thammanaickenpatti, said that he had raised bitter guard, onion, brinjal and a few other horticultural crops in his field. He had brought his field under the light trap system. He could say that his field was almost insect-free thanks to the light trap.He said he had bought the light for Rs.1500. It was a cheap and effective method to control insects."

The prices of shallots that hovered around Rs. 18 per kg last month came down suddenly to Rs. 8 in Dindigul on Monday.Regular arrivals from Theni, Andipatti, Dharapuram and Udumalpet were good.With sufficient rainfall at the right time, the yield was high in major shallot production centres in the district now, said onion traders in the whole sale market.The market received 4,500 bags of shallots on Monday, of which the arrival from domestic production centres, especially Iyyalur, Eriyode and Gujiliamparai, was around 2,800 bags.Increase in production and arrivals from neighbouring districts caused a glut in the wholesale market. Exports too did not pick up much in the last one week owing to fresh arrivals of shallots. Exporters preferred matured, completely dry shallots. The shelf life of fresh onions was very short when compared to matured onions, traders added. The farmers were deeply worried over the sudden slump in shallot prices as the existing sale price would not even meet their plucking and transport costs.The traders opined that shallot prices would fall further in the months to come as harvesting would be completed in major production centres in the neighbouring districts.Normally, the wholesale market receives onion in large quantities from Nilakottai, Sengurichi, Gujiliamparai in Dindigul district, and Thuraiyur, Udumalpet and Namakkal, some of the major onion production centres in the State, and from Mysore in Karnataka.Rise in production, huge arrivals from other districts lead to a glut"

The Gandhi Market, established in 1940, has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about six acres of land, attracting thousands of traders and consumers every day. The market caters not only to the city but also to retail traders from several small and big towns in the neighbouring districts.The construction of a central market was announced in July 2014 by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, when she represented the Srirangam constituency. The new market is coming up on 10 acres of land at Kallikudi, off the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, about 15 km from here.Officials say the market would have all modern infrastructure with 1,000 shops, a cold storage of 2,000 tonne capacity, sorting and grading yards and wide internal roads to facilitate easy movement of trucks and loading and unloading facility. Although representatives of traders associations say they did not mind relocating, they wanted the entire market shifted as a whole.A meeting of various traders associations held on Friday, with Ve. Govindarajalu, State treasurer, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu in the chair, decided to go on a 24-hour strike from 10 p.m. on February 11 to 10 p.m. on February 12 essentially to bring to the notice of the government the concerns of the traders.Although we are not opposed to shifting, we want the market to be shifted entirely. Besides, the shops that are being built at Kallikudi are too small and in multiple floors. The government should have consulted the traders, Mr.Govindarajalu said. Echoing his views, A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association, said onion and potato commission mandi traders required shops of 1,000 to 2,000 square feet area on the ground floor. Traders would face difficulty in lifting loads to the upper floors.U.S. Karuppiah of the Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Permanent and Platform Traders Association said there was no information on who would be allotted shops at the new market and whether the market would be shifted entirely.However, one of the platform traders association has decided not to participate in the strike. A few other associations are also yet to decide.Onion and potato traders need shops of 1,000 to 2,000 sq ft. area and will face difficulty in shifting consignments to upper floors.Thangaraj A.,General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association"
58f8de95a3d24b0b70c3b150,Winter harvest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/winter-harvest/article8236293.ece,2016-02-14,,The Hindu,"Grant Roads Bhaji galli will be endlessly fascinating for anyone even slightly interested in food. It is also a reminder that the traditional Indian diet is seasonal, local, minimal in its environmental impact and above all, striking in its immense variety. When I went there on a cool morning, little hillocks of pearly ponkh were being stacked at my feet. Big jute sacks, plump with onions, were being emptied onto raised platforms. Sweet-fleshed yams were being rolled onto colourful plastic crates. Cardboard boxes were being prised open to reveal ruby-hued strawberries and tangy star fruit.Bhaji galli has a fairly old pedigree, originally named for Jagannath Shankarsheth (Jagannath Lane). Its colloquial appellation comes from the vegetable vendors from Vasai who used to unload fresh vegetables that they got from Vasais weekly market, in the compound of the nearby Balchandra building. The number of vendors then slowly swelled, until the entire lane was overwhelmed by a flood of fruit and vegetable sellers.Today, the lane hums with a steady stream of Mumbaikars, some from as far away as Powai and Borivali. Bhaji galli is dotted with vendors on both sides, many specialising in certain kinds of produce: root veggies, kanda batata, fruits, or foreign vegetables. I am drawn to a stall selling a bewildering array of wintry tubers and greens for undhiyu: green Surti papdi, baby eggplants, purple kand, sweet and regular potato, seedless (ariya) kakdi, Rajagiri bananas and fenugreek. The lady next to me is buying up several packets of these. I come from Borivali once a month to Bhaji galli, she explains as I gawk at the quantity of vegetables she is buying. I have to buy enough undhiyu samaan to last my family that long. But why come all the way here, I persist? She gave me a long, cold look and then she smiled gently. She spoke in a soft voice, as if to an insane person. Bhaji galli has the best quality vegetables, she said, enunciating each word.I slink away to the next vendor, who has heaped posies of mogri or rat-tail radish pods, both green and purple. Oddly, for someone who isnt too fond of radish, I cant get enough of mogri, which I mostly eat raw. But this time, I stir fry them lightly at home with some chopped garlic and salt. They are still delicious, but seem to have lost their sharp flavour and their glorious crunch, having turned a bit fibrous.I move down the lane to Chachas stall, one frequented by my mum for years. We have never been able to find out his real name, You call me chacha only. But we do know that he sometimes keeps amba haldi (mango ginger), another winter favourite. Amba haldi looks almost exactly like regular ginger, tastes a little like green mango with an acerbic aftertaste, but is an obscure relative of the turmeric family. The mango ginger is ripe for pickling with just a little salt water and lime juice and is eaten with every meal to ward off winter infections. But you could also lace your curry with a few slivers, to give it a sour-sharp tang. Its widely used to perk up South Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes.A little further into the lane, I spot an enormous heap of fresh, leafy vegetables in every possible shade of green. Behind the pile presides a dignified old lady.There is sarson or mustard greens, the main ingredient in the hearty Punjabi winter staple, sarson da saag. There are bunches of spinach and bathua, both of which make first-rate pakodas; I find bathuas bitterness too acrid to consume except when shrouded by a shell of deep-fried dough. But in Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pants Classic Cooking of Punjab , bathua sits comfortably with sarson, spinach and moolipatta (radish leaf) in the aforementioned sarson da saag. This time, I will try and stuff it into a paratha. I also buy the dill, parsley, tender green garlic, pudina and spring onions, ready to be transformed into osh, the warming, nutritious stew that is much loved by Iranians. The lady also has baby methi and gongura; the latter I am going to try and cook with shrimp, Andhra-style.While the lady is rootling around in her tin box for change, I spot a vendor surrounded by a swathe of carrots, both the orange English carrots and the red-hued Indian carrots. The red carrots are more intensely-flavoured and carrotier than their compatriots. I will add them to green peas for a delicious gajar matar sabzi and if some are left over, I will try to cadge the century-old recipe of vegetable achaar from my Punjabi friend. Into her pickle go gobi, shalgam, gajar tempered with salt, chilli, mustard seeds and oil with a little jaggery. It is a delectable winter tradition.A market is an excellent way to get under the skin of a place, and Bhaji galli is a true reflection of Mumbai. The soft drink crates and plastic trays overflowing with international produce reflect the citys growing omnivorousness. Here, a tray heaving with snowy daikon radish. There, a crowd of avocados balanced precariously on a rickety wooden stand. Naturally, the radish and avocados make their way into my shopping bag.What else do I bring home? A perfectly spherical white gourd, which I will stuff with mincemeat as soon as I finish writing this story. Little fronds of fennel which I happily eat raw in salads, but also braised and served on a bed of white fish. Postbox-red chillies. Tart gooseberries or amla. (Amla juice is the elixir I should absorb but amla murabba is what I will actually eat, with stacks of thepla). And finally, green gram, nestled within their pods (a proper pain to shell). Fried or roasted with a light sprinkle of salt and chilli together with a squeeze of lime, they make for the most satisfying winter evening snack.The author is a freelance writer and editor"

Colours extracted from leaves, flowers and berries besides tree barks have been used to dye these fabrics. It is very difficult to get dark colours and hence they look so dull, Madhusoodhanan D. of Kollam Handlooms says.Onion peels, red sandal, pith of jackfruit tree, saffron flowers, Aloe Vera, rind of pomegranate, gooseberries, Indigo, coffee and tea powders, teak leaf and almond leaf are some of the natural ingredients used for the colours.

PHOTOS: A. MURALITHARANmajority of traders of Gandhi Market downed their shutters on Friday to draw the attention of the government to their concerns over a possible move to shift them to the new Central Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers, coming up at Kallikudi on the outskirts of the city.The 24-hour strike commenced at 10 p.m. on Thursday in response to a call given many traders associations. While most shops, including wholesale and retail ones dealing in onion, potato, and vegetables, remained closed, some retailers were seen functioning. A few associations such as the platform traders and fruit sellers had announced that they were not participating in the strike.Although there was no indication from any of the government agencies on the possibility of shifting the traders to the new market, the traders organisations had expressed apprehensions that they may be asked to do so.The traders contended that the new market at Kallikudi did not have adequate number of shops to accommodate all traders operating out of Gandhi Market now. Besides, the shops built at the new market were small in size and would not meet the requirement of wholesale and retail traders, they contended.The strike comes in the context of a long-pending proposal of the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation to shift the market to the outskirts of the city.

There were over 2,500 shops in the Gandhi Market, he said and affirmed that all could not be accommodated at the new market.Besides, the shops at the new market were located on three floors and unsuitable for traders. The shops, he said, were just 10x10 feet in size. Wholesale traders would require shops of a minimum size of 1,000 square feet and retailers about 500 sq. ft. of space.Many retailers were women and they would face difficulty in operating from the city outskirts. Besides, it would entail higher transportation costs, he contended. Instead of shifting the market, Mr. Govindarajalu said the Gandhi Market could be expanded if the Womens Prison, adjacent to the market, was shifted to some other place.NOT AN EASY TASKTraders associations want all the shops to be shifted to the new placeA majority of retail traders, particularly women, may find it difficult to travel to KallikudiWholesale traders say the shops built in the new complex are too small for them"

Among other efforts, it plans to revive karunkanni, a cotton variety getting extinct. It will convert cotton into value-added products, including naturally-dyed yarn, and sell it to other khadi units for cloth production. It has roped in traditional farmers in Athoor and Reddiyarchathiram blocks in Dindigul district to raise this variety. Similar efforts are on to revive 23 traditional cotton varieties throughout the country.These points were highlighted at a workshop on Revival of desi cotton and contemporary khadi held at Gandhigram near here on Monday. Trust secretary K. Siva Kumar said that the proposed facility would procure the entire produce from farmers and add value to it. The main aim was to end farmers marketing problem. This short staple yarn was best suited for producing bandage cloth and bed sheets.The natural dying unit would use cotton to make naturally-dyed yarn to tap emerging markets. Seeds would be supplied to farmers and the unit would act as a full-fledged model centre for organic cotton and value addition. It would also facilitate formation of a federation of desi cotton producers in the State, he added.Ananthoo of TULA Organic Clothing said that 97 per cent of cotton produced in the country before Independence was of traditional variety. The British, who tried to kill native varieties, and introduce foreign varieties could convert just three per cent of farmers. But, after Independence, Indian scientists had successfully killed traditional varieties and converted 97 per cent per cent of farmers into hybrid cultivation. Now, khadi units were using foreign cotton. Production and input costs for traditional varieties were very less when compared to those from Egypt and the US, he added.Other varietiesKrishna Prasad of Sahaja Samrudha, a peoples movement in Karnataka, said that 23 traditional varieties, especially Bengal Desi, Pundur, Kaala cotton, Wagadh, Karunganni, Jayadhar and Pandrapura, were being raised in the country for the past 1,000 years. Efforts were under way to revive these varieties. All Indian varieties had been grown as inter-crop to channa, coriander, chillies, pulses, tomato and onion, he said.Traditional cotton grower Visvasam of Vellode said that 500 acres of karunkanni variety had been raised in Reddiyarchatram and Athoor blocks. Owing to lack of marketing facilities, many farmers had shifted to other crops. These farmers would be encouraged to grow this variety. Besides Dindigul, Karunkanni was grown in Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam only, he added."

Minister for Marketing T. Harish Rao directed the officials to demarcate place for onion farmers so that they could sell it directly to consumers.The government is of the opinion that the initiative would not only protect the onion farmers from price fall but also protect consumers from exploitation by middlemen and retailers with price rise. The Minister directed the officials to provide required space for special onion sale counters at all rythu bazaars in Hyderabad and Secunderabad.Further, he asked the officials to take up a campaign in Mahabubnagar, Medak and Ranga Reddy districts, where onion was grown on a large-scale, and the sale facility to be provided to farmers in rythu bazaars. Arrangements were being made to encourage consumers to buy onions only from farmers. Mr. Harish Rao took serious note of fleecing of consumers by the onion traders in vegetable markets even as the prices climbed down drastically in recent months. The government had provided onion seed at 70 per cent subsidy to farmers but the farming community had failed to get minimum support price due to lack of marketing facility in the State, he added."

Following the Ministers instructions, the Chief Executive Officer of Rythu Bazars organised an emergency meeting with the estate officers across the twin cities and drew plans for implementation, a press release informed on Saturday.

The traders fear if the protests continue, it is bound to hit supplies to the Capital. The availability of even milk is likely to be hit with some parts of the city already facing such shortages.Sunday was a calm day at the mandis in the city as they remain shut and supplies were not hit until Saturday as well. But what lies ahead is quite uncertain as traders claim the impact would be visible from Monday onwards. We hope the roads are opened by tomorrow as trucks begin to reach the mandis early morning. Unfortunately, majority of these supplies come from Haryana side, so if the protests do not ease, then problems would begin, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur Agricultural Marketing Produce Committee (APMC).Having hardly any produce of its own, Delhi largely gets fruits and vegetables from other States like Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.The problem being that except from UP, trucks bringing in supplies of essential commodities from other States come to Delhi via Haryana (NH 1, NH 8 and NH 10) which are being blocked by the protestors. Denying reports that wholesale prices of some vegetables have already increased, Mr. Sharma added, So far, there has been no hike in cost of any fruit or vegetable. The rumours are a bid by retailers to cash in on the Jat protests.According to traders at the Azadpur Mandi, the largest fruit and vegetable market in Asia, the items which may take a hit if the roads are not opened include potatoes, cauliflowers, onions, grapes, apples, spinach and so on. The transporters who are aware of the protests are now avoiding going via Haryana and are now taking an alternate route via Baghpat in Western Uttar Pradesh, said the trader.Milk supplies also hitAreas like Rohini and Pitampura faced shortage of milk supplies on Sunday. One of the largest milk suppliers in Delhi, Mother Dairy Fruit and Vegetable Private Limited, also said that it has begun to face problems because of the crisis.Sandeep Ghosh, Business Head  Milk section of Mother Dairy said, We are currently experiencing some consumer supply disruptions in select pockets of Delhi. However, we are taking all corrective measures to ensure that the consumer supplies are normalised by evening today.While in terms of raw milk movement, we are assessing the situation to address any such supply challenges to the incoming milk to our plants, he added. Operations at Amul's milk plant in Rohtak remained suspended. It has a capacity of 5 lakh litres per day.

I asked him why he didnt eat it, my friend Sudeshna Shome Ghosh wrote. His response was, How could I? I didnt know what it was. My friend rolled her eyes (you can now do that thanks to an updated emoticon app), I LOLd and that was the end of it.The conversation brought back dabba memories, of going to school and opening my stainless steel lunch box in the afternoon, hours after it was packed, wondering about its contents. With the mother being a fabulous cook, the dabba was usually crammed with theplas folded in half with a dibbi of mango pickle, jeera rice with caramelized onion and curd, or rotis that miraculously stayed soft so that they could be torn with two fingers and eaten with sabji . There was lunchbox envy, where I coveted my classmates tiffins because they brought food that wasnt familiar to me. I yearned for cucumber sandwiches, after re-reading Enid Blyton books, even though the white bread would be curling up at the edges by afternoon. I even wanted the dabba that held cold, clammy Maggi noodles, something that I now wouldnt touch with a barge pole. But at that time, it was as exciting as moringa leaves are now to chefs.Now there are plenty of cookery books, blogs and Instagram accounts with innovative lunch box ideas, all just a Google search away. Blogger and nutritionist Nandita Iyer, better known as Saffron Trail online, has simple, healthy ideas, which include vegetable peanut noodles, pita pocket pizza sandwiches, and puliyogare or tamarind rice. Lulu Loves Bombay blogs about travel, her children, and food. Her sweet potato discs sound like a lovely addition to the dabba , as do her methi thepla and mango chunda. Sanjeeta KKs blog, Lite Bite, has a Lunchbox Bites section with some handy tips and recipes such as for muthiyas and wholegrain chillas.On Instagram, Lunch Box Dad, Beau Coffrans mealtime hacks include rocket ships from bread and cheese, and Spider-Man lunches with berries; while bleary-eyed parents may not be keen to wake up and make food art, its a fun account to follow. Grace Halls Eats Amazing blog focuses on Bento-style lunches for her son and follows themes such as Halloween, rainbows, and gardens. Her #PackedLunchLove Project has creative boxes that, she promises, take just a few minutes to prepare and are a visual feast. A few years ago, graphic designer and illustrator David Laferrieres innovative sandwich bag art went viral. Hes made over 1,800 sandwich bag drawings with monsters and kites.And when in doubt, return to the library.Apart from the usual cluster of recipe books, check out Karen Le Billons French Kids Eat Everything , a charming account of a family, with two picky-eater children, that moves from the USA to France and discovers how the French government and the school system strengthen food education. Then theres Chris Butterworths Lunchbox: The Story of Your Food , illustrated by Lucia Gaggiotti. A picture book, it takes young readers on a journey from farm to fork, getting them to think: where did the food in my lunchbox come from? Its a lovely way of engaging children with farmers who grow our food and get them curious about what they are eating.Mommy Go Lightly, a.k.a. journalist and author Lalita Iyer, writes lovingly about dabbas on her blog, Food is intuitive, she writes about packing her son Res lunch box. At least thats how it should be. Try different things and figure out what works for your child. My tip is, make it visually exciting. Make it look good. All you need is colours. Pretty much all my mommy and daddy friends gave me tips like that when I talked to them about the art of dabba packing: fruits and dry fruits in small Tupperware boxes to snack on in the bus; use leftovers innovatively.Shinibali Mitra Saigal, who packs food for her nine-year-old daughter said, Mine doesnt like anything soggy, squidgy or leaky. My daughter claims that thanks to me, she had to eat pickled strawberries, which taste vile. When I asked her what she meant, she added, According to her, the pickle in an airtight container leaked and ran into the strawberry in a different compartment. So that makes it pickled strawberry and an excuse not to finish her lunch box.Ghosh wakes up ten minutes earlier in the morning to make extra sandwiches for her sons friends. According to my son, none of them want to share the fruits I pack, she said, with a sigh. But hes telling me that, and well, he hates fruits. SoLooking back, we can appreciate that one person who woke up at the crack of dawn to toil away in the kitchen to prepare fresh lunchboxes for the family. I regret the dabbas that I brought back home uneaten, even the alu methi, which really doesnt do itself any favours when cold. Okay, maybe not the alu methi.The author writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru."

At times two brawls run parallel, or they spark off each other.Even at its most ugly and shrill, the film stays so real and believable that what you see on screen feels like your very own family war zone, a bitter-sweet slice of your own life.

So at one level there is the sense of indulgence and affection towards the characters, who could well have been your own granddad, father, mother, uncle or brother.

Everyone is pointing a disapproving finger at the other but saying  sab theek hai  when nothing is quite right.Brilliantly craftedThe busy screenplay reminds one a lot of Piku : the frenzied frames, the hyper characters, the constant motion in the sequences. Like Piku , it is yet another film that has been brilliantly crafted and mapped out in terms of the writing, and how the scenes slowly build up towards a crescendo. Its an onion-peel narrative in which the relationships, revelations, secrets and lies, unfinished confidences, unresolved issues, betrayals and conflicts are unspooled layer by layer. Little hints are thrown out here and there that eventually accumulate to lead on to outbursts. The simple, conversational exchanges and the repartee are the other high points, as is the acting: how the actors play off against each other with pitch-perfect timing.There is something very finely calibrated and nicely measured about the entire package that is Kapoor & Sons . Whats more, its delightfully engaging despite being rooted in the everyday, the banal and the seemingly trite. Even fixing a fuse with a wooden stick becomes a delightful scene in Batras hands. Its not just the quarrels but even the togetherness that Batra recreates just so right. I found myself smiling through the extended family get-together: the guitar, the song, the happiness and the ache: why cant we fix things and become happy again?Kapoor and Shah bicker brilliantly, and with great dignity at that. Khan is expectedly charming and delightfully at ease with his personable self. He seems to just inhabit his scenes rather than act them out.Even though its a tad hard to imagine Malhotra as a budding novelist, he holds his own with his solid presence and vulnerable glances. Aalia Bhatt seems to be playing her usual hyper, ditzy little sunshine girl act yet again. What disappointed me most was Rishi Kapoor with the terrible prosthetics  why couldnt another older actor have been cast in the role?  and loud presence, perhaps in tune with his character but totally out of sync with the rest of the mellow, subtle tenor of the film.Like Piku , Batra brings the family, parent-child relationship under the scanner in Kapoor & Sons , but he doesnt quite rebel against or throw away the construct entirely. He questions the family only to reassert its primacy.The sorries come as easily as the bickering, and all is forgiven over a few shared joints. A few blips later its back to continuities and certainties, perhaps to yet another argument or a bigger fight. Its about the chaos of relationships, yet about an overarching stability. The redemption is not in running away from the family but coming within the fold.

Responding to a question on rising prices during the question hour, Mr. Rajender admitted that pulses and edible oils had become dearer. The price monitoring committee under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary has met 12 times during the year, to discuss the issue and decide upon the measures to curb price rise. The Marketing Department purchased 54,277 quintals of onion from within and outside the State and supplied to consumers at Rs. 20 per kg, while 1,831 quintals of red gram was sold through Rythu Bazars and special counters at Rs. 135 per kg.In the current year, over 7,000 raids were conducted and 2,501 cases were booked against black-marketers. A total of 1,250 cases were slapped against fair price shop dealers, and 115 were arrested. A total of 12,961 metric tonnes of paddy and 77,086 metric tonnes of PDS commodities were seized. Raids and arrests of this scale had never happened earlier, he pointed out.Efforts are on to make the State self-sufficient, by improving agriculture yield, the results of which would be out soon, Mr. Rajender said.Members T. Jeevan Reddy and Ajay Kumar Puvvada questioned the price list supplied by the Minister and said rice of super fine quality costs Rs. 46 per kg, as against Rs. 42 as mentioned by the Minister.Answering another question on civil supplies, Mr. Rajender said reforms in the civil supplies include digitisation of ration card data with Aadhaar seeding, generation of dynamic key register, online allocation of food grains, supply-chain management for monitoring the movement of stock, fair price shop automation with ePoS devices, and GPS in all the vehicles carrying the stocks.After successful implementation in Kandukur mandal of Ranga Reddy district, ePoS devices have been installed in fair price shops in the GHMC area, he said. Rationalisation of fair price shops is on the anvil. To another supplementary question, he said the beneficiaries under the Deepam scheme can get the gas filled at any outlet, with subsidy of Rs. 1,650 offered by the government.The connections would be sanctioned on saturation mode, he promised.Three adjournment motions pertaining to drought conditions, wages of workers in industries, and notifications for government jobs raised respectively by members R.

Since, I wont be able to store such quantity or entirely use it, I plan to distribute it among neighbours, said Shanti, a resident of Ameerpet.If inflation or shortage of vegetables and pulses are a matter of concern, then so is the excessive production of the essential consumables which has hit the city markets. At various Rythu Bazars and wholesale markets, some vegetable varieties are abundantly available and sold at dirt-cheap price or worse, being dumped by the farmers themselves. We have fixed a price for onions since we want the farmers to earn some profit, said P. Ramesh, Estate officer of a Rythu Bazar in the city.Less than a year after it had overshot the Rs 100 per kg mark, onions are available for as low as Rs. 4 per kg. The average price of the onion at this time of the year is usually Rs. 20 per kg.The government has taken the initiative and asked the farmers to sell onions for Rs. 12 per kg. Sometimes we see overproduction of vegetables during the beginning of the summer season. This year, the production has been very high and we expect the prices to stabilise in 20 days, said.

Photo: AFPChampion ram King of Oils shows no visible signs of stress before his semi-final fight at the National Stadium in Lagos.The amber eyes of the snow-white ram barely register the raucous crowd 50 metres away but his outward tranquillity belies a tenacity deep within.Three and a half years ago, Dayo Folami bought King of Oils for less than 50,000 naira (Rs. 16,714). Yet today the 39-year-old businessman says the ram is priceless.Ive won a lot of money with the power he has, Folami, wearing a white T-shirt and dark jeans, told AFP at Sundays event. He doesnt give up.What motivates King of Oils to dominate in the ring is a mystery, said Folami. There is no winning secret of rams, you can never force them to fight.It is exactly that innate will to battle that distinguishes ram fighting from other animal sports, Folami said. With eight weight categories and referees, the Ram Lovers Association of Nigeria (RLAM) is working to bring ram fighting into the mainstream by enforcing a strict set of rules to ensure ram safety and fair play.We brought in rules and regulations of different weight categories, just like in boxing, RLAM member Basheer Bash Agusto said. People expect to see fairness.Agusto, the 68-year-old owner of champion ram Little Tiger  who competes in H, the lightest category  said the rams are just like any other athlete.Once identified as a fighter you make sure hes not lacking, Agusto explained, recommending to give him vitamins and clean between the hooves.Agusto, his silver hair in a short mohawk and a thin gold chain necklace, said ram fighting is an escape from daily life in Nigeria, where poverty is endemic despite massive oil wealth. They can't go to the polo club or golf club, never mind the boat club, so here they have an outlet to look forward to.Intimidating namesHundreds of people gathered under a blazing sun to watch the rams fight on a sandy pitch, fenced off with orange and blue rope.Vendors sold popcorn and suya  a salty, spicy grilled meat served with red onions and tomatoes  while contortionists in striped outfits of mustard yellow and lime green performed in front of VIPs sitting in the shade under white tents.Some rams are named after historic warriors (Attila the Hun, Spartacus), while others after devastating diseases (Ebola, Malaria).The Nigerian ram fighting rules state that at the start of a tournament rams are allowed to hit 30 blows before the referee calls a tie. By the finals, rams can headbutt up to 100 times.But sometimes the fight never takes place at all, with unwilling rams high-tailing it to the safety of their owners amid laughs and jeers from the crowd.At stake is a plethora of official prizes ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. More lucrative, however, is the gambling on the sidelines where men bet tens of thousands of naira on rams. After football, this is what brings people together, said ram judging assistant Segun Odulate. If you come here you wont think anything more, youll concentrate on the rams and youll be happy.  AFP"

Harbour-1, the container vessel owned by Neepa Paribahan, was to arrive at Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh on March 26. However, it failed to depart from Chittagong Port on March 17 due to lack of adequate number of containers and a crane fault.Maiden journeyIn its maiden journey, the vessel was to carry 150 empty containers. Due to the crane fault, only 30 containers were loaded on to the vessel since March 17, trade sources said.When contacted, Krishnapatnam Port officials said they had received confirmation that the vessel would reach the port by early next week.India and Bangladesh signed a coastal shipping deal during November 2015 to promote coastal shipping, enhance bilateral trade between the two countries and bring down transportation costs for EXIM cargo. Bangladesh imports onion, rice, lentils, cotton, industrial raw materials and machinery.As per the deal, the vessel would call at the ports of Kolkata, Haldia, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Krishnapatnam and Chennai, while in Bangladesh it would be at Chittagong, Pangaon ICT, Narayanganj, Ashuganj, Payra, Khulna and Mongla. The vessels first call would be at Krishnapatnam Port.CongestionCurrently, container goods are moved from and to Bangladesh either through Colombo or Singapore as Chittagong Port does not have a deep draft and hence smaller feeder vessels are deployed. Besides, rapid growth in bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh led to congestion on the road at Indo-Bangladesh border. Hence, the importers and exporters urged introduction of feeder service between India and Bangladesh, said trade sources.Out of a total of 1.8 million tonnes of cargo moved on Indo-Bangladesh protocol route during 2013-14, fly ash accounted for 98 per cent, which was transported from Kolkata to various river ports in Bangladesh. During the current year, India for the first time used the Indo-Bangladesh river protocol to transport food grains via Ashuganj to Tripura. However, the quantum of cargo has not picked up because of low draft in the upper reaches of Bangladesh rivers and also because of certain non-trade barriers, says a Shipping Ministry release."

In fact, onion growers had got Rs. 2,500- 5,000 in October-November last year for their monsoon crop.What is ironic is that there are no buyers for a large quantum of produce even at the above price range of Rs. 1,200-1,500. This has resulted in heaps of onion produce remaining unsold at the Raichur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard.We have spent around Rs. 25,000 for cultivating onion on one acre. We got better crop this year both in terms of quality and yield. Unfortunately, there is no good price in the market. Wholesale buyers are asking the crop for a throwaway price. How can we survive? asked Hanumayya, a farmer from Sasivegera village in Deodurg taluk.His produce in 45 bags, each having 50 kg of fine quality onion, has remained unsold at the APMC for the last two days. I have decided to sell the produce at whatever price the buyer asks, he added.Most of the onion growers in the AMPC yard were in a similar condition as onion is a perishable agricultural produce and there was no hope of recovery of price in the immediate future. They were left with no option other than selling their produce at whatever price they get as they cannot take their crop back to their villages incurring additional transportation costs. They sleep beside their onion heaps in open protecting their crop from pigs and cattle.According to the traders, glut in the market caused by heavy imports from Nashik in Maharashtra caused the dip in the price of onion. The traders are heavily importing onion from Nashik. Supply is greater than the demand. This caused the prices to crash, Nagaraj, a trader, said.Chamarasa Malipatil, state president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, expressed similar views. According to him, the government imported onion from different countries when the onion prices were high in the domestic market.Massive imports, much greater than the required quantity, has caused the glut in the market. Now, domestic farmers have to bear the brunt. Farmers are in a very pathetic condition as they are repeatedly hit hard by problems floods, drought, Bt cotton failure and now price crash,"" he said. He demanded that the government open onion procurement centres at APMCs and purchase the produce directly from farmers offering minimum support price."

They choose from the varieties of fruits and vegetable plants, and even the flowers of green leaves grown in this garden.Pleased to see the guests in her terrace garden, Nandini.R., a resident of Lawspet, says: I began the terrace garden to create a habitat for birds and animals.Starting as an experiment, she initially planted ornamental plants in the terrace. Her strong inclination to follow organic methods in terrace gardening allowed her to grow even vegetables and fruits. I was not blessed with a green thumb so I was hesitant to grow vegetables or fruits in the terrace. Initially, I planted only ornamental plants for the birds. As they grew, I saw tomatoes and pumpkin grow automatically from the compost. Watching them grow, I decided to plant more vegetables in the terrace garden, she says.She makes bed for the plants from the vegetable compost collected from her kitchen waste with a layer of soil and dry leaves. No organic waste goes out of her house. She collects the kitchen waste and prepares compost from it. It is because of the organic method that different bees visit the terrace garden. It takes at least two to three months to prepare the compost from kitchen waste. This bed is sufficient for the plants to grow. Thatched roofs are built to provide shade to these plants, she says.Now, her terrace garden has tomatoes, onion, broad beans, more than two varieties of green leaves and many other fruit plants. From these plants, one can save seeds to grow more plants. It is difficult to find a good source for native seeds. I got the seeds from an exhibition organised by an environment protection group. The first thing we should learn in organic farming is to save the seeds, she added.She wants to grow small trees in the garden including fruit-bearing plants to make a habitat for birds and animals. Nandini confesses that what she has done was very little as her family was soon moving to a different place. She believes that more could be done to grow vegetables from the terrace garden that can be self-sustaining. Not just that, people will also start managing the organic waste themselves rather than waiting for the government to tackle the problem."

Only during the last kharif season, I could, for the first time, harvest over 40 quintals of chilli from my two acres of land. This was possible only with the krishi honda (a pond dug in the field under the Krishi bhagya scheme during 2014-15) which helped me protect my crop, Mr. Manjunath told The Hindu .Like him, Doddappa in Kottalachinta, a border village in the taluk, another beneficiary of the Krishi Bhagya scheme, is cultivating onion as a summer crop in his land with the help of krishi honda. Krishi honda has come as a boon for farmers like me who depend on rain. I have been cultivating onion in half an acre land making use of the water that was harvested in the newly dug pond, he says. He is hopeful of a good yield on over five acres of land during the kharif season.Krishi honda is one of the components under Krishi bhagya scheme. A 30-metre long and 30-metre wide pond with a depth of three metres is dug at a suitable place for harvesting rainwater. Later, a diesel generator pumpset along with sprinklers and pipes are provided. Krishi honda with other components will approximately cost Rs. 1.75 lakh. The government gives a subsidy up to 90 per cent for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and 80 per cent for other farmers.The scheme has many advantages and it is becoming more popular in the district. As on date, 4,394 krishi hondas have been completed. More farmers are keen to take advantage of the scheme in the current fiscal, Sharanappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, says.The concept is to harvest rainwater besides taking up strengthening of the field bunds and land development with the help of the soil dug from the pond.The water harvested in the pond will come in handy for the farmer to protect the crops when there is no rain. The pond can help irrigate about five acres of land at least two to three times."

Their major outlet at the Caf Sree premises in Nadakkavu has been a big hit with a large number of people opting to purchase the traditional veggies here.The Kudumbasree had started preparations for this feat months ago. Farming groups were formed at the panchayat level with proper guidance in organic farming.With the aid of the District Panchayat, the Kudumbasree members leased out acres of land for cultivation. They focused on making barren lands cultivable. Their stall has vegetables such as cucumbers, ladies finger, pumpkins, ash gourd, bitter gourd, spinach, yam, brinjal and even the country items such as banana flower, muringa leaves, turmeric, ginger and so on besides Kani Vellari, the must have for Vishu. Kudumbasree has made arrangements for home delivery in case of bulk orders.Another popular player in the field is Green View, the farmers collective. Green View has set up shop at South Beach as well as at the Muthalakkulam grounds under the banner Jaiva Bhavanam. The stalls feature organically produced vegetables from across the district. Tomatoes, carrots, beans, cabbage, cauliflower and onions that cannot be produced organically are not available at these stalls.

Appasaheb Pundalik Aher, national president of Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh, which joined the agitation, said, The two bodies representing farmers issues would like to highlight that it is not loan waivers that will solve the problem of suicides. The State should give farmers the right price for their produce, by eliminating the middlemen. Onions are commanding a price of Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kg, yet farmers are getting only Rs 2 to Rs 5 per kg.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had failed to fulfil the promise he made to agriculturists about a proper support price and a 50 per cent share in profits in the market price.Opposition leaders visited the agitating farmers, while delegates from the State government met the leaders of the farmers collective.The government delegation informed us that the Chief Minister would meet us personally once the Assembly session took a respite from the days affairs, Mr Patil said.

Similarly, farmers get Rs 46 per kg for Tur dal while the country imports it from Myanmar for Rs 135 to Rs 150 per kg.The Shetkari Sanghatnas president said, The rate of farmer suicides has increased from three to five deaths a day. It is clear that no loan waiver package has worked. Assistance to farmers in respect of seeds, fertilizers, and a fair national price would help. Why should there be an export ban on onions which is not an essential food item?As an opposition party MLA then, the current Chief Minister had demanded that the erstwhile Democratic Front government be booked for murder of farmers in the state.

A reason for the same could be the lack of loan eligibility cards (LECs), which none of the 40 farmers had.Borrowings from private money lenders, tenancy, lack of remunerative prices, and rain-fed agriculture coupled with drought conditions, drove many a farmer to suicide, the report by the voluntary initiative said.Twenty-two out of the 40 were tenant farmers, and 14 of them had zero bank loans. Average total debt of tenant farmers alone was Rs.4,27,500, of which Rs.3.85 lakh was from private money lenders. Only four out of the 22 farmers, who had some own land, got any benefit of the loan waiver scheme announced by the AP government. Lack of LECs led to deprivation of insurance or subsidies on the leased land.Money on borewellsThe condition of land-owners was no better. Of the 30 land-owning farmers, 16 had spent a lot of money on bore-wells before committing suicide. One farmer had 14 bore-wells dug, while another nine, the report said. Crisis of rain-fed agriculture and lack of protective irrigation for crops drove them to suicide, it said.In majority of the districts, failure of rains had caused crop loss and debt. All 13 farmers of Kurnool and 14 of the 15 farmers from Anantapur had crop loss due to drought and failure of rains. The report cited a farmer from Kurnool, who tried a variety of crops in the past two years, including jowar, dhaniya, Bengal gram and onion, but committed suicide after all crops failed. Floods and hailstorm too contributed their share to the farmers cup of woes.In 39 of the cases, crop loss occurred due to natural calamities such as drought, cyclone or flood. Yet, the government failed to provide effective crop insurance or compensation leading them deep into debt and despair."
58fa6415a3d24b44f321ca6c,The storyteller within,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-storyteller-within/article8502076.ece,2016-04-21,,The Hindu,"o where were we? In the middle of a long conversation with actor Pankaj Tripathi, we suddenly lose the thread and have to go back to my notes to figure how we had begun. An exchange with Tripathi is like that, a free flowing, meandering, stream of consciousness. One thought leads to another and then yet another. No doubt Tripathi, soon to be seen as an eccentric school principal in Ashwiny Iyer Tiwaris Nil Battey Sannata , is a talented actor, but he is an even more accomplished raconteur.The actor himself admits to how he creates subplots within a plot so that the listener may not lose interest in his tales. This talent was exploited by the students union while he was studying in Patna in the 90s. As a member, he was assigned the task of bringing the crowd together and holding its interest. I used to tell jokes, keep the kids entertained till the leaders came and talked ideology and politics.Born to a farming family in the village of Belsand, near Gopalganj, Bihar, Tripathi studied there till the tenth standard. He remembers performing small roles in the amateur plays put up during the Chhath festival: This was the kind of theatre in which no one remembered their lines and the only job of the director was to prompt from behind the curtains.His father wanted him to become a doctor, but he never objected to Tripathis taking to acting either. However, the multi-talented son dabbled in a lot of things before settling down with theatre and films.He was a very good sportsman, participating in the 100 metres sprint and kho kho, and he was high jump champion at Magadh University in Patna.A right-wing students union member, Tripathi even spent seven days in jail in 93 for participating in a violent local agitation.Those days proved to be a crucial step in his march towards cinema. He spent a lot of time reading in the jail library, and got exposed to left-wing thinking and the literary works of giants like Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh. Art and culture mein vaampanth ka dabaav aur prabhav raha hai [art and culture have seen the influence and domination of the left wing].A show of Lakshmi Narayan Lals Andha Kuan and Pramita Jaiswals performance in it immensely moved him and got him hooked to theatre for life. Tripathi attended the performances in town with such regularity that the guy at the theatres cycle stand stopped charging him, as he was such a dedicated audience member. One of his own performances in amateur theatre found his name published in the newspaper. The reviewer spoke about apaar sambhavana [endless possibilities] in me as an actor, he recalls. It motivated him. Also, all the other things he was dabbling in couldnt hold his interest for long. He wasnt enjoying sports and the promise of a constables job through the sports quota didnt excite him. He didnt like the idea of embracing politics either: It forces you to bow in front of the leaders, turns you into a sycophant.He was compelled by his uncle to do a course in hotel management in Patna, where he worked night shifts as a trainee cook in a hotel. But I realised I was meant for something more than potatoes and onions. Nonetheless, Tripathi compares acting to cooking, both of which he excels at. With the latter, you have to be careful about the ingredients; how much salt and pepper you put in a dish; acting for him, is also a similar kind of a measure, of emotions: they should neither be too little nor too much. There is texture, colour and taste towards which you work when you are cooking a vegetable. Similarly, I work on a character, with his looks, his personality, his quirks.Tripathi also claims to bring in lifes experiences and draws from the works of his favourite authors, Phanishwar Nath Renu, Uday Prakash, Sanjeev. Every member of the crew on the film set has a button to push. An actor has none. For him, that button is his own experiences.It was in 2001, in his second attempt, that he cleared the entrance test for the National School of Drama in Delhi. But he looks back at those years with regret. Not for what was taught but at his own attitude as a student. It is a fantastic institute, but I was too laidback and not serious enough about it.After the training, he spent some time in Patna doing theatre, but soon realised he wouldnt be able to survive as an artiste. Hindi theatre hasnt developed commercially as well as Gujarati and Marathi theatres.So Tripathi decided to try his luck in films at the behest of a friend. October 16, 2004: he still remembers the day he landed up in Mumbai Central on the Golden Temple Express. Every actor remembers his first day in Mumbai though he may forget many other significant ones.For him, embracing Bollywood hasnt been about glamour but for livelihood and survival. He did a lot of television for the same reason: I never dreamt of becoming the hero, was not choosy about my roles, believed in doing whatever came my way. Even a Dilwale , Singham Returns or Gunday . But he has an explanation: when a big film releases in 5,000 screens simultaneously, you connect with people in a bigger way. I got messages from as far as Romania and Greece for Dilwale . He also strongly feels that it is because of the commercial contribution of a Dilwale or Bajirao Mastani that a small film like Masaan is also able to find its way to a theatre.The role of Sultan in Gangs of Wasseypur has been his passport to recognition and fame. It was unexpected. I used to wonder what unique thing I am doing, he says. But the role of the butcher and henchman of Ramadhir Singh got so popular that more butcher roles started coming his way. No one wants to experiment in the industry. I started getting tired of the gangster roles, he says. This is why he never wanted to play macho characters. There is a word in Bihari, mauga , which means the exact opposite of macho. I wanted to play that. I can even do a womans role with just the right amount of femininity. So Masaan helped in discovering the more sensitive element within. It led him on from the brutality of Sultan to the humane Sadhyaji who forms a unique, indefinable bond with Devi (Richa Chaddha).Tripathi is becoming more conscious of his choices of films now; there are audience expectations to live up to. What dictates the choice is the comfort and tuning with the director and the script. It is very difficult to make a bad film with a good script. You can hold a film for 30 seconds with your visuals but in the 31st, the story has to come into play.Coming up next is a diverse set of characters that an actor of his calibre deserves to play. Anarkali Aarawali has him play a dancer, another art form that he is very good at but hasnt quite put on display on screen. In Shankar Ramans Gurgaon , a story of a father-daughter, he plays the builder father. Then there is Mango Dreams , a tale of an auto driver (played by Tripathi) and a doctor who travel from Ahmedabad to Wagah; one is a Sikh, the other a Muslim; one a victim of the Partition, the other of the riots. The challenge here for him was to speak in English and that too for sync sound. In Amit Masurkars Newton , he plays an arrogant CRPF commandant. We had to match acting skills with 40 tribals who were natural in front of the camera, besides walking for hours in the jungle and staying in three small guest houses in Dalli Rajhara near Raipur.Ask him about his favourite role and he says that he wants to play straight and simple characters. Like Raghuvar Prasad in Srilal Shuklas book Deewar Mein Ek Khidkee Rehti Thi . Or like his 90-year-old father who walks six kilometres every day in the village, sleeps at seven and has no tensions and complexities in life. Things have become too grey and black. There are too many layers. I want to play a pure, simple soul for a change.There has been no return to theatre, though he did work once in a play for the money. He loves the immediacy of the audience response in theatre but cinema gives internal enjoyment to him as an actor. In theatre, you have to project your expression across to the viewer in the last row. In films, you reach your own truth as an actor. You just have to be there in the scene, in the moment, with your co-star, and just feel and react.It has been almost 12 years in Mumbai now, but his heart still belongs to his village. His house in Charkop in Andheri faces a huge pond and a temple, giving a sense of expanse and a rural feel in the middle of the urban jungle that is Mumbai. A place where he can sit for hours together engrossed in another quaint hobby of his: reading maps. Of Andheri, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India and the world.The role of Sultanin Gangs of Wasseypur has beenhis passport to recognition and fame"
58fa7760a3d24b44f321d20b,Onion prices hit a new low,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/onion-prices-hit-a-new-low/article8481600.ece,2016-04-16,,The Hindu,": After having to deal with repeated spikes in the prices of onions during the last fiscal, there is finally a huge respite for people. Wholesale rates of the edible bulb have crashed to as low as Rs 4.5 per kilo in the Capital owing to a glut of supplies from States like Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.The bumper harvest this year, however, has left farmers in tears with reports suggesting that prices have fallen to an all-time-low of Rs. 30 paise per kg at Madhya Pradesh's mandi in Neemuch district.There has been surplus onion production across the country this time, and the demand is relatively low. The farmers are badly hit as they spend at least Rs. 12 per kg in the entire process of producing the crop, excluding their labour cost, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).In Delhi, which primarily relies on these two States among a few others for onions, the situation is equally grim.At the Azadpur Mandi, the kitchen essential is being sold at Rs. 7.86 per kilo on an average.The best-quality onions are being sold at a wholesale rate of Rs. 10.5 per kg, whereas the poor-quality and the smaller ones are being bought by traders at Rs. 4.5 per kilo. The retail prices in the city range between Rs. 18 per kilo and Rs. 20 per kilo.If data of onion prices at Azadpur Mandi of over a year is compared, then its the lowest this month. In August last year, the rates were a staggering Rs. 53 per kilo, and the average cost itself was Rs. 39. In January also the price was as high as Rs. 17 per kg, said Mr. Sharma.Lasalgaon mandi in Maharashtras Nashik district is also facing the same situation, but prices have not dropped so drastically there, he added.The supplies increased March onwards during which the Lasalgaon mandi recorded a 25-month low price of Rs. 6 per kilo.The last time the countrys largest wholesale market recorded an all-time low of Rs. 6 per kilo was on February 15, 2014.At the Azadpur Mandi in the Capital, the kitchen essential is being sold at Rs. 7.86 per kilo on an average"

Tomatoes, areca nut, grapes, small onions, and bananas are all cultivated here and for the residents of the city who want a short getaway, there are several spots on the banks of the Noyyal that they can go to.Well, things are not the same anymore. In several areas, the farms have given way to buildings and the Noyyal cries for attention. Elephants crossing the road, entering residential areas, and damaging crops are common.One of the significant demands of the constituency is efforts to support agriculture. It is an area where different crops are raised. In the recent years, small farmers have been selling their land as they do not find farming viable, say some of them. The grape growers have seen a sharp fall in area under grapes and have been asking for a research centre that can guide the farmers. Instances of elephants and boars damaging crops are on the increase and the agriculture community has sought protection for crops. Construction of retention walls on the bunds of the Noyyal will protect the river, they add.In some of the tribal hamlets at the foothills, the residents seek bore wells so that they can continue farming during summer months and when there is shortage of water too. The Noyyal restoration is important not only for the constituency but also for the districts through which the river passes. Now, untreated sewage is let into the river and waste is dumped on the river bed. The local bodies in the constituency need to go in for sewage treatment plants so that the Noyyal can be revived. Checking of violation of Hill Area Conservation Authority rules, controlling water bottling plants that operate without licence and improvement in public transport facilities for tourists are among the other demands.Eco-friendly measures that will conserve Nature, benefit tourists, and develop the religious and Natural tourist destinations will help develop the constituency better, say environmental activists.Sitting MLA S.P. Velumani (AIADMK) polled 62.40 per cent of the votes in 2011 in Thondamuthur Assembly constituency, which was bi-furcated in 2007 to create Kavundampalayam and had some areas of Perur added to it. This election, the main parties contesting include AIADMK (S.P. Velumani), Manithaneya Makkal Katchi in the DMK front (M.A. Syed Mohammed) and DMDK in the DMDK-PWA-TMC front (K. Thiagarajan). The constituency requires not just lights and roads but more development to increase the income of the people. It has potential for promotion of tourism and agriculture, says Mr. Thiagarajan. According to Mr. Mohammed, the constituency has not got any new industry or initiative to generate more jobs in the last five years."

NTR took up Galeru Nagari and Handri Neeva projects to supply Krishna water to the region.Neeru Chettu scheme was promoted last year and through Neeru Pragathi programme this year, efforts were being made to conserve rain water by digging farm ponds, construction of checkdams and link channels to tanks, the Chief Minister said. The Chitravathi, Penna and Papaghni rivers would be linked to 644 tanks in Kadapa district to mitigate water scarcity.Despite the resource crunch after bifurcation of the State, farmers loans to the tune of Rs. 24,000 crore and Rs. 3,200 crores were waived in two phases, interest waived for DWCRA women and seven hours power was supplied to agriculturists.Horticultural hubThe district would be developed as a horticultural hub, he added. Banana, onion and commercial crops would be promoted. Irrigation Minister D. Umamaheswara Rao said Rs. 13,241 crore was spent on irrigation projects in the last 21 years. A farmer Anki Reddy of Vemula said farmers stored water in November last year by desilting tanks.Ninety five per cent of land date was computerised and wages of NREGS workers were hiked from Rs. 140 to Rs. 210, the Chief Minister said in Neeru Pragathi programme at Balliguttacheruvu in Ramapuram mandal in Rayachoti constituency.Mobile clinicsAn app would be used to help people complain on deficiencies in hospitals, he said.

Bharamagowdra collected, collated and documented his experience as an organic farmer in an agricultural industry that was increasingly becoming dependent on chemical pesticides.The noted farmer passed away three months ago, but not without passing down his knowledge to future generations.His experience with the rich rain-fed black cotton soil in north Karnataka was recorded by the Institute for Cultural Research and Action (ICRA) and subsequently brought out as a book in Kannada DD Bharamagowdra BadukuBesaya, Savayava Krushikana Mahaan Payana (in English: The Organic Farmers Notable Journey).It is a detailed take on the art and science of organic farming that can serve as a manual for farmers,"" said environmentalist Yellappa Reddy at the recent launch of the book.Bharamagowdra was one of the most seasoned farmers of Gadag.He had been through a roller-coaster ride with respect to dealing with chemical and organic farming.His father Byamana Gowdas family grew more than 40 crops with traditional wisdom guiding their 'inter, border and mixed cropping philosophies'.The family is said to have been the foremost in bringing onion and byadgi chilli to that region said V. Gayathri, who transcribed, compiled and edited the newly released book that traces Bharamagowdras relationship with soil.After completing his BSc., Bharamagowdra was inspired by the green revolution and was drawn to chemical-dependant agriculture. The saga of his return to organic farming after seeing his soil go bereft of nutrients is what makes the book a veritable manuscript, says Gayathri.Bharamagowdras association with Institute for Cultural Research and Action started in the 1980s when he used to be in touch with P. Babu, one of the earliest functionaries and promoters of organic farming.He later contributed to ICRAs bimonthly magazine Sahaja Saguvali, which Ms. Gayathri edits.ICRA recorded Bharamagowdras know-how. The project involved meticulously transcribing his oral records. Although I edited the book, I was careful not to disturb his style of dialect and vocabulary so that farmers could relate to his calling, said Ms. Gayathri.The 325-page book in two parts starts with Bharamagowdras early memories, the agricultural practices before the green revolution, the onslaught of fertilizers before the genesis of the organic movement in Karnataka.The second part contains 17 articles detailing the author's experiments in dry land organic agriculture.The ecological vision of Bharamagowdra is significant in the context of climate change and distress in agriculture."

Deo, wife of ad filmmaker and Delhi Belly director Abhinay Deo, fusses over her guests as she dishes out finger-licking mutton chops, Chickencha Pandhara Rassa and the famous Karwari fish curry: just a few of the recipes featured in her cookbook, Karwar to Kolhapur via Mumbai, that has hit the shelves.Labour of loveThe aroma of cooking is a reminder of the simple, eternal joys of life, she says Deo. Food was subliminally around me all the time. I was raised in a house where people loved to eat, cook, and appreciated flavours and aromas.It is not your typical cookbook with back-to-back recipes, but a documentation of Deos journey through the three cities that shaped her outlook and personality. Its a cookbook with an autobiographical bent, as Deo has infused every page with personal experiences, peppered with mirth and wisdom.In the bargain, she has helped revive the cultural identity and traditions that often get forgotten.Deo spent a good part of her childhood in Karnataka and Maharashtra: two states with so much in common but distinct local cuisines. The author does justice to both by highlighting their indigenous cooking styles, ingredients and flavours. She has incorporated seasonal vegetables and food that befit occasions and cultures. But some are just an extension of her personality.Ode to her rootsDeo keeps the traditional recipes easy to replicate; aiming to adapt old techniques without losing the essence. When I decided to write the book, I was confused about whether to write a regular recipe book or add a background story to each, she says. Finally, I decided that theres no way I could pay an ode to my roots without narrating the story behind them.Authoring a regional cookbook included several challenges: she had to contact erstwhile neighbours and distant relatives to understand subtle differences in dishes with similar recipes, and find authentic ingredients in a big city.Much in commonFor me writing and cooking are similar in process. You have to start with an idea and assemble all the ingredients, says Deo. Then have a little fun and improvise as you go along, while stirring the pot till the plot thickens, and the story emerges with many twists and turns to be finally consumed with a satisfying burp.Deo says everything, from her place of birth and marriage to all the interesting people shes ever met, has found place in Karwar to Kolhapur via Mumbai . I fondly acknowledge all the loving warmth I received in the process of writing this autobiographical cookbook, she says, hoping readers will enjoy perusing and replicating the recipes as much as she did while putting it together.The author is a freelance writer"

These farmers sow the cane even as its outsized water demands relative to other crops threaten to plunge this traditionally arid region back into a drought.""It is the only reliable crop. Earlier this year I cultivated onions and incurred a 50,000 rupees loss as prices crashed,"" said Wagh, who plants 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of sugar cane.Four months ago Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing region in India, suffered the worst drought in four decades that ravaged crops, killed livestock, depleted reservoirs and slowed down hydroelectric power output.Environmental activists and the government blamed the rapid expansion of sugar cane growing for creating the water scarcity. Cane consumes about 22.5 million litres of water per hectare during its 14-month long growing cycle compared to just 4 million litres over four months for chickpeas, a pulse, commonly grown in India and called gram locally.Without government intervention to reset the revenue balance in favour of other crops, experts warn the sustained production of sugar cane will further deplete scarce water resources and leave the region prone to droughts. This could create social unrest stemming from the widening income gap between cane growers and other farmers.""The government asks farmers to shift to less water consuming crops, but it does little to support those crops. It failed to solve the problems of oilseed and pulses growers,"" said Pradeep Purandare, a former professor at Maharashtra Water and Land Management Institute based in Aurangabad.Erratic prices for vegetables, oilseeds and pulses limit the incentive for farmers to plant them.In contrast, the government requires sugar mills to buy cane at a set ""fair and remunerative price"" (FRP). The government also buys wheat and rice at what is called the minimum support price (MSP).""Returns from other crops are unpredictable. This year I allowed 5 tonnes of onions to rot. Prices were so low that my losses would have increased by transporting onions to the market,"" said Suresh Kothawale, another Aurangabad farmer.India's government hopes higher subsidies for pulses and oilseeds will change farming patterns.""We are creating oilseeds and pulses as an alternative for sugar cane by raising their minimum support prices,"" said a senior official at India's Agriculture Ministry who declined to be named.But industry critics said the pulse and oilseed MSP only exists on paper as the government never procures them aggressively like wheat or rice.""Green gram prices were trading below support prices due to higher production. This makes the support price irrelevant for farmers,"" said Nitin Kalantri, a pulses miller based at Latur in Maharashtra.HARDY CROP, POLITICAL CLOUTThe sugar mill buildup in Marathwada was initially pushed by politicians in the region trying to replicate the prosperity of mills in other areas of Maharashtra state and was focused on areas with plentiful water, said Jaidev Dole, a political analyst in Aurangabad.""But later politicians opened mills everywhere, even in areas where drinking water is not available, to build a constituency rather than making farmers rich,"" he said.Farmers sell cane directly to sugar mills, effectively getting 100 percent remuneration, but other crops pass through middlemen, ensuring farmers get half the price consumers pay, said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.Sugar cane's sturdiness also attracts farmers because of limited access to insurance that protects against crop failures.Mature cane withstands heavy rainfall or dry spells and is also less vulnerable to pest and diseases compared to other crops, said farmer Sharad Mate, who has lost pulse crops due to droughts and un-seasonal rainfall.""I had taken crop insurance for pulses last year, but didn't get compensation despite losing an entire crop,"" said Mate, a farmer from Sillod, northeast of Aurangabad."

The prices rose by 2.42 per cent in August.The sub-category of manufactured food products, which includes sugar and edible oils, registered a rise of 11.21 per cent.This was mainly caused by a spurt in sugar prices, which rose by 32.92 per cent, as a result of production shortages.

From a rustic food shack in a countryside, to the modular kitchen in a Kochi high-rise, delicacies lay awaiting to be dug out.The sojourn was worthy -- there was the unheard combination of ripe banana and thalacurry, ayala nirachath and the very vegetarian vendakka olan, which were rich enough to set many mouths drooling. As the seven-month long journey, the second season of the culinary yatra, boils down to select dishes on the menu of Trilogi, the restaurant at the Crowne Plaza, Rejimon says the local taste isnt explored much.Our focus was on finding the most localised or unheard-of dishes. Fusion dishes or the regular kappa meen curry fare are not something we looked at. We needed the authentic ones, the recipes of which have not been tampered much, says Rejimon. His seven-month long yatra took him to the nook and crannies of Kerala. While the Northern end beckoned him with its unique non-vegetarian dishes, the southern tip of Kerala was more vegetarian.Stuffed mackerel (ayala nirachath) was a surprise even to me. I learnt the dish from Sabitha Arif and her sister in Tirur. They stuffed cleaned mackerel with onion, but then we enhanced the taste by mixing it with minced fish, prawns and egg, says the chef.Another taste he acquired from the sisters was kozhi musaman, which varied slightly from the regular stuffed chicken. Here the chicken, stuffed with egg, is cooked in a gravy, made with dal and masala (not garam masala). The core of the recipes may remain unaltered, but the chef enhanced the flavours by tweaking it a bit. For instance, the vegetable olan, which he discovered from Vijayalakshmi, at Pattom in Thiruvananthapuram. Her vegetable olan, which had ladys finger among the kidney beans and ash gourd, wowed him enough to prompt some experimentation. Thus was born the kozhi olan(chicken pieces with veggies).Kozhi olan has coconut milk in it. It has the feel and taste of our olan, but spicier due to green chillies. But, the basic taste remains the same, says the chef. He did have his share of shocker dishes, too, like the aykoora. In Kollam, at a household, they asked me whether I have had aykoora. Soon the dish was served. A huge head of kingfish was cooked in gravy and ripe bananas were chopped and added to it. The taste was impressive, says the chef. It was the same with Meen Puliyuanam where little parava fish was cooked in a gravy, made with shallots and spices. The dinner-service festival that will begin on October 7, will conclude on October 29."

Farmers harvested over 200 kg per acre as against the normal yield of 1,500 kg. Adding to their woes, insurance for the onion crop has not yet been announced.Banking on good monsoon, farmers cultivated onion on over 2,800 hectares in Thoothukudi district in the current fiscal, exceeding the previous years coverage of 1,600 hectare. The crop was extensively cultivated in Vilathikulam taluk, literally a rain-fed region in the district.Though poor rainfall posed a risk, the three-month crop managed to survive the drought. But with the yield going down, the farmers are struggling to even make up for the input cost.Varadharajan, a farmer, told Express that after the first shower, there was no sign of rain, which led to a severe yield loss.We expected rain at the time when the crop reached flowering stage. But rain gods did not bless us, he said. Farmers had invested over Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 for raising onion in an acre. But the yield has been as low as 200 kg per acre, which the traders procure for Rs 10 each. An acre of onion crop yields around 1,500 kg a year, he said. Adding fuel to the fire, the onion is among the five crops awaiting a government order on insurance. The last date for the crop insurance is January 15. Over 5,000 onion farmers had not insured the crops.With a heavy loss, farmers had appealed to the government to declare the state as drought hit and had demanded compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre."

This was the fifth straight month of WPI inflation after continued deflation for over a year.In first week of September, retail price inflation remained lower at 5.05 percent that had declined from 6.07 per cent in July, below the tolerance level of the government.Despite food inflation in both the indices showing signs of decline, both indices showed opposite trend. This was because the food index has lower weightage of over 14 percent in WPI against over 45 percent in CPI.This will bring a challenge for the new RBI Governor Urjit Patel for any monetary policy tweaking in October. However, the fact that WPI inflation is still 4 percent would give some comforts to the RBI in case it wants to cut the policy rate to spur economic growth.Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA said that the WPI will have a limited impact on RBIs repo rate cut decision but we expect at least one 25 basis points rate cut this year. A rate cut is more likely to happen in December rather than October, she added.According to global financial services major DBS, the softening trend in inflation leaves the door open for a rate cut in the fourth quarter of this calender year with odds of a move in October on the rise.A benign inflation path going forward and likelihood of a dovish policy committee leaves the door open for further easing but this needs to be balanced off with firmer demand dynamics and risks of US rate normalisation as the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting approaches, DBS said in a research note.Commenting on the inflation number, D S Rawat, secretary general of Assocham said,  prices of products which are of national interest has been continuously rising at industry level are pulses, potato, and fibres but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should check though prices of onions have been managed."

Based on a formula, the state will seek Rs 3,373.85 crore as relief from the Centre. The districts of Bidar, Yadgir and Kalaburagi also faced losses due to excessive rain and floods. The amount of crop loss determined is Rs 2,485 crore. The Department of Agriculture and Revenue will submit a memorandum to the Union government in this regard to seek a compensation amount of Rs 386.44 crore. The Centre will also be requested to provide assistance for the establishment of cow shelters, fodder banks and providing drinking water.Market intervention for onionsThe government is mulling over a market intervention plan for onions as the rate of the vegetable has dropped dramatically. A good yield has resulted in drastic fall in the price of onions. Also, around 3.5 lakh acres where onions were cultivated is said to have suffered a loss. The state government and the Centre usually have an equal share in the support price and the state government is now asking for a support price of Rs 11 per kg.Free treatment at new hospital in UdupiThe Cabinet has approved the decision to give 3.88 acres in Udupi on lease to Dubai-based industrialist B R Shetty for the construction of a hospital for women and children, and a centre of excellence. The 30-year lease will see the razing down of an existing government hospital on the premises and the constriction of a new 200 bed hospital for women and children and another 400 bed hospital in the centre of excellence.BRS Health Research Limited has stated that the treatment at the women and children hospital will be free.Rain damages 17 pc of red gram cropsKalaburagi: About 17 per cent of the red gram (tur dal) cultivated in the district has been damaged due to excess rainfall this year, according to a joint survey conducted by different departments. As per the report, of the 5,89,064 hectares cultivated in the district in 2016, crops in 89,616 hectares (15.21 percent) have been damaged due to heavy rain. Red gram was cultivated in 3,97,025 hectares and crops in 67,650 hectares (17.34 per cent) have been damaged. Sources said despite floods this year, there is an expectation of good yield of red gram.Grower stages protest with bags of onionDharwad: Onion farmers in the district are not even getting transportation costs for their produce. On Wednesday, when Mallikarjungouda, a farmer from Shirur of Navalgund taluk, took his produce to the Navalgund market, he was shocked to know that onion was purchased for Rs 150 per quintal. He directly went to Dharwad and staged a protest in front of the DCs office with bags of onions. This is not an isolated case. A fortnight ago Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda he had assured of coming to the rescue of onion growers. But no action has been taken till now."

Foods were invented to overcome shortages and to keep longer. So, at the food fest in Crowne Plaza, I am introduced to a history and a cuisine.Master chef Asmic Raj is trying Vietnamese for the first time for their monthly Pan-Asian Festival, at their rooftop restaurant East. This fest will end on September 30.As a starter we are served Rice-paper Roll Chicken. The paper roll, which is exclusive to Vietnam, is imported for the festival and its stuffing  carrots, cucumbers, mint, basil and chicken chunks  taste garden fresh. Mint and basil feature predominantly in this cuisine. It is said that Vietnamese food is one of the healthiest in the world and, after having a sample, you wouldnt question why.The Hanoi corn cake, which is corn paste cooked in banana leaves, is named after the capital city of Vietnam. It is like how pani-puri is to us, says chef Asmic Raj, the most common street-side food.No Vietnamese meal is complete without their signature Pho (pronounced fuh). It, of course, has the country divided as North and South camps over which side makes the best Pho. This aromatic noodle soup was served in a standard white bowl and is full of green vegetables like broccoli and pak choi. The soup is low on salt but the spicy chilli hits you. Seven ingredients are served separately, -- burnt garlic, fried onions, lemon, basil, mint, chillies and coriander -- you can add them to your taste.Vietnam borders Gulf of Thailand, Pacific, South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin, so seafood is a given. We are served basa fish made with tamarind sauce and mango puree. Colourful, the dish tastes tangy and sour.Tofu (bean curd) fried rice, Yellow Chicken Curry and Asparagus with Tender Coconut are the main dishes. Tofu Fried Rice, which was made first to keep for the next day, soon gained wide popularity because of its rich taste. Garlic and onions are plenty, but spring onions are used sparingly. The Yellow Chicken Curry is a fine blend of coconut cream, sugar, curry powder and sweet potatoes.The best is kept for last, when the chef serves us Cassava Coconut Cake. A triangular slice of cake made out of tapioca and glazed with honey was a total winner."

Its an everyday struggle as small vendors suffer a huge dip in their collection while labourers are left with no wages or work to meet ends. Express spoke to a few of them on how they are surviving against the odds.Ahmed | Age: 47 | Chaat sellerAhmed and his family live in a rented house near Shivajinagar. The demonetisation drive, Ahmed says, has taken a large chunk of his earnings as people do not have cash.Most of the food items I sell cost either Rs 30 or Rs 40 per plate. From noon to 9pm, Rukiya (his wife) and I used to conduct business worth Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. Everything has changed since the new notes were introduced. We are unable to make half of what we used to, he said.He has two school-going children.The couple has been selling food items near Commercial Street for over a decade now.Explaining his constraints, Ahmed said that it has become difficult to raise enough money to even buy tomatoes and onions among other items for his business.Since all my earnings go to my family, I have no savings or a bank account. The cash crunch, I fear, will push me towards debt, he said.However, he is hopeful that the situation will return to normal soon. If not, I will have to ask my son to quit school and assist in looking after the family, he added.Venkatesh | Age: 45 | Flower vendorIn a corner on Veerapillai Street in the city, Venkatesh has been selling flowers with his mother Lakshmi for the past two-and-a-half decades. Ever since demonetisation was announced, Venkatesh has been witnessing a steady decline in his income. We had never faced such a financial crunch before, he said.The income they generated by selling flowers has shrunk by 66 per cent in the last 15 days. Earlier, we used to sell goods worth Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 on a daily basis, of which we could make an earning of Rs 500. What can we do if we only earn Rs 1,000? he asked.He resides at Anepalya in the city with his mother, wife H Devi and two children. His recent income, he says, is inadequate to make ends meet. We dont have a bank account. All that we earn is enough to meet only our daily demands. If business continues to be this dull, we will have to explore other options to sustain the family, he said.Kannan | Age: 27 | Daily wage labourerIf not for the charitable gesture of his employer, Kannan says he and his wife would have been forced to beg. Kannan, his wife Vijayalakshmi, and a group of other labourers are working at a construction site in Banashankari and are being fed by the contractor.Thats all we are getting now  food. We have not received payment for the past two weeks, Kannan said. Kannan has left his parents and younger brother back in Kolar district. Though his brother does menial jobs, Kannan and his wife are the primary breadwinners. Kannan used to travel home every two weeks to give money to his parents, but he has not been able to do so since November 8. They have resorted to borrowing from people. I cant ask the contractor to send money to my parents because they do not have a bank account. Without salary we cant go home. We cannot insist that the salaries be paid because we might lose our jobs. We have to be understanding. How will the owner pay salaries if he cant take cash out from bank, he said.Karthik Kumar | Age: 32 |Migrant labourerKarthik Kumar and his family spend about six months in Bengaluru and six months in their village near Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu. He says his bank has been turning him away due to lack of change for the high denomination notes he is paid with.He and his wife Mutthu earn up to Rs 500 and Rs 300 respectively. The money he earns, he deposits it every month in his mothers account, who lives alone in the village. I used to deposit money in the Bengaluru branch of a bank we have back home. When I went last Tuesday, bank personnel insisted that I deposit the money at my home branch, he said.We cannot afford to travel more than 300 km every week to deposit money. We cant keep it safe with us either, he said. The Rs 2,000 denomination too has caused problems for him. When we are trying to save every penny, having a Rs 2,000 note is a problem as we are forced to buy more to get change, he added.Zarina | Age: 37 | ArtisanZarina, her husband Saleem and daughter Ayesha hail from Ahmedabad and have been residing on a footpath in front of Cantonment Railway Station.To a question, she said that she had heard about old notes being taken out of circulation but is not sure if it has made any difference.In Bengaluru or any other city, if we sell our wares we can make a maximum of Rs 200 a day. So, to earn Rs 500, my husband and I have to roam around the city for three days, said Ayesha as she started to cook on the footpath.People with money might have faced problems. But, we dont have any money. If our wares do not sell, we will beg and feed ourselves. There is always a tomorrow where we will earn enough for us to survive, she added.Mehboob Pasha | Age: 20|Construction labourerMehboob Pasha and his two brothers work in different parts of Bengaluru. They moved from Raichur district. For Mehboob, who started working as a construction labourer a month ago, demonetisation has put him in a personal crisis.Mehboob told Express that he had arrived in the city with his brothers with little money. A few days later he was left only with a Rs 500 note. This was a couple of days after the demonetisation move. Then, his employer gave him Rs 1,000 as salary.When I went to the shop with the money, they told me that both the denominations have been withdrawn. They asked to me to go to the bank to deposit the money, he said. Since he did not have a bank account to deposit the money, he was forced to stand in a queue for almost a day to exchange the notes. I lost a days earning. Since we receive a meagre salary, we cant afford to take leave, he said. Echoing similar concerns was his relative, who did not wish to be named. Even now we are paid in old notes. We have been asking the contractor to give new notes as we cant afford to stand in a queue and lose a day, she added."

This restaurant, a darshini, serves organic vegetarian. This is the brainchild of four friends  two who worked in a health-insurance office, and two in the software industry.Vivek Patil quit his well-paying job in the insurance company. I worked there for almost five years and observed the disease patterns. I found an unhealthy lifestyle to be the main culprit, in fact eating habits to be more precise. That got me and my friend Srinivas Hatti thinking... and we decided to open a restaurant with health as the main focus, says Patil, who has also enlisted the services of an in-house Ayurveda doctor for consultation. Dr Radhapriya convinced us to open an organic restaurant, he says. Shivanand Naik and Kiran DS, two software engineers, joined in.The most interesting section of their menu is The Health Special Organic Juices. It lists 15 to 20 juices combining fruits and veggies with names indicative of their effect on the body.So you have Flat Tummy (for burning fat), Red Cooler (for reducing cholesterol), Heart Beat (for a better heart), Acid Free (to fight acidity) and Body Builder (for muscle gain). All are prepared under the guidance of the in-house Ayurveda doctor, who is also available for consultation between 7 am and 10 am everyday.Health juices are famously tasteless, so the restaurant has cleverly altered their range to be palatable.Snacks such as Organic Idli, Masala Dosa, and Roti Khara Bhat dont taste like anything out of the ordinary, but it does leave you satisfied that you had something organic.Millets have been used in the dishes and the Millets Special Organic Lunch Menu features millet idlis, millet bhath, millet puliogre, millet sweet and pongal. All taste like they are homemade, bland and familiar.Davangere delicacies such as Davangere Benne Dosa, Girmit (a bhel puri like mixture made from onions and tomatoes, roasted gram powder and puffed rice) and Mandakki Oggarane (again a mixture of puffed rice, roasted gram dal and condiments), and some of the popular dishes from North Karnataka also find space on the menu. Be careful with the chilli fritter (bhajji), which is startlingly hot.There is also the special menu for the day with its 10-12 varieties of organic sandwiches. Coffee too has Regular, Black and with jaggery options. In teas, you could have a masala tea made from organic milk."

The secret behind the delectable spread of paya, nihari and marag served fresh with hot dil naan is that there really is no short-cut. Itminan or patience is the byword followed by the chefs who make it. The launch of a new Hyderabadi Irani menu, as a tribute to the Nizami traditions atSodaBottleOpenerWala, Hyderabad was another reminder of this fact. You cant cook this fare by a recipe book, it takes painstaking hours of cooking and a whole lot of love to put these delicacies on the table, says Shaaz Mehmood, partner, SBOW.From this week onwards, the Jubilee Hills-based Irani Cafe has been serving two kinds of cuisines-the usual Parsi Bombay fare and the Hyderabadi delicacies along with liquor. If this strikes a chord with the food lovers in the city, the plan is to replicate it in the other outlets through out the country. It took three months and copious hours in the kitchen for us to train our chefs. My mother, my partner Shirazs mother, my grand-mothers cooks, my fiancs grand mothers cooks, over six households got together to come up with the dishes, informs Shaaz.For starters we tried the mutton varqi luqmi with mint and tomato chutney; this could be the perfect companion for your cuppa of your signature Irani chai. The baked Irani specialties also include Osmania biscuits, macrom, badam biskoot, naan khataais.What came next at the sampling session was the paya, nihari and marag with dil naan and zabaan. The spice level was muted but it allowed us to savour the flavour even better. The talihuwi arbi and talahuwa gosht, would go well with your baghara khana and khatti dal. One must pair the kaddu ka dalcha (a warm and wholesome variant of dal with gourd) with steamed rice. The Irani haleem, somewhat different from the characteristic preparation that you get almost every nook and corner in Hyderabad during Ramazan. Served with chopped mint leaves, a squeeze of lemon, fried onions, and green chillies, this dish had a fresh taste. The biryani, both mutton and vegetarian were not the usual spicy variation but stayed true to the authentic Hyderabadi taste. The dum ka murg was distinctly smokey as this dish is meant to be. The meal ended on a sweet note with khubani ka meetha and kulfi-falooda that was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth.The new menu lives up to the promise of serving food that is truly Hyderabadi in every morsel. For your next relaxed meal with conversations that go on for hours, this could be an apt bet."

It was a small restaurant but the experience taught me a lot. The city has also gradually changed from being a quite place known for its greenery to an IT hub and we were exposed to cuisines from all over the world. I was lucky enough to be trained under the best Italian and French chefs. I have worked in this city for a few years now and have had several competitions with my colleagues to bring out the best dish during the food trials in various restaurants.The dish that I am sharing today came to my mind during one of the food trials. Red bell pepper was often used by many departments in the kitchen to either make a salsa dip or salsa salad. I was always fascinated by the flavour you get after barbecuing red bell peppers. After that I always wanted to make a burnt barbecued red bell pepper sauce with Indian spices.After preparing the sauce I tried adding it to different types of cuisines and dishes but the one that stood out was a burnt bell pepper chilli Margherita pizza. The way the cooked pepper and cheese played with your palate was perfectly balanced and almost felt like they belonged together.Red Bell Pepper Sauce IngredientsRed Bell pepper -.500 Gm  Oregano- 10 GmCumin Powder - 5 Gm  Fresh Red Chili - 5 gmSalt - 5 Gm  Coriander Powder - 5 GmOnion -10 Gm  Garlic - 5 GmOlive Oil-15 Gm  Water-50 MlDirections1. Heat oven to 200C/180C. Place the peppers and Red chilli on a baking tray and roast in the oven for about 45 mins until the skins are blackened. Remove from the oven and putinto a plastic bag - this makes them sweat and the skins slip off more easily. When cool enough to handle, peel off the skins with your fingers. Slice the peppers open, pick outand discard all the seeds and membrane, then roughly chop the red flesh.2. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. When hot, fry the garlic and shallot for a few mins. Add the chopped peppers, Cumin Powder, Coriander Powder, and continue to fry for a few mins, stirring to combine everything. Add the Water, bring to the boil, then allow it to reduce a little.3. Pour the contents of the pan into a blender and whizz until smooth. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Depending on the ripeness of the peppers, you shouldnt need any sugar - but if they retain a slightly bitter flavor, return the sauce to the pan, add sugar to taste and let it dissolve over the heat"

What does that mean? Everyone means how many? S.I.-sir asked as if he were conducting a cross-examination. Sir, we have a hundred and twenty-three students, Dinamastres voice was trembling. But your attendance registers say only sixty-three students are present today, said the S.I. getting irritated. He had a blackberry-sized wart between his lip and chin. Perhaps it was due to the weight of his wart that his lower lip drooped. Eating away poor childrens food? Is it your dharma? Who will forgive you? The entry in the attendance register is sixty-three but the stock register says one hundred and twenty-three. Are you fooling me? Thieving  robbery you are teaching this to students? Who really appointed you as a teacher?... Go and beat a drum, S.I.-sir went on rebuking him.This time too Dinamastre wanted to say something but could not. His eyes became moist and his nose started to run. In his thirty years of service, no one had ever pointed a finger at him and had called him a thief or a robber. For the first time, such words had been flung at him when he was innocent of any crime.It was true that sixty-three students had come to school today. It was also true that the stock register said one hundred and twenty-three students. But dalia for only sixty-three students had been given to the cook Raghuama to prepare. This did not mean that he, Dinamastre, was stealing the food meant for the children. He was not a thief. The truth was that in order to feed the poor children the government threw a few sacks of dalia. But to cook that dalia from where could the fuel be collected? Would the children fetch the wood missing their classes? Did the government supply the little gur or sugar that was added to the dalia or the fried chillies and onions that were sometimes mixed into the dalia? If he did not sell dalia, was he to buy these things from his own pocket? To get some money, Dinamastre sold as much dalia as was needed to buy the required fuel, gur, oil, onions, chillies, and so on.Dinamastres anger rose; he was about to break down. He thought of using a few rough words to teach S.I. Panda a lesson, but he did not. He was compelled to remain silent because he knew how Makarand, the school teacher, after retiring from Kenduguda School had been suffering. That helpless old man, otherwise gentle, had been running to the block office every week. His pension papers had not been prepared because, it seems, he had once shouted at a certain S.I. or D.I. on some official matter.(Excerpted from Bheda by Akhila Naik; Translated from Odiya by Raj Kumar; Publisher: Oxford University Press (forthcoming))"

But the situation is the opposite for farmers of small onions in Tiruchy and Perambalur.Because of scanty rains, farmers in the central districts chose to stay with small onion cultivation instead of switching to water-intensive paddy and sugarcane, which resulted in a glut. With markets flooded with small onions, prices of the vital ingredient of the iconic recipe in sambar has nose-dived by at least 50 per cent in the past two weeks.According to officials of Horticulture department, as much as 5,000 acres in Thuraiyur, Uppiliyapuram, Manachanallur, and Pullambadi blocks of Tiruchy, and around 15,000 acres in Perambalur, including Alathur and Veppanthattai blocks, are flush with small onions.We would have gone for paddy and sugarcane had we got enough rainfall. But in its absence, farmers have opted to recultivate small onions. Alathur and Veppanthattai farmers for successive terms cultivated small onions. said V Neelakandan, a farmer from Perambalur.Similarly in Tiruchy, small onion cultivation has taken place on close to 5,000 acres in Thuraiyur and Uppiliyapuram area. With as much as 10-15 per cent surge in production, the problem of plenty has directly affected the prices of small onion also called as sambar onions.At this time last year, a tonne of small onions was sold at Rs 30,000. Now we are getting only Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 whereas the cost stands at Rs 25,000 per acre, Neelakandan added.According to traders in Gandhi market, around 200 tonnes of small onion would arrive at the market here everyday and would be supplied across central districts.But in the past two weeks, the excessive production of small onion has made its reserve to bulge in the godowns forcing traders to sell at throwaway prices. The 75-90 day small onion crop require only half the water needed for paddy. From being sold at `25 per kilogram in the first week of November, the retail prices fell to `5-10 per kg on Saturday. The prices are likely to hold for the next few weeks.Our estimate is that production could have surged by 10 per cent, said a horticulture department official said."

City byelaws made this use of space illegal. But with that, according to Amit, the city lost half of its charm.A food enthusiast and an ardent traveller, he decided to open a multi-cuisine restaurant much in line with Tycoon restaurant that once was his go-to place in the city. It took him two years and travels to 15 countries to finally open his ideal restaurant.The Druid Garden was opened yesterday in Sahakarnagar.The 32,000-sqft restaurant is on the third and fourth floor of a building that houses a fitness gym and grocery stores. But pass the first two floors and you enter a world starkly different with its striped Aztec black and white marble floor.The entrance is dimly lit and, almost all of a sudden, the restaurant turns bright and open. There are different seating arrangements -- German communal tables and elevated corners to VIP sections and closer-to-the-DJ rooms.Our idea was to have an outdoor space and yet a controlled one, says Amit. What if it rains? An open space will not be fun, he says. I look around to see the open space and see the glass roof above my head starting to slide. The retractable glass roof gives way to open skies and a cool breeze.There are planted gardens all around, to remind you of this garden city. In the nights, with fairy lights, the restaurants wears a warm yellow tone.I seat myself in an elevated area, to the right of the entrance. Seated in a handcrafted Italian oak chair, I get an open view of an Italian kitchen. The kitchen boasts of a wood-fire grill and imported teak, oak, rosewood and hickory are used to smoke meat in the grill.The kitchen occupies 20,000 sq ft area and is driven by 60 chefs. You can take a tour of it on request. The store rooms and the refrigerators are stuffed with imported products from all over the world, such as chocolates from Belgium, salmon from Venenzula and cheese from Italy. While the organic vegetables are brought in from Talakadu and Chikballapura, the lamb is from Banur. Majority of the basic ingredients such as garam masalas, breads and ice-cream are made in-house. All ingredients are sealed with a sticker that carries the name of the chef who prepared it, the date on which it was prepared and Best Before date.Adjacent to the kitchen is a brewery with 36 tanks imported from Czech Republic. The beer is made exclusively by a master brewer Ladislav, who is from Czech Republic.The 140 dishes on the menu were carefully picked from 400 dishes. It was tough to narrow them down, says Niharika Raval, general manager of the restaurant.The dishes are from all 15 countries Amit travelled to: Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Portugal, Vietnam, Thailand, South America, Honduras, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Mexico, Japan, China and India. The menu was curated, over eight months, after tasting food from streets and from fine-dining restaurants.I cant try all, so I pick 10 dishes.First, I am served Vietnamese Summer Roll with Peanut Sauce. Fresh lettuce, glass noodles, red cabbage and herbs were assembled together and wrapped in a feather-light rice paper. Maybe because Vietnamese is my favourite cuisine, I find this roll to be the best I have ever had. It has unobtrusive flavours and crunchy, raw textures that are not too loud to chew on. Moist glass noodles adds a smoothness to it too.Hoisin Duck Taco is a surpise. The taco is small, round and soft. Shredded duck is layered with crispier pieces. The duck is prepared in confit, which means it is cooked slowly over a long time in its own fat. The process takes a whole day. The skin of the duck is crispy fried and topped on the taco along with cucumber, spring onions and chayote. The tanginess of the ketchup contrasts well with the sweetness of the duck.Campagna Burrata is sheer delight for cheese lovers. A solid mozzarella holds a refined silky mozzarella and fresh cream.Danish dish Smorrebrod with Anchovy Paste, an open-faced sandwich, has toasted bread drizzled with fresh lettuce. It is divine with the tangy flavour of marinated tomatoes and savoury anchovies. I can taste a hint of basil, roasted pepper and olive oil.Asian cuisine is served with dips that have soy sauce and garlic and Mediterranean dishes have creamy cheesy dips.For the dessert, I am served Orchard Fresh Sorbet that excels in presentation. There are fruit jellies and roll ups. You can pick from three kinds of sorbet -- the brown one that is Chocolate-Chilli flavored, white is Kaffir Lime and Coconut flavoured, and red is Mixed Berry. I try Chocolate Chilli sorbet first, out of curiosity. It tastes first of chocolate then the hotness of the chilli shoots in. The chilli is an after-taste. The Kaffir Lime-Coconut is tangy and creamy. The Mixed Berry sorbet tastes like something you can layer on a bread, instead of jam.Approximate cost for two: `1,400 without alcohol."

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

Every day, the jumbos will be fed green gram, wheat, boiled rice, vegetables, urad dal, jaggery, black gram, sugarcane, boiled cereals, pulses, onions, coconut and several nutritious supplements to make them gain more weight.

Business has slumped by 60% with traders warning of dire consequences to the countrys economy if this continues.This markets impact on business is so striking that the Union Home Ministry even dispatched a representative on Thursday to hold closed-door discussions with traders. Top representatives of the 1,980 wholesale traders at the market have requested the Centre to increase the individual daily withdrawal limit from banks for current account holders from Rs 24,000 to Rs 2 lakh per day.Spread over 93 acres, the APMC is not only the biggest in terms of trade volume but also the largest in south India in terms of area, says Bharat Shah, consultant to food grains and pulses merchants in the city.With 11 entry gates leading to the yard, it is a bustling market with tempos, small and big trucks zooming in and out all day and night. The average daily turnover was a whopping Rs 50 crore till November 8.Onions, potatoes, pulses, grains, sugar, jaggery, dry fruits  almost everything is available in this wholesale market.Loading workers at the yard now earn between D150 and D200 per day as the volume of trucks bringing in produce has come down | s manjunathWe cater to food requirements of 2.5 crore people across the state, including the one crore-plus population of Bengaluru and a large population in Hoskote, Dobbspet, Tumakuru, Magadi, Chintamani, Kolar and Ramanagara, said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains & Pulses Merchants Association.Daily turnover takes a hitAs one enters the gates of the market, bags of onion and potatoes are seen strewn around the yard or being auctioned off. The yard receives an average of 1 lakh bags of onion and 50,000 bags of potato daily. Groups of men are found standing in different spots in the yard, auctioning these items after the trucks arrive with the produce.From a daily turnover of Rs 50 crore, we now have a daily turnover of Rs 18 crore to Rs 20 crore due to the massive cash crunch all around. After the demonetisation move on November 8, our total turnover for the next three days hovered around Rs 5 crore only, said Lahoti. Business has been improving but we are still losing 60 per cent of our business and the Centre has to do something urgently. We requested their representative Anil Kumar, during our meeting on Thursday, to increase the withdrawal limit for current accounts to atleast Rs 2 lakh per day, he added.Traders around his shop concede that the wholesale business sees 90 per cent cash transactions. Representatives of farmers have been camping at the market for a day or two to collect due payment in new currency notes.They will not accept old Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes or cheque payments, a trader said. He adds that almost every trader here lost at least Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh by accepting cheque payments which later bounced. Business is no more done on trust, he added.Speaking of his outlet, Sunil & Co, located in MG Building in the yard, Lahoti said, I have been giving credit only to longstanding customers, whom I trust. I am losing the rest of my business."

No, seriously, because its hard to get. But if youre one of the few who stood in queue for hours, battling rain and shine, exhaustion and dehydration, to finally claim your prize for being an honest citizen, you surely have an opinion on the newest denomination note of the country.Its flimsy, some said, compared to the old notes. Probably because it was printed in a hurry, commented others. And the colour, How does one describe it? Red Onion? asked a young fashionista, screwing up her nose. Hahaha it looks like Monopoly money, joked another, referring to the popular board game.More serious criticism came from those who deal with notes every day. A shopkeeper said the notes are too thin and could easily stick to each other and lead to miscounting.Well like it or not, the country is stuck with it. But were not alone; there are other nations with uglier-looking currency. Check them out here.Australia: The Australian Dollar bill, the currency of the Commonwealth of Australia, is the fifth most traded currency in the world, falling only behind USD, Yen, Euro, and the Pound Sterling. The multiple colours and graphic elements of the Aussie Dollar makes it looks quite tacky. And what is that? The colour of cow dung? One wonders if its a tribute to the thriving dairy industry down under.(Image Courtesy: WikiMedia Commons)Netherlands: A beautiful country with one of the most picturesque capitals, Amsterdam, and yet when it came to the aesthetics of designing their currency, they failed miserably. Did they outsource the job, one wonders. Anything but pleasing to the eye, the currency notes  termed Gulden (the Dutch term for gold coin, similar to the English term guilder) come in bright pinks and reds.(Image Courtesy: www.leftovercurreny.com)Romania: Named Romanian Leu, translating to Romanian Lion, the currency has no semblance to the image that the name invokes. With colourful flowers alongside tough looking men, this currency note is a mish-mash of too many elements. Seems like a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.(Image Courtesy: www.leftovercurreny.com)Germany: The German currency, originally the Deutsche Mark until the European country adopted the Euro in 2002, had multi-coloured bills featuring faces of famous personalities like Carl Friedrich Gauss, a noted German mathematician. Were they going for the rainbow effect with the colours?(Image Courtesy: www.leftovercurrency.com)Philippines: The Philippino currency called Peso during the colonisation of United States, and later rechristened Piso to sound more Filipino post independence, come in various shades of jatang depending on the denomination. You may need to wear sunglasses to handle them.(Photo | AP)Yugoslavia: The Yugoslav Dinar was the currency of three different kingdoms between the years of 1918 and 2003. The highest denomination Dinar note was 500 billion dinars, which became worthless two weeks after it was printed, due to hyperinflation. The note looked rather bleak, as if foretelling its own doom.(Image Courtesy: WikiMedia Commons)Canada: Right from its nickname, its understood that the currency is whacky. Owing to the image of a loon (a bird common to the country) on its one dollar coin, the Canadian Dollar is called the Loonie. Popular though among central banks as the country is known for its financial soundness, the currency, however, looks like someone high on maple candy designed it.(Image Courtesy: Bank of Canada)French overseas collectivities: Overseas regions of the French Republic, like French Polynesia, use the CFP Franc (Change Franc Pacifique). While there is a hand-painted sort of appeal to the bills, they look more like horizontal tarot cards than currency notes.(Image Courtesy: WikiMedia Commons)Norway: Krone, the name of the currency of Norway and its dependent territories, translates to crown in English. Although the current currency is beautiful, its hard to ignore the hideous old ones. Wait a minute, where was Count Dracula and Transylvania based? Not in the scenic land of the Fjords, but get a look at the currency and one wonders if there is a connection.(Image Courtesy: www.leftovercurrency.com)Pakistan: The Pakistani Rupee, also called rupaya or rupaye from the Sanskrit word rupya, was put into circulation after the end of British rule in 1947. Although during the independence era it bore close resemblance to the Indian rupee, and has to this day carried its founder Mohammed Ali Jinnahs picture much like India has carried MK Gandhis on the obverse side, with time the colours became too bright and the effect too loud.(Image Courtesy: Twitter)"

What is worse is that a huge chunk of these perishables are in a state of decay.Elaborating on the chores many poor women like her perform here, M Ambika says that when produce from farmers are brought in sacks, buyers would insist on checking a few sample bags before bulk purchase. An entire bag is emptied and the buyer would inspect them and choose only the good ones. He keeps aside the rejected potatoes or onions, she explains.A large section of the women, two in each onion or potato outlet, help the buyers put the selected onions in a sack for transportation. In return for our labour, we are allowed to take these rejected items. We eke out a living by selling them for cheap, Ambika says. Some buyers also give them one or two kg of fresh onions. When asked as to who would actually buy the rotten perishables, pat comes her reply, Hotels and small grocery shops.However, even this paltry income has been hard to come by due to a dip in the number of lorries as well as sacks reaching the yard since November 9. I used to make between Rs 100 and Rs 200 per day. Now it is between Rs 50 and Rs 100 per day, Ambika says.There are roughly 2,000 labourers employed in the yard. The men largely do the loading and unloading of produce.Muruga and his colleagues are quite a disgruntled lot. We used to earn Rs 700 to Rs 800 per day and have work thrice a week. Now we earn Rs 150-Rs 200 a day due to the reduced number of trucks coming to the yard, he says. He is among a group of labourers who come to the city from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh for seven to eight months each year to earn a living.Ganesan, a co-worker says, Just see this truck now.

After a dark Dasara, merchants are hoping that things pick up at least before Diwali.Movement of goods between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is taking place smoothly now but with a 25-35 per cent increase in freight charges.Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Association president Ramesh Chandra Lahoti says truckloads of pulses, Sona Masuri rice, steam rice and onions are among the items sent to Tamil Nadu daily. Apart from the regular rates of `22,500 for a truckload of goods, an additional `15,000 was paid to transport goods last month. There were literally no Dasara celebrations for traders due to the additional costs incurred, he said.Trucks parked at Yeshwanthpur yard in Bengaluru | Pushkar VThe cost of transporting 1kg of any item shot up from `1.50 to `2.50 last month. Things normalised a week ago, but the previously prevalent rates are not being charged. The cost of transporting a kg is now `2, which is nearly a 35 per cent increase over previous rates, Lahoti pointed out. Traders are forced to pass on the burden to consumers, he added.Bharat Shah, a consultant to many foodgrain and pulses merchants in the city, says the increase in charges applies to both exports and imports between the two states and the end result is that the consumer has paid more for commodities exchanged between both states (see box). Dasara sales have definitely slumped for all the traders here, he adds.Vastupal Sanghvi, proprietor of Sree Mookambika Trading Company at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, imports truckloads of pulses daily from Chennai. I used to pay `120 for transporting one quintal (100 kg) of either urad dal, tur dal or moong dal by truck. It shot up to `170 a quintal for a fortnight when the agitation was at its peak. The transportation cost has reduced to `150 now but it is still 25 per cent more than what I used to pay earlier,  he says.When asked about why they are made to pay increased freight charges, he says that some truckers still stop their vehicles at the border between the states around 6.30-7 pm. They halt there for a few hours and enter only under the cover of darkness. Hence, the additional charges are levied, he says.Things will be okay after Nov 5Yeshwantpur APMC Local Lorry Owners Association president G Kumar conceded that the transportation charges were on the higher side now.Some top exporters have declared a one-week to 10-day closure of shops for Diwali. This has forced lorry owners to reduce the number of trucks on the roads. Due to the reduced number of vehicles plying, the rates have gone up, he said.He assured that rates would stabilise and go back to the days before the Cauvery protests, by November 5. When asked if the hikes during festive season was an annual occurrence, Kumar said, No. Those plying lorries last month had to undertake much risk when crossing the Hosur border. Hence, transportation charges were jacked up. It has continued after that."

I want people to experiment with new flavours. If you are a South Indian, Ill suggest you to try Gujarati, Kolhapuri, Bengali, Marathi cusines. Theres an array of flavours in Indian cuisine and with this restaurant, my goal is to encourage people to try different flavours of India, he says.Doi Rui Tawa Fry sets off the delightful mustard based spread, with pleasing favlours marked by the curd and ginger garlic marinate. The fish is well cooked and compliments well with the colourful presentation of sliced onions and beetroot.The main course sees a bountiful variation of the Illish fish, with brand chef at the Indian Kitchen presenting a range of authentic recipes from the Bengali kitchen.Machar Kalia was a sweet and spicy combination of onion, tomato paste cooked with potatoes that set the sauce for the fish that was cooked in raw mustard and spices. The dish definitely is one of the must-try curries in the main course spread.On the other hand Lonka Bhapa Illish, sets a milder tone with subtle flavours of the sauce that is a blend of mustard, coconut milk, coconut paste and green chillis.Kosha Mangsho, a traditional mutton dish served at the restaurant, while lacking on presentation, was well cooked in mustard oil, complimented with a onion-ginger-garlic gravy.The Murd Deem Biriyani is not too spicy and will appeal to those who appreciate subtle flavours in their biriyani. The chicken is well-cooked in handmade masala, with saffron adding colour to the dish.The main course curries are served with steamed rice.The dishes are complimented with a pickle and chutney spread comprising plastic chutney  made of raw papaya, a sweet mango chutney, a mango and pudina flavoured green chutney and an Andhra pickle.Other than the rosugullha, Chennar Paish among desserts is definitely the hero of the festive spread, served chilled in a cocktail glass.

They now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.But, that is the least of Jayaramans worries. Ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said Jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.Consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said Jayaraman and his friend M Abdul Khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. This month, I had to send four of my 10 labourers to Bihar where they come from, since I couldnt afford them, Jayaraman added.Apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. For instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.Before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.As a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. Likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.In Koyambedu, Asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. Flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.While calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like Jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.If the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.Its not good for business.Produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apples from Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from Ganganagar in Punjab, seedless grapes from Solapur and sapotas from closer home in Tirupattur.The key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. Some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. We cannot do that, said Jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. If we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.So despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.Abdul Khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.In addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of Rs 1 per square feet a month.Hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, Rs 1,200 would have to be paid.However, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. The last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. So, were hopeful, Jayaraman said.On November 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere Rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at Rs 12.Last week, before Ammas death, it was Rs 7 per kg, said Abdul Khader."

They are consultants to those wishing to nurture gardens of different sizes, as well.Minette shares some valuable information and tips with our readers.Watering requires to be done everyday, unless the soil is already wet/damp from the previous day. Among the herbs, rosemary is a delicate darling which requires some extra attention and care.Water your plants enough to keep the soil moist without over-watering (roots will rot in a soggy container). Let the top of the soil, or growing medium, dry out completely between watering and check moisture levels often. Mint, parsley does best in fairly moist soil, whereas rosemary, thyme and sage prefer soil that is only slightly moist.Herbs grow well in equal parts compost, sterile topsoil and builders sand. An all-purpose organic fertilizer can be added to this mix. The soil mix needs to drain well. Since they can thrive on any type of soil, the soil does not have to be completely organic. They are not often bothered by insect or disease pests. Neem oil works best in case of any diseases.Herbs can be grown in pots or on the ground. They require a minimum of 6 hours of bright sunlight and can be grown indoors where they get sufficient light. Indoors the advantage is no weeds, easy to access but the yield is less. A south west facing window will do well. Outdoors, the yield is larger, the herbs are more flavoursome.The beauty of herbs is that they can thrive on your kitchen window sill, balcony, patio etc as long as they get the required amount of sunlight and water. One can buy seeds from most garden stores. Most herbs are available as saplings and can be re potted into bigger pots or into the ground. Basil gives out flowers which dry into seeds. Once it flowers, it needs to be pinched and the seeds can be dried and grown. The same goes with garlic and onion chives.Seeds of annual herbs (basil, coriander, dill and oregano) can be started indoors and grown year round. Place a collection of popular culinary herbs in a sunny kitchen window and theyll be available when needed. Perennial herbs, like chives, parsley, sage, sweet marjoram and thyme, can be started from seed, but it is often easier to purchase young plants from a nursery. Because perennials grow for more than one season, its best to keep them outside in pots during the summer and bring them in if the winter is too cold.The Tale of a TeacherI am the proud owner of a farm in the heart of Bengaluru in Jayanagar. It is just a 3ft by 14 ft patch in my backyard but I call it a farm because in that small space I grow a variety of vegetables and herbs!says former teacher, Mythili Ramaprasad, her eyes sparkling with joy and pride. To make maximum use of the little soil in the patch and also the limited sunlight available, I grow climbers, shrubs, herbs and tubers.So there is a happy mix of pumpkin, turmeric, cherry tomatoes, sweet potato, colocasia( kesuvina soppu) along with curry leaves, chilies, mint, basil and ajwain ( dodpathre soppu) ,all growing in symbiosis. I have also tried growing climbers like passion fruit, chow and hyacinth beans ( avarekai) in the past which have given good yields.She says I took up gardening seriously as a hobby after I retired as a teacher. What began as a hobby has now become a passion. I love to spend time every morning in the garden, examining each plant and discover a fresh green shoot or a healthy new bud. It is very relaxing and has great therapeutic value. Very little investment is needed to plan a small kitchen garden. It is best if it is organically cultivated. Kitchen wastes like vegetable and fruit peels can be collected and buried in a pit in the soil.Sometimes the plants are attacked by caterpillars and insects which need immediate attention as they can seriously damage the plants and affect the produce. Monkeys can also be a menace and cause destruction.....she rues. And those who know Mythili Ramaprasad will tell you just how alert and vigilant she is especially when it comes to her beautiful garden!"

He must be unaware. My worry is how he will survive the two-day journey, he added.The worst affected are the traders who are scared they will lose their daily business for the next two days.

I have currencies in the denomination of `500 and `1,000. How would I carry out my business tomorrow?, wondered a concerned Vijayakumar, a shop owner in Koyambedu.While common man was a tad uneasy, those from financial background were more measured in their reactions. Aashish, who deals with banking and financial services, said that the commodity market will be hit. Prime Minister says 99 per cent of transaction in India is through cash. This will put people into tremendous hardship but then it is a welcome sign as it will put an end to black money, he said.It is commendable, but there are many buts.

It had cabbage, onions, pepper, tomato ketchup sauce and garnished with a fried egg. Wouldnt you love to try that? I remember being the happiest little kid when my mom would cook her amazing meals for the family. I began to cook too. Actually, I wanted to join armed forces because I always admired their dedication and discipline. But I could not pursue it further; so I decided to be a chef, which also requires equally high levels of dedication and discipline. No regrets at all!Sujit MukherjeeThe first professional kitchen experience I had was peeling onions for a large banquet and I grew to cooking food for 2,800 people. I started my career in an Indian kitchen. The blend of spices and the union of flavours with exotic spices fascinate me. A lot of young people have no idea what this kind of job requires. Its tough; so try not to take this as an easy way out. Nowadays, chefs are in serious demand all over the world.Recently, we did a complete themed brunch which was based on molecular cuisine using techniques like sous vide, nitrogen cooking, gelling and spherification. Of course, certain experiments dont work out. I tried making a pizza pie with a twist but it didnt come out the way I wanted it too. Food is not just about cooking; I educate myself on flavour, taste and seasonality.You should try Spaghetti Aglio Olio with grilled chicken, which has a nice charcoal aroma of the chicken, caramelised garlic and extra virgin olive oil for that additional flavour. Its my favourite! Always use garlic and herbs in your dishes. While the former helps in controlling cholesterol, the latter helps in reduction of heart diseases.Ive got a good understanding of food and cuisines from other countries. A tip to aspiring chefs: eat a wide range of food and experiment with things; its the only way to update yourself in the present market. So start at the bottom and work your way up, learn and absorb as much as possible. Assisting in kitchens is essential to understand the industry on a deeper level. If you have that passion and youre willing to work hard, youll do well. And fast.As for me, Ive been in the kitchen for a long time and I soon want to travel to various places and try the local flavours there.Also, cook under the open sky and indulge in a nice warm chocolate souffl."

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

It opens a window to seeing the world differently, with its many magical surprises. Designing a garden that is child-friendly will sustain their interest. Here are some top tips to make it so.Select a small patch of the whole garden space for this garden. Here, they can do activities by themselves like digging, sowing, watering and weeding. Take care of their safety. Avoid using the materials which will hurt them while gardening.The pots and the planters which are used in the garden can be painted with different colours and decorated with their favourite cartoon characters. This will make things more fun. Kids are curious about new things. The kids garden should have plants which grow fast. They will be thrilled to see the sprouting and emerging of a new leaf from a seed which was sown by them. Plucking a carrot from the soil and eating them with the fresh soil flavour will become their green childhood stories. They will enjoy the colours. Bright flowering plants would be a smart addition to their garden.The child-friendly garden should have some interesting structures where the kids can play, learn and grow plants. It could be done in many creative ways. You could design an alphabet garden where the raised beds could be designed like an alphabet. Pizza gardens could be designed in a small circular patch of land where all the vegetables and the herbs which are used in pizzas could be grown. Beans can be grown in a spiral cage attached to the pot, making them more engaged with the plant by trailing it on the cage.In case you have no space on the ground to have a child-friendly garden, don't worry. Make some interesting planters at home which gives them the happiness of growing food. Potato man, aqua onion are easy to make and perfectly fit your window sill garden at home. Here is how to make a potato man and aqua onion:Take a big size potato. Cut the potato one inch from the top and scoop out all the flesh with a spoon or a knife. Leave a thick layer of flesh around the skin. Fill the potato with soil and sow some Ragi seeds on that. Sprinkle some water every day. Ragi will germinate within a week and grow like the hair of the potato. Draw a face on the potato with its green lush hair on the top. Wheat, paddy or any other cereal seeds could be used.Aqua onions: Take a cup and fill with water. Keep an onion in that in such a way that the roots are touching the water.

Tamil Nadu buys 150 to 200 truckloads of onions every day from Karnataka.Paramesh, president of State APMC Yard Workers Union, told Express, Since this is one of the biggest yards in the state, usually, there are 10 to 15 lakh people here every day. But ever since the Cauvery agitation started, the number of people has come down by 30 per cent.According to traders in the market, onion is the worst hit. Onions have a short shelf life. Since the protests started, the onions that were in stock have started to rot. So we are selling them at `1 per kilo. Good quality onions cost `6 to `8 per kg.Nandeesha, a trader at APMC Yard, said, Some of our truck drivers are stuck midway and are forced to throw away the rotting onions.The rice market is also affected to a great extent.

Insects which feed on plants are called as pests. In nature, these pests are consumed by the predator insects, that are garden friendly or farmer friendly. However, chemical farming has collapsed this balancing system in nature. Chemical pesticides kill predators and pests resistance towards these chemicals as well. In natural farming, pest management is based on the principle of 'prevention is better than cure'. Weaker plants are easily susceptible to pest attacks while healthy plants don't get affected by pests and thrive best if they grow in good quality soil. Humus is the best way to create healthy soil. Humus could be created by adding biomass and beneficial micro organisms to the soil. Desi cow dung and cow urine are the best sources of beneficial micro organisms. Creating healthy soil as well as the following simple gardening tips will help you to make your garden absolutely healthy.Plant protection tips for your gardenSeeds should be treated with a microbial culture before sowing, which gives protection from all fungal diseases.Providing proper space between plants will facilitate aeration and avoid spreading of disease between the plants.Marigold can be grown around the garden, as a trap crop. The yellow flower attracts pests and secures the main vegetable plants.Grow companion plants. When vegetables are grown with herbs, the herbs act as a repellent plant for pests. Tomato and tulsi can be grown in the same pot.Crop rotation should be followed. Grow different plants instead of same plants in each container. For example tomato - beans - onion can be grown consecutively in one year.Grow maize and cow pea in between vegetable plants. The maize and cow pea foliage attracts pests and prevent other vegetable crops from getting affected.If any plant or plant part gets affected by insects, remove the affected pant or plant part manually and use it for composting.Growing marigold and castor plants once in a while in the pot which will give protection from root nematodes.Have lights in the garden during night hours.

58fd5dde7be9e06c9371a7fa,Pellets or grains for furry friends?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2016/sep/21/Pellets-or-grains-for-furry-friends-1521949.html,2016-09-21,,The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: A nutritious and balanced diet is essential for your furry friends, but how can you pick the right one? You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

The second time she repeated Gadagada gudugudu.. gadagada gudugudu, even the adults joined her. Asha, who hails from a teaching background, belongs to the Chennais Storytellers Association. I was told stories while having food. I was so fascinated by this, I took up storytelling. As a storyteller, I believe in reviving old stories, traditions and passing them to the younger ones, said Asha.But what was the gadagada, gudugudu all about? Well, Asha was narrating the story of Krishna Rao who owns the Woodlands Hotel, a city landmark. As she finishes the story, Sharanya went on stage and begins dancing to the songs of the good old Madras. She enlightens the kids about five things Madras is famous for  the Marina beach, hot idlis with a variety of chutney, the Vandaloor zoo, Sem Mozhi Poonga and the Rajni craze. As she finishes, Banu jumps onto the stage and narrates the story of Thiruverkaadu Amman temple.The trio has been associated with storytelling for many years, and now has learnt new tricks to ensure kids can relate to what they say. Well, a few kids grasp immediately, while a few look at our actions and pick it up slowly. For some others, it is the rhyming words and songs that help them understand what is told. So when it comes to Madras Day stories, we try and incorporate all of these so that they can relate it to, says Sharanya.Today, Chennai has many heritage buildings and sites. How important is it for kids to know about these historic structures? I personally feel its very important for all of us who stay/live in this city to know about its history and heritage, says Banu. Of all the places that have become history, Asha says she misses the Moore Market complex most. Well, I treasure the hours I spent shopping there. I still remember buying books for 90 paisa, a basket for 25 paisa and I miss that place a lot.As she finishes, Sharanya drifts her thoughts to the days when Drive-in Woodlands was a happening-spot in the city. The bread and peas that used to be served there for breakfast used to be my favourite. The bread would be toasted with butter on plain tawa with the onion, tomato and green peas curry. Even today I pine for it, she laughed."

Among the cars on display were the classic Austin Seven, Mgs, Ford Fairline, Ford Galaxy, Ford Mustang, Chevrolet 1953 and Dodge 1868.The first car came to Madras from a company called Alldays and Onions and they represented cars like the hummer and sunbeam. V Sriram who addressed a group of automobile enthusiasts during the event said, AJ Yorke, a director of Parry and Co brought a car from England in 1901. He used to drive it from Bens garden thats popularly known as Parrys corner.Though there is an unverified sighting of a car much earlier, 1901 is the year that one can trace back for car records. When cars began to be registered, MC01 was owned by Sir Francis, spring chairman of the Madras Port Trust and MCO3 was ownedby Thatikonda Namberumal Chetty, shared Sriram. Addison and Company were the pioneers of car imports in the Madras Presidency and a few years before Independence Madras, became the car hub of the country. Soon after Independence, though car manufacturing hadnt begun in the country, Anantharamakrishnan of Amalgamation limited started acquiring all British companies. In 1949, he set up Indian Pistons, Indias first automotive manufacturing company, explained Sriram. His vision was that one day cars will be manufactured here and that his spares will have demand.Historian Muthaiah shared some personal stories about the car history of madras. I came here in 1968 and I had a car of the 51s model and was a luxury carany guesses? he quizzed the heritage car enthusiasts. After several answers, one person got it right. Muthaiah owned a Lanchester and was the third person to own it in the Madras Presidency.Talking about the story of how he landed with a Herald, he recalled, T T Krishnamachari had a standard Herald and his son Vasu too owned one. After TTK passed away, his car was passed on to Vasu and Vasus car came to me! Though most people have the misconception that Ford came to India in 1993, Muthaiah shared that Ford started assembling trucks as early as 1926 in Bombay.Har Sahay Meena, MD, TTDC, said that more such initiatives have to be taken to preserve our heritage. The idea of a rally (interstate or intra-state) was proposed by Ranjit Prathap, MD, Rayala Corporation. The State government will help in any way possible.

Its founder A Senthilkumar said they were overwhelmed by the good response to their first outlet in Mogappair and aware of the consequences of using antibiotics in broiler chicken. European countries pay a lot of attention to the health and fat content of chicken. I wanted to make that concept take root in India too, he said.Herboo chicken is tested and proven to be safe by a Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) authorised laboratory called Eurofins. This facility is an international group of labs headquartered in Luxembourg which offers testing and support services to the industries across pharma, food, environmental and consumer products sectors.Mettex Lab (authorised by FSSAI) has declared that no trace of antibiotics was found in the Herboo chicken. Antibiotics prevent the spread of diseases within the birds. To compensate for the lack of using these medicines, Senthilkumar resorted to herbal remedies after extensive research. He uses 38 different spices like pepper, cardamom and ginger that boosts the immunity of the chicken and increases its taste.Apart from these, he feeds neem juice, aloe vera, beetle nut and onions to the birds to prevent worms. At the counter, the chicken is stored in refrigerators to prevent spoiling of the meat. However, the increase in the quality of chickens health and taste come with additional expenditure. If you could buy about 2 kg of chicken in the market for Rs 200, the same price would fetch you just three-quarters of a kilo at Herboo Chicken.By the end of September, three more outlets of Herboo Chicken will be opened in Virugambakkam, Pallikarnai and Velachery.

I specialise in North Indian cuisine, and I love cooking Rajasthani, Kashmiri and Bengali. Although I havent tried South Indian cuisine much, Ive learnt one item, Ardha Pathi or Adai, which my boss in Delhi loves.Indian cuisine is vast and there are so many things to experiment with, so I would still say that I am in the learning process. In the south, although there are many North Indian restaurants, I always find that theres a South Indian touch to it, just like how I cook South Indian food in Delhi. I use curry leaves instead of coriander in sambhar, and people like it that way there. The base for North Indian cuisine is onions and tomatoes. Like in the south, people use tamarind to get a sour flavour, in the north we use tomatoes to give a tangy touch. Today, I find people are open to all kinds of cuisines, and they want a change from the routine they are used to.I believe in cooking authentic food rather than innovative food. Im not against fusion, but I feel it can be adopted while presenting a dish rather than while preparing it. Let me share a funny incident that I faced in a restaurant a few years back. I had ordered a kofta, and the way they presented it was funny. It had a cup with gravy, a loaf of crispy bread placed over the cup and the kofta balls placed aside. However, the beauty of the dish is that the kofta balls should be soaked in the sauce/gravy! (laughs)Some of my vegetarian specialties are Butte ke Kabab, made from corn kernels, nuts and spicies, which are made into patties and cooked in kebab style. This is a vegetarianNorth Indian dish. In non-vegetarian, my specialities include Tandoori Jinga, Chicken Tikka and Tandoori Chicken.The kind of ingredients used play a major role in making sure the taste is retained in a dish. Today even in the south, we get all the ingredients required to cook North Indian food. But there are a few exceptions like the kachri powder (used to bring a sour taste to a dish), which I bring from Delhi. When it comes to dessert, the main difference is that North Indian desserts do not use coconut at all, while in the South, several desserts have coconut as a base."

Derailed by the demonetisation bug, M Seelamma of Panchalingala village is worried about raising even `5000 needed to hire labourers to harvest the crop in another week.She has been calling the traders, who have to clear the bills for the Bengal gram sold to them. They are offering cheque. She is refusing because there is no point in accepting them. Banks will not give her cash immediately. Even if I engage my entire family in harvesting, I would be five persons short. Delay means the yield will come down. We require more hands to remove coriander seed from the plant, she said.B Thimmappa, a 45-year-old farmer in Tulisapuram of Kurnool, too is a worried man. He spent `40,000 per acre on cultivating Bengal gram over five acres. I owe my farm hands `20,000. They are putting pressure on me. They will refuse to harvest the next lot due in two weeks. I went to the bank five times, but could only withdraw `2000, he laments. If not harvested in time, the crop will lose value and not fetch the price it should.This time of the year during Rabi, farmers in Kurnool take up cultivating millet, oil seeds, pulses like Bengal gram, red gram and chillies with paddy to a lesser extent. Several had completed sowing and started the process of weeding, using fertilisers and spraying pesticides, before the announcement of demonetisation.Now, a majority are facing problems in getting workers for weeding, spraying another round of pesticides and harvesting, which starts in the last week of December and continues till the end of January. Even if the cash problem eases in January, farmers are worried about recovering the minimum support price. Rates falling is another concern. Prices of red gram, black gram fell by `30 per kilo in the last month and they are afraid that traders might offer a lower price now.D Maddileti, a young farmer from the village who also cultivated Bengal gram, said he needs around `15,000 per acre for weeding and spraying pesticide. It's hard to manage and promises of late payment have not convinced the farm hands. Even getting loans is difficult as everyone is on the same boat. There is no cash, although many have bank accounts full of cash, he said.7.29 lakh hectares- Total area sown in the state of Andhra Pradesh during Rabi season.Paddy 42% Coarse grains 64% Total pulses 65% Rainfall status ScantyThe effect of demonetisation has been such that Chinna Venkanna, a 45-year-old from Rematta, who cultivated three acres of Bengal gram and left another five acres unused, has lost hope. I need money to engage labourers for weeding, spraying pesticides and harvesting. I have deposits with the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society, but they have no new currency. I am unable to get loans and Kharif bills are pending with traders. I dont know if I will get even my investment back.The situation is no different with bigger farmers like Ghouse Mia of Ullakala village and Hussain Basha of T Kotakonda village of Devarakonda mandal. While Ghouse had cultivated 15 acres of onion, eight acres of chillies for Rabi, Hussain cultivated eight acres of Bengal gram, two acres of jowar and two acres of red gram.I am due for harvest in 15 days, but there's no cash to engage workers. If I can't, pest infestation will render the crop useless. I have money in bank but can't withdraw, he said. Ghouse paid a farm hand his wage to stand in the queue at ATMs, but had no luck."

Ghee has been generously used in all the dishes here. The eatery, infact, prides in using only ghee and no oil, and therefore there is a rich flavour. The onion fillings of paddu, creamy pongal, colourful and bright shavige bath and the tasty ghee upma  all of these are made in ghee.The delicious pongal is made with coconut milk. The kesari bath melts in the mouth and has flakes of kesar. Both have a melting, rich texture and taste delicious.Chettys Coffee has some offbeat varieties of dosas. Apart from the regular plain dosa and masala dosa, theres Avalakki Dosa, Pickle Dosa and Vegetable Dosa. The Avalakki Dosa, made with rice and gram, looks appealing and like the appams. But these are not made in coconut milk. Yet, they are light, soft and fluffy. They are served with onion and coconut chutnies. The onion chutney has a mild sweetness and the coconut chutney is spicy.The Pickle Dosa is another specialty with a tangy twist. The dosa has a chilli-pickle spread, which gives it a yellow tinge. Though these are made from chillies, it is not hot and tasted the best of all. It surprises you with its light tantalising flavour.The beetroot in the vegetable dosa lends it a pink colour and an overarching earthy flavour. The dosa also has other veggies like carrot and beans. Unlike the usual vegetable dosas at other food joints, with chopped and spiced vegetables as a filling, in this dosa the vegetables are ground well along with the batter. It looks like a pink plain dosa.Now comes the dessert. The Anjoor Halwa is simply delicious and will make you crave for more. The gel-like halwa floats in ghee. It is sticky, yet a delight to taste.Approximate cost for two: Rs 150"

It has become a trend now.Thats when I started thinking about what I can make exclusively with organic vegetables. I always wished of having a vegetable garden near to my kitchen so that I can pluck from them and directly put them in frying pan. Interestingly, from my travel experience, I found that there are places in India where people do the same. This gave me an idea of making a special dish which I named it as Chefs Garden. Keeping new market trends, awareness of local theme, freshly grown, farm to plate concepts in mind, I created this contemporary salad using fresh microgreens and dehydrated olives.For preparing Chefs garden, I use all the fresh vegetables like carrot, zucchini, baby corn, Pearl onion microgreens and Frezze which spread over the cheese filled baked dough. Sprinkling olive powder, Panko crumb and dressing it up with Vinegrette give a good flavour to the dish.The whole idea behind creating dishes with fresh local produce is to create appreciation for healthy eating, benefits of organic produce, spreading the joy of simplistic dishes and cooking.More and more people want to embrace the idea of farm to fork, enjoy seasonal fruits and vegetables and make the most of what is available around them which is fresh and stored without preservatives.As a chef and a parent, I want the future generation to understand the importance of organic farming by introducing exciting and interesting dishes for them and getting them to eat healthy, nutritious food.- Chef Rana Dominic Gomes, Executive Chef,Hotel Royal Orchid"

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments. As for those investors who want to set up something, we provide the expertise.Meanwhile, Mariem is looking forward to coming back to Kochi in the future. I love the place, she says."

Moreover, since it is located on the canal bund and restrictions have been imposed on vehicle movement in the area, even if the wholesale market is kept open it will not be accessible. The local vendors are sourcing the vegetable from other areas and hence, the increase in prices coupled with the shortage of vegetables, said K Sivashankar, a roadside vegetable vendor in Satyana rayanapuram.Out of fear, people are hoarding veggies in large quantities for the next 12 days. Even if vegetables arrive tomorrow, the cost may touch the sky. So, we are buying and stocking them for the next fortnight, explained P Sirisha of Ayodhya Nagar.However, the marketing officials in Krishna district say there is no need to worry. We decided to open rythu bazaars in the city, round-the-clock during Krishna Pushkarams. We are also operating as many as 20 mobile rythu bazaars in areas that are at considerable distance from the nearest rythu bazaar, said J Ravi Kumar, assistant director of marketing.There are six rythu bazaars in the city including the one at Ibrahimpatnam and running them round-the-clock will certainly help. When pointed out that potatoes, tomatoes and onions are not grown in Vijayawada region and have to be imported from other parts, the official said they have made alternate arrangements even though restrictions on vehicles have been imposed in Vijayawada.The government itself will supply potatoes, onions and tomatoes to rythu bazaars during Pushkarams. Potatoes are being imported from Agra and Indore, onions from Maharashtra and tomatoes from Madanapalle in Chittoor district, said Ramesh Babu, officer in-charge of Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar but public, continues to be apprehensive."

I am accepting things which I can use. Rice and coconut can be resold. Bamboo will be used in fencing and wooden planks for furniture, Palai said.With rural Odisha facing currency crisis and most of the panchayats still remaining unbanked, people have adopted barter system to purchase essential commodities and manage their daily requirements.Barter is an old system of exchange of goods and services without involving money. Treated as cashless economy, it is usually a reciprocal medium of exchange, benefiting both the parties - giver and taker.While people in urban Odisha are using debit or credit cards to make payments, communities in rural areas have turned to the older form of cashless payment. Other things apart, rice, which is abundantly available after the autumn harvest, has become a common medium of exchange.Unlike coastal areas, people in hilly and forest regions have been availing goods, grocery items and vegetables in exchange of forest produces like honey and resin. Even as the Centre chalked out a series of measures for smooth flow of cash into rural areas, this barter system proved beneficial for people like daily wager Dibakar Soren (62) who is yet to have a bank account.I purchased one kg potato, 250 gms dal, 500 gms onion and some spices in exchange of one litre of honey. I have two old Rs 500 notes, but none is willing to accept it. The bank, where I can exchange the notes is seven km away, Soren, a resident of Jashipur in Mayurbhanj district, said.Adding to the woes of senior citizens, the officials have paid them old-age pension in old currency notes.In many parts of the State, two persons have been provided one Rs 500 note and one Rs 100 note asking them to exchange the old one and divide the amount. People above the age of 60 years are entitled to get Rs 300 each as old-age pension.While there are reports of dharna by pensioners in front of panchayat offices in protest against the payment through banned currency notes, people in several districts staged demonstrations before cooperative banks demanding exchange of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

But farmers are seemingly discouraged to take potato cultivation due to high price of certified seed potato of K-Jyoti variety at `35.5 per kg.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the administration also plans to cover 133 ha in Gurundia, Rajgangpur, Kutra and Lefripara blocks under the convergence initiative of horticulture and watershed schemes. So far, 1,200 quintals of total 2,082 quintals of seed potato have been supplied and farmers in the four blocks would get incentive of `30,000 per ha under convergence initiative, he added.In the rest 13 blocks, potato farmers registered under Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana (RKVY) would be entitled to get incentives of `20,000 per ha. He said a section of the farmers have resorted to germination of seed potatoes and sowing would continue till December in the district.About onion cultivation, he informed that 160 ha are covered under the State Plan Scheme and 16 quintals of seed onion have been supplied at a subsidised cost of `250 per kg. The DDH claimed that in rest of the district, farmers have taken up onion cultivation on 940 ha at their own and onion seeds are being developed at nurseries for transplantation after 45 days.Sources said sandy loam soil is most suitable for potato crop with each ha requiring about 15 quintals of seed potato and after 105 days, the average potato yield is expected to be 10 tonnes per ha in the district. Similarly, each ha requires 10 kg of seed onion and after 150 days, each ha is likely to produce 10 tonnes of onion on an average.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said to boost potato and onion cultivation, adequate cold storage facilities are required. He hoped the recently opened cold storage facility in Bargaon block of 5,000 tonnes capacity and an existing facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela would be helpful to some extent.Potato farmers, however, continue to be worried about market uncertainties as in 2015, potato price had crashed drastically leading to distress sale of locally grown crops."

Farmers are forced to resort to distress sale and they blame the State Government for the situation.Only two mandis are operational in the district for procuring cotton as a result of which, they sell their produce to traders, who are encashing on the situation. Against the target of 55,000 hectares (ha) of land, cotton was grown over 53,000 ha in the district this year. With each ha giving a yield of eight to 10 quintals, the targeted yield has been fixed at about five lakh quintals. The MSP for cotton this season has been fixed at `4,160 per quintal. Sources said only two mandis are operating at Karlapada and Utkela exposing the farmers to private traders, who have already started purchasing cotton at price much less than the MSP.With majority of the farmers availing both institutional and private loan for cotton cultivation, they are in a hurry to repay the loan to avoid payment of interest. Cotton cultivation was initiated in Kalahandi in the 70s and it brought in new horizons. Over the years, it turned out to be the major cash crop. Apparently, Kalahandi was a paddy growing area till agricultural scientists introduced cash crops like cotton, onion and pulses. As weather and soil condition is suitable for cotton cultivation, government hoped to improve economic condition of farmers through it.However, in the absence of marketing facilities and support from Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), farmers have failed to gain from the crop.Deputy Director, Agriculture, Laxman Paltasingh said more mandis will be made operational shortly."

She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day.

Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.

While members of both the communities were conspiring against each other, Sauqat was busy discharging his duty for the mankind.The youths were crying in pain when they arrived at the hospital. I cleaned their wounds and covered those with bandage after nurse applied medicines, he said.On the strife, Sauqat said people from both the communities live peacefully in the town. Some mischief mongers flared up the small incident, he added. Normally, Soro is a peaceful town and people here extend cooperation to each other, Sauqat added.Doctors of the CHC also donned role of Samaritans for the patients and their attendants who were stuck up without food due to promulgation of prohibitory orders and curfew. A team of four doctors led by Dr Dhiresh Kumar Sarangi spent from their own pocket and provided cooked food to at least 200 persons daily for the last four days.The patients and their attendants were helpless since all hotels were closed as Section 144 of CrPc was clamped in the town. Even vegetables were also not available, we managed to collect dal, some vegetables and rice to provide them cooked food, said Dr Sarangi.Other doctors who extended a helping hand are Dr Satyanarayan Nayak, Dr Hemanta Roul and Dr Gauranga Singh. With the situation in Soro improving and no untoward incident reported since last 24 hours, the contribution of the hospital doctors and Sauqat is hailed by all and sundry.Meanwhile, the locals residents, who were forced to remain indoors due to prohibitory orders, came out and purchased essential commodities and vegetable which were made available after four days. People alleged that the traders were raking in the moolah as very few shops were opened and commodities were insufficient. Some were seen selling potato and onion at ` 40-a-kilo while the price of other vegetables were very high compared to other markets in the district. Fishes and chickens were sold like hot cakes.A district official said only a few truck loads of potato, vegetables and fishes reached Soro on Wednesday. The price was high since the supply was less but it will come down in a day or two, he added."

(File | Reuters)NEW DELHI: Wholesale inflation eased for the third straight month as it fell to 3.15 per cent in November after subdued demand due to demonetisation led to softening of prices of vegetables and other kitchen staples.The wholesale price index-based inflation, reflecting the annual rate of price rise, in October stood at 3.39 per cent. In November 2015, the print was (-)2.04 per cent.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)24.10 per cent in November, saw deflationary pressure for the third consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)51.51 per cent.Pulse inflation continued to rule high at 21.73 per cent in November, according to commerce ministry data.Potato recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food inflation basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.The reading for manufactured articles was 3.20 per cent compared with 2.67 per cent in the previous month. The corresponding figure for sugar came in at 31.76 per cent and that of petrol 5.54 per cent.The WPI inflation for September has been revised upwards at 3.8 per cent against the provisional estimate of 3.57 per cent.The decline in wholesale inflation coincides with a fall in retail inflation, which hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent in November.The monetary policy committee headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel had earlier this month held interest rates steady and said demonetisation of high value currency notes could lower prices of perishables and reduce CPI inflation by 10-15 basis points by December.Even as RBI maintained 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017, it trimmed GDP growth forecast to 7.1 per cent, from 7.6 per cent, for the current fiscal."

The decline in wholesale prices was seen across the board  vegetables (-24.10 per cent), onion (-51.51 per cent) and oil seeds (-5.05 per cent)  not much different from the Consumer Price Index data released earlier this week. However, some experts say that the decline in wholesale inflation along with a fall in retail inflation, which hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent in November, should not be a cause of concern.The decline in vegetable prices is directly linked to lack of cash in peoples hand following the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 9 and the inability of Reserve Bank of India to pump in required currency into the system.The outlook for agriculture sector growth this fiscal year is optimistic which will help keep food prices in check and will also support overall growth, said Harshavardhan Neotia, President, FICCI. Others feel the situation is likely to remain same for the next month, especially with disturbance in global oil prices. ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar pointed out that rising global commodity prices and a waning of the base effect would push up WPI in December.Commerce Ministry data in October showed prices of pulses continued to rule high in the wholesale market. The decision of the RBI to retain the existing interest rates was on the belief that the demonetisation could lower prices of perishables and reduce CPI inflation by 10-15 basis points by December."

Many denizens in the city wrap themselves in their woollens and head to the Old City. The delicious gourmet itinerary, of course, leads them to the bowlfuls of nalli nihari, paaya, marag, and kaleji gurda washed down with piping hot Irani Chai.What is common about these comfort winter food items is that they are all made from juicy mutton/beef chunks or succulent chicken. But what about those who, by choice or not by choice, are hard-core vegetarians? Do they have a choice? Well, if you are a vegetarian and want to beat the winter chills we bring to you the list of delights that are prepared only with veg ingredients and keep you equally warm as would a liver pie do. Read on to mark the same in your winter bucket list:Classic Cheese LasagnaThis one dish can never fail you. Thick cheese layered with lasagna sheets and a whole gamut of other finger-licking ingredients like cherry tomatoes, button mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers and, of course, marble onions. What actually keeps you warm is the use of basil and oregano - the herbs known for their unique warmth-providing properties. A dig into the sinful layers and you feel comforted immediately - the rich taste stays with you till you head to bed. Recommended places: 10D, Deli9 and Autumn Leaf Cafe.Date palm halwaRich in nutrients and a handful of these desert fruits ensures that your energy levels remain high during the day. Sweet in itself, the fruit when cooked, doesnt need any sugar in it. Preparation of halwa just needs a box of fresh juicy date palms de-seeded and cooked on slow flame in milk. The result is a smooth mixture dark like winter night itself. A few spoonfuls with a glass of milk provides warmth enough to beat the chill.Mewa laddooWell, ask your grandmother and shell tell you the tales of mortal and pestle crushing those ochre coloured nuts into a granular powder that would be mixed with sugar, some ghee and translucent chunks of fried edible gum. The result - globules of warmth. Have two of these laddoos in the morning and you are set to take off your jacket even if the weathermans chill wind prediction comes true. Almond House is the best place to get a boxful.Beetroot RisottoFaint scarlet with that mix of fresh herbs - this is a must-try. The richness of seasonal vegetables paired with goat cheese makes this dish winter essential bringing to you the feel of balmy Italian afternoons. You can relish beetroot risotto at Tuscany, Trident Hyderabad with champagne or white wine. Shares chef Manik, Such foods are real comforters even if they are prepared with vegetables. Our bodies respond wonderfully to the produce of the season."

Curated by Goan chef Anthony DSouza, the promotion has much to offer when it comes to authentic Goan delights. Charges: `1,400 all inclusive.At the promotion we saw clay pots simmering on stoves arranged on live counters while the aroma of food wafted all around. Goan cooking is varied with its use of fresh catch such as crabs, prawns, variety of fish, chicken, mutton and ingredients like vinegar, wine and, of course, the ubiquitous coconut. Many people think that its just the Portuguese that influenced the Goan cuisine, while the same has been influenced by Hindu cuisine as well, thats how you get to eat dishes like Dal Varan, the mild dal cooked on medium heat is relished best when combined with steamed rice. We tried it with Channacho Ross - a dish of chickpeas done in light gravy. We liked Fish Peri Peri done with Vinegar, garam masala and Kashmiri mirch. Chicken Xacutti and Beef Chilli Fry were equally good. However, the most-loved dish of the day was Bolinhas De Bata - a round fried delight. It was the mixture of mashed potatoes, onions, green chillies and cheese. It was wrapped in rawa and fried. The taste was excellent thanks to the use of cheese. The kokum served along the food had mix of garlic which not many people can take. We rounded the lunch off with Bebinca, a dessert of flour, eggs painstakingly made."

Five of us have to divide the money. We get the notes exchanged at kirana shops at a commission, he added. Ramulu, nor the other four who work with him, have a bank account. Meanwhile, the kirana shop owners denied charging a commission for changing the Rs 2,000 notes brought to them by labourers. The labourers were reluctant to point out the shop keepers who took the commission. They will not change our notes, said Laxman.The labourers are hired in clusters, explains S Pandu an onion dealer. We hire four to five of them for a day and pay all them by the evening with Rs 2,000. Its up to the labourers to figure out a way to break the big notes into small ones, he added. While we can pay them in cheque, the workers themselves prefer to be paid on the same day itself. Most of them dont even have a bank account, he said.SubhedThe Onion Traders Association had declared a ten day bandh following the announcement of demonetisation which ended on Nov 24. For the interim period, the Telanagana State Agricultural Marketing Committee (AMC), under the directions of Harish Rao, minister for irrigation, directly supplied onions in the city. The AMC too had left the labourers in the lurch paying the daily wages with old notes. The officials now insist the traders to the pay the labourers through cheques.I need the money to meet daily expenses. The cheque takes time, says Laxman, another daily wage labourer. He has a zero balance account opened under the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana at his home town in Mahabubnagar. But he does not know how to operate it.

You wont be able to trace the minces of meat in the kebab.The perfectly grilled tandoori jhinga was bursting with rich and exotic feel. The marinated tandoori paste on the prawns adds to the bland big pieces of prawns.The Hare Moong Ki Galouti is a vegetarians delight. Made of moong dal, the delicacy just melts in your mouth. The name itself suggest that it is gala hua.For the main course, koftas are served with some steamed rice or Indian breads and dal makhni. The pudina paratha on the menu comes highly recommended. The koftas include nadru kofta, palak kofta, alubukhara kofta, mahi kofta, murgh phaldari kofta and kofte ka surkh salan.The palak anjeer kofta had a creamy texture. Bathed in a rich and thick consistent gravy, the kofta has a coating of anjeer, which gives a mild sweet taste. You get the milky taste of the curry and perhaps that subsides the bitter taste of the spinach.The non-vegetarians may like kofte ka surkh salan more than the vegetarian counterpart. The mutton kofta in the red gravy was like meatballs with flavour in every bite.All the kebabs and koftas were layered with oil drippings. The koftas have a layer of cream that gives it a tempting appeal.So, embark on a culinary journey till October 2 from 12 pm to 3:30 pm and 7 pm to 11:30 pm."

I catch the delicate smell of boiled chana, sprinkled with coconut, and the sweet smell of rava (semolina) fried in ghee.Chef Gaurav Bathla, sous chef, says that he has tried to put one dish from every corner of the state into the buffet.Our meal starts with Kalu Palya, made of black chana. Lightly fried with onion and freshly grated coconut, the boiled-chana appetiser is a perfect way to start gorging on Kannada cuisine.Palyas such as Sabske Soppin Peda, dill leaves cooked with toor dal, and Balekayi Palya, raw banana shallow fried, is paired well with chapatti. Both the dishes  one mildly bitter and the other a little tangy  are something that most Kannadigas have grown up eating.The chef says that he got the recipes from Kannadiga friends. I learnt them from my friends mothers and grannies, who make these dishes regularly at home, he says. Little wonder then, that the fine-dining restaurant reminded me of my home kitchen.Chicken Curry is strictly for those who enjoy a spicy meal. The strong spices and the soft meat make it a must-have. To balance out the hotness, have it with roti.Mangaloreon Prawn Curry, with coconut, tamarind and red chillies, and Pandi Curry, pork cooked in tamarind water and spiced with pepper, are for people who like medium spiciness. Both the dishes are easy to bite into and melt in the mouth. Rice goes best with prawn curry and pork with roti.Mandya Mutton Curry, with ghee and coconut, is a bit bland for my taste but otherwise is a good dish to try.Vangi Bath, rice cooked with brinjal, tamarind and spices, is sweet, sour and spicy. All good here.Desserts such as Dharwad Mishra Peda, Rava Unde (laddoos made from semolina lightly fried with ghee), Ante Unde (made from different dry fruits) made for a perfect closing."

On Thursday, along with Marketing Director Laxmi Bai, he visited Malakpet wholesale market and inspected the onion market transactions.He met the traders and commission agents of the market. The Secretary said the onion farmers produce was collected from their farm and transported to the market. Later, the produce is procured by the Marketing department at a reasonable price of `8 per kg and the same will be sold to consumers at Rs 10 per kg through Rythu bazaars.Parthasarathi said the government considered the interests of both the farmers and the consumers. The Secretary has instructed the marketing department officials to speak to local traders and commission agents and keep the agriculture market committees (AMC) open so that the transactions are done as usual.The Agriculture Secretary also instructed the officials concerned to pay the farmers through cheque, online transfer, Real-time gross settlement (RGTS) after the transaction. He said the onion production was noted more in Jogulambha and Wanaparthy districts.In August and September 2015 onion seeds were distributed to farmers at 75 per cent subsidy which led to onions being planted on 9,000 acres. As a result, there was no major shortage of onions in the state, he said. He said that the market price for onion has gone down due to the supply of stock from Maharashtra."

My love for travelling has not only helped me explore new places but also gives me the opportunity to meet people from different cultures, try out food from different cuisines and get acquainted with exotic ingredients. These special ingredients are great to play around  as they test ones creativity, they also lead to some experimentation with unique and innovative recipes. Two ingredients which I really enjoy cooking with are John Dory also known as St Pierre or Peters Fish and the black truffle, popularly known as the black diamond of kitchen.I believe it takes a great understanding of gastronomy and palate along with little creativity to bring forth some delectable recipes. One such recipe, which is really close to my heart is Pan-seared John Dory with Black Truffle and Sweet Potato Mash along with Martini Veloute, Red Wine Sauce and Buttered Vegetables.This dish is very simple, yet an intricate amalgamation of unique flavours bringing together the mild taste and texture of the fish with one of the rare ingredients in the world  black truffle. This unusual fish needs to be cooked in a hot pan, basted with butter and thyme. For the mashed potatoes, you need to boil the sweet potatoes in milk and then mash them into a smooth paste with a few dollops of butter and shaved truffle. Season it with some salt and pepper according to your liking. Stir fry seasonal vegetables with butter and plate them along with Martini Veloute and red wine sauce. For making the Martini Veloute, all you need to do is reduce vermouth with sweet onion and cream. The red wine sauce is no rocket science, just a de-glazed pan with red wine. Surprisingly, it adds an exquisite taste to the dish and goes very well with the texture of the fish.Both these ingredients are unique in their own territory and this dish brings together the mild taste and unique texture of John Dory along with the flavour of the rarest ingredient in the world  black truffle.Ramasamy Selvaraju, Executive Chef, Vivanta by Taj"

The North East monsoon has arrived but is weak. This Rabi, between October 1 and November 14 (Monday), we were supposed to receive 161.3 mm rainfall of which we received only 33.5 mm. This is close to 80 per cent deficit, he saidIt may be recalled that normal rainfall from June to September end is 735 mm, while the state got only 599 mm. With North East rainfall too being less, there will be dry days ahead.This year, the situation looks bleak. Last year, we had identified 136 drought hit taluks and this year there are 139 taluks, said a statistical officer from the Revenue Department.Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said farmers will face bad days this time.

Thats how we have Moplah Food Festival happening at Aish, The Park which will be on till November 20.So what exactly is the new fetish about Moplah food? Its a region of North Kerala dominated by Muslim population who trace their roots to the Arabs as the latter came to the region for the trade of spices and silk. Talk about spices and the same reflects in the cuisine. Chef Abida Rasheed speaks amiably dropping abundant portions on our plates asking the stewards to bring more warm food. There was not command in her tone but affection that reflects in the dishes she so lovingly cooks. We enjoyed eating Mutton Ishtew that had the desired consistency, neither gooey nor sticky  just the right thickness that you can relish with Kerala Parota. The potatoes were succulent and dissolved with the curry, the mutton pieces were juicy and soft. The green coriander leaves just added the ghar ka khana bit. Food needs to be cooked in clay pots as the same give breathing space to your food which keeps your food fresh for a longer time, said the chef.Its not just clay pots that do the wonder, the use of ghee gives the food its own deliciously different taste thats how the mutton biryani she cooked turned out to be really different from what we eat in Hyderabad, Calcutta or Lucknow. The rice used wasnt the long-grained biryani rice, instead the grains were smaller and better known as Khaima rice. She describes, Earlier this rice used to grow in valleys and as the wind blew the crop became more fragrant. It cooks really well giving the biryani its unique texture.We relished Kozhi Nirachathu, pot roasted chicken with deep-fried onion gravy that had that subtle sweet flavour. Begum Abida added, We use spring chickens that dont weigh more than 400 gms. The bones of these chickens give that special flavour and taste to the curry.And not just these dishes there are a variety to be relished such as: Meen Porichattu, Vada with thenga manga chutney, Kadala Kari, Parupu Kari and more. It was the dessert which amazed us. The egg yolk and white had been separated and cooked differently. The egg white was steamed with sugar, while the yolk was whisked and dropped in loops in hot boiling sugar syrup which gave it noodle like shape and consistency. It was topped on the sweet steamed white. Any guesses for the name? Its that famous Mutta Mala people associated Moplah cuisine with.Price: `999 all inclusive for lunch and `1,495 all inclusive for dinner."

We have to pay the truck freight charges, pay the farmers and labourers their daily wages, says Kranti. The traders on a daily basis make an average payment of `20,000-`70,000 per truck.Most of us here deal with a minimum of three truck loads a day. With the banks giving us just `10,000 for a week, how do they expect us to do any business? Kranti added.Marketing minister T Harish Rao had warned the onion dealers not to create an artificial scarcity. He has directed the marketing departments to procure onions directly from the farmers and bring them to Malakpet and Rythu Bazars.On Wednesday, three days after the strike began, the largest onion market in Telangana wore a deserted look with very few shops open. And the few shops that were open do little business.Who is buying? Yes there is demand for onions but who has money to pay for it? said another trader who did not wish to be named. Venting his anger on the government, he said, The government clearly hasnt thought this through, he added.I am not sure how the state government is going to bring onions directly to the markets, said Paresh K, an onion trader. Most of the farmers deal only in cash as a vast majority of them dont have bank accounts, he added.The onion dealers are of the opinion that since the market they operate out of is government owned, the state should accept the exchange of the banned notes. The farmers too are not ready to sell. They accept only cash and do not trust online banking. I am ready to pay them right now but they are not willing, Paresh said.Attempts to get in touch with officials from marketing department proved to be futile."

He referred to the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 following years of racial inequity, adding: ""We are running on inclusiveness, optimism and hope, and that will translate into a progressive presidency on issues of diversity and inclusion.""As Obama prepares to leave the White House, America is increasingly, and in the estimation of many, irreparably divided by race, class and religion. What Republican candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign has done is to make targeting people of a different skin color not just acceptable, but chic.The devastating effects could linger awhile, even if he loses. In New York, which like California, was once considered a bastion of pluralism, Mexican school students have been told to ""go home"". In Georgia a militia of gun owners prepare to withstand the anticipated onslaught on their way of life should Hillary Clinton become president. The group welcomes immigrants, but only from Europe.The possibility of Donald Trump becoming the next US president is dire enough to have sent many to psychiatrists. Other Americans have contemplated moving to Canada or New Zealand.The unspoken apprehension of impending doom seems pervasive among all but the faithful. In Chicago, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev was asked as to how Americans should deal with the voter's moral dilemma in the most contentious presidential campaign in recent American history. His answer was that what the country needed was a considered vote, not a ""committed"" one.Bertrand Russell once said that one of the problems in the world is that fools and fanatics are so sure of themselves while the wise are full of doubt. Like the far right elsewhere, Indian Americans supporting Trump are absolute -- both in their certitude and their manifestations of ferocious piety.At the Hindus for Trump event organized in New Jersey recently, Bollywood actress Malaika Arora revved up the audience before Trump made his appearance to declare that ""I am a big fan of Hindu"". By many accounts, well over 90 percent of the three million Indian Americans are anti-Trump. (Indians like many immigrants tend to vote for the Democrats.)Hindu Americans appeared to gravitate to Trump for his relentless anti-Muslim rhetoric and his professed admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the euphoria of a new found savior, history was the first casualty. New Jersey is no stranger to bigotry. As recently as the early 1990s, the state was infamous for the dot busters', gangs which targeted bindi' wearing Hindu women. In the post 9/11 America, there have been also instances of Hindus and Sikhs being targeted because they were perceived as being Muslims. How would Donald Trump isolate Muslims while preventing the targeting of other South Asians? Neither the organizers nor the audience appeared perturbed by such subtleties.Analysts have said that with Donald Trump, the Republicans -- the party of Abraham Lincoln -- has become one for those without college degrees. Like right-wing politicians in Europe and elsewhere, he has tapped into the fear of free trade and immigration among blue collar workers in parts of America known as the rust belt.He has obliterated election traditions -- not releasing his tax returns and even refusing to accept the election results unless he is declared the victor.At his campaign events, journalists are corralled and the audience encouraged to boo at them. This has reinforced Trump's image as a martyr against the establishment and the rigged' media.Trump has become such an effective parody of himself that the staff of the satirical magazine The Onion found themselves creatively bankrupt trying to caricature him.Trump's affairs of the heart are famously ephemeral. It was not long ago when, railing against outsourcing of American jobs, he put on a fake Indian accent to mimic a call center worker.Indian Americans basking in his affection today may discover rather quickly that Trump's infatuation can shift in a heartbeat. And it was Napoleon Bonaparte who warned that one who knows how to flatter is equally adept at slander."

""They said: 'Get out of here!'""Running uphill with the rest of his neighbors, Pascual heard the disaster before he saw it.""It was the noise of a runaway train. Then we looked at what was coming,"" he said. ""It was the color of the clay. There wasn't even water, just clay coming and this strong wind.""The sliding wall of mud tore apart or submerged orchards, houses, roads, cars, animals, trees.""It was like the end of the world,"" Pascual said. ""The lights went out.""- Neck deep in mud -Pascual and his wife, whose 12 children live in other towns, were safe and their small house and plot of land, located on a slight rise, were spared.But Paracatu was finished. A year later mud still clogs the main street. Mud sits heaped in roofless houses. Mud stains walls of the ruined church.Pascual is hardly the quitting type, recounting how he waded back home through the mud to retrieve his wife's forgotten documents. ""It was up to here,"" he said, pointing to his neck.Even today, he tends his crops of manioc, onion, tomato and maize. Ever resourceful, he has grown his own tobacco for cigarettes that he rolls in dried maize leafs.Yet the clock is running down.Samarco says it will build a new Paracatu in a different location, with each inhabitant receiving a house equal to the one that was lost. A majority of residents have agreed to take the deal, although it means abandoning their ancestral home -- and Pascual is with them.His house and crops may be intact, but too much else has been spoiled.The river where he used to fish now runs red with mining waste. His two best cows were killed and so his production of round, white cheeses depends on two skinny survivors that he herds around the ruins. Income is down 75 percent.Samarco says it could take until March 2019 before the new Paracatu is built.In the meantime, Pascual tends the farm alone, making a journey of about an hour on weekends to see his wife. It's a lonely, sometimes spooky existence.""Sometimes I spend the whole night awake. Any noise will wake me,"" he says.And even if he could somehow hang on in the village, community life was always about more than mere survival.""We've ended up without a bar where you can go to get a drink, just a tiny drink,"" he said mournfully.""Yes, I want to leave."""

They include Phoenician stelae and rare medieval Christian mummies along with the anthropoid coffins, which display a human face on the sarcophogus and were long a standard for the elite.Some of the items have never before been on public display.Other pieces have not been shown since the 1970s, when the museum was forced to shut down because it sat on the frontline that ran through the city during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.""This is a lesson in courage and hope because 41 years after the museum was closed in 1975, we today are able to receive visitors on three floors,"" says museum director Anne-Marie Maila Afeiche.The archaeological museum was renovated after the years of fighting and shelling damaged its building and exhibits, and reopened in the 1990s.But the current exhibit is the first time its basement has been open since the civil war.Among the treasures of often-breathtaking beauty is a fragment of a Roman sarcophagus found in Beirut that depicts the myth of Icarus, who is shown alongside his father Daedalus, making his ill-fated wings.Another gem is an extraordinary hypogeum -- an underground tomb -- accidentally discovered by a farmer in the Tyre region in 1937.It is covered with restored frescoes inspired by Greek mythology, including a scene of Priam on bended knee begging Achilles to return the body of Hector.- 'Belongs to humanity' -""It was essential to show the public this heritage, which belongs to Lebanon and humanity, that was lying in our storage,"" said Afeiche.All of the exhibits on display in the museum were excavated across Lebanon, which is rich with historical sites and artifacts.They include a premolar from 70,000 BC belonging to the first known example of a homo sapiens in Lebanon, and stretch through to an 1830 Ottoman stele adorned with a turban.Among the collection's flagship displays is a series of Phoenician sarcophagi dating from between the sixth and fourth century BC that were found in the southern region of Sidon.""We're exhibiting 31 of these sarcophagi at the moment,"" which mix Greek and Egyptian styles, said Afeiche, noting that some of the sarcophagi found in Sidon are currently displayed in the Louvre.This is ""the largest collection of anthropoid sarcophagi in the world,"" she added.But perhaps the most striking part of the exhibit is the unprecedented display of three mummies found in 1989 by cavers in the Qadisha Valley.The area is a UNESCO World Heritage site and its cave-pocked sheer rock faces provided refuge for Maronite Christians persecuted during the Mamluk and Byzantine eras.""They were discovered in a cave along with eight naturally mummified bodies"" wearing the clothes of of women and children, in some cases the 13th-century silk embroidery still intact.- More treasures to display -Around them were nuts, onion skins, ceramics, bronze tools and documents written in Arabic and Syriac.""They were psalms and liturgical chants that showed that these were Christians who had taken refuge in this cave,"" said Afeiche.The three mummified bodies are particularly rare as Lebanon does not have a tradition of mummification, according to Marco Samadelli, director of the EURAC centre in Italy, who offered his expertise to help conserve the unique mummies.Italy contributed 1.02 million euros ($1.1 million) to the project of restoring the museum's basement and collection, along with the expertise of leading archeologists including Antonio Giannarusti.Even with the basement now open, the museum's storage areas contain plenty of undisplayed pieces and the culture ministry has plans for a new history museum in Beirut as well as museums in both Sidon and Tyre.The new exhibition provides a timeline of burial techniques, from a 6000 BC Neolithic cradle tomb to a 4BC Chalcolithic burial jar found in Byblos.Phoenician urns holding cremated remains are exhibited alongside a Byzantine-era tomb decorated with the face of the Virgin Mary from 440 AD.""We believe this is the oldest representation of the Virgin discovered to date in Lebanon,"" said Afeiche.The largest is the hypogeum from Tyre, with frescos reminiscent of Pompeii. One of its sides features an inscription: ""Be brave, no one is immortal."""

Migrant workers at one of the several open grounds in Little India.Nazrul, Nazrul! The tiny room erupts with the demand for a song by the late Bengali poet and musician. Lets sing a Nazrul! Lets sing his Pechhon theke daaka (A call from behind)!AKM Mohsin, editor and publisher of Banglar Kantha, looks up from a pile of papers on his desk and at the group of young men playing music. A smile plays on his lips. The men, Bangladeshi migrant workers in Singapore, have gathered in Mohsins office for their weekend music session. After a week of gruelling work, this is their spot of entertainment.Mohsins office in Little India, from where the 52-year-old brings out the Bengali bi-monthly newsletter, is a place of refuge and recreation for many Bangladeshi migrant workers in Singapore, who are adrift in an alien land. They pick up the harmonium and flute that Mohsin keeps in his office, and soak in the nostalgia, memories of home and a family left behind. For those few hours, this tiny space becomes home to those forced by economic compulsions to live away from their homeland, sometimes for years.In the 1980s, Singapore opened its doors to foreign workers. It had been two decades since its separation from Malaysia. With its focus on infrastructure development, it attracted unskilled and semi-skilled labour from a number of countries across Asia. The economic opportunities in the city-state continue to provide jobs in the construction, manufacturing and shipping industries. There are over three lakh foreign workers in the construction sector alone. Indians, chiefly Tamilians, and Bangladeshis form a dominant part of this important but invisible workforce.Most of the workers do 12-hour shifts for six days a week and live in dormitories, each room shared by four to eight workers. With very few spaces for recreation in the expensive country, a large number of them visit Little India on weekends. The neighbourhood, informally divided into a Bangladeshi side and an Indian side, is home to a large number of establishments and eateries that cater to people from the Indian subcontinent. There is Saravana Bhavan for those missing their adhais and rava kesari as well as Kailash Parbat with its chaat and north Indian cuisine. Shops sell yam and tiny sambar onions, as well as vegetables and spices from home. Saris, lungis, chappals or gold jewellery  you can find almost anything from the subcontinent in the lanes, where the market spills on to the streets, as it would back home.AKM Mohsin, the editor of the Bengali newsletter Banglar Kantha AKM Mohsin, the editor of the Bengali newsletter Banglar KanthaOn weekends, the streets of Little India teem with people, much to the displeasure of the authorities, which ensure heavy patrolling and police presence. There is a perception among locals that when off work, the Bangladeshis womanise and the Indian boys like to get drunk and riot, says Christine Pelly, a volunteer with the NGO Transcient Workers Count Too (TWC2), which addresses issues faced by migrant workers in Singapore.The perception Pelly speaks of is rooted in a December 2013 incident in Little India when a riot broke out after an inebriated Indian worker died under the wheels of a private bus. According to the records, 27 people were injured and 40 arrested.While the official version of the events has been questioned several times over the last three years, albeit in hushed tones, the consequences have been long term. Drinking was banned in all public places from 10.30 pm to 7am. Retail shops were not allowed to sell takeaway alcohol in that period. Stricter rules apply in the neighbourhoods of Little India and Geylang, known for its red-light district. There has been a concentrated effort to build self-contained dormitories and recreation centres outside Little India in order to discourage migrant workers from collecting there, especially on weekends and other holidays.The violence also forged a stereotype about the boys of Little India that has been tough to shake off. That had played on Sri Rams mind two years ago when he launched Thanjai CC, a new league-level team in Singapores burgeoning cricket scene. The team largely comprises Indian migrant workers from the low-wage sector. Santhosh Nickson, the teams captain, speaking on behalf of Sri Ram, who also owns the franchise of Saravana Bhavan in Singapore, says the only idea wasnt to counter a bias. These boys leave home and come here to work. But everyone needs a respite, and a sense of home away from home, in order to continue. And cricket is a passion for most Indians, he says.That passion is evident at the open ground in Jurong East New Towns Pandan Gardens neighbourhood. From sunrise to sunset on weekends, it turns into a bustling cricket ground. Today, Thanjai CC is scheduled to play Ceylon Sports Club, but the morning match between two other teams is still on. As on most Sundays, TS Muruga is the first to arrive. He seats himself on a plastic chair a few metres away from the ground. His impatient eyes follow the game, a cigarette dangling from his lips.Even before he set foot in Singapore in 2015, Muruga had heard of the thriving cricket scene there. A number of his friends and distant relatives, neighbours from Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu who were employed in the country, would talk about their weekends spent on cricket grounds. Muruga would hear their stories and sulk. I used to play district-level cricket in India but gave it up when financial conditions at home forced me to move to Chennai for work, recounts the 24-year-old.At the time, he had been continuing his diploma in electrical engineering too, but dropped out after his sister committed suicide. Everything changed at home, and I decided to take up a job in the electrical department of a construction company in Singapore, he says. Initially, the change in food and environment made Muruga homesick. I still miss home but cricket makes me look forward to weekends after working like a robot through the week.Thanjai CC is a part of Singapore Cricket Association governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Its success has since inspired several other teams to look for talent among migrant workers, many of whom spend weekends playing cricket matches with tennis balls in the open grounds across Singapore or in their dormitories.Cricket holds no charm for Panneer Selvam Parthiban, 23, who followed his father to join the migrant work force in Singapore. In January this year, he injured himself at work after his supervisor insisted he use a metal-cutter to cut wood. The blade slashed his wrist, leading to permanent damage.He not only lost his job but also received a paltry amount as compensation from his employer. He took his case to Singapores Ministry of Manpower (MoM), which has swapped his work permit for a Special Pass, meant for those who are in dispute with their employers or are injured. According to the rules set by the MoM, a person with the pass cannot work or return to his home country until the case is resolved.With too much time on his hands and little to keep him from worrying about where his next meal will come from, Parthiban bought himself a sketchbook and a few pencils to pursue his hobby: art.It was a collection of portraits he drew in those months of unemployment that Singapore-based artists Biddy Low and Clayton Hundall came across on Facebook. The images had been hosted on TWC2s Facebook page by a volunteer (Parthiban came in touch with the NGO through the free meal programme it runs in Little India).While Hundall took Parthiban under his wings to help hone his raw talent, for Low, Parthibans case offers an opportunity to give back to the unequal society she inhabits. Every year, hundreds of cases like Parthibans are reported to the MoM. Low, who was once a volunteer with an NGO that works for migrant workers, realises that little has changed in the last decade, that the exploitation of the workers continues.Her concerns find voice in the experiences narrated by Parthibans father, Panner Selvam, who recounts his early years in Singapore, living in shipment containers on construction sites in the 1990s. While the 2013 violence resulted in curbs, it changed things for the better on one front: the government brought in laws that has improved housing for migrant workers like him. My company moved us all into a dormitory, which offers facilities like a gym, playground and a common kitchen, says the 57-year-old.Alex Au, one of the most prominent activists of migrant worker rights, argues that the diktat for improving the dormitories is driven more by the intention of keeping workers off streets. These dorms provide everything under one roof so that it discourages workers from stepping out, he says. They dont need to go anywhere. This isnt a prison but they have to be kept under control, says V Ranjan, a senior manager at the Tuas View dormitory.Unlike his son, Selvam didnt find any need for recreation. Instead, he opted to work seven days a week so he could make enough money to support Parthibans education in an English medium school, which he feels has gone waste after his son dropped out of an engineering diploma programme. All I ever look forward to is speaking every night with my wife, children and two granddaughters. I dont get sleep the day I cant do that, he says.Singapore also has a large population of domestic workers, largely women, from countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Myanmar, among others. A shared loneliness and the lack of emotional support system in a foreign land often leads to friendships that cut across religion, language and cultures. Not all of them stand the test of time, what with the uncertainty over renewing work passes and the constant financial strain.Hossain Mahabub, from Bangladesh, and Murtikah, from Indonesia, are an exception. The couple met a decade ago at the restaurant where the former used to work. Murtikah, a 32-year-old domestic worker, was working for a family living nearby. For a month, Mahabub did nothing but notice her come and go. One day, he gathered courage and handed her a chit with his number written on it. A few weeks later, she called. The two have been dating since and hope to get married soon. She has been my pillar of strength in difficult times. A few years ago, I moved to Dubai but she trusted me to return and waited. She could have found a higher paying job in Taiwan or other such countries, but chose to stay back to be with me, says Mahabub, 37.Murtikah adds that their parents know of their relationship and have no objections. But the law in Singapore doesnt allow us to marry here and stay together. Nor have we met each others families because during the course of employment, we cant go back. Our employers keep our passports with them, she says.Those employed in the construction industry in India and Bangladesh are largely educated, often graduates or diploma holders. What compels them to live in exile are the lack of opportunities back home and the promise of a salary higher than they would earn even if they put their education to use. While Singapore doesnt have a minimum wage system, most low-wage workers join at USD 25-35 a day.Its the promise that led Sameer Bhattacharya to leave his village near Dhaka and take up a plumbing job with an engineering outfit in Singapore. He was offered SGD 1,200 a month but realised after joining that the pay was based on a daily-wage system. Typically, Bhattacharya does not have work on more than two days a week. With no more than SGD 150 in his pocket every month, he struggles to survive, even as the interest on the loan he took by mortgaging his land back home, piles up.In such difficult times, music provides the much-needed respite. Even when he is not seeking help or advice from Mohsin, who works for the welfare of Bangladeshi migrants pro bono, he comes and spend hours in his office with others like him.The newsletter, Banglar Kantha, offers a platform to the literary talent of many migrant workers, whose poetry it publishes. What began as a hobby evolved into a cultural movement after some Singaporean artistes recognised the talent and introduced an annual poetry festival for migrant workers. Encouraged by the response, several poets have published their work. Rajib Shil Jibon, 30, for example, finds time between his 12-hour shifts at the construction site to not only write poetry but also study. He recently graduated in mechanical engineering from the University of South Australia through a distance-learning course.For a large part, though, most of the workers dont look at Singapore as home. Some of us make friends, build a parallel life through activities like music and poetry but this is a foreign land that will never accept us as residents. So, I will wait till I can make enough money to repay my loan and build a house for my parents. Once that happens, I will return home, says Jibon.The light outside Mohsins office has changed from bright yellow to orange and then deep blue but the music hasnt stopped. Having exhausted the list of songs they had drawn up before upon everyones request, they once more call out for suggestions: What song do we sing next? Mohsin says, Why dont you sing Rabindranath Tagores Shudhu jawa asha (These comings and goings)? Its quite apt.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
58fed8067be9e0420db2822d,Erratic rain hits veggie prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/odisha/story_97421.jsp,2016-07-19,,Telegraph,"Bhubaneswar, July 18: Customers are moving around in market places with long faces. With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

A notice pasted on the closed entrance announces the ""complete and permanent closure"" of the dhaba that dates back to pre-Independence. The reason cited on the notice is ""physical inconveniences"" of the partners who have become ""senior citizens"" and ""non-availability of any of their next kin in the City"". The notice is dated June 28 and the closure, it mentions, became effective from 6am the day after. ""We are three brothers. I am 70 and the youngest among us is 64. We want to retire now,"" said Avtar Singh, the eldest. ""Our next generation has migrated to Canada. Those who are here do not want to join the business."" The family had two other dhabas. The Hindusthan Park one was rented out earlier this month .Another, in Bagha Jatin, is functional but Manjinder Singh, the youngest, says he sits there only for an hour in the morning. The closure of the Ballygunge Phari landmark came as a bolt from the blue for the 42 permanent employees and seven casual workers. ""We worked as usual till Monday (June 27). Tuesday is our weekly closure. On Wednesday, we found this notice on coming here,"" said Alok Debnath, who worked for 14 years as a table boy. Kanai Das, the biryani cook, still has his wallet and mobile phone locked inside. They have been offered settlement of their dues but they want their jobs back. Customers are surprised too. ""The Dhaba is one of the places we regularly order food from for our staff room. Who knew they were planning to shut down!"" wondered Neelanjana Dasgupta, a teacher of South Point School. She would miss her favourite Keema Stuffed Kulcha that came with a kebab of choice. ""I also used to pick up Sarson Ki Saag and Makki Di Roti sometimes for dinner."" Workers insist that footfall was not lacking. ""Daily sales would run upto a lakh or so and double on special occasions,"" claimed Gour Baidya, a waiter at the eatery since 1978. Top picks included Tandoori Chicken, Reshmi Kebab, Mutton Tikka Onion and Do Pyaza. ""No one makes tadka in south Calcutta like we do,"" said Manjinder, a claim enthusiastically echoed by the workers. ""Customers got our rolls packed for relatives before flying to Singapore or London,"" Manjinder added. The Dhaba counted several celebrities among its patrons. ""Orders came from Tollywood superstar Prosenjit's office across the road. Om Puri dropped by whenever he was in town. Suchitra Sen loved our roll and mentioned that in several interviews. There was a time when she would wait in the car for the delivery,"" said Manjinder. Among the other famous faces that dropped by over the years are former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farukh Abdullah, actor and columnist Victor Banerjee and Tolly heart-throb Dev. ""Victor Banerjee has had tea on our roof-top on several occasions. The restaurant was single-storeyed then,"" recalled Manjinder. The Dhaba was started by Sardar Gurbachan Singh, the father of the present owners, in the 1930s. ""He got a trade licence from the British in 1938 which still hangs inside the locked premises,"" said Manjinder. ""My father's bus driver friends used to complain of the lack of a tea stall on their route from Jadavpur to Esplanade."" Thus the place started as a tea shop which also sold milk. Gradually the benches in the single-storeyed structure gave way to tables and chairs and in the late 1970s, a floor was added. Air-conditioned seating was introduced about two decades ago. A Punjabi cuisine specialist, The Dhaba added rolls and then Chinese to its menu around 2001-02. Biryani and other north Indian dishes were added about 10 years ago. ""Our biryani was favoured for being less oily. In recent years, we innovated with Babycorn Roll and Diet Roll, which used rumali roti in place of paratha,"" said Manjinder. The Bagha Jatin Dhaba does not offer all this. ""People here care more for good food than good health,"" he said, from behind the counter on Sunday morning. The workers, who gather habitually at The Dhaba every day, feel that the Ballygunge restaurant will reopen in a different avatar. But the owners say they have not decided what to do with the property at such a prime location. For now, they have ""long vacations"" and ""trips to Punjab"" on their mind. Will you miss The Dhaba?

The satirical website The Onion captured the irony: Hillary Clinton Is Too Ambitious To Be The First Female President.That gets a laugh from Melanne Verveer, Clintons chief of staff as first lady.If a guy is described as ambitious, its a noble attribute, says Verveer. But if a woman is ambitious  its a pejorative.CHAMPION FOR WOMENHillary Rodham was already blazing a trail in 1969, the first student chosen to address a Wellesley commencement. She delighted classmates with a rebuke to the previous speaker, whose comments the grads found condescending to women.Its been a frustration to Clintons campaign that young Democrats havent responded more enthusiastically. Young people today  dont understand how much she shares those aspirations of theirs, Verveer says.A key moment in Clintons journey came in 1995, with her famous Beijing declaration: Human rights are womens rights, and womens rights are human rights.Yet her image as a champion for women has been complicated by her, well, complicated marriage  shes gotten both sympathy and blame for staying with her husband.ROBOTIC OR HUMAN?I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, Clinton offered recently.But those whove watched her up close say shes an excellent communicator; Friends always call her relaxed, funny, witty. Wellesley classmates say they cant understand the disconnect between public and private Hillary.At their 35th reunion, Nancy Herron performed a standup routine skewering Clinton  even her famous pantsuits.She sat there and just laughed her head off, says Herron. Afterward, she gave me a hug, and said, We need to take you on the road!'THE TRUTH ISSUEFair or not, dishonesty is a theme woven into the Clinton story. The most difficult thingHillary Clinton has to deal with right now is her difficult relationship with the truth, says Carl Bernstein, author of A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton.Writer Gail Sheehy attributes that difficulty to years of fending off attacks.You could call it denial, says Sheehy, author of Hillarys Choice. Its a defense mechanism she has used a great deal.The issue has never been more important. What the email mess shows, Bernstein says, is this fierce desire for privacy and secrecy that seems to cast a larger and larger shadow over who she really is.Who she really is. Theres that question again.Is it fair?Former Rep. Pat Schroeder thinks not. What more do you want to know? says the former congresswoman, who tested her own candidacy decades ago. Do they want some kind of a confession?Herron feels that we dont subject male candidates to the same scrutiny. We expect her to let her hair down, to talk about her failures and self-doubt or something, she says.You know what, shes not like that! Let her be who she is.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Prashant Mitra Don't want to go veggie shopping amid dust, heat and crowds? Just tap on an app. Two young Ranchi guys with BCA and MBA degrees under their belt from Manipal and Pune are back home to open a start-up selling vegetables and fruits at prices lower than retail markets. Friends from their days at DAV Public School, Hehal, Bariatu boys Ankit Kumar (25), a BCA from Manipal, and Aman Lal (24), an MBA from Pune, have teamed up to open Meri Sabzi, a vegetable shop with a difference, from June 20. The boys have provided three options for customers to order fruits and vegetables, through the portal www.merisabzi.com, an app called Merisabzi and a WhatsApp number 8351155455. Ankit, who worked as an event manager, and Aman, who was with a telecom company, came back home when the business bug bit them. ""We wanted to open something people needed everyday,"" said Ankit. ""Vegetables and fruits are a must, but busy young professionals, couples who have a packed day juggling many things or elderly people who don't want to depend on domestic help do face problems going to the market to buy the essentials."" ""Plus, the skyrocketing prices,"" chipped in Aman. ""From farm to wholesale to retail, prices keep inflating at every rung and the customer bears the full brunt of it. So, we wanted to put in place a seamless logistics, from farm to Meri Sabzi, to give our customers the best deal possible, eliminating middlemen."" The duo made their home delivery plunge after six months of planning. They took care of the software, built contacts with farmers on the outskirts of Ranchi in places like Bundu, Chanho Pithoria, Ormanjhi, Bedo, Nagri, hired delivery boys and opened up their Bariatu office. The efforts seem to have paid off. Thanks to their farm links, they have managed to deliver potatoes at Rs 15 per kg, onions at Rs 14, tomatoes at Rs 25, brinjal at Rs 22 and lady's finger at Rs 23 when the market rates are Rs 20, Rs 18, Rs 40, Rs 30 and Rs 30. In mornings, they delivery only vegetables from 6am to 9am. In the evening, they also deliver fruits and fresh veggies between 5pm and 8pm. Orders must be worth Rs 100 and above. If someone places an order worth Rs 250, he or she will get 5kg onions for Rs 50, the duo promise. The best part? Delivery is free of cost. So far the maximum orders are through WhatsApp, though the duo hope their own app also catches on. ""But our five delivery boys are busy all the time, which is important as we have just started out. We got 60 orders on Day One. We've come close to 100 orders in one day,"" said Ankit. ""We've got customers from Namkum, Hatia, Piska More, Booty More, Kanke Road, Bariatu, Morabadi, Ratu Road and many other places."" Their first customer, Bariatu homemaker Rachna Sahay, said she was thrilled when the fruits she had ordered, worth Rs 167, came smartly wrapped in plastic in a basket. ""It looked so neat and clean that I have kept ordering from them,"" she smiled. Do you know of any professional with a start-up? Tell [email protected]"
58feeb797be9e0420db296fa,"Idyllic setting, a life of ideals",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160706/jsp/bihar/story_95084.jsp,2016-07-06,,Telegraph,"Sachchidanand Sinha It is a beautiful evening, rain-filled and green. We drive past Muzaffarpur town onto a narrow road, pass groves of bananas, mangoes and lychees, vegetable patches of potatoes, cauliflowers, onions, fields of rice, sugarcane and grass. We cross a canal and suddenly came upon a lake. Its water is red from the setting sun. Birds are flying home. It is idyllic. I was driving to Manika Gaon in Mushari, the home of Sachchidanand Sinha, who is among the most important living socialist writers and thinkers in India. The road was good, the villages clean and orderly. If only every village in India could be like this, neat and fertile, its prosperity reflected not in ugly electricity-guzzling big malls and shopping complexes but on the branches of its trees and the crop in its fields! Sachchidanandji was waiting for me with Biju mangoes from his tree, soaking in a small bowl of water. We sat on a raised mud-platform outside his small home, surrounded by mango and guava trees and a flowering madhumalti bush. A tiny patch of wild grass divided us from the main village road, with small houses on both sides. ""Your father had come here during George's (Fernandes) election,"" he recalls. George's constituency was Muzaffarpur in Bihar though Bombay was his stomping ground as a trade union leader and Mangalore his place of birth. My father and George were close friends. George had hidden at our place during the Emergency dressed as a priest. At the time of his arrest, my father had gone to fetch Chinese food. Later both my parents had campaigned for George's election in Muzaffarpur, while George was in jail for the Baroda Dynamite Case. When George came to Calcutta after his release, he took us to eat ice-cream on Park Street. However, in good socialist tradition, I never called him Uncle. He was simply George. My father still goes to see a paralysed George in Delhi, even though they did not meet during the BJP-alliance years. Sachchidanandji too opposed the Emergency (Emergency in Perspective: Reprieve and Challenge, 1977), but the performance of the Janata regime disappointed him. He reflected on the subject in The Permanent Crisis: After Janata What? (1978), and left Delhi for Bihar in 1979, to live and explore socialist ideology. The 87-year-old lives on the bank of a huge lake in the middle of exotic flora and fauna, grows his own grain, greens, and fruits. He offers the Biju mango grown without any chemical fertiliser or pesticide with delight. He paints and photographs his surroundings, and has published a book on birds. As I suck the mango, I talk to him of Gandhian socialism. He explains: the ends don't justify the means; the means are the ends; the means we choose dictate the ends we get. As this has come down to us, it is popularly understood as non-violence. But it goes far deeper than that. We discuss how violence done to the earth normalises violence for us. In turn we are violent with each other without realising it. Violence to women is part of the culture of violence. Non-violence has to start from non-violence to earth. How can one be non-violent to the earth? We are not miners, we don't throw bombs, we don't throw chemical into rivers. His answer was, we have to be mindful consumers and mindful producers. Large-scale industrialisation has led to large-scale waste and the very rape of earth. We have to consume as little as necessary. At the same time, we have to choose our means of production carefully. The race for more has devastating environmental consequences. In fact, Sachchidanandji felt that the biggest issue for the socialist movement was environment and nature. Socialists needed to offer a different paradigm for development. Born in 1929, Sachchidanand Sinha joined the Quit India movement in 1942 as a Class 9 student and ended up with the socialist group of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and Kishan Patnaik. He was in the labour movement working as a khalasi (coolie) in Bombay, when Lohia read an article by him. He began working in Mankind; later participated in the JP Movement and has, ever since, contributed to the socialist movement as a writer and ideologue. In 1973, he wrote The Internal Colony: A Study in Regional Exploitation on Centre-state relations focussing on Bihar, the definitive Socialism and Power, The Bitter Harvest: Agriculture and Economic Crisis called for long-term planning and management of agriculture and environment and Chaos and Creation, a profound probing of the biological roots of art and creativity. He is able to transcend boundaries of disciplines and ideologies, but returns to socialism, again and again, because he finds in it the only hope for mankind. I wonder why. So many friends in my generation feel that Bihar is poor because socialism has called anarchy here. He smiles and says they don't see the changes in the everyday lives of ordinary people. They don't see the teenage girl cycling to school in a remote Bihar village who could not have stepped out from home a decade earlier or the change in the caste composition of the Bihar Assembly from the 1950s which was then dominated by Brahmins and Kayasthas. Today the majority is of Yadavs, Kurmis, Majhis, Paswans... ""The change may not be enough but a radical change is happening. Its biggest threat is the so-called development that is being imposed top-down. We are brainwashed into believing that destruction is 'development' by both the communist and capitalist thinkers. Look at the big industries and shopping complexes - do they give back to people as much as they consume or do they end up consuming people instead? ""Vera Zasulich wrote to Marx questioning his unilinear model of development focusing on industry. Capitalist countries in the west did the same thing. Waste, over-production and the use of technology to control the marginalised are the result of this model. The Gandhian model is more appropriate, not just for agrarian, non-industrialised societies like ours, but for the earth itself. We are hurtling towards disaster. Enough will never be enough, we will always want more."" But what about fascism? Is that not the biggest challenge for India? Sachchidanandji differs. ""Fascism cannot take root in India for two reasons: the diversity of our country and Gandhian thought. The BJP had to drop their call to remove Article 370 on Kashmir from the Indian Constitution. And Gandhian thought is in our blood now. It will be hard for any party to uproot our political and socially democratic values."" A man in a khadi dhoti waves from the village path across the grass patch. A woman appears on a scootie. The man jumps in on the back seat behind the woman as they drive away. ""That is the change,"" Sachchidanandji says as he waves back. ""She is driving. He took a lift. They are both farmers, going to sell their produce in the local village market.""  Ruchira Gupta is a feminist campaigner, writer, visiting professor at New York University, adviser to the UN, and founder of Indian anti-sex trafficking organisation Apne Aap Worldwide."

Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, May 26: The JMM and the Congress today launched blistering attacks on the BJP-led government that completed two years in power at the Centre. Leading the offensive, the state's principal Opposition party JMM called the Narendra Modi government a "" dholpitwa"" (one who beats his own drum), who had failed on every front - domestic as well as diplomatic - during the first two years in office. ""There is no control on the inflation, the price rise has severely hit the poor and middle class while bad loans have pushed the banks on the verge of collapse,"" said JMM working president Hemant Soren during a news meet at his Kanke Road residence in Ranchi today. ""Farmers in Maharashtra are forced to sell onion at throwaway prices; our relations with neighbouring countries like Nepal have deteriorated; but the BJP government has been busy making announcements and launching new projects over the past two years. It is a dholpitwa sarkar,"" Hemant added. The Congress today held a news conference and a rally to highlight the failures of the Modi government. AICC spokesperson Rita Bahuguna, who arrived here from Lucknow to lead the attack, said that the BJP government's achievements included only polarisation of masses on religious and communal lines and prosecution of students on the name of law and order. She also accused the BJP of protecting the interests of corporates, defaulters and fugitives like Vijay Malaya and Lalit Modi. ""The country had never faced such a bad situation... even essential commodities are out of poor people's reach. Fuel prices have dropped by 54 per cent in international markets, but the country has witnessed only 16 per cent decrease. Where has the rest of the money gone?' Bahuguna asked. While defaulters like Vijay Malya were allowed to safely escape the country, poor farmers were being harassed on the name of loan recovery. ""Modi had promised good days for farmers, but they are being forced to work as daily wage labourers. Water crisis and drought are forcing farmers to commit suicide in different parts of the country. But PM has no time to visit aggrieved people,"" she said. Around 1,000 Congress workers, led by former Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay and party spokesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo, took out a protest march from Albert Ekka Chowk to Raj Bhavan around noon. Later, a Congress delegation submitted a memorandum to governor Droupadi Murmu, pointing out failures of the Modi government in the Centre and the Raghubar Das government in the state. ""The Das government started with a bang, and within a year and half ended up in a whimper. The local residents' policy announced by the government has disappointed people,"" Sahay said. Rajya Sabha polls Senior JMM leader Hemant Soren today said that the party was considering fielding its own candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha poll. ""At this juncture, I can only say that the party may stake its claim on the seat. But a final decision will be taken by the party,"" said the Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly. Congress nominee Dhiraj Prasad Sahu has already expressed his wish to contest the Upper House seat for the second consecutive term. JMM has altogether 19 MLAs, Congress seven and JDU has two legislators, besides other smaller parties and Independents. One needs 28 first preference votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat in Jharkhand. It is still not clear whether the BJP will contest for only one seat or will go for both, the elections for which are scheduled for June 11."
58fef4507be9e0420db29fe0,"Airplane to toilet, Rajini fans on roll",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/nation/story_97514.jsp,2016-07-19,,Telegraph,"An Air Asia aircraft with an image of Rajinikanth from Kabali; the actor at the Sri Venkateswara Lotus Temple in Virginia (below) Chennai, July 18: An airline has painted some of its planes with images of the movie's hero. A district collector has offered free tickets of the film if villagers sign a form undertaking to build toilets at their homes. Even five-star hotels have caught the fever as Tamil superhero Rajinikanth's latest, Kabali, gears to release on Friday, July 22. Four top hotels in Bangalore will in a never-before initiative screen the film in their banquet halls, holding four shows a day for the first three days following its release. All this frenzy has scared some like Chennai's milk vendors. They have appealed to fans not to loot sachets from their booths to pour milk on the hero's cut-outs - a release-day ritual for movies featuring superstars that they fear might go out of hand this week. Enough to make onions cry, as a Rajinikanth joke might say. "" Kabali will set a record for a non-Hindi film. We expect it to do a gross business of Rs 400 crore worldwide,"" the film's producer S. Thanu said. Kabali, a Tamil film also dubbed in Telugu and Hindi, will release across 2,500 screens in India and another 1,500 in other countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Britain, Southeast Asia and West Asia. In America, it's being released across 445 screens, the highest ever for any south Indian movie. Air Asia, the film's airline partner, has painted two of its aircraft with Rajinikanth's visage from Kabali to attract low-cost fliers to its routes between Chennai, Bangalore and Southeast Asia. When Puducherry district collector P. Jawahar discovered that 447 of the 772 houses in Sellipet village lacked toilets, he came up with his Kabali incentive, drawing praise from lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi. Jawahar, who has since been transferred as local administration secretary, clarified that the incentive won't cost the taxpayer. ""I'm talking to two theatres to release 200 free tickets during the first week,"" he said. Chennai's milk vendors view Kabali as a grim disincentive, though. ""With every TV channel seeking its 'exclusive coverage', the fans will simply continue the paal abishekam (milk shower) throughout the day, causing losses for retail vendors and creating a shortage,"" state Milk Dealer's Welfare Association president A. Ponnusamy complained. In Bangalore, JW Marriott, Lalit Ashok, Royal Orchid and Crown Plaza will fit their banquet halls with the Dolby Atmos audio technology to screen the movie. ""It will be the first such venture in India,"" Anand G, director of Lahari Music who is behind the idea, told The Telegraph. ""Apart from some film festival shows, I don't know if any movie has ever released in five-star hotels anywhere in the world."" Each venue will accommodate 300 seats, and the tickets will cost Rs 1,300 each. Multiplexes in Bangalore, which ordinarily charge Rs 150-200 for a ticket, have raised the price to Rs 400-500 for Kabali. Rajinikanth, 65, himself has been away from it all, leaving the country after completing the shooting and the dubbing more than three months ago. His invisibility ended today, though, when his daughter Aishwaryaa R. Dhanush tweeted a picture of her father praying at the Sri Venkateswara Lotus Temple in the ashram of his guru, Swami Satchidananda, at Yogaville in the US state of Virginia. Rajinikanth is in America for medical treatment and is expected to watch the movie with a select audience in the US. Back home, his fans will be celebrating Kabali with more than the usual fervour since the last two Rajinikanth films had flopped miserably. Searching for a hit, Rajinikanth had picked new-age director Pa. Ranjith, whose last film Madras portrayed the street politics of north Chennai. Ranjith got Rajinikanth to play his age in his role of a don on a comeback trail after his enemies got him jailed for backing the cause of migrant Tamils in Malaysia. Nearly half the movie, which also features Radhika Apte and Taiwanese actor Winston Chao, was shot in Malaysia. Industry sources said that Ranjith, a Dalit, had woven in some dialogues criticising upper caste oppression but Rajinikanth had those scenes removed, arguing that none of his films ever carried caste overtones. Still, Dalit youths and outfits are holding up the song Neruppuda, Nerungudaa, Mudiyuma (I am fire, can you come near me) as an expression of their anger. The film's promoters, however, have pitched the song as an evocation of Rajinikanth's status as the unchallenged king of Tamil cinema. In Bangalore, his fans are gearing for the release with their customary charity work that has become a precursor to every Rajinikanth movie. ""We just completed three rounds of charity donations to orphanages, old-age homes and slums,"" said ""Rajini"" Murugan, president of Rajini Seva Samiti, a fan club. ""It's a great feeling that Kabali is receiving a response that even James Bond films don't,"" said Murugan, who has adopted for himself a shortened version of his favourite star's name as a mark of respect. Rajinikanth has a huge fan following in Bangalore, where he worked as a bus conductor before shifting base to Chennai when his film career took off in the early 1970s. In the run-up to the release, the Kerala-based non-banking finance company Muthoot Fincorp has rolled out Kabali silver coins weighing five to 20 grams and priced between Rs 300 and Rs 1,400. Merchandises like mugs and tees have been flying off the shelves for some weeks now. Chennai-based trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai explained the hype over the film. ""The producer and the distributors have made their money. It's now up to the theatre owners to see some brisk business,"" he said. ""A lot rides on Kabali because only eight among the 107 Tamil films released in the first six months of this year have been profitable."""
58fef7cc7be9e0420db2a57f,Guwahati control room to check prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160513/jsp/northeast/story_85311.jsp,2016-05-13,,Telegraph,"Guwahati, May 12: The Kamrup (metro) district administration today set up a control room to monitor and check price rise of essential commodities in the city. ""The control room has been set up at the deputy commissioner's office building here for the first time to effectively monitor the prices of essential commodities. Complaints can be made between 8am and 8pm on a given day at the landline phone number, 0361-2733052. An officer will be stationed at the room to address the complaints,"" Jamatul Islam, deputy director, food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, said. Officers will take immediate action on any complaint/information received in regard to anomalies or realisation of exorbitant prices by traders. ""A register on the complaints/information received will also be maintained,"" Islam said. A meeting chaired by state food and civil supplies commissioner here on May 6 had asked representatives of the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board, Fishfed, supply, agriculture and veterinary departments to take measures against price rise. A committee headed by additional deputy commissioner (supply) Esther Kathar was formed today to hold meetings at regular intervals to review and monitor the market prices of onions and potatoes, green vegetables and fish. The committee will also monitor and review the progress of the mobile vans of Fishfed and the agriculture marketing board from time to time. ""The district administration would do well to ensure that the monitoring and reviewing process remains throughout the year and not when there is an abnormality in the market,"" said a shopper in the Uzan Bazar market. Prices of pulses, onions, potatoes and poultry have over the past month or so spiralled prompting Dispur to take corrective measures. Prior to the May 6 meeting convened by the food and civil supplies department here, the Kamrup (metro) district administration on April 27 formed inspection teams to monitor the development. ""The trend has been brought to our notice and teams have been formed to inspect markets,"" Esther Kathar, additional deputy commissioner, Kamrup (metro), had told The Telegraph. The district administration on May 5 initiated a drive across the city to ensure that essential items were available in the markets at official rates. In an official statement, the administration said 10 teams of officials from the administration and the food and civil supplies department had started carrying out checks in the city's markets, both retail and wholesale. The administration had asked the traders to display the available stock for the day and the rates at which they were sold. The district administration today decided to provide more licenses to wholesale traders under the Assam Trade Articles (Licencing and Control) Order, 1982. Traders have been asked to submit their applications to obtain the licenses."
