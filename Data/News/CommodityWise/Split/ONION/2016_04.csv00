Koyambedu wholesale market, Chennais hub of perishable goods, gets nearly 550 loads of vegetables from neighbouring States daily.R. Jamuna, a resident of Nolambur, said: I am adding more green and seasonal vegetables to the menu. Until a few weeks ago, many vegetables, such as broad beans and carrots, were priced at over Rs.70 a kg.While retail traders in smaller markets are glad that more customers are visiting their shops, wholesalers in Koyambedu note that sales have not picked up much as other neighbouring places like Tiruttani get produce from local areas. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the prices have dropped by 10 per cent this winter compared to last year because of sufficient water in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Many retailers from other places such as Tindivanam, Sulurpet, Arakkonam, Puducherry and Chengalpet usually source vegetables from Koyambedu. They do not frequent market now as they get produce from local areas for the past few days, he said.Retailers like P. Sundarraj of MKB Nagar say there has been an increase in the number of customers by at least 40 per cent ever since the cost dropped a week ago. Many people are buying vegetables like carrots, beans, peas and broad beans as they are much cheaper now, he said. The prices may remain stable till March. Several vegetables such as cabbage, radish, onion and tomato are priced within Rs. 30 a kg after many months. Drumstick is perhaps among the few costly vegetables, sold for Rs.80 per kg."

The prices of shallots that hovered around Rs. 18 per kg last month came down suddenly to Rs. 8 in Dindigul on Monday.Regular arrivals from Theni, Andipatti, Dharapuram and Udumalpet were good.With sufficient rainfall at the right time, the yield was high in major shallot production centres in the district now, said onion traders in the whole sale market.The market received 4,500 bags of shallots on Monday, of which the arrival from domestic production centres, especially Iyyalur, Eriyode and Gujiliamparai, was around 2,800 bags.Increase in production and arrivals from neighbouring districts caused a glut in the wholesale market. Exports too did not pick up much in the last one week owing to fresh arrivals of shallots. Exporters preferred matured, completely dry shallots. The shelf life of fresh onions was very short when compared to matured onions, traders added. The farmers were deeply worried over the sudden slump in shallot prices as the existing sale price would not even meet their plucking and transport costs.The traders opined that shallot prices would fall further in the months to come as harvesting would be completed in major production centres in the neighbouring districts.Normally, the wholesale market receives onion in large quantities from Nilakottai, Sengurichi, Gujiliamparai in Dindigul district, and Thuraiyur, Udumalpet and Namakkal, some of the major onion production centres in the State, and from Mysore in Karnataka.Rise in production, huge arrivals from other districts lead to a glut"

The Gandhi Market, established in 1940, has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about six acres of land, attracting thousands of traders and consumers every day. The market caters not only to the city but also to retail traders from several small and big towns in the neighbouring districts.The construction of a central market was announced in July 2014 by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, when she represented the Srirangam constituency. The new market is coming up on 10 acres of land at Kallikudi, off the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, about 15 km from here.Officials say the market would have all modern infrastructure with 1,000 shops, a cold storage of 2,000 tonne capacity, sorting and grading yards and wide internal roads to facilitate easy movement of trucks and loading and unloading facility. Although representatives of traders associations say they did not mind relocating, they wanted the entire market shifted as a whole.A meeting of various traders associations held on Friday, with Ve. Govindarajalu, State treasurer, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu in the chair, decided to go on a 24-hour strike from 10 p.m. on February 11 to 10 p.m. on February 12 essentially to bring to the notice of the government the concerns of the traders.Although we are not opposed to shifting, we want the market to be shifted entirely. Besides, the shops that are being built at Kallikudi are too small and in multiple floors. The government should have consulted the traders, Mr.Govindarajalu said. Echoing his views, A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association, said onion and potato commission mandi traders required shops of 1,000 to 2,000 square feet area on the ground floor. Traders would face difficulty in lifting loads to the upper floors.U.S. Karuppiah of the Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Permanent and Platform Traders Association said there was no information on who would be allotted shops at the new market and whether the market would be shifted entirely.However, one of the platform traders association has decided not to participate in the strike. A few other associations are also yet to decide.Onion and potato traders need shops of 1,000 to 2,000 sq ft. area and will face difficulty in shifting consignments to upper floors.Thangaraj A.,General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association"

Photos: Shanker ChakravartyAs the AAP completes one year in office, the Opposition trained its guns on the party with Delhi units of both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress claiming that the party had failed to deliver on the promises made to the citizens of the Capital.While the Delhi BJP has planned to observe a Protest Day, the Congress said it would observe February 14 as Chhalawa Divas (deceit day).Terming it as a year of confrontations, the Delhi BJP demanded that the Centre dismiss Arvind Kejriwal for violations of the Constitution. Addressing a press conference here, Opposition Leader in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta referred to a list of 52 notifications released by the Delhi government and claimed these were in violation of the Constitution and laid down rules.The central government should not overlook the violations of the Constitution. I will soon meet Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and apprise him of major instances of violation of the Constitution, laws and rules by AAP government, Mr. Gupta told reporters adding that the party would hold a protest at Jantar Mantar on Sunday.Meanwhile, Senior Congress leaders P.C. Chacko, in-charge of the party's Delhi Affairs, Ajay Maken, President, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee and other Office-bearers addressed a press conference detailing their plans in addition to releasing a report card, titled Kejriwal Ek Saal, Delhi Behaal.I will give zero mark to Kejriwal government because I cannot give it minus mark, Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken said, adding the first year of AAP government was marked by its conflict with the central government and other agencies and passing blame for its failures to others.AAP government followed a course of conflict with the Centre and other agencies to divert focus from their governance and lack of delivery on their promises, shrugging of its responsibility while passing the blame to others, he said, giving a powerpoint presentation on the AAP government.The government also failed in its promise of giving a corruption-free governance as its own legislators and ministers faced allegations of corruption, Mr. Maken said, in addition to giving its nod for what he termed was the weakest ever Lokpal.Delhi Congress was at the forefront of exposing various scams of the government including onion and sugar scams as well as protesting against party leaders and ministers who faced a range of allegations including land grabbing, bribery and possessing fake degrees, he added."

Minister for Marketing T. Harish Rao directed the officials to demarcate place for onion farmers so that they could sell it directly to consumers.The government is of the opinion that the initiative would not only protect the onion farmers from price fall but also protect consumers from exploitation by middlemen and retailers with price rise. The Minister directed the officials to provide required space for special onion sale counters at all rythu bazaars in Hyderabad and Secunderabad.Further, he asked the officials to take up a campaign in Mahabubnagar, Medak and Ranga Reddy districts, where onion was grown on a large-scale, and the sale facility to be provided to farmers in rythu bazaars. Arrangements were being made to encourage consumers to buy onions only from farmers. Mr. Harish Rao took serious note of fleecing of consumers by the onion traders in vegetable markets even as the prices climbed down drastically in recent months. The government had provided onion seed at 70 per cent subsidy to farmers but the farming community had failed to get minimum support price due to lack of marketing facility in the State, he added."

Harish Rao has asked the department officials to take measures to support onion farmers in the context of falling prices for the commodity.Already, farmers have been supplied with onion seed at 70 per cent subsidy, he said, and directed the officials to see that the farmers get a minimum price of Rs.11 per kg sold through Rythu Bazars. Following the Ministers instructions, the Chief Executive Officer of Rythu Bazars organised an emergency meeting with the estate officers across the twin cities and drew plans for implementation, a press release informed on Saturday. He asked them to visit mandals with high onion cultivation in Medak, Ranga Reddy, and Mahabubnagar districts, and spread awareness among the farmers."
58f91678a3d24b0b70c3cf36,What’s in your tiffin?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/whats-in-your-tiffin/article8274277.ece,2016-02-24,"Recently, a friend texted about a piece of homemade fudge that had come back uneaten in the lunch box of her 13-year-old son. I asked him why he didnt eat it, my friend Sudeshna Shome Ghosh wrote. His response was, How could I? I didnt know what it was. My friend rolled her eyes (you can now do that thanks to an updated emoticon app), I LOLd and that was the end of it.The conversation brought back dabba memories, of going to school and opening my stainless steel lunch box in the afternoon, hours after it was packed, wondering about its contents. With the mother being a fabulous cook, the dabba was usually crammed with theplas folded in half with a dibbi of mango pickle, jeera rice with caramelized onion and curd, or rotis that miraculously stayed soft so that they could be torn with two fingers and eaten with sabji . There was lunchbox envy, where I coveted my classmates tiffins because they brought food that wasnt familiar to me. I yearned for cucumber sandwiches, after re-reading Enid Blyton books, even though the white bread would be curling up at the edges by afternoon. I even wanted the dabba that held cold, clammy Maggi noodles, something that I now wouldnt touch with a barge pole. But at that time, it was as exciting as moringa leaves are now to chefs.Now there are plenty of cookery books, blogs and Instagram accounts with innovative lunch box ideas, all just a Google search away. Blogger and nutritionist Nandita Iyer, better known as Saffron Trail online, has simple, healthy ideas, which include vegetable peanut noodles, pita pocket pizza sandwiches, and puliyogare or tamarind rice. Lulu Loves Bombay blogs about travel, her children, and food. Her sweet potato discs sound like a lovely addition to the dabba , as do her methi thepla and mango chunda. Sanjeeta KKs blog, Lite Bite, has a Lunchbox Bites section with some handy tips and recipes such as for muthiyas and wholegrain chillas.On Instagram, Lunch Box Dad, Beau Coffrans mealtime hacks include rocket ships from bread and cheese, and Spider-Man lunches with berries; while bleary-eyed parents may not be keen to wake up and make food art, its a fun account to follow. Grace Halls Eats Amazing blog focuses on Bento-style lunches for her son and follows themes such as Halloween, rainbows, and gardens. Her #PackedLunchLove Project has creative boxes that, she promises, take just a few minutes to prepare and are a visual feast. A few years ago, graphic designer and illustrator David Laferrieres innovative sandwich bag art went viral. Hes made over 1,800 sandwich bag drawings with monsters and kites.And when in doubt, return to the library.Apart from the usual cluster of recipe books, check out Karen Le Billons French Kids Eat Everything , a charming account of a family, with two picky-eater children, that moves from the USA to France and discovers how the French government and the school system strengthen food education. Then theres Chris Butterworths Lunchbox: The Story of Your Food , illustrated by Lucia Gaggiotti. A picture book, it takes young readers on a journey from farm to fork, getting them to think: where did the food in my lunchbox come from? Its a lovely way of engaging children with farmers who grow our food and get them curious about what they are eating.Mommy Go Lightly, a.k.a. journalist and author Lalita Iyer, writes lovingly about dabbas on her blog, Food is intuitive, she writes about packing her son Res lunch box. At least thats how it should be. Try different things and figure out what works for your child. My tip is, make it visually exciting. Make it look good. All you need is colours. Pretty much all my mommy and daddy friends gave me tips like that when I talked to them about the art of dabba packing: fruits and dry fruits in small Tupperware boxes to snack on in the bus; use leftovers innovatively.Shinibali Mitra Saigal, who packs food for her nine-year-old daughter said, Mine doesnt like anything soggy, squidgy or leaky. My daughter claims that thanks to me, she had to eat pickled strawberries, which taste vile. When I asked her what she meant, she added, According to her, the pickle in an airtight container leaked and ran into the strawberry in a different compartment. So that makes it pickled strawberry and an excuse not to finish her lunch box.Ghosh wakes up ten minutes earlier in the morning to make extra sandwiches for her sons friends. According to my son, none of them want to share the fruits I pack, she said, with a sigh. But hes telling me that, and well, he hates fruits. SoLooking back, we can appreciate that one person who woke up at the crack of dawn to toil away in the kitchen to prepare fresh lunchboxes for the family. I regret the dabbas that I brought back home uneaten, even the alu methi, which really doesnt do itself any favours when cold. Okay, maybe not the alu methi.The author writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru."

Shakun Batras Kapoor & Sons , however, keeps you riveted as you move from one family fight to another  from the dining table to the kitchen to the bathroom, the lawn and the party, from the husband-wife to the brothers. At times, two brawls run parallel, or they spark off each other. Even at its most ugly and shrill, the film stays so real and believable that what you see on screen feels like your very own family war zone, a bitter-sweet slice of your own life. Even as a silent spectator, you get planted in the action and become a participant. So at one level, there is the sense of indulgence and affection towards the characters who could well have been your own granddad, father, mother, uncle or brother, at another it is also a curiously therapeutic experience where you step out of the theatre having come to terms with at least a few of your own demons, if not entirely exorcised all the ghosts.You could well be the perfect elder child, Rahul (Fawad Khan), always looked up to as the responsible one, but who is tired of being under the weight of all the expectations, wanting desperately to break free.You could just as well be the younger brother, Arjun (Siddharth Malhotra), living perennially under the shadow of a successful sibling, always being the second best, the runner-up, grudging and complaining about everything, right from the bhindi sabzi to his room getting taken over without his go-ahead. You could be the head of the family, Harsh (Rajat Kapoor) bearing the burden of a crippling financial crisis or his wife Sunita (Ratna Pathak Shah) trying desperately to be an entrepreneur but not quite.On the face of it, you might easily say that theres nothing new to Kapoor & Sons . Isnt it the usual, dysfunctional family drama we have seen in countless Hollywood films? But not for a minute does the film feel stale. Batra gives a refreshing new voice to an old, tried and tested trope.So you have the grand dad (Rishi Kapoor) wanting desperately to frame his family members together forever in a happy picture while they seem to be going their own ways, the relationships falling apart. Everyone is pointing a disapproving finger at the other, but saying sab theek hai when nothing is quite right.The busy screenplay reminds one a lot of Piku : the frenzied frames, the hyper characters, the constant motion in the sequences. Like Piku , it is yet another film that has been brilliantly crafted and mapped out in terms of writing, how the scenes slowly get built up towards a crescendo. Its an onion peel narrative in which the relationships, revelations, secrets and lies, unfinished confidences, unresolved issues, betrayals and conflicts are unspooled layer by layer. The simple, conversational exchanges and the repartee are the other high points as is the acting: how the actors play off against each other with pitch-perfect timing. There is something very finely calibrated and nicely measured about the entire package that is Kapoor & Sons . Whats more, its delightfully engaging despite being rooted in the everyday, the banal and the seemingly trite. Even fixing a fuse with a wooden stick becomes a delightful scene in Batras hands. Kapoor and Shah bicker brilliantly and with great dignity at that. Khan is expectedly charming and at ease with his self. He seems to just inhabit his scenes than acting them out. Even though its a tad hard to imagine Malhotra as a budding novelist, he holds his own with his solid presence and vulnerable glances.Its Aalia Bhatt who seems to be playing her usual hyper, ditzy, little-sunshine-girl act yet again. What disappointed me the most was Rishi Kapoor with the terrible prosthetics and loud presence, perhaps in tune with his character but totally out of sync with the rest of the mellow, subtle tenor of the film.Like Piku , Batra brings the family, parent-child relationship under the scanner in Kapoor & Sons but he doesnt quite rebel against or throw away the construct entirely. He questions the family only to reassert its primacy. The sorries come as easily as the bickering, all is forgiven over a few shared joints. A few blips later, its back to continuities and certainties, perhaps to yet another argument or a bigger fight. Its about the chaos of relationships, yet about an overarching stability. The redemption is not in running away from the family, but coming within the fold. It is still all about loving your family.

But, the farmer is hassled. I have to sell the huge stock that I have by evening, he said. Even as selling off the vegetables was on top of his mind than making good profit, a customer had a jaw-dropping moment when she started enquiring with the seller at the Rythu Bazar in Erragadda.20 kgs for Rs 60. Ok? was the price offered by the farmer.The homemaker did not think twice before nodding her head.I usually bargain with the vendors during groceries shopping. But the farmer is selling tomatoes at such low price that I did not even feel like asking him to decrease further. Since, I wont be able to store such quantity or entirely use it, I plan to distribute it among neighbours, said Shanti, a resident of Ameerpet.If inflation or shortage of vegetables and pulses are a matter of concern, then so is the excessive production of the essential consumables which has hit the city markets. At various Rythu Bazars and wholesale markets, some vegetable varieties are abundantly available and sold at dirt-cheap price or worse, being dumped by the farmers themselves. We have fixed a price for onions since we want the farmers to earn some profit, said P. Ramesh, Estate officer of a Rythu Bazar in the city.Less than a year after it had overshot the Rs 100 per kg mark, onions are available for as low as Rs. 4 per kg. The average price of the onion at this time of the year is usually Rs. 20 per kg.The government has taken the initiative and asked the farmers to sell onions for Rs. 12 per kg. Sometimes we see overproduction of vegetables during the beginning of the summer season. This year, the production has been very high and we expect the prices to stabilise in 20 days, said. Mr. Ramesh.Even cabbage, potatoes, cucumber and brinjal are being sold for very low prices.Less than a year after it had overshot the Rs 100 per kg mark, onions are available for as low as Rs. 4 per kg"

KarthikeyanWith a huge arrival of shallot from major onion production centres in Dindigul and nearby districts, the wholesale onion market in Dindigul has witnessed a crash in prices of small onion, worrying farmers. Onion growers could not get even 10 per cent of their seed costs as returns and many of them would be forced to switch over to other crops in the next season, traders said.The prices of shallots that hovered around Rs.18 a kg last month suddenly fell to Rs.7 a kg on Monday. On the retail market, shallots were being sold up to Rs.15 a kg. Regular arrival from Theni, Andipatti, Dharapuram and Udumalpet was good owing to high yield, small onion traders said.The market received 4,100 bags of shallots (each weighing 60 kg) on Monday, of which the arrival from domestic production centres, especially Iyyalur, Eriyode and Gujiliamparai, was around 2,500 bags, said V. Rajendran, onion wholesale trader.With no exports in the last one month, prices fell sharply. Already, Sri Lanka has started cultivating onion to reduce imports, traders added.I purchased onion seeds at Rs.70 a kg. But, shallots were sold for Rs.7 a kg in the market. Selling price of small onions did not cover even 10 per cent of the seed costs. How can I meet other expenses such as input costs, plucking and freight charges, asked R.
