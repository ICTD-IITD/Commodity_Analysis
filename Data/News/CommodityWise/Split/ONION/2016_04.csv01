Jaikumaran, Head, Agricultural Research Station, Mannuthy, at an onion field. Jalaja Menon, research assistant, (right) is seen.Onion cultivation is picking up momentum in the plains of the State, thanks to the sustained efforts of Thrissur Krishi Vigyan Kendra.The research findings of Jalaja Menon in identifying varieties suitable for the soil and climatic conditions in the State have given the right impetus for the new crop culture.Now onion cultivation is popular inas many as eight districts of the State andsixteen blocks in Thrissur district. People are growing onion in fields, backyards and even terraces.Onion farming has been accepted by farmers in Palakkad, Thrissur, Wayanad, Ernakulam, Idukki, Kotrayam, Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram districts.The seedlings have to be planted in October and March will be the harvesting time. Porus soil with sufficient irrigation facility is the best. Onion can also be grown in grow bags, says Dr. Jalaja.Even as the farmers who embraced onion farming are enjoying their harvest, Dr.Jalaja is exploring further possibilities in the field.The harvesting in her experimental plot was of a different kind, as it was not of one variety but of 19 varieties grown for a comparative study of their productivity. The harvesting was inaugurated by U. Jaikumaran, Professor & Head, Agricultural Research Station, Mannuthy, recently."

In fact, onion growers had got Rs. 2,500- 5,000 in October-November last year for their monsoon crop.What is ironic is that there are no buyers for a large quantum of produce even at the above price range of Rs. 1,200-1,500. This has resulted in heaps of onion produce remaining unsold at the Raichur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard.We have spent around Rs. 25,000 for cultivating onion on one acre. We got better crop this year both in terms of quality and yield. Unfortunately, there is no good price in the market. Wholesale buyers are asking the crop for a throwaway price. How can we survive? asked Hanumayya, a farmer from Sasivegera village in Deodurg taluk.His produce in 45 bags, each having 50 kg of fine quality onion, has remained unsold at the APMC for the last two days. I have decided to sell the produce at whatever price the buyer asks, he added.Most of the onion growers in the AMPC yard were in a similar condition as onion is a perishable agricultural produce and there was no hope of recovery of price in the immediate future. They were left with no option other than selling their produce at whatever price they get as they cannot take their crop back to their villages incurring additional transportation costs. They sleep beside their onion heaps in open protecting their crop from pigs and cattle.According to the traders, glut in the market caused by heavy imports from Nashik in Maharashtra caused the dip in the price of onion. The traders are heavily importing onion from Nashik. Supply is greater than the demand. This caused the prices to crash, Nagaraj, a trader, said.Chamarasa Malipatil, state president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, expressed similar views. According to him, the government imported onion from different countries when the onion prices were high in the domestic market.Massive imports, much greater than the required quantity, has caused the glut in the market. Now, domestic farmers have to bear the brunt. Farmers are in a very pathetic condition as they are repeatedly hit hard by problems floods, drought, Bt cotton failure and now price crash,"" he said. He demanded that the government open onion procurement centres at APMCs and purchase the produce directly from farmers offering minimum support price."

The Forest Department officials deployed an animal rescue van in the farm to catch the monkeys and release them in the wild. However, the simians continue to outwit the staff and stay put in the farm.The factors like deforestation and release of simians, those caught by the monkey catchers from towns, in the vicinity of villages have aggravated the monkey menace in several parts of the district, sources said.The monkey menace has assumed severe proportions posing obstacles to horticulture activities in the farm, says R. Srinivasa Rao, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, Khammam.We have earlier tried the biological control method to deal with the monkey menace by deploying langurs, but with little success. Off late, the monkey menace resurfaced on a vigorous scale, he points out."

The pancha kavya is produced using cow-dung, cow urine, water, curd, milk, and yeast. We supply pancha kavya to tribal farmers who are not so familiar in preparing it, says T.M.P. Thangaraj, founder of the TMP Vermicompost Production Centre at Konganimudakku village near Ottampattipudur on the foot of the hills.P. Pazhanisamy, co-founder of the centre, said apart from tribal farmers, big farmers from Kancheepuram, Rasipuram, and Rajapalayam had been placing bulk orders for the bio manure. We despatch the pancha kavya by parcel, he said.The sprawling area of 10 acres accounts for a large number of shade-giving trees and the dry leaves were being utilised for preparing the vermin-compost.Mr. Thangaraj said there had been a growing demand for using bio-manure. On an average, he markets 200 litres of pancha kavya and four tonnes of vermi-compost. The profit margin is 50 per cent for panchakavya and about 40 per cent for vermi-compost.

Only during the last kharif season, I could, for the first time, harvest over 40 quintals of chilli from my two acres of land. This was possible only with the krishi honda (a pond dug in the field under the Krishi bhagya scheme during 2014-15) which helped me protect my crop, Mr. Manjunath told The Hindu .Like him, Doddappa in Kottalachinta, a border village in the taluk, another beneficiary of the Krishi Bhagya scheme, is cultivating onion as a summer crop in his land with the help of krishi honda. Krishi honda has come as a boon for farmers like me who depend on rain. I have been cultivating onion in half an acre land making use of the water that was harvested in the newly dug pond, he says. He is hopeful of a good yield on over five acres of land during the kharif season.Krishi honda is one of the components under Krishi bhagya scheme. A 30-metre long and 30-metre wide pond with a depth of three metres is dug at a suitable place for harvesting rainwater. Later, a diesel generator pumpset along with sprinklers and pipes are provided. Krishi honda with other components will approximately cost Rs. 1.75 lakh. The government gives a subsidy up to 90 per cent for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and 80 per cent for other farmers.The scheme has many advantages and it is becoming more popular in the district. As on date, 4,394 krishi hondas have been completed. More farmers are keen to take advantage of the scheme in the current fiscal, Sharanappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, says.The concept is to harvest rainwater besides taking up strengthening of the field bunds and land development with the help of the soil dug from the pond.The water harvested in the pond will come in handy for the farmer to protect the crops when there is no rain. The pond can help irrigate about five acres of land at least two to three times."

Private companies sell the seeds at Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 per quintal depending on the quality of the seeds.Based on the cultivation area of onion in the district, the farmers require 1,600 quintal of onion seeds. Some of the small and medium farmers find it difficult to invest on seeds and other material required for cultivation. So, the farmers had decided to grow seeds in at least 10 guntas of their land.This move would help farmers to grow a minimum of 640 quintal of seeds and the remaining 960 quintal would be purchased from the companies, sources said.In order to grow seeds on their own, the farmers had separated good quality onions during the last kharif season and preserved them till the suitable climatic condition arrived.The growing of seeds had begun in the month of November and after four months the seeds are now ready for sale.According to sources, the farmers are expected to set aside some quantity of the seeds for themselves and sell the remaining to other farmers at reasonable rates without the interference of middlemen."

Bharamagowdra collected, collated and documented his experience as an organic farmer in an agricultural industry that was increasingly becoming dependent on chemical pesticides.The noted farmer passed away three months ago, but not without passing down his knowledge to future generations.His experience with the rich rain-fed black cotton soil in north Karnataka was recorded by the Institute for Cultural Research and Action (ICRA) and subsequently brought out as a book in Kannada DD Bharamagowdra BadukuBesaya, Savayava Krushikana Mahaan Payana (in English: The Organic Farmers Notable Journey).It is a detailed take on the art and science of organic farming that can serve as a manual for farmers,"" said environmentalist Yellappa Reddy at the recent launch of the book.Bharamagowdra was one of the most seasoned farmers of Gadag.He had been through a roller-coaster ride with respect to dealing with chemical and organic farming.His father Byamana Gowdas family grew more than 40 crops with traditional wisdom guiding their 'inter, border and mixed cropping philosophies'.The family is said to have been the foremost in bringing onion and byadgi chilli to that region said V. Gayathri, who transcribed, compiled and edited the newly released book that traces Bharamagowdras relationship with soil.After completing his BSc., Bharamagowdra was inspired by the green revolution and was drawn to chemical-dependant agriculture. The saga of his return to organic farming after seeing his soil go bereft of nutrients is what makes the book a veritable manuscript, says Gayathri.Bharamagowdras association with Institute for Cultural Research and Action started in the 1980s when he used to be in touch with P. Babu, one of the earliest functionaries and promoters of organic farming.He later contributed to ICRAs bimonthly magazine Sahaja Saguvali, which Ms. Gayathri edits.ICRA recorded Bharamagowdras know-how. The project involved meticulously transcribing his oral records. Although I edited the book, I was careful not to disturb his style of dialect and vocabulary so that farmers could relate to his calling, said Ms. Gayathri.The 325-page book in two parts starts with Bharamagowdras early memories, the agricultural practices before the green revolution, the onslaught of fertilizers before the genesis of the organic movement in Karnataka.The second part contains 17 articles detailing the author's experiments in dry land organic agriculture.The ecological vision of Bharamagowdra is significant in the context of climate change and distress in agriculture."
