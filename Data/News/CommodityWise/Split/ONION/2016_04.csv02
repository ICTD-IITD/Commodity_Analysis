This has affected the production of particularly vegetables in the local farms.Due to this, there has been a steep fall in the arrival of vegetables particularly to the 11 uzhavar santhais in the district.The santhai sources said that the local tomato season has already come to an end and local tomatoes are not at all arriving in the santhais. At present farmers are bringing the tomatoes procured from Rayakottai, and Krishnagiri to the uzhavar santhais.The price of tomatoes which remained at Rs. 15 a kg last week, has risen to Rs. 26 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in the open markets.Similarly the price of brinjal has gone up from Rs. 10  Rs. 14 last week to Rs. 18 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 25 in the open markets.The small onion season has also come to an end. The onion arriving at the santhais are from areas such as Udumalpet, and Mysore.The small onion was selling at Rs. 20  Rs. 25 a kg last week, and it has gone up to Rs. 32 a kg in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 35 in the open markets. The season of drumsticks is also over.There is a fall in the arrival of Bengaluru beans too, due to which its price has shot up to Rs. 70 a kg from Rs. 50, uzhavar santhai sources said.With mercury continue to soar high, there is no hope of improvement in the arrival of local vegetables to the uzhavar santhais. Hence the price of vegetables is expected to increase further in the days to come, causing much anxiety to both the farmers and consumers."

Farmers harvested over 200 kg per acre as against the normal yield of 1,500 kg. Adding to their woes, insurance for the onion crop has not yet been announced.Banking on good monsoon, farmers cultivated onion on over 2,800 hectares in Thoothukudi district in the current fiscal, exceeding the previous years coverage of 1,600 hectare. The crop was extensively cultivated in Vilathikulam taluk, literally a rain-fed region in the district.Though poor rainfall posed a risk, the three-month crop managed to survive the drought. But with the yield going down, the farmers are struggling to even make up for the input cost.Varadharajan, a farmer, told Express that after the first shower, there was no sign of rain, which led to a severe yield loss.We expected rain at the time when the crop reached flowering stage. But rain gods did not bless us, he said. Farmers had invested over Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 for raising onion in an acre. But the yield has been as low as 200 kg per acre, which the traders procure for Rs 10 each. An acre of onion crop yields around 1,500 kg a year, he said. Adding fuel to the fire, the onion is among the five crops awaiting a government order on insurance. The last date for the crop insurance is January 15. Over 5,000 onion farmers had not insured the crops.With a heavy loss, farmers had appealed to the government to declare the state as drought hit and had demanded compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre."

The Centre will also be requested to provide assistance for the establishment of cow shelters, fodder banks and providing drinking water.Market intervention for onionsThe government is mulling over a market intervention plan for onions as the rate of the vegetable has dropped dramatically. A good yield has resulted in drastic fall in the price of onions. Also, around 3.5 lakh acres where onions were cultivated is said to have suffered a loss. The state government and the Centre usually have an equal share in the support price and the state government is now asking for a support price of Rs 11 per kg.Free treatment at new hospital in UdupiThe Cabinet has approved the decision to give 3.88 acres in Udupi on lease to Dubai-based industrialist B R Shetty for the construction of a hospital for women and children, and a centre of excellence.

But the situation is the opposite for farmers of small onions in Tiruchy and Perambalur.Because of scanty rains, farmers in the central districts chose to stay with small onion cultivation instead of switching to water-intensive paddy and sugarcane, which resulted in a glut. With markets flooded with small onions, prices of the vital ingredient of the iconic recipe in sambar has nose-dived by at least 50 per cent in the past two weeks.According to officials of Horticulture department, as much as 5,000 acres in Thuraiyur, Uppiliyapuram, Manachanallur, and Pullambadi blocks of Tiruchy, and around 15,000 acres in Perambalur, including Alathur and Veppanthattai blocks, are flush with small onions.We would have gone for paddy and sugarcane had we got enough rainfall. But in its absence, farmers have opted to recultivate small onions. Alathur and Veppanthattai farmers for successive terms cultivated small onions. said V Neelakandan, a farmer from Perambalur.Similarly in Tiruchy, small onion cultivation has taken place on close to 5,000 acres in Thuraiyur and Uppiliyapuram area. With as much as 10-15 per cent surge in production, the problem of plenty has directly affected the prices of small onion also called as sambar onions.At this time last year, a tonne of small onions was sold at Rs 30,000. Now we are getting only Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 whereas the cost stands at Rs 25,000 per acre, Neelakandan added.According to traders in Gandhi market, around 200 tonnes of small onion would arrive at the market here everyday and would be supplied across central districts.But in the past two weeks, the excessive production of small onion has made its reserve to bulge in the godowns forcing traders to sell at throwaway prices. The 75-90 day small onion crop require only half the water needed for paddy. From being sold at `25 per kilogram in the first week of November, the retail prices fell to `5-10 per kg on Saturday. The prices are likely to hold for the next few weeks.Our estimate is that production could have surged by 10 per cent, said a horticulture department official said."

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

The average daily turnover was a whopping Rs 50 crore till November 8.Onions, potatoes, pulses, grains, sugar, jaggery, dry fruits  almost everything is available in this wholesale market.Loading workers at the yard now earn between D150 and D200 per day as the volume of trucks bringing in produce has come down | s manjunathWe cater to food requirements of 2.5 crore people across the state, including the one crore-plus population of Bengaluru and a large population in Hoskote, Dobbspet, Tumakuru, Magadi, Chintamani, Kolar and Ramanagara, said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains & Pulses Merchants Association.Daily turnover takes a hitAs one enters the gates of the market, bags of onion and potatoes are seen strewn around the yard or being auctioned off. The yard receives an average of 1 lakh bags of onion and 50,000 bags of potato daily. Groups of men are found standing in different spots in the yard, auctioning these items after the trucks arrive with the produce.From a daily turnover of Rs 50 crore, we now have a daily turnover of Rs 18 crore to Rs 20 crore due to the massive cash crunch all around. After the demonetisation move on November 8, our total turnover for the next three days hovered around Rs 5 crore only, said Lahoti. Business has been improving but we are still losing 60 per cent of our business and the Centre has to do something urgently. We requested their representative Anil Kumar, during our meeting on Thursday, to increase the withdrawal limit for current accounts to atleast Rs 2 lakh per day, he added.Traders around his shop concede that the wholesale business sees 90 per cent cash transactions. Representatives of farmers have been camping at the market for a day or two to collect due payment in new currency notes.They will not accept old Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes or cheque payments, a trader said. He adds that almost every trader here lost at least Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh by accepting cheque payments which later bounced. Business is no more done on trust, he added.Speaking of his outlet, Sunil & Co, located in MG Building in the yard, Lahoti said, I have been giving credit only to longstanding customers, whom I trust. I am losing the rest of my business."

In return for their labour, they are not paid in cash, but in the form of onions or potatoes. What is worse is that a huge chunk of these perishables are in a state of decay.Elaborating on the chores many poor women like her perform here, M Ambika says that when produce from farmers are brought in sacks, buyers would insist on checking a few sample bags before bulk purchase. An entire bag is emptied and the buyer would inspect them and choose only the good ones. He keeps aside the rejected potatoes or onions, she explains.A large section of the women, two in each onion or potato outlet, help the buyers put the selected onions in a sack for transportation. In return for our labour, we are allowed to take these rejected items. We eke out a living by selling them for cheap, Ambika says. Some buyers also give them one or two kg of fresh onions. When asked as to who would actually buy the rotten perishables, pat comes her reply, Hotels and small grocery shops.However, even this paltry income has been hard to come by due to a dip in the number of lorries as well as sacks reaching the yard since November 9. I used to make between Rs 100 and Rs 200 per day. Now it is between Rs 50 and Rs 100 per day, Ambika says.There are roughly 2,000 labourers employed in the yard. The men largely do the loading and unloading of produce.Muruga and his colleagues are quite a disgruntled lot. We used to earn Rs 700 to Rs 800 per day and have work thrice a week. Now we earn Rs 150-Rs 200 a day due to the reduced number of trucks coming to the yard, he says. He is among a group of labourers who come to the city from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh for seven to eight months each year to earn a living.Ganesan, a co-worker says, Just see this truck now. Seven of us were trying to offload the 300 sacks in it which is normally done by two or three people. This will reduce all our wages.Jaishanthappa of Bharat Traders, a potato dealer, says, I used to buy a truck-load of potatoes a day. Now I am buying only one every four days due to cash crunch.The regret over the diminished income and cash crunch echoes across owners and labourers."

They are consultants to those wishing to nurture gardens of different sizes, as well.Minette shares some valuable information and tips with our readers.Watering requires to be done everyday, unless the soil is already wet/damp from the previous day. Among the herbs, rosemary is a delicate darling which requires some extra attention and care.Water your plants enough to keep the soil moist without over-watering (roots will rot in a soggy container). Let the top of the soil, or growing medium, dry out completely between watering and check moisture levels often. Mint, parsley does best in fairly moist soil, whereas rosemary, thyme and sage prefer soil that is only slightly moist.Herbs grow well in equal parts compost, sterile topsoil and builders sand. An all-purpose organic fertilizer can be added to this mix. The soil mix needs to drain well. Since they can thrive on any type of soil, the soil does not have to be completely organic. They are not often bothered by insect or disease pests. Neem oil works best in case of any diseases.Herbs can be grown in pots or on the ground. They require a minimum of 6 hours of bright sunlight and can be grown indoors where they get sufficient light. Indoors the advantage is no weeds, easy to access but the yield is less. A south west facing window will do well. Outdoors, the yield is larger, the herbs are more flavoursome.The beauty of herbs is that they can thrive on your kitchen window sill, balcony, patio etc as long as they get the required amount of sunlight and water. One can buy seeds from most garden stores. Most herbs are available as saplings and can be re potted into bigger pots or into the ground. Basil gives out flowers which dry into seeds. Once it flowers, it needs to be pinched and the seeds can be dried and grown. The same goes with garlic and onion chives.Seeds of annual herbs (basil, coriander, dill and oregano) can be started indoors and grown year round. Place a collection of popular culinary herbs in a sunny kitchen window and theyll be available when needed. Perennial herbs, like chives, parsley, sage, sweet marjoram and thyme, can be started from seed, but it is often easier to purchase young plants from a nursery. Because perennials grow for more than one season, its best to keep them outside in pots during the summer and bring them in if the winter is too cold.The Tale of a TeacherI am the proud owner of a farm in the heart of Bengaluru in Jayanagar. It is just a 3ft by 14 ft patch in my backyard but I call it a farm because in that small space I grow a variety of vegetables and herbs!says former teacher, Mythili Ramaprasad, her eyes sparkling with joy and pride. To make maximum use of the little soil in the patch and also the limited sunlight available, I grow climbers, shrubs, herbs and tubers.So there is a happy mix of pumpkin, turmeric, cherry tomatoes, sweet potato, colocasia( kesuvina soppu) along with curry leaves, chilies, mint, basil and ajwain ( dodpathre soppu) ,all growing in symbiosis. I have also tried growing climbers like passion fruit, chow and hyacinth beans ( avarekai) in the past which have given good yields.She says I took up gardening seriously as a hobby after I retired as a teacher. What began as a hobby has now become a passion. I love to spend time every morning in the garden, examining each plant and discover a fresh green shoot or a healthy new bud. It is very relaxing and has great therapeutic value. Very little investment is needed to plan a small kitchen garden. It is best if it is organically cultivated. Kitchen wastes like vegetable and fruit peels can be collected and buried in a pit in the soil.Sometimes the plants are attacked by caterpillars and insects which need immediate attention as they can seriously damage the plants and affect the produce. Monkeys can also be a menace and cause destruction.....she rues. And those who know Mythili Ramaprasad will tell you just how alert and vigilant she is especially when it comes to her beautiful garden!"

He must be unaware. My worry is how he will survive the two-day journey, he added.The worst affected are the traders who are scared they will lose their daily business for the next two days. With the sudden clamp, we dont know how the transactions will happen, rued Bhaskar, an onion trader in Koyambedu market where transactions happen only in cash.What will I do? I have currencies in the denomination of `500 and `1,000. How would I carry out my business tomorrow?, wondered a concerned Vijayakumar, a shop owner in Koyambedu.While common man was a tad uneasy, those from financial background were more measured in their reactions. Aashish, who deals with banking and financial services, said that the commodity market will be hit. Prime Minister says 99 per cent of transaction in India is through cash. This will put people into tremendous hardship but then it is a welcome sign as it will put an end to black money, he said.It is commendable, but there are many buts. In a nutshell the move will bring ordinary cash transaction to standstill.

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

It opens a window to seeing the world differently, with its many magical surprises. Designing a garden that is child-friendly will sustain their interest. Here are some top tips to make it so.Select a small patch of the whole garden space for this garden. Here, they can do activities by themselves like digging, sowing, watering and weeding. Take care of their safety. Avoid using the materials which will hurt them while gardening.The pots and the planters which are used in the garden can be painted with different colours and decorated with their favourite cartoon characters. This will make things more fun. Kids are curious about new things. The kids garden should have plants which grow fast. They will be thrilled to see the sprouting and emerging of a new leaf from a seed which was sown by them. Plucking a carrot from the soil and eating them with the fresh soil flavour will become their green childhood stories. They will enjoy the colours. Bright flowering plants would be a smart addition to their garden.The child-friendly garden should have some interesting structures where the kids can play, learn and grow plants. It could be done in many creative ways. You could design an alphabet garden where the raised beds could be designed like an alphabet. Pizza gardens could be designed in a small circular patch of land where all the vegetables and the herbs which are used in pizzas could be grown. Beans can be grown in a spiral cage attached to the pot, making them more engaged with the plant by trailing it on the cage.In case you have no space on the ground to have a child-friendly garden, don't worry. Make some interesting planters at home which gives them the happiness of growing food. Potato man, aqua onion are easy to make and perfectly fit your window sill garden at home. Here is how to make a potato man and aqua onion:Take a big size potato. Cut the potato one inch from the top and scoop out all the flesh with a spoon or a knife. Leave a thick layer of flesh around the skin. Fill the potato with soil and sow some Ragi seeds on that. Sprinkle some water every day. Ragi will germinate within a week and grow like the hair of the potato. Draw a face on the potato with its green lush hair on the top. Wheat, paddy or any other cereal seeds could be used.Aqua onions: Take a cup and fill with water. Keep an onion in that in such a way that the roots are touching the water. After a week new shoots will come from the onion. Engage your kids in watering and trimming the shoots.The options are endless! So start to grow plants and nurture your kids in a greener world.

Insects which feed on plants are called as pests. In nature, these pests are consumed by the predator insects, that are garden friendly or farmer friendly. However, chemical farming has collapsed this balancing system in nature. Chemical pesticides kill predators and pests resistance towards these chemicals as well. In natural farming, pest management is based on the principle of 'prevention is better than cure'. Weaker plants are easily susceptible to pest attacks while healthy plants don't get affected by pests and thrive best if they grow in good quality soil. Humus is the best way to create healthy soil. Humus could be created by adding biomass and beneficial micro organisms to the soil. Desi cow dung and cow urine are the best sources of beneficial micro organisms. Creating healthy soil as well as the following simple gardening tips will help you to make your garden absolutely healthy.Plant protection tips for your gardenSeeds should be treated with a microbial culture before sowing, which gives protection from all fungal diseases.Providing proper space between plants will facilitate aeration and avoid spreading of disease between the plants.Marigold can be grown around the garden, as a trap crop. The yellow flower attracts pests and secures the main vegetable plants.Grow companion plants. When vegetables are grown with herbs, the herbs act as a repellent plant for pests. Tomato and tulsi can be grown in the same pot.Crop rotation should be followed. Grow different plants instead of same plants in each container. For example tomato - beans - onion can be grown consecutively in one year.Grow maize and cow pea in between vegetable plants. The maize and cow pea foliage attracts pests and prevent other vegetable crops from getting affected.If any plant or plant part gets affected by insects, remove the affected pant or plant part manually and use it for composting.Growing marigold and castor plants once in a while in the pot which will give protection from root nematodes.Have lights in the garden during night hours. The nocturnal pests, which are active during night time will get attracted by lights and does not affect the plants.Take a piece of yellow colour chart paper and apply castor oil on both sides and tie it on the plant. Adult pest insects get attracted by the yellow colour and acts as a sticky trap.Nursery trays could be covered with a mesh/net to avoid the fly attackAdd neem cake with the potting mixture to give protection from root diseases.All the above prevention measures give maximum control over pests. In case any further pest incidence to be observed in the garden then go for a repellent spray, which will not kill the pest but give a repellent effect to the pests.These tips will help you to get rid of the pests from the garden. If you still find any pest infestation then use a neem based spray on weekly intervals until it is controlled.For more information on urban farming or any other related queries contact author at nalini@artyplantz.com"

It wont disappoint you.From pongal, upma and your dosa, idli to Anjoor Halwa, the joint serves what seems to come straight from a grandmothers kitchen.While you sip a cup of hot filter coffee, try some paddu, shavige bath and ghee upma. Ghee has been generously used in all the dishes here. The eatery, infact, prides in using only ghee and no oil, and therefore there is a rich flavour. The onion fillings of paddu, creamy pongal, colourful and bright shavige bath and the tasty ghee upma  all of these are made in ghee.The delicious pongal is made with coconut milk. The kesari bath melts in the mouth and has flakes of kesar. Both have a melting, rich texture and taste delicious.Chettys Coffee has some offbeat varieties of dosas. Apart from the regular plain dosa and masala dosa, theres Avalakki Dosa, Pickle Dosa and Vegetable Dosa. The Avalakki Dosa, made with rice and gram, looks appealing and like the appams. But these are not made in coconut milk. Yet, they are light, soft and fluffy. They are served with onion and coconut chutnies. The onion chutney has a mild sweetness and the coconut chutney is spicy.The Pickle Dosa is another specialty with a tangy twist. The dosa has a chilli-pickle spread, which gives it a yellow tinge. Though these are made from chillies, it is not hot and tasted the best of all. It surprises you with its light tantalising flavour.The beetroot in the vegetable dosa lends it a pink colour and an overarching earthy flavour. The dosa also has other veggies like carrot and beans. Unlike the usual vegetable dosas at other food joints, with chopped and spiced vegetables as a filling, in this dosa the vegetables are ground well along with the batter. It looks like a pink plain dosa.Now comes the dessert. The Anjoor Halwa is simply delicious and will make you crave for more. The gel-like halwa floats in ghee. It is sticky, yet a delight to taste.Approximate cost for two: Rs 150"

My family has been in this profession for generations and hence creativity in the space of food, runs in the family.I always enjoy learning new things, be it new dishes, new styles of garnishing, new cuisines, learning about new cultures and so on.The society has grown increasingly conscious about health care. I found from my own experience that people have started understanding the need of organic farming. It has become a trend now.Thats when I started thinking about what I can make exclusively with organic vegetables. I always wished of having a vegetable garden near to my kitchen so that I can pluck from them and directly put them in frying pan. Interestingly, from my travel experience, I found that there are places in India where people do the same. This gave me an idea of making a special dish which I named it as Chefs Garden. Keeping new market trends, awareness of local theme, freshly grown, farm to plate concepts in mind, I created this contemporary salad using fresh microgreens and dehydrated olives.For preparing Chefs garden, I use all the fresh vegetables like carrot, zucchini, baby corn, Pearl onion microgreens and Frezze which spread over the cheese filled baked dough. Sprinkling olive powder, Panko crumb and dressing it up with Vinegrette give a good flavour to the dish.The whole idea behind creating dishes with fresh local produce is to create appreciation for healthy eating, benefits of organic produce, spreading the joy of simplistic dishes and cooking.More and more people want to embrace the idea of farm to fork, enjoy seasonal fruits and vegetables and make the most of what is available around them which is fresh and stored without preservatives.As a chef and a parent, I want the future generation to understand the importance of organic farming by introducing exciting and interesting dishes for them and getting them to eat healthy, nutritious food.- Chef Rana Dominic Gomes, Executive Chef,Hotel Royal Orchid"

I am accepting things which I can use. Rice and coconut can be resold. Bamboo will be used in fencing and wooden planks for furniture, Palai said.With rural Odisha facing currency crisis and most of the panchayats still remaining unbanked, people have adopted barter system to purchase essential commodities and manage their daily requirements.Barter is an old system of exchange of goods and services without involving money. Treated as cashless economy, it is usually a reciprocal medium of exchange, benefiting both the parties - giver and taker.While people in urban Odisha are using debit or credit cards to make payments, communities in rural areas have turned to the older form of cashless payment. Other things apart, rice, which is abundantly available after the autumn harvest, has become a common medium of exchange.Unlike coastal areas, people in hilly and forest regions have been availing goods, grocery items and vegetables in exchange of forest produces like honey and resin. Even as the Centre chalked out a series of measures for smooth flow of cash into rural areas, this barter system proved beneficial for people like daily wager Dibakar Soren (62) who is yet to have a bank account.I purchased one kg potato, 250 gms dal, 500 gms onion and some spices in exchange of one litre of honey. I have two old Rs 500 notes, but none is willing to accept it. The bank, where I can exchange the notes is seven km away, Soren, a resident of Jashipur in Mayurbhanj district, said.Adding to the woes of senior citizens, the officials have paid them old-age pension in old currency notes.In many parts of the State, two persons have been provided one Rs 500 note and one Rs 100 note asking them to exchange the old one and divide the amount. People above the age of 60 years are entitled to get Rs 300 each as old-age pension.While there are reports of dharna by pensioners in front of panchayat offices in protest against the payment through banned currency notes, people in several districts staged demonstrations before cooperative banks demanding exchange of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."

During the rabi season 2015-16, crops were grown on 1,18,130 hectares.As per reports, paddy will be cultivated on 51,300 hectares with a target of 3, 22,677 tonne during the upcoming rabi season. The paddy production target was 3, 20,625 tonne on 51,300 hectares during the last rabi season.Likewise, wheat and maize will be cultivated on 420 hectares with a target of 2,539 tonne. The target was 2,509 tonne on 420 hectares last year.Besides, oilseeds, including groundnut, sesame, mustard and sunflower will be cultivated on 13,620 hectares with a production target of 19,650 tonne. The target was 16,321 tonne on 10,684 hectares during the last rabi season.

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

But farmers are seemingly discouraged to take potato cultivation due to high price of certified seed potato of K-Jyoti variety at `35.5 per kg.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the administration also plans to cover 133 ha in Gurundia, Rajgangpur, Kutra and Lefripara blocks under the convergence initiative of horticulture and watershed schemes. So far, 1,200 quintals of total 2,082 quintals of seed potato have been supplied and farmers in the four blocks would get incentive of `30,000 per ha under convergence initiative, he added.In the rest 13 blocks, potato farmers registered under Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana (RKVY) would be entitled to get incentives of `20,000 per ha. He said a section of the farmers have resorted to germination of seed potatoes and sowing would continue till December in the district.About onion cultivation, he informed that 160 ha are covered under the State Plan Scheme and 16 quintals of seed onion have been supplied at a subsidised cost of `250 per kg. The DDH claimed that in rest of the district, farmers have taken up onion cultivation on 940 ha at their own and onion seeds are being developed at nurseries for transplantation after 45 days.Sources said sandy loam soil is most suitable for potato crop with each ha requiring about 15 quintals of seed potato and after 105 days, the average potato yield is expected to be 10 tonnes per ha in the district. Similarly, each ha requires 10 kg of seed onion and after 150 days, each ha is likely to produce 10 tonnes of onion on an average.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said to boost potato and onion cultivation, adequate cold storage facilities are required. He hoped the recently opened cold storage facility in Bargaon block of 5,000 tonnes capacity and an existing facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela would be helpful to some extent.Potato farmers, however, continue to be worried about market uncertainties as in 2015, potato price had crashed drastically leading to distress sale of locally grown crops."

Farmers are forced to resort to distress sale and they blame the State Government for the situation.Only two mandis are operational in the district for procuring cotton as a result of which, they sell their produce to traders, who are encashing on the situation. Against the target of 55,000 hectares (ha) of land, cotton was grown over 53,000 ha in the district this year. With each ha giving a yield of eight to 10 quintals, the targeted yield has been fixed at about five lakh quintals. The MSP for cotton this season has been fixed at `4,160 per quintal. Sources said only two mandis are operating at Karlapada and Utkela exposing the farmers to private traders, who have already started purchasing cotton at price much less than the MSP.With majority of the farmers availing both institutional and private loan for cotton cultivation, they are in a hurry to repay the loan to avoid payment of interest. Cotton cultivation was initiated in Kalahandi in the 70s and it brought in new horizons. Over the years, it turned out to be the major cash crop. Apparently, Kalahandi was a paddy growing area till agricultural scientists introduced cash crops like cotton, onion and pulses. As weather and soil condition is suitable for cotton cultivation, government hoped to improve economic condition of farmers through it.However, in the absence of marketing facilities and support from Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), farmers have failed to gain from the crop.Deputy Director, Agriculture, Laxman Paltasingh said more mandis will be made operational shortly."

Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.  I used to sell a minimum of 10,000 coconuts per day and a maximum of 50,000. In the past one month, my minimum has been 3,000 and the maximum has not crossed 25,000, he said."
