In the last five days price of potato has gone up by Rs two to touch Rs 22. While cucumber costs Rs 40 a kg, onion is up by Rs four to cost Rs 22, tomato is priced at Rs 35 from the earlier Rs 30 and ladyfinger is selling for Rs 40 and cauliflower is priced between Rs 20 and Rs 25.Banking in on the religious sentiments of the people are dalals who have started hoarding. A farmer of Sankarpur Basanta Sahoo alleged that they earn little as dalals detain them on way to Dhenkanal markets and buy the produce from them at cheaper prices. Farmers from Sankarpur, Tarava, Gondia and Dinabandhupur and other pockets of Sadar block bring their produce to the towns market while potato is imported from West Bengal and Onions from Nasik.Civil Supply Officer Hadibandhu Sethy said, We have conducted a meeting with traders and asked them to keep price of onion and potato stable in daily sample study. We have started conducting survey from Tuesday. The department, however, has no hold or authority in enforcing price of vegetables except potato, onion and dal, he added.During Laxmi Puja, the demand for potato and onion increases manifold as more fast food stalls come up at this time. As many as 200 gupchup vendors from Bihar have opened their stalls and each vendor purchases a minimum of 50 kg potato a day, informed one of the kiosk owners in Ganesh Bazaar. Locals have demanded the intervention of the Government or district administration to check the prices from going beyond the reach of common man."

While members of both the communities were conspiring against each other, Sauqat was busy discharging his duty for the mankind.The youths were crying in pain when they arrived at the hospital. I cleaned their wounds and covered those with bandage after nurse applied medicines, he said.On the strife, Sauqat said people from both the communities live peacefully in the town. Some mischief mongers flared up the small incident, he added. Normally, Soro is a peaceful town and people here extend cooperation to each other, Sauqat added.Doctors of the CHC also donned role of Samaritans for the patients and their attendants who were stuck up without food due to promulgation of prohibitory orders and curfew. A team of four doctors led by Dr Dhiresh Kumar Sarangi spent from their own pocket and provided cooked food to at least 200 persons daily for the last four days.The patients and their attendants were helpless since all hotels were closed as Section 144 of CrPc was clamped in the town. Even vegetables were also not available, we managed to collect dal, some vegetables and rice to provide them cooked food, said Dr Sarangi.Other doctors who extended a helping hand are Dr Satyanarayan Nayak, Dr Hemanta Roul and Dr Gauranga Singh. With the situation in Soro improving and no untoward incident reported since last 24 hours, the contribution of the hospital doctors and Sauqat is hailed by all and sundry.Meanwhile, the locals residents, who were forced to remain indoors due to prohibitory orders, came out and purchased essential commodities and vegetable which were made available after four days. People alleged that the traders were raking in the moolah as very few shops were opened and commodities were insufficient. Some were seen selling potato and onion at ` 40-a-kilo while the price of other vegetables were very high compared to other markets in the district. Fishes and chickens were sold like hot cakes.A district official said only a few truck loads of potato, vegetables and fishes reached Soro on Wednesday. The price was high since the supply was less but it will come down in a day or two, he added."

The decline in wholesale prices was seen across the board  vegetables (-24.10 per cent), onion (-51.51 per cent) and oil seeds (-5.05 per cent)  not much different from the Consumer Price Index data released earlier this week. However, some experts say that the decline in wholesale inflation along with a fall in retail inflation, which hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent in November, should not be a cause of concern.The decline in vegetable prices is directly linked to lack of cash in peoples hand following the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 9 and the inability of Reserve Bank of India to pump in required currency into the system.The outlook for agriculture sector growth this fiscal year is optimistic which will help keep food prices in check and will also support overall growth, said Harshavardhan Neotia, President, FICCI. Others feel the situation is likely to remain same for the next month, especially with disturbance in global oil prices. ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar pointed out that rising global commodity prices and a waning of the base effect would push up WPI in December.Commerce Ministry data in October showed prices of pulses continued to rule high in the wholesale market. The decision of the RBI to retain the existing interest rates was on the belief that the demonetisation could lower prices of perishables and reduce CPI inflation by 10-15 basis points by December."

Most of them are being paid in Rs 2,000 and in order to get a change for the note, these labourers have to pay a commission of Rs 200 to the kirana shops on the market premises.What would I do with a Rs 2,000 note? wonders Ramulu, a 30-year-old labourer who has been working in the market since his childhood. Five of us have to divide the money. We get the notes exchanged at kirana shops at a commission, he added. Ramulu, nor the other four who work with him, have a bank account. Meanwhile, the kirana shop owners denied charging a commission for changing the Rs 2,000 notes brought to them by labourers. The labourers were reluctant to point out the shop keepers who took the commission. They will not change our notes, said Laxman.The labourers are hired in clusters, explains S Pandu an onion dealer. We hire four to five of them for a day and pay all them by the evening with Rs 2,000. Its up to the labourers to figure out a way to break the big notes into small ones, he added. While we can pay them in cheque, the workers themselves prefer to be paid on the same day itself. Most of them dont even have a bank account, he said.SubhedThe Onion Traders Association had declared a ten day bandh following the announcement of demonetisation which ended on Nov 24. For the interim period, the Telanagana State Agricultural Marketing Committee (AMC), under the directions of Harish Rao, minister for irrigation, directly supplied onions in the city. The AMC too had left the labourers in the lurch paying the daily wages with old notes. The officials now insist the traders to the pay the labourers through cheques.I need the money to meet daily expenses. The cheque takes time, says Laxman, another daily wage labourer. He has a zero balance account opened under the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana at his home town in Mahabubnagar. But he does not know how to operate it.

The cheque takes three to four days to get credited. We are ready to accept online transfers but the traders are not accepting this, Bhaskar said.The problem is that there is a cash crunch. It is near impossible for us to get small change, C Mahesh, who works as an accountant for a chilly dealer.We cant pay truckers in cash as we cant withdraw beyond Rs 24,000 a week. Also it takes us time to deposit cash because of long queues. So cheques are our only option for now, he added."

This was after the onion dealers association called a ten-day strike which comes to a close on Friday.Irrigation minister T Harish Rao had directed the AMC officials to supply the market with onions. While this has come into effect, the AMC officials at Malakpet have been paying the daily wage labourers with the banned notes for their loading and unloading work. AMC officials at higher ups were surprised and unaware of this practice.Ramulu is a daily wage labourer working at the Sri Krupa market for 18 years. He neither owns a bank account nor an account under the Jan Dan Yojana. I earn Rs 500 a day. Yesterday also they paid me Rs 500. What option do I have? I need the money, he says. The only person who owns a bank account in his family is his wife, but she does not own an ATM card.I go to SBI and get the notes exchanged. For the past few days due to the strike we had no work, so the money we get now is important, said Mallayah, another daily wage labourer who has been working with the market for 20 years.We cant tell them that we will not accept old notes as we will have to come back here for work later, so we take the banned notes, he added.L Srinivas, the supervisor at the Sri Krupa AMC, is helpless. The state government is accepting old notes so we accept them but there are no Rs 100 notes for us to pay the workers with. We dont have a choice here, says Srinivas. Most of the workers dont have bank accounts and for those who have accounts, we cant do real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) transfers as the workers want their wages today itself, he added.People are not accepting old notes, maybe they (AMC officials at the market) are giving delayed payments because of their relationship. We are collecting market fee as per the instructions of the central government and accepting old notes, said Lakshmi, additional director, AMC."

I catch the delicate smell of boiled chana, sprinkled with coconut, and the sweet smell of rava (semolina) fried in ghee.Chef Gaurav Bathla, sous chef, says that he has tried to put one dish from every corner of the state into the buffet.Our meal starts with Kalu Palya, made of black chana. Lightly fried with onion and freshly grated coconut, the boiled-chana appetiser is a perfect way to start gorging on Kannada cuisine.Palyas such as Sabske Soppin Peda, dill leaves cooked with toor dal, and Balekayi Palya, raw banana shallow fried, is paired well with chapatti. Both the dishes  one mildly bitter and the other a little tangy  are something that most Kannadigas have grown up eating.The chef says that he got the recipes from Kannadiga friends. I learnt them from my friends mothers and grannies, who make these dishes regularly at home, he says. Little wonder then, that the fine-dining restaurant reminded me of my home kitchen.Chicken Curry is strictly for those who enjoy a spicy meal. The strong spices and the soft meat make it a must-have. To balance out the hotness, have it with roti.Mangaloreon Prawn Curry, with coconut, tamarind and red chillies, and Pandi Curry, pork cooked in tamarind water and spiced with pepper, are for people who like medium spiciness. Both the dishes are easy to bite into and melt in the mouth. Rice goes best with prawn curry and pork with roti.Mandya Mutton Curry, with ghee and coconut, is a bit bland for my taste but otherwise is a good dish to try.Vangi Bath, rice cooked with brinjal, tamarind and spices, is sweet, sour and spicy. All good here.Desserts such as Dharwad Mishra Peda, Rava Unde (laddoos made from semolina lightly fried with ghee), Ante Unde (made from different dry fruits) made for a perfect closing."

He said the onion production was noted more in Jogulambha and Wanaparthy districts.In August and September 2015 onion seeds were distributed to farmers at 75 per cent subsidy which led to onions being planted on 9,000 acres. As a result, there was no major shortage of onions in the state, he said. He said that the market price for onion has gone down due to the supply of stock from Maharashtra."

My love for travelling has not only helped me explore new places but also gives me the opportunity to meet people from different cultures, try out food from different cuisines and get acquainted with exotic ingredients. These special ingredients are great to play around  as they test ones creativity, they also lead to some experimentation with unique and innovative recipes. Two ingredients which I really enjoy cooking with are John Dory also known as St Pierre or Peters Fish and the black truffle, popularly known as the black diamond of kitchen.I believe it takes a great understanding of gastronomy and palate along with little creativity to bring forth some delectable recipes. One such recipe, which is really close to my heart is Pan-seared John Dory with Black Truffle and Sweet Potato Mash along with Martini Veloute, Red Wine Sauce and Buttered Vegetables.This dish is very simple, yet an intricate amalgamation of unique flavours bringing together the mild taste and texture of the fish with one of the rare ingredients in the world  black truffle. This unusual fish needs to be cooked in a hot pan, basted with butter and thyme. For the mashed potatoes, you need to boil the sweet potatoes in milk and then mash them into a smooth paste with a few dollops of butter and shaved truffle. Season it with some salt and pepper according to your liking. Stir fry seasonal vegetables with butter and plate them along with Martini Veloute and red wine sauce. For making the Martini Veloute, all you need to do is reduce vermouth with sweet onion and cream. The red wine sauce is no rocket science, just a de-glazed pan with red wine. Surprisingly, it adds an exquisite taste to the dish and goes very well with the texture of the fish.Both these ingredients are unique in their own territory and this dish brings together the mild taste and unique texture of John Dory along with the flavour of the rarest ingredient in the world  black truffle.Ramasamy Selvaraju, Executive Chef, Vivanta by Taj"

Thats how we have Moplah Food Festival happening at Aish, The Park which will be on till November 20.So what exactly is the new fetish about Moplah food? Its a region of North Kerala dominated by Muslim population who trace their roots to the Arabs as the latter came to the region for the trade of spices and silk. Talk about spices and the same reflects in the cuisine. Chef Abida Rasheed speaks amiably dropping abundant portions on our plates asking the stewards to bring more warm food. There was not command in her tone but affection that reflects in the dishes she so lovingly cooks. We enjoyed eating Mutton Ishtew that had the desired consistency, neither gooey nor sticky  just the right thickness that you can relish with Kerala Parota. The potatoes were succulent and dissolved with the curry, the mutton pieces were juicy and soft. The green coriander leaves just added the ghar ka khana bit. Food needs to be cooked in clay pots as the same give breathing space to your food which keeps your food fresh for a longer time, said the chef.Its not just clay pots that do the wonder, the use of ghee gives the food its own deliciously different taste thats how the mutton biryani she cooked turned out to be really different from what we eat in Hyderabad, Calcutta or Lucknow. The rice used wasnt the long-grained biryani rice, instead the grains were smaller and better known as Khaima rice. She describes, Earlier this rice used to grow in valleys and as the wind blew the crop became more fragrant. It cooks really well giving the biryani its unique texture.We relished Kozhi Nirachathu, pot roasted chicken with deep-fried onion gravy that had that subtle sweet flavour. Begum Abida added, We use spring chickens that dont weigh more than 400 gms. The bones of these chickens give that special flavour and taste to the curry.And not just these dishes there are a variety to be relished such as: Meen Porichattu, Vada with thenga manga chutney, Kadala Kari, Parupu Kari and more. It was the dessert which amazed us. The egg yolk and white had been separated and cooked differently. The egg white was steamed with sugar, while the yolk was whisked and dropped in loops in hot boiling sugar syrup which gave it noodle like shape and consistency. It was topped on the sweet steamed white. Any guesses for the name? Its that famous Mutta Mala people associated Moplah cuisine with.Price: `999 all inclusive for lunch and `1,495 all inclusive for dinner."

The traders on a daily basis make an average payment of `20,000-`70,000 per truck.Most of us here deal with a minimum of three truck loads a day. With the banks giving us just `10,000 for a week, how do they expect us to do any business? Kranti added.Marketing minister T Harish Rao had warned the onion dealers not to create an artificial scarcity. He has directed the marketing departments to procure onions directly from the farmers and bring them to Malakpet and Rythu Bazars.On Wednesday, three days after the strike began, the largest onion market in Telangana wore a deserted look with very few shops open. And the few shops that were open do little business.Who is buying? Yes there is demand for onions but who has money to pay for it? said another trader who did not wish to be named. Venting his anger on the government, he said, The government clearly hasnt thought this through, he added.I am not sure how the state government is going to bring onions directly to the markets, said Paresh K, an onion trader. Most of the farmers deal only in cash as a vast majority of them dont have bank accounts, he added.The onion dealers are of the opinion that since the market they operate out of is government owned, the state should accept the exchange of the banned notes. The farmers too are not ready to sell. They accept only cash and do not trust online banking. I am ready to pay them right now but they are not willing, Paresh said.Attempts to get in touch with officials from marketing department proved to be futile."

He referred to the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 following years of racial inequity, adding: ""We are running on inclusiveness, optimism and hope, and that will translate into a progressive presidency on issues of diversity and inclusion.""As Obama prepares to leave the White House, America is increasingly, and in the estimation of many, irreparably divided by race, class and religion. What Republican candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign has done is to make targeting people of a different skin color not just acceptable, but chic.The devastating effects could linger awhile, even if he loses. In New York, which like California, was once considered a bastion of pluralism, Mexican school students have been told to ""go home"". In Georgia a militia of gun owners prepare to withstand the anticipated onslaught on their way of life should Hillary Clinton become president. The group welcomes immigrants, but only from Europe.The possibility of Donald Trump becoming the next US president is dire enough to have sent many to psychiatrists. Other Americans have contemplated moving to Canada or New Zealand.The unspoken apprehension of impending doom seems pervasive among all but the faithful. In Chicago, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev was asked as to how Americans should deal with the voter's moral dilemma in the most contentious presidential campaign in recent American history. His answer was that what the country needed was a considered vote, not a ""committed"" one.Bertrand Russell once said that one of the problems in the world is that fools and fanatics are so sure of themselves while the wise are full of doubt. Like the far right elsewhere, Indian Americans supporting Trump are absolute -- both in their certitude and their manifestations of ferocious piety.At the Hindus for Trump event organized in New Jersey recently, Bollywood actress Malaika Arora revved up the audience before Trump made his appearance to declare that ""I am a big fan of Hindu"". By many accounts, well over 90 percent of the three million Indian Americans are anti-Trump. (Indians like many immigrants tend to vote for the Democrats.)Hindu Americans appeared to gravitate to Trump for his relentless anti-Muslim rhetoric and his professed admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the euphoria of a new found savior, history was the first casualty. New Jersey is no stranger to bigotry. As recently as the early 1990s, the state was infamous for the dot busters', gangs which targeted bindi' wearing Hindu women. In the post 9/11 America, there have been also instances of Hindus and Sikhs being targeted because they were perceived as being Muslims. How would Donald Trump isolate Muslims while preventing the targeting of other South Asians? Neither the organizers nor the audience appeared perturbed by such subtleties.Analysts have said that with Donald Trump, the Republicans -- the party of Abraham Lincoln -- has become one for those without college degrees. Like right-wing politicians in Europe and elsewhere, he has tapped into the fear of free trade and immigration among blue collar workers in parts of America known as the rust belt.He has obliterated election traditions -- not releasing his tax returns and even refusing to accept the election results unless he is declared the victor.At his campaign events, journalists are corralled and the audience encouraged to boo at them. This has reinforced Trump's image as a martyr against the establishment and the rigged' media.Trump has become such an effective parody of himself that the staff of the satirical magazine The Onion found themselves creatively bankrupt trying to caricature him.Trump's affairs of the heart are famously ephemeral. It was not long ago when, railing against outsourcing of American jobs, he put on a fake Indian accent to mimic a call center worker.Indian Americans basking in his affection today may discover rather quickly that Trump's infatuation can shift in a heartbeat. And it was Napoleon Bonaparte who warned that one who knows how to flatter is equally adept at slander."
58fdb1cb7be9e012bf285930,Lebanon's national museum reveals long-hidden treasures,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2016/nov/01/lebanons-national-museum-reveals-long-hidden-treasures-1533833.html,2016-11-01,"BEIRUT: Beirut's National Museum has opened its basement of ancient treasures for the first time in four decades to show the public its stunning array of funerary art, including the world's largest collection of anthropoid sarcophogi.The new exhibition's 520 pieces range from the Paleolithic period to the Ottoman Empire. They include Phoenician stelae and rare medieval Christian mummies along with the anthropoid coffins, which display a human face on the sarcophogus and were long a standard for the elite.Some of the items have never before been on public display.Other pieces have not been shown since the 1970s, when the museum was forced to shut down because it sat on the frontline that ran through the city during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.""This is a lesson in courage and hope because 41 years after the museum was closed in 1975, we today are able to receive visitors on three floors,"" says museum director Anne-Marie Maila Afeiche.The archaeological museum was renovated after the years of fighting and shelling damaged its building and exhibits, and reopened in the 1990s.But the current exhibit is the first time its basement has been open since the civil war.Among the treasures of often-breathtaking beauty is a fragment of a Roman sarcophagus found in Beirut that depicts the myth of Icarus, who is shown alongside his father Daedalus, making his ill-fated wings.Another gem is an extraordinary hypogeum -- an underground tomb -- accidentally discovered by a farmer in the Tyre region in 1937.It is covered with restored frescoes inspired by Greek mythology, including a scene of Priam on bended knee begging Achilles to return the body of Hector.- 'Belongs to humanity' -""It was essential to show the public this heritage, which belongs to Lebanon and humanity, that was lying in our storage,"" said Afeiche.All of the exhibits on display in the museum were excavated across Lebanon, which is rich with historical sites and artifacts.They include a premolar from 70,000 BC belonging to the first known example of a homo sapiens in Lebanon, and stretch through to an 1830 Ottoman stele adorned with a turban.Among the collection's flagship displays is a series of Phoenician sarcophagi dating from between the sixth and fourth century BC that were found in the southern region of Sidon.""We're exhibiting 31 of these sarcophagi at the moment,"" which mix Greek and Egyptian styles, said Afeiche, noting that some of the sarcophagi found in Sidon are currently displayed in the Louvre.This is ""the largest collection of anthropoid sarcophagi in the world,"" she added.But perhaps the most striking part of the exhibit is the unprecedented display of three mummies found in 1989 by cavers in the Qadisha Valley.The area is a UNESCO World Heritage site and its cave-pocked sheer rock faces provided refuge for Maronite Christians persecuted during the Mamluk and Byzantine eras.""They were discovered in a cave along with eight naturally mummified bodies"" wearing the clothes of of women and children, in some cases the 13th-century silk embroidery still intact.- More treasures to display -Around them were nuts, onion skins, ceramics, bronze tools and documents written in Arabic and Syriac.""They were psalms and liturgical chants that showed that these were Christians who had taken refuge in this cave,"" said Afeiche.The three mummified bodies are particularly rare as Lebanon does not have a tradition of mummification, according to Marco Samadelli, director of the EURAC centre in Italy, who offered his expertise to help conserve the unique mummies.Italy contributed 1.02 million euros ($1.1 million) to the project of restoring the museum's basement and collection, along with the expertise of leading archeologists including Antonio Giannarusti.Even with the basement now open, the museum's storage areas contain plenty of undisplayed pieces and the culture ministry has plans for a new history museum in Beirut as well as museums in both Sidon and Tyre.The new exhibition provides a timeline of burial techniques, from a 6000 BC Neolithic cradle tomb to a 4BC Chalcolithic burial jar found in Byblos.Phoenician urns holding cremated remains are exhibited alongside a Byzantine-era tomb decorated with the face of the Virgin Mary from 440 AD.""We believe this is the oldest representation of the Virgin discovered to date in Lebanon,"" said Afeiche.The largest is the hypogeum from Tyre, with frescos reminiscent of Pompeii. One of its sides features an inscription: ""Be brave, no one is immortal."""
58fed8067be9e0420db2822d,Erratic rain hits veggie prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/odisha/story_97421.jsp,2016-07-19,"Bhubaneswar, July 18: Customers are moving around in market places with long faces. With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."
58fedb9a7be9e0420db287e4,Dhaba at Ballygunge Phari downs shutters as owners 'retire',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160711/jsp/calcutta/story_96003.jsp,2016-07-11,"The Dhaba, the landmark food stop at the Ballygunge Phari crossing and one of the oldest tandoori eateries in south Calcutta, has downed shutters. A notice pasted on the closed entrance announces the ""complete and permanent closure"" of the dhaba that dates back to pre-Independence. The reason cited on the notice is ""physical inconveniences"" of the partners who have become ""senior citizens"" and ""non-availability of any of their next kin in the City"". The notice is dated June 28 and the closure, it mentions, became effective from 6am the day after. ""We are three brothers. I am 70 and the youngest among us is 64. We want to retire now,"" said Avtar Singh, the eldest. ""Our next generation has migrated to Canada. Those who are here do not want to join the business."" The family had two other dhabas. The Hindusthan Park one was rented out earlier this month .Another, in Bagha Jatin, is functional but Manjinder Singh, the youngest, says he sits there only for an hour in the morning. The closure of the Ballygunge Phari landmark came as a bolt from the blue for the 42 permanent employees and seven casual workers. ""We worked as usual till Monday (June 27). Tuesday is our weekly closure. On Wednesday, we found this notice on coming here,"" said Alok Debnath, who worked for 14 years as a table boy. Kanai Das, the biryani cook, still has his wallet and mobile phone locked inside. They have been offered settlement of their dues but they want their jobs back. Customers are surprised too. ""The Dhaba is one of the places we regularly order food from for our staff room. Who knew they were planning to shut down!"" wondered Neelanjana Dasgupta, a teacher of South Point School. She would miss her favourite Keema Stuffed Kulcha that came with a kebab of choice. ""I also used to pick up Sarson Ki Saag and Makki Di Roti sometimes for dinner."" Workers insist that footfall was not lacking. ""Daily sales would run upto a lakh or so and double on special occasions,"" claimed Gour Baidya, a waiter at the eatery since 1978. Top picks included Tandoori Chicken, Reshmi Kebab, Mutton Tikka Onion and Do Pyaza. ""No one makes tadka in south Calcutta like we do,"" said Manjinder, a claim enthusiastically echoed by the workers. ""Customers got our rolls packed for relatives before flying to Singapore or London,"" Manjinder added. The Dhaba counted several celebrities among its patrons. ""Orders came from Tollywood superstar Prosenjit's office across the road. Om Puri dropped by whenever he was in town. Suchitra Sen loved our roll and mentioned that in several interviews. There was a time when she would wait in the car for the delivery,"" said Manjinder. Among the other famous faces that dropped by over the years are former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farukh Abdullah, actor and columnist Victor Banerjee and Tolly heart-throb Dev. ""Victor Banerjee has had tea on our roof-top on several occasions. The restaurant was single-storeyed then,"" recalled Manjinder. The Dhaba was started by Sardar Gurbachan Singh, the father of the present owners, in the 1930s. ""He got a trade licence from the British in 1938 which still hangs inside the locked premises,"" said Manjinder. ""My father's bus driver friends used to complain of the lack of a tea stall on their route from Jadavpur to Esplanade."" Thus the place started as a tea shop which also sold milk. Gradually the benches in the single-storeyed structure gave way to tables and chairs and in the late 1970s, a floor was added. Air-conditioned seating was introduced about two decades ago. A Punjabi cuisine specialist, The Dhaba added rolls and then Chinese to its menu around 2001-02. Biryani and other north Indian dishes were added about 10 years ago. ""Our biryani was favoured for being less oily. In recent years, we innovated with Babycorn Roll and Diet Roll, which used rumali roti in place of paratha,"" said Manjinder. The Bagha Jatin Dhaba does not offer all this. ""People here care more for good food than good health,"" he said, from behind the counter on Sunday morning. The workers, who gather habitually at The Dhaba every day, feel that the Ballygunge restaurant will reopen in a different avatar. But the owners say they have not decided what to do with the property at such a prime location. For now, they have ""long vacations"" and ""trips to Punjab"" on their mind. Will you miss The Dhaba?

She may have to settle for becoming the first female leader of the free world.Her journey has been unlike any seen in American politics: great promise, excruciating setbacks, bitter scandal, stunning comebacks, and especially reinvention  of her own life, and as a result, of the role of women in government. Its one that has fascinated not just her own country, but the world.Watch Video: Whats making newsThink about it: Is any woman more recognizable on a global scale than Hillary Clinton? If Barack Obama was the presidential candidate who seemed to come out of nowhere, Clintonsthe candidate who seemed to come out of everywhere.Americans first knew her as a governors working wife in Arkansas, then as the nations first lady  half of Bill Clintons Buy one, get one free bargain. Touched by scandal, she nonetheless emerged to become a hard-working senator, the first first lady to gain elected office. She was the presidential candidate who suffered a stinging defeat to Obama, but proudly claimed 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling.Then she reinvented herself again, becoming Obamas secretary of state, traveling to 112 countries.We knew her so well by then. Or not.Perhaps its a question of layers, so many different roles. But theres also a sense of impenetrability, exacerbated by Clintons penchant for secrecy  a characteristic thats led to her greatest vulnerability now: the email scandal.For the last 14 years, and 20 overall, Americans polled by Gallup have named Clinton their most admired woman in the world. But consider some other titles from over the years: Lady Macbeth. Washington insider. Robotic. Wildly ambitious. Congenital liar.But also: Feminist heroine. Glass-ceiling breaker. The most prepared in the room. The most qualified presidential candidate ever. Loyal friend. Witty companion. Mom. Grandma.There have been polarizing figures in politics before, but its hard to imagine any have been called as many wildly divergent things as Hillary Clinton. Does everyone simply have their own version of her?THE AMBITION THINGSaturday Night Live has been turning out Hillarys for some 25 years. There have been nine, including Miley Cyrus rapping in a bandeau. But theres been one constant: Ambition.No, MINE! blurted out Amy Poehlers Hillary in 2008, of her thwarted road to presidential glory. More recently, Kate McKinnons Hillary moaned, Why wont the people just let me LEAD?Comedy aside, the ambition tag has dogged Clinton, 68, as if it were a bad quality rather than a necessity. The satirical website The Onion captured the irony: Hillary Clinton Is Too Ambitious To Be The First Female President.That gets a laugh from Melanne Verveer, Clintons chief of staff as first lady.If a guy is described as ambitious, its a noble attribute, says Verveer. But if a woman is ambitious  its a pejorative.CHAMPION FOR WOMENHillary Rodham was already blazing a trail in 1969, the first student chosen to address a Wellesley commencement. She delighted classmates with a rebuke to the previous speaker, whose comments the grads found condescending to women.Its been a frustration to Clintons campaign that young Democrats havent responded more enthusiastically. Young people today  dont understand how much she shares those aspirations of theirs, Verveer says.A key moment in Clintons journey came in 1995, with her famous Beijing declaration: Human rights are womens rights, and womens rights are human rights.Yet her image as a champion for women has been complicated by her, well, complicated marriage  shes gotten both sympathy and blame for staying with her husband.ROBOTIC OR HUMAN?I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, Clinton offered recently.But those whove watched her up close say shes an excellent communicator; Friends always call her relaxed, funny, witty. Wellesley classmates say they cant understand the disconnect between public and private Hillary.At their 35th reunion, Nancy Herron performed a standup routine skewering Clinton  even her famous pantsuits.She sat there and just laughed her head off, says Herron. Afterward, she gave me a hug, and said, We need to take you on the road!'THE TRUTH ISSUEFair or not, dishonesty is a theme woven into the Clinton story. The most difficult thingHillary Clinton has to deal with right now is her difficult relationship with the truth, says Carl Bernstein, author of A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton.Writer Gail Sheehy attributes that difficulty to years of fending off attacks.You could call it denial, says Sheehy, author of Hillarys Choice. Its a defense mechanism she has used a great deal.The issue has never been more important. What the email mess shows, Bernstein says, is this fierce desire for privacy and secrecy that seems to cast a larger and larger shadow over who she really is.Who she really is. Theres that question again.Is it fair?Former Rep. Pat Schroeder thinks not. What more do you want to know? says the former congresswoman, who tested her own candidacy decades ago. Do they want some kind of a confession?Herron feels that we dont subject male candidates to the same scrutiny. We expect her to let her hair down, to talk about her failures and self-doubt or something, she says.You know what, shes not like that!

Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, May 26: The JMM and the Congress today launched blistering attacks on the BJP-led government that completed two years in power at the Centre. Leading the offensive, the state's principal Opposition party JMM called the Narendra Modi government a "" dholpitwa"" (one who beats his own drum), who had failed on every front - domestic as well as diplomatic - during the first two years in office. ""There is no control on the inflation, the price rise has severely hit the poor and middle class while bad loans have pushed the banks on the verge of collapse,"" said JMM working president Hemant Soren during a news meet at his Kanke Road residence in Ranchi today. ""Farmers in Maharashtra are forced to sell onion at throwaway prices; our relations with neighbouring countries like Nepal have deteriorated; but the BJP government has been busy making announcements and launching new projects over the past two years. It is a dholpitwa sarkar,"" Hemant added. The Congress today held a news conference and a rally to highlight the failures of the Modi government. AICC spokesperson Rita Bahuguna, who arrived here from Lucknow to lead the attack, said that the BJP government's achievements included only polarisation of masses on religious and communal lines and prosecution of students on the name of law and order. She also accused the BJP of protecting the interests of corporates, defaulters and fugitives like Vijay Malaya and Lalit Modi. ""The country had never faced such a bad situation... even essential commodities are out of poor people's reach. Fuel prices have dropped by 54 per cent in international markets, but the country has witnessed only 16 per cent decrease. Where has the rest of the money gone?' Bahuguna asked. While defaulters like Vijay Malya were allowed to safely escape the country, poor farmers were being harassed on the name of loan recovery. ""Modi had promised good days for farmers, but they are being forced to work as daily wage labourers. Water crisis and drought are forcing farmers to commit suicide in different parts of the country. But PM has no time to visit aggrieved people,"" she said. Around 1,000 Congress workers, led by former Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay and party spokesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo, took out a protest march from Albert Ekka Chowk to Raj Bhavan around noon. Later, a Congress delegation submitted a memorandum to governor Droupadi Murmu, pointing out failures of the Modi government in the Centre and the Raghubar Das government in the state. ""The Das government started with a bang, and within a year and half ended up in a whimper. The local residents' policy announced by the government has disappointed people,"" Sahay said. Rajya Sabha polls Senior JMM leader Hemant Soren today said that the party was considering fielding its own candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha poll. ""At this juncture, I can only say that the party may stake its claim on the seat. But a final decision will be taken by the party,"" said the Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly. Congress nominee Dhiraj Prasad Sahu has already expressed his wish to contest the Upper House seat for the second consecutive term. JMM has altogether 19 MLAs, Congress seven and JDU has two legislators, besides other smaller parties and Independents. One needs 28 first preference votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat in Jharkhand. It is still not clear whether the BJP will contest for only one seat or will go for both, the elections for which are scheduled for June 11."
