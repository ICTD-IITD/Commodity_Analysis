The people must be able to procure essential items at reasonable prices and towards this end, trade and business organisations must lend a helping hand by keeping a tight leash on prices, he said.Sonowal asked business organisations and wholesale dealers about the stock and availability of essential commodities and wholesale and retail prices. He said the wholesale dealers must strictly conform to the strictures of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department.""Wholesale dealers have equal responsibility towards the people as that of the government. By maintaining a close rapport with the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, the businessmen have to keep the prices under check,"" he added.He asked the department and the wholesale dealers to ensure that there was no scarcity of essential commodities in view of the flood situation in the state. Minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Rihon Daimari made it clear that businessmen would have to keep prices under check in tune with the guidelines of the department.Daimari apprised Sonowal of the slew of initiatives taken by his department to control prices of essential commodities by holding discussions with trade and business organisations.The meeting was attended, among others, by representatives of Chambers of Commerce, fruits and vegetables, potato and onion and egg wholesale dealers."
58fefcaf7be9e0420db2ad0d,Solar power to fields,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160810/jsp/bihar/story_101608.jsp,2016-08-10,,Telegraph,"The solar plant set up in Jamui. (below) Manoj Tanti. Telegraph pictures Manoj Tanti, a 35-year-old farmer in Jamui district's Kedia village, is brimming with pride and joy these days and the source of his happiness is a huge, white container positioned in the nearby fields. The container is the state's first solar-powered cold storage and is expected to change the fortunes of the village, around 170km southeast of Patna, home to 650 and odd people. ""We had to sell potatoes and onions at throwaway prices to middlemen. We could not store them for long at normal temperatures,"" Manoj told The Telegraph. ""But with the solar cold storage, we can keep our vegetables for longer periods and sell them at our own discretion."" This state-of-the art cold storage set up in the Barhat block of the Maoist-ravaged district has a capacity of 5 tonnes and a back-up power supply of around 30 hours. Normally powered by solar panels that heat a thermal plate replete with various devices, the cold storage can run on regular power supply and diesel generator during the monsoon. Greenpeace, the environmental NGO that adopted Kedia village in 2014, has facilitated the cold storage worth Rs 12 lakh - the funds for which were collected from the villagers and crowd funding. Over the past two years, the farmers have diversified their crops and started growing a variety of vegetables with the help of organic fertilisers and minimum use of pesticides. ""Crowd funding was managed in metro cities, with several film and television celebrities such as Waheeda Rehman, Pooja Bedi, Meiyang Chang and Pankaj Tripathi,"" said Ishteyaque Ahmad, Greenpeace's campaigner for sustainable agriculture in Kedia. ""Though there is a good demand for vegetables from this village in the market, farmers had to sell their produce at throwaway prices in the absence of a cold storage. The cold storage will be managed by the farmers' cooperative and will help them save their own seeds for crops like potato."" In a country where 40 per cent of farm produce is wasted because of no storage space and inability of small and marginal farmers to afford exploitative rates of regular cold storages, this is a boon. Ishteyaque said the cold storage is just one part of the ""Kedia model"" of sustainable agriculture developed in consultation with farmers and government officials to utilise existing central and state government schemes and subsidy programmes for rural development, agriculture and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Act. The money from these schemes have been used to construct 282 vermicompost units to provide organic fertilisers to farmers, 11 biogas plants to provide better cooking fuel, five pucca cattle sheds to help collect cowdung and urine to feed the biogas plants and for pest management solutions, and ecological toilets, with a possibility of turning excreta into fertilizer. For the next step, Greenpeace has invited labour resources minister Vijay Prakash to inaugurate the solar facility on Thursday. ""After inauguration, we are aiming to advocate for the 'Kedia model', including solar cold storage, with the Bihar government to have it on a pilot basis in at least one village in each of the 38 districts,"" said Ishteyaque. ""It should be extended to other villages as no aid is required for it and the technology is easily available."""
58ff09907be9e0420db2ba4a,Giggles in House as BJP MPs jab govt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160504/jsp/nation/story_83710.jsp,2016-05-04,,Telegraph,"Rajnath Singh outside Parliament on Tuesday.Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha New Delhi, May 3: The Lok Sabha today saw BJP MPs criticising their own government, soon after a pep talk by Narendra Modi listed its achievements and asked the MPs to take these to the people. Modi listed the Mudra scheme, increased LPG coverage and rural electrification as big achievements at a closed-door parliamentary party meeting in the morning. During the Lok Sabha sitting soon after, at least two BJP members voiced discontent on specific issues and got support from other party MPs. ""You have given a very elaborate reply but the problem remains as it is. The price of pulses is not coming down and that of onions is not going up,"" BJP MP Hukum Singh said during Question Hour. Hukum appeared unhappy that agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh had washed his hands of the problems of onion farmers, raised by another BJP MP. Replying to Sumedhanand Saraswati's plea to save onion farmers, the minister had said: ""A price stabilisation fund has been set up for potato, onion and pulses. Earlier it was with the agriculture ministry but now it has gone to the food and civil supplies ministry."" After the minister spoke about e-trading being introduced by the government, Hukum said: ""Of what use is e-trading, when farmers are being compelled to sell their onion at Rs 2/kg and even Rs 1/kg? The government should provide a solution...."" The caustic remark led to mild flutter in the treasury benches and many MPs were seen expressing their support. On another issue, another MP, R.K. Singh, embarrassed home minister Rajnath Singh. After Rajnath had firmly denied there was ever a provision for housing in the Centre's police modernisation scheme, R.K. Singh spoke up. ""I just want to clarify one fact. There was a provision for housing in the police modernisation scheme... it has been stopped since the Centre has increased the share of taxes to the states,"" the BJP MP said. Many party members were seen suppressing giggles. ""He should be made the minister,"" an Opposition MP quipped, prompting Rajnath's junior, Kiren Rijiju, to step in. ""What is this?"" he protested. The intervention seen as ""undesirable"" by many party leaders came after Rajnath had rejected Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge's claim that earlier there was a provision for housing. ""Police modernisation fund is never allocated for housing,"" the minister had said. Congress members loudly contested the denial. Rajnath remained firm till his own party MP overruled him. The minister did not contest the MP, who had retired as home secretary before joining the BJP and intermittently speaks out against the government and the party. Yesterday, another BJP MP from Bihar, Bhola Singh, had said: ""With regard to Reliance, the policy of the previous government and in some instances the present government remains the same. I want to know what is the compulsion of the government in resolving the dispute clearly and firmly with the company."" Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said with Modi as Prime Minister, there was no question of compromise, but many BJP MPs were seen congratulating Bhola."
58ff0ab57be9e0420db2bc11,"Minister absent, govt 'sorry'",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160505/jsp/nation/story_83929.jsp,2016-05-05,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, May 4: The scheme has smart written into it with a capital ""S"" but the government was left smarting. Not often does the Speaker haul up the ruling dispensation. And if that wasn't enough, a minister had to say ""sorry"" too. The moment of embarrassment came after neither railway minister Suresh Prabhu nor his junior, Manoj Sinha, was found to be not present in the Lok Sabha today when the House took up a question relating to a smart card scheme for train tickets during Question Hour, the 11am-to-12-noon daily slot when Parliament is in session. Under the railway ministry's ""Go-India Smart Card"" initiative, the smart cards can be used at designated counters for getting tickets. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan voiced her displeasure after the Opposition accused the government of not following rules. ""The concerned minister should be present till the Question Hour is over.... This is not fair. It should not happen again,"" she said. Parliamentary affairs minister M. Venkaiah Naidu then apologised on behalf of the government. ""The government feels sorry for this. On behalf of the government I am feeling sorry.... It will not be repeated,"" Naidu told the House. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seen in the House in the morning, was not present when his government was left red-faced. According to rules, the cabinet minister concerned is required to be present in the House to answer questions from MPs related to their ministry. If the minister cannot attend the proceedings, he or she can inform the Speaker and seek permission to depute the junior minister. Prabhu was unavailable today, so Sinha was deputed for the Question Hour session as queries related to the ministry had been listed for the day. Sinha was present in the House in the morning and had even answered questions from MPs relating to passenger amenities at stations. But he left after some time, apparently assuming that the next listed question on railways would not be taken up because of time constraints. It wasn't the smartest thing to do, although the House usually manages to take up a maximum of five questions in the hour-long slot. Unfortunately for Sinha, eight questions were taken up today, partly because one was skipped as the two MPs who -OVERMATTER- had posed the query were absent. The first and the seventh questions related to railways. ""He was very much here. He might have thought that we may not reach up to that question. But it is incorrect,"" Naidu said. Yesterday, too, the government had been left discomfited when two BJP MPs criticised their own government. One MP criticised the government for failing to control rising prices of pulses and help distressed onion farmers. The other embarrassed home minister Rajnath Singh by pointing out that he was not well informed on police modernisation. Today, Opposition Congress members were on their feet demanding that the Speaker pass a stricture against the government. ""They (the government) are not following rules. The other day, no cabinet minister was present during a discussion in the House. We remained silent. You (the Speaker) tell us to follow the rules but they (the government) don't follow rules,"" Congress leader in the House Mallikarjun Kharge said. But Mahajan refused to entertain the demand, saying she had warned the government."
58ff0cec7be9e0420db2bf5b,"Nature's bounty, poverty paradox",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160703/jsp/bihar/story_94549.jsp,2016-07-03,,Telegraph,"The sun sets over the fields and orchards and (bottom) a child nibbles on a mango in Muzaffarpur. Pictures by Ruchira Gupta We enter a world of trees dripping with mangoes in Muzaffarpur. Lychee season is over and we are in the middle of the mango season in Bihar. Muzaffarpur is known as the Lychee Kingdom. Two varieties are famous, China and Shahi, available from May to June. Its cultivation covers a farm area of about 8,000 hectares with a production of about 75,000 tonnes of lychee every year. Kranti Prakash, a local farmer, believes that the lychee is a gift from China in exchange for the gift of Buddhism from Bihar. ""That is why one of our main lychee varieties is called China."" He grows lychee, rice, mustard, bananas, squash and three varieties of mangoes - Malda, Bambaiya and Langda - on his land. He also has four kathal trees. The whole district is lush. Rice-fields, sugar-cane fields, banana groves, guava trees, grass for thatching and making ropes, and vegetables. Bihar has become the largest producer of vegetables - potatoes, onions, eggplants, and cauliflower. It is also the third largest producer of pineapple. All Bihar's rice varieties - Katika, Jagar, Satthi (ready in 60 days), Sonachur, Hathia Jhulan, Jaswa, Kasaunjih, Bakol, Tulsimanjari, Badshabhog, Laldhari, Darmi, Jagar, Kessore, Selha, Kamod, Katani, Ladaura, Mircha - are grown by farmers in the district in spite of the pressure of the markets. Mill owners tend to buy only two varieties and government agencies as well as loan companies keep pushing the high yielding variety. ""We have edible soil, that is the best variety of soil. It comes from Nepal in the Budi Gandak river every year,"" says Kranti Prakash. When I see this abundance and prosperity, I cannot understand why Bihar is poor and why so many Biharis are malnourished. Kranti explains: because of lack of amenities for the cultivator. ""If we keep promoting the high-yielding variety seeds, we will lose our diversity,"" says Kranti. He adds that he keeps back a sack of Sonachur every year to re-grow. ""If the market has its way, this will disappear."" He is also apprehensive of the micro-credit companies driving the market of the high-yielding variety seed, chemical fertilisers, and irrigation systems catering to corporate farming. ""We have a top-down approach to farming. For example a dam has been made near my village. This will lead to malaria for all and my own village is going to go under water,"" he said. I feel sad. I love the diversity of Bihar. I can get a variety of vegetables here that we cannot find in a US supermarket. Fruits are still flavourful because they are not genetically modified. The variety of rice is a part of my life as is the variety of mangoes. I eat different rice for chuda and different rice for a pilaf. I hardly touch the ubiquitous Basmati. I have been tasting different mangoes since I started the Safarnama. Bambaiya came first, then the Dasheri, Kishen Bhog and Zardalu and now my all-time favourite, Langda. I will be gone by the time Fazli, Neelum and Chausa are available in full force. It won't matter that I won't be here for the Bathua in late September, I will get the pickle made from it. It would be a pity if Basmati is the only rice left in the world, Shahi the only lychee and Alphonso the only mango. It would also be a pity if corporate farming destroyed the small landholdings with their rice-fields, vegetable patches and banana groves, a way of life that is the backbone of the country that I know.

58ff139b7be9e0413616239a,He overcomes odds to become successful writer,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/526125/he-overcomes-odds-become-successful.html,2016-01-30,,Deccan Herald,"He overcomes odds to become successful writerAbhay Kumar, Jan 31, 2016, DHNS: 23:10 ISTRatneshwar was nicknamed story master in schoolWhen he was barely a four-year-old, he lost his father. When he was appearing for class X examination, a division of property in his undivided family left him with merely Rs 7. Faced with acute poverty and eking out a living from a nominal Rs 7, the 1966-born Ratneshwar is today an author writing best sellers like Jeet ka jadu, a script-writer for TV serials, and president of Centre for Readership Development (CRD), all rolled into one. Magic in you, the English version of one of the best-sellers of 2015 Jeet ka Jadu, saw pre-booking orders for 20,000 copies.Besides, an international movie is likely to be made on his forthcoming book Rekhna Meri Jaan, which is not only based on global warming but also depicts an unusual love story with Bangladesh in the backdrop.However for Ratneshwar, who turns 50 this year, the road to success has not been a smooth one. Born in Bihars Warsaliganj, Ratneshwar childhood was spent mostly at Barahiya in Lakhisarai district in the company of his three step-brothers. The property dispute and division of assets later rendered Ratneshwar poorer.At a tender age, he was also slapped with a notice of loan worth Rs 10,000, which was taken during the wedding of his elder brothers daughter. Ratneshwar sold his mothers ornaments to repay the loan and took to farming to eke out a living.I would walk 8 km every day to reach my farm where maize and wheat were cultivated. My mother would give me sattu, salt and onion as lunch. In the absence of father, I faced acute penury in the early childhood days, he told Deccan Herald.But despite hardships, the son of the soil from Lakhisarai never gave up. His family sent him to Pataliputra school in Patna for further studies. When he was in Class V, he used to tell stories to his classmates. Soon he was nicknamed story master. He would be invited to other classes as well to narrate stories, where he would speak extempore.I was not very good at studies but when it came to telling/narrating stories, I would do so impromptu, said Ratneshwar, who later, with the help of one of his relatives, left Bihar and shifted to Nagpur for higher studies.There I completed my Class XII from St Francis College and then graduated from Nagpur University, he said. In 1988, when he was barely 22 years of age, he wrote a story Main Jaichand Nahin which was published by an Hindi publication. This story received wide acclaim.The features editor of the newspaper invited him over for a cup of tea where Ratneshwar expressed his eagerness to work for the Hindi daily. He was told to meet the editor next day at 10 am sharp. That day, it was raining heavily. I did not have an umbrella. But still I rushed to the editors office where I reached 15 minutes before the scheduled time.When the editor saw me completely drenched and enquired about it, I said: I had to reach your office on time, although I did not have money to purchase an umbrella. Deeply impressed with my honest answer, the editor called in the features editor and asked him to show me the desk where I would work, averred Ratneshwar, dwelling on his beginning as a trainee journalist. He did not continue with the newspaper for too long. But writing continued to be his passion. So he authored one book after another, all in Hindi, which sold like hot cakes. In between, Ratneshwar shifted to teaching where he taught Mass Communication at Dr Zakir Hussain Institute. This was followed by becoming a guest lecturer at Patna University, Ranchi University, IIMC, Delhi University and Benaras Hindu University (BHU).In 2006, Ratneshwar shifted to Mumbai. Struck by the glitz and glamour of the tinsel town, the author made his debut as a script writer for the TV serial Mano Ya Na Mano, for Star One. Later, noted film-maker Prakash Jha, amazed at his multi-tasking ability, assigned him the job to launch a news channel Maurya TV. In the meantime, Ratneshwar continued writing. In 2011, Lt Hudson followed by Jeet ka jadu became one of the best sellers and won him plaudits.In December 2015, the English version of Jeet Ka jadu, worked wonders for me. There were pre-booking orders for 20,000 copies of Magic in you, something unusual for a book being translated from Hindi, averred Ratneshwar.At present, the author is giving final shape to his latest book Rekhna Meri Jaan, based on global warming. Its not only based on global warming in Antarctica but its a love story in the backdrop of Bangladesh, he says, refusing to share more details as a Hollywood movie is slated to be made based on his book. Talks are in the preliminary stage. But since its an off-shore movie, it wont be prudent to share more details right now, he signs off."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160912/jsp/jharkhand/story_107636.jsp,2016-09-12,,Telegraph,"Govinda's in Bistupur, Jamshedpur, which serves only vegetarian snacks. Telegraph picture Have puja at home but feel like snacking? Breaking a fast but don't feel like cooking? Want to carry some food for your conservative mother-in-law who doesn't take onion and garlic? If you've faced these situations and wracked your brains for a solution without finding any, here's Iskcon (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) to your rescue with its satvik food. Iskcon has launched its Govinda's eatery in Jamshedpur, its first foray in Jharkhand, on September 9 to mark Radha Ashtami. A mobile unit for now for lack of space, the van is parked in Bistupur at Inner Circle Road behind Gopal Maidan. The timings are between 5.30pm and 10pm. Govinda serves about 25 dishes, including dosa, vegetable cutlet, aloo paratha, chilli paneer and gobi manchurian, all free of onion and garlic. In fact, the food is prasad. Just like bhog in temples, food first served to lord Krishna is then mixed with what is prepared for mass-scale consumption. Govinda's restaurants are famous across the world for satvik food. They have a presence in 1,000-plus venues across the world, including New York City, Los Angeles, Hawaii and Tuscon to name a few. In the New York restaurant, apart from samosas, tofu and quinoa salad are their pop picks. In fact, there's a Govinda's eatery wherever there is an Iskcon temple. ""In India, there are about 130 temples with its headquarters at Mayapur in Bengal. But, in Jamshedpur, there is no temple as yet,"" said P. Jagannath Das, a preacher of Iskcon. ""Still, we wanted to offer satvik food to people and they are liking it,"" he said. According to Das, a majority of the menu changes everyday. ""Quantity is less, there is no wastage and no stale food. Ask anyone who's tried our food anywhere in the world. We are known for our fresh, homemade offerings without preservatives, which are as healthy as possible. The cooks are Iskcon members who maintain utmost cleanliness and hygiene while preparing food,"" Das said. Since its launch, business has been brisk. ""Who normally finds satvik food in the city? It's great for some communities who avoid going to restaurants because they don't want garlic or onions. Food here is also very hygienic and tasty,"" said Suresh Sonthalia, Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry president, who went to the outlet on Day One. Govinda's is a good way to have satvik food and generate revenue for the organisation that undertakes social projects. Iskcon runs the Akshaya Patra project that prepares midday meals to around 63 government schools in East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan daily."

58ff1f2b7be9e0420db2cfea,River of discontent where 'cusec' is a call for war,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160913/jsp/nation/story_107927.jsp,2016-09-13,,Telegraph,"A woman takes her child from a Karnataka Sangha school in Chennaion Monday. (PTI) Chennai, Sept. 12: Just say ""Cauvery"", and you could end up hitting a raw nerve in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The two states have been fighting for centuries for their share of water from the river, which feeds the rice bowls of both. While less water has been flowing down the river - for both climatic and man-made reasons - the size of the area it irrigates has been increasing in both states, particularly in Karnataka. A tribunal award in 2007 that instructed Karnataka to release 192 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year has aggravated the dispute (it's not yet settled how much the release should be in distress years). When Karnataka has a poor southwest monsoon, like this year, things turn especially tricky as the water stored in its reservoirs is just enough for drinking and not for irrigation. So when the Supreme Court on September 5 directed the state to release 15,000 cusec water every day till September 15 to Tamil Nadu (about 1.3tmcft per day), furious farmers and pro-Kannada outfits in Karnataka directed their anger against the rulers of both states. Today, the top court revised the award to 12,000 cusec a day till September 20. In Tamil Nadu, every small legal victory on the Cauvery (or Mullaperiyar, in the case of Kerala) is flaunted by the ruling AIADMK as yet another feather in Amma's cap. This further provokes the pro-Kannada groups in Karnataka, who see their government as the loser in the duel in spite of controlling all the dams that store the Cauvery's waters. So the easy targets of their anger are vehicles from Tamil Nadu, Tamil films, eateries with distinct Tamil names and the Tamils living in large numbers in Bangalore and Kolar district. As interstate road transport grinds to a halt, trade and the movement of people are hit. While the arrival of tomatoes and onions in Tamil Nadu dwindle, the farmers growing them in Karnataka stare at losses because of the consequent glut. Similarly, milk and eggs from Tamil Nadu stop moving to Karnataka, the tensions thus hitting both states economically. In Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery dispute feeds into the rivalry between the two Dravidian parties to prove which of them is the greater protector of Tamil interests. So the verbal duel between the DMK and the AIADMK grows to its shrillest, with each accusing the other of not doing enough to get Tamil Nadu its share of the water. The two parties often send separate delegations to Delhi to fight the state's case, in contrast to the unity displayed by Karnataka parties. It is in this context that fringe Tamil groups try to grab their brief moments of fame by attacking vehicles from Karnataka or businesses run by Kannadigas. Although they claim that their attacks are aimed at deterring violence against Tamilians, such incidents in these days of 24-hour television news have exactly the opposite effect. ""It was only after New Woodlands (a hotel owned by a family with Karnataka roots) was attacked in Chennai early today that the Adayar Ananda Bhavan in Bangalore (part of a chain of restaurants with Chennai-based owners) got vandalised,"" a senior police officer said. Even when the monsoon is not playing truant, the Cauvery remains a sore spot as Karnataka wants to build one more dam at Mekadattu, 110km from Bangalore, to feed its capital's growing drinking water needs. Tamil Nadu sees it as another plea to deprive it of its tribunal-stipulated share of water. One solution mooted to decrease the two states' dependence on the Cauvery is to link the peninsular rivers starting from Mahanadi in Odisha down to the Vaigai in southern Tamil Nadu. With Tamil Nadu already locked in water wars with three neighbouring states - including Andhra Pradesh -however, that proposal may never take off. Farmers in the Cauvery delta have been slowly resorting to alternative crops that need less water compared with rice. This could create another kind of dependence on other states - for rice - by lowering rice production in Tamil Nadu. ""Even in a good year, the water flow along the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu is hampered by the huge pits created on the riverbed by reckless sand mining. The irrigation channels are not desilted, either, to take the water to the tail-end areas,"" an agricultural scientist said. ""We should address these issues with greater sincerity, too, while we demand our share of the water."""

58ff38d87be9e0420db2ea67,A day at the harbour,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161103/jsp/opinion/story_117017.jsp,2016-11-03,,Telegraph,"Cinema, writing and photography come together, sometimes, to create for us the mysterious power of particular human faces. Through the experience of a face viewed, read about, shared and remembered, we may confront certain powerful emotions within ourselves - fears and desires that we could have scarcely managed, or dared, to put in words had the work not been done for us by others. For me, this has been the case with the faces of two extraordinary actors: Monica Vitti and Isabelle Huppert. Especially Vitti, as she appears in the early black-and-white films of Michelangelo Antonioni: L'avventura, La Notte, L'eclisse (The Adventure, The Night, The Eclipse, the Italian and English words attaching themselves somewhat differently to her face in each film), and then his journey into colour, The Red Desert (Il Deserto Rosso), all made in the early Sixties. On the one hand, there are the films - transcendently in the past, yet repeatedly watched (even stalked), fully or in fragments, in the vanished cinema-halls of my student years and now in the privacy of my home, thanks to YouTube and torrents. On the other hand, these films have haunted some of the writers and artists I follow: Coetzee (in Youth), Roni Horn and Anne Carson have made with Vitti's face, words and actions their own bodies of visual, fictional and poetic work, Horn having blurred the lines between image-making and writing with both Vitti and Huppert. Add to this what we, as viewers, readers and communicators, do with these primary and secondary materials, working them into our own and our friends' memories with our phones and laptops, making screenshots, putting clips and images on Instagram and Facebook, or as WhatsApp profile pictures, where they get interlaced with other images, usually photographs of 'real' people and places, or pages from books we happen to be reading, so that these faces become dramatis personae in our private image-repertoires and visual diaries. This is how their faces become our faces, their films become our films, our films become our friends' films, and how memory and art perform their secret ministries, through viewing and grabbing and thieving and sharing, and the subtitles and lines of poetry become parts of this work, as the faces pass into our fantasies and waking dreams, and, in turn, into other people's dreams and memories, into their perceptions of us. What a journey this is from the objectivity of photography towards the making of subjectivity and of complex emotions! This, for me, is the endless work of modernity, of our being both in time and out of time, the illicit and illegal devouring power of our eyes and our gadgets, and the transforming power of our minds and memories, at once acquisitive and generous, possessive and promiscuous, scrupulous and unscrupulous, restless, prodigious, and compulsively, compellingly and vitally useless. In her capacity for metaphysical boredom, what is Monica Vitti, as Antonioni captures her in these films, but the muse and presiding deity of the pointlessness of life itself, confounding the beautiful and the sublime, which Edmund Burke had wanted to keep so carefully apart? Three things were happening simultaneously in my life over the last weekend. I was watching Red Desert on my laptop, watching and making notes in preparation for a lecture on industrial photography. This was interrupted by a day trip I made by car with my friend and her daughter to Diamond Harbour, where, as a friend of my mother used to put it in her inimitable manner, the domestic help elopes with the driver, with tragic consequences. I was constantly making photographs, too, out of these two experiences and sharing them on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp with friends and quasi-friends. And because of how these things were all happening in the interstices of one another, I woke up the next morning with this piece of writing going round and round in my head like an unforgettable dream. So I wrote it up, convinced that in the writing of it I would be able to grasp, if only for myself, the meaning of the life of certain images in the making of our selves in time. Once, on her way back home from a journalistic assignment, my friend had stopped briefly at a resort on Diamond Harbour. It was dusk, the place was deserted and the river was magical in the setting sun. So, that memory compelled her to take her daughter and me back to this resort for lunch on Saturday. We set out in her car in the morning, and by the time we reached, our nerves were wracked by the menace of the narrow road on which speeding buses and trucks kept coming at us as if with an intent to crush and kill. Children are free of the fear of death: her daughter first slept in the car and then played games on her mother's phone, unaware of the panic building up in us. We got there around noon. The sun was strong, the river dazzling and wide, but the people at the reception were unwelcoming towards visitors who came in small cars for the day and wouldn't let us walk or the child play on their lawns by the river. We tried the state-run tourist lodge next door. It looked desolate and sleazy, and was equally unwelcoming on hearing that we were not going to check in. We moved along to a hotel further down the road, where they were nicer at the desk with two dead clocks showing the time in London and New York. Their dining hall was walled off from any sort of view, so we persuaded them to lay a table for us in a passage with windows looking out on the lawn and a swimming pool at the back. We ate an overpriced and unremarkable lunch as the breeze blew in the stench of the fisheries nearby. The child quickly worked through her sandwiches and ran out to swing and slide. The hotel seemed deserted, but the light outside had turned golden, the rice was settling inside us, and the river shimmered just out of sight. We could have been in one of those silent towns in L'avventura, into which Vitti and her friend-turning-into-lover might have strayed flatly for a non-conversation and nothing else to do, a town through which empty trains pass from time to time. I took a picture on my phone of a bird with a long forked tail sitting absolutely still on a bare tree in the middle of a paddy field beyond the pool and whatsapped the photo to a friend in Milwaukee. She wrote back saying that it filled her with a yearning for the green-and-gold stillness of the afternoons of her childhood forty years ago, when they would stop at Diamond Harbour on the way to their ancestral village. At that time, there was just a dusty road, the river and the government lodge, then glittering and spruce. They would buy fish from the fishermen. On our way back, we were menaced again by the traffic and collapsed on our beds to sleep off the trauma of the journey and the anticlimax of the destination. After a strong cup of tea in the evening, I looked at the photograph of the bird again, and it reminded me of the villages in the illustrated Bengali books of my early years. It was always afternoon in those picture-book villages. My nerves were still a bit frayed, but already around that whatsapped and instagrammed image of the bird on the tree in the paddy field another memory of our day out had begun to form, at once cinema and photograph, fiction and truth - private, but made and relived with a number of other people. I sat down to watch Red Desert on my bed from where I had left off before setting out for Diamond Harbour. Monica Vitti is inside a shack on another harbour, suspended between land and sea, with her shallow friends, her cold and caring husband, and that tender-eyed visitor with his half-Italian and half-German name, played by Richard Harris. They are eating quail eggs, talking about aphrodisiacs, and trying to be lecherous. In the margins of the room, Vitti and Harris are quietly attracted to each other, held in an afternoon swirling with fog, into which a strange ship enters, sending out poops of alarm because of some medical emergency happening inside the vessel. That freezing red room, the people in which seem to be nervously on the brink of a stylish orgy, is also smouldering with an intricate web of wordless feeling. Antonioni makes us observe Vitti, her husband and their friends slowly and closely. But we are made to look at everything through Vitti's watchful and listless eyes as well. The camera records not only what is going on inside the room, but also an unspeakable story building up inside a supposedly sick woman's head. The director is pushing her friends, and us, towards a certain impatience with his heroine. We feel that we know what is wrong with this woman, but this knowledge keeps getting lost in the fog that gathers around her. She wants to be loved, to be desired, we tell ourselves, she wants attention - as her little boy does later in the film, when he pretends not to be able to use his legs to stand up and walk. He is his mother's rival in attention-seeking, and wants her to tell him a story. And the story that she does tell him becomes the lushly beautiful film within the film, about a girl on an island who spots a mysterious ship that seems to come towards her and then leaves her alone on her island. The child's malingering and his mother's storytelling - the film colludes with both to give us two opaque and interlocking accounts of what can only be shown and felt but never fully explained and understood, or diagnosed and cured. Perhaps Antonioni is showing us that we are all, sometimes beautifully but more often unregarded, caught between wanting everything and wishing not to want anything at all; caught, that is, between tutti and niente, two words that are used over and over again in the film. So we often end up doing to others what we fear would be done to us, pre-empting abandonment with abandonment. Harris and Vitti sense these twinned reflexes in each other inside the shack on the harbour, as the ships appear and disappear in the fog. The sickness of her fear of being left with nothing finds its mirror-image in his never-changing heart to leave without anything. As I watched Red Desert for the umpteenth time, I kept taking screen-shots and jotting down some of the subtitles. It occurred to me that some of the subtitles could make up a poem, which I called ""Foghorn"" at first, and then decided to call ""Via Alighieri"", after the poet, and the street in the film on which Vitti wants vaguely to set up a shop. Nothing in that poem was my own, of course: White forest/ In the red desert/ Nothing/ Everything/ Even the ashtrays./ Am I leaving you/ Or are you leaving me?/ I can't decide./ I never get enough./ Why do I always need other people?/ I don't know what to sell./ Does this ship take passengers?/ Will you be the same when I return?/ Will you be there when I return?/ I can never look for long at the sea/ And not lose interest in what happens on land."

Picture by Faryal Rumi Indias famed culture of unity in diversity reflects in Chhath, Bihars biggest festival, as well. Chhath holds special importance for Hindus in Bihar. During these four days, thousands of people worship the Sun God for long life and good health. However, the festival encompasses all, regardless of faith. For instance, it is the busiest time of the year for Maimoon Khatoon, Mohammad Maqoon and many other slum-dwellers who live near the New Patna Club. For the past five decades, the duohave been making mitti ka chullah (clay stoves) for Chhath devotees who cook prasad on stoves during the festive season. For Maimoon, 72, making the stoves for devotees is not just a means to earn money, but a labour of love.I make all the stoves in traditional style with determination and devotion. For making stoves, I give up eating non-vegetarian food and avoid meals prepared with onion or garlic. Making these stoves is a time-taking process, so I start preparing it a month before the festival, she said. The clay stoves range between Rs 40 and Rs 80. For me, devotees praise is more important than money. I do not negotiate for price and sell the stoves at whatever they offer. During Chhath, Sanija Khatoon, 30, and her whole family get busy making clay stoves for devotees. Its been 55 year since my in-laws have been preparing chullahs for this festival. It is really nice that during Chhath, a festival of faith and purity, devotees use stoves made by us. We buy clay from farmers in nearby rural areas for around Rs 5,000 per tractor. We leave the clay under the Sun to make it crisp and grind it. After that we add water and make a big dough and later mould it into chullahs, said Sanija. Around 70 families near Beer Chand Patel Marg are involved in procuring and selling clay stoves. Shaheeda Khatoon, 41, sells flowers and garlands at the nearby temples. Shaheeda, who has also been helping her family prepare Chhath stoves for the past two decades, said: I have full faith in gods and goddesses and will live my life to serve them. Just like Id and Bakri Id, I celebrate all festivals with full enthusiasm and devotion. Sakeena Bano, 33, makes earthen pots, brass soops and dalas for Chhath. These are essential items for the festival, especially on the day when women offer arghya to the Sun, said Bano, who lives near Bans Ghat. On other days, she sells puja flowers and steel utensils. Every year, slum dwellers clean the Collectorate and Anta Ghats two days before Chhath, said Mohammad Ishtiyaque. We do not clean it because of money but to get the appreciation and blessings of the devotees."

The district was, once, known for its heavy rainfall. Rivers like Tunga, Bhadra, Hemavathi, Vedavathi and Yagachi were flowing throughout and keeping the region green.With a decline in rainfall, the water flowing in the rivers have reduced drastically. Chikkamagalurus water woes will only worsen if the decline in groundwater resource is anything to go by.ComparisonThe noticeable drop in the water table may be blamed on the poor monsoon. Compared to last year, the district has received 15.16% less rainfall this year. The normal average rainfall in the district is 190.4 cm. This year, no taluk has received normal rainfall. On an average, Sringeri and Mudigere taluks, situated on the periphery of Western Ghats, were receiving the highest 365.9 cm rainfall in a year, while Kadur taluk used to get 60.36 cm rainfall. This year, however, the district did not receive heavy rainfall like the Malnad.Growers of various horticulture and agriculture crops worry about losing yield. There was a delay in the onset of monsoon. We were expecting good rainfall in July and August, but there were no sufficient rains. Even farmers in Kadur who had borewells could not provide water for their crops, said the farmers.Drought tagThe state government has already declared Kadur, Chikkamagaluru, Mudigere, NR Pura and Koppa taluks as drought-hit, however, the representatives and the farmers organisations are demanding that the entire district be declared drought-hit.Majority of the borewells have gone dry in the plateau. The local bodies have already started supplying tanker water in several villages of Lakya and Ambale hoblis. Coffee, cardamom, black pepper, arecanut, and onion crops have started withering."

The funds, being sanctioned by the government towards the repair of government school buildings, is too meagre, she added.Chaitrashri exhorted Chinnaswamy to bring the woes to the notice of the government and impress upon the authorities towards increasing the annual grants to address the problems faced at many levels.Chaitrashri, who also brought to the commissions notice that the maintenance grants for school buildings is also proving less, rued that the prevailing drought has worsened the situation. The deputy commissioner is directing the authorities to sink borewells at required places, utilising calamity relief fund. The government should declare support price for arecanut and onion crops, and develop roads in Malnad region, she added.She said earlier 30 kg of rice per month was being provided to eligible ration card holders. But it has now been reduced to 3 kpg.The newly introduced coupon system to avail ration under Public Distribution System (PDS) has caused more troubles than relief. Bhagyalakshmi bonds are not distributed in a regular manner, she stated.Honorarium hike soughtThe honorarium of Zilla and Gram Panchayat members should be revised, she demanded. Executive Officer of Tarikere Taluk Panchayat Gangadhar Murthy said the Panchayat can explore its commercial avenues by buiilding a commercial complex of 20 shops on the available space. It will ensure regular income to the local body, he added.The funds towards the maintenace of anganwadis and school buildings is inadequate, so also drinking water supply. The Panchayat is also finding it difficult to pay daily wagers as per the wages fixed by Labour Department, he said.Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R Ragapriya said the lack of staffers in Zilla Panchayat, Women and Child Development Department and also Education Department increased the work pressure on the employees. Such is the situation that, some of the officials lack information on Multi-village scheme and also professional skills. Such shortcomings should be addressed by starting a separate department, she demanded.At some places, there is a need to build residential quarters to accommodate district- and taluk-level officials, she said.In his address, Chinnaswamy said, even though there has been an increase in central grants up to 50%, the problems faced by the districts are also on upward mode. Owing to lack of rainfall, livestock are facing drinking water related problems.Chikkamagaluru and Hassan districts that come under Malnad region need special grants to take up road development works, he added.Chinaswamy suggested the Panchayat authorities to submit their grievances in the form of questionnaire to the Commission.Commission Member H D Amarnathan said a decision on collecting taxes in industrial areas will be taken after due consultation with Zilla Panchayat chief executive officer.He also informed the meeting that Central government is the decision-making authority and there is no provision to relax it."

According to a press release issued by environment and wildlife conservation activist G Veeresh, The Department of Animal Husbandry is tasked with the conservation of indigenous Amrit Mahal breed of cattle with a dedicated breeding centre set up at Kaval area. To guard the area, the guards are hired on a contract basis. But the guards, instead of restricting to their job, have indulged in illegal cultivation of commercial crop.Though they are allowed to grow ragi, maize and also hay for cattle feed, they have taken to large-scale cultivation of commercial crops. It is suspected that the higher officials in the department have colluded with the guards in the illegal activity.To substantiate this, Veeresh has recalled that when the similar activity came to light during the previous year, the officials seized the crop and also auctioned it. Now, the guards have already harvested the crop, he claimed.Wildlife sanctuaryThe state government has declared Amrit Mahal Basur Kaval Area as a wildlife sanctuary in the year 2002. While the Forest Department was tasked with the protection of the sanctuary, the Department of Animal Husbandry has retained the breeding and the conservation centre under it.The kaval area also has the credit of being the only forest in open plain coming under Amrit Mahal.

Farmers, who had sowed their land with the hope of reaping a bumper harvest are now feeling dejected. Crops like ragi, jowar and onion have borne the brunt of scanty rains. More importantly, scarcity of rain has also led to acute drinking water shortage in some parts of the taluk.The monsoon had failed last year as well. However, the good rainfall during last rabi season ensured that the taluk did not face drinking water crisis. The monsoon, though was promising in the beginning, fizzled away in the later days. And now, the rains have virtually disappeared.Onion was sown on more than 2,500 hectares in Kadur taluk. Since there was no sign of rains, the farmers irrigated the crop using water from borewells for a few days. But, the borewells too failed owing to drastic depletion of groundwater. With no water, the crops have started withering, apparently affecting the yield.The recent crash in the price of onion has added to the worries of the farmers. They fear that with the prevailing price for the produce, they may not be able to recover even their investment. The farmers in Biluvala, Nagagondanahalli, Basooru and Maccheri have left the onion crops on the field without harvesting it.A farmer in Maccheri village stands to lose his onion crop grown an acre. The plants have already dried up and there are bleak chances of he recovering his investment of Rs 35,000 on seeds and fertilisers.The deficient rainfall has adversely affected ragi sown on 35,000 hectares in the taluk. Wild boars have been destroying jowar grown in Yagati hobli. Groundwater has been exploited to the hilt in the taluk. As a result, the authorities have imposed restrictions on sinking of borewells. However, a majority of the borewells have gone dry. Under these trying circumstances, farmers are also struggling to save their coconut and arecanut plantations. Drinking water crisis has assumed grave proportion in Panchanahalli, Yagati and Singatagere hoblis as well. With no other viable alternatives, the farmers in the taluk are looking up to the sky for any sign of rain."

This had made them to sow seeds of commercial crops.However the eluding of rains even after completion of one month of rainy season has made the growers to worry over the future of the crops. If rain fails, farmers will incur huge loss this year as well, said an onion grower.To cultivate onion on one acre land, the growers have to spend at least Rs 45,000 including sowing, removing weeds and applying fertilisers. A good yield can fetch at least 80 quintals of onion from one acre land. The lack of rainfall will, however, affect the yield per hectare.At present, the onion growers are dependent on borewell for irrigating the farm land. Onion plants have grown well in Nagenahalli, Biluvala, Maccheri, Chikkabasoor and other areas. Onion has been sown on 1,894 hectares in the taluk.According to horticulture department statistics, tomato is cultivated on 211 hectares land in Sakharayapattana hobli.

Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust activist D V Girish, Wildcat Member C Sridev Hulikere and State Wildlife Board former member S Girijashankar said some farmers had cultivated onions on Kaval land last year too. Some officials are cooperating with the growers for personnel benefits, they charged.He said Amrit Mahal Kaval land holders are allowed to grow staple foodgrains on two acres land. The produce can be used for consumption and the grass should be handed over to the Amrit Mahal Breed Conservation Centre, Ajjampur, to be used as feed for cattle being reared at Amrit Mahal Kaval land, according to a new order.

The officials have been backing the illegal activity.The Kaval land has been fenced and the land is being levelled for cultivation now. This will result in scarcity of fodder for cattle.

While farmers should get high price for their produce, consumers should get quality produce at a fair price.Kammaradi said, Only 41 per cent of agricultural produce are being sold at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) in the state, while the rest are being sold at villages to private traders. Even after 60 years, we could not bring at least 60 per cent of the produce under market purview. The market should go to farmers rather than farmers coming to the market. This could bring a large quantity of produce under the market purview.He said the present minimum support price (MSP) prescribed for crops by the Centre was inadequate and did not meet the actual expenses of farmers.The state government should take measures to prevent the sales of agricultural produce below MSP in APMCs by giving statutory status to MSP. Many crops like onion and coconut do not get MSP, he pointed out.Kammaradi told educational institutions to have an official tie-up with KAPC to boost the farming sector.Managing Director of Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS) Manoj Rajan, former director of Institute of Development Studies, the University of Mysore, H S Gopala Rao, former director of Madras Institute of Development Studies V K Nagaraj, former vice chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences P G Chengappa and former chairman of KAPC S Bisaliah were present."

Through e-NAM, the farmers will have a choice to log on to the platform and sell their produce at the best price discovered through a wider base of market players competing for procurement. In the first phase, 21 mandis have joined the trading platform but the government wants to connect 585 mandis in the next two years. Hopefully, if this target is achieved, the initiative will not only help significantly increase the monetary yield for the farmers but also bring about wider positive spin-offs for the economy equivalent to the potential gains from the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST). Even as the GST remains a football between the BJP and the Congress, e-NAM can integrate the entire rural landscape into uniform market, helping both growers and consumers.Since agriculture is a state subject, the Centre needs to take states on board in sewing up the e-platform into a single market without the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts coming in the way. The APMC Act, which has since been amended by 14 states to allow such a technology-driven initiative, could have been dealt with in a manner that did not require the tedious processes of amending the laws. In any case, the states which have agreed to join the initiative must be lauded for their honest intentions to help the farmers who are witnessing a crisis like situation even as the Met department is giving some hope to look skyward for normal Monsoon this year after back to back deficit for two years.As many as 25 crops would be traded on the e-NAM which is partnered in the first phase by Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh. Farmers should be able to seek the best bids for their harvest in wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, potatoes, onions, and spices among others. Such reforms which can ride the technology and involvement of trade, industry, cooperatives and NGOs, should be the top priority of the government. Similar path-breaking steps should be encouraged in water management, dry land farming, farm tools and equipment, allied activities like dairy farming and fishery and micro-financing."

Though the support price came to their rescue, the farmers are left in the lurch due to confusion prevailing over the purchase of the crop.Farmers who bring their crops to the centre, simply make their way back to their farms along with the crop, bearing the additional cost of transportation.This year, November 30 is the last date for the purchase of onions.

Relieving myself of the shoes and the heavy handbag, I dragged my feet towards the kitchen. The sight on the kitchen counter, with scattered utensils, tampered roll of kitchen towel and spilt food particles, brought a sudden surge of anger in me and drained away my appetite for coffee.I came to the living room and curled up on the sofa. Moments later, I heard footsteps coming down from the first floor which I chose to ignore, pretending to be angry at the person who had caused the devastation in the kitchen! I lay still to the sound of the clutter of plates in the kitchen. A few minutes later, my husband came up to me with a plate of onion pakodas, the smell of which made me stir up to a sitting position.As we gorged on the plate of pakodas he explained how, in an attempt to surp-rise me with a nice snack, he had gone through an unimaginably tough time! He had dug out the old recipe book to figure out the proportions, rummaged through the kitchen cabinets for the ingredients and the teary, onion cutting ordeal had almost dissuaded him from continuing with the task. But his ego didnt let him give up. Amid sweat and stress, he had completed the frying job. He had gone upstairs to freshen up before I returned, to cover up his struggle in the kitchen!We both agreed that the taste was not too bad, which encouraged him to make coffee at which he generally does not go wrong. Sipping the coffee, he confessed that it is worthwhile to learn cooking, at least the basic things. He decided right then that I should teach him how to cook a few dishes which we regularly eat. After the most needed refreshments, I agreed to it and teaching sessions started the same evening.Every evening, my husband would cook two items following my instructions. He would make notes of every dish he cooked. I should add here that his only demand during these sessions was for an apron, which we bought. He would wear it religiously and start cooking, adorning the look of a Master Chef! He perfected a dozen items, cooking under my able guidance. After each session, he would muse at the number of ingredients and the variety of spices used. This continued for about two months.One evening, during the cooking session, answering my daughters phone call, I heard him say, Dont think cooking is easy. It is a technical job. It needs full concentration. One must know the correct proportions and combinations... Make sure to learn a handful of recipes from Amma when you come home next. It will be valuable. We must admire her skills. All these days, we happily gobbled up these delicious items without a word of appreciation for her and the amount of time she spent preparing these dishes.As I looked at him thankfully, he admitted that he sincerely meant every word of it. Now, I know if I am tired or bored or not at home I can always bank on my husband to take over the cooking. He takes it as a fun activity and is a specialist now!"

They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."

The evening was free so we went to the Vadakkanathan Temple. After that we sat on a stone bench under a large and spreading tree. The gentle breeze and the serene atmosphere did much to soothe the spirit.Lakshmi was in a mood to reminisce. She spoke at length about the good old school, where she was a boarder and didnt have a care in the world. She recalled the ruses she and her friends used to wrangle permission from the warden to go shopping or watch a movie always escorted by a senior boarder, of course. Sometimes, the senior turned out to be stricter than the warden! After a lengthy pause in the conversation, Lakshmi slid off the bench and said, You know what? I am hungry. She sounded as if she had made a major discovery. So we flagged an auto and returned to the hotel we were staying at. We headed straight to the restaurant where an attentive waiter seated us and stood by to take our order. I placed my order and so did Lakashmi. As an afterthought, she asked for salad as well. The pleasant-mannered, cheerful youth was only too eager to oblige. With the air of a magician producing a rabbit out of a hat, he put the plate of salad on the table. It looked impressive with slices of tomato, cucumber and carrot artistically arranged on a lettuce base with a mound of shredded cabbage in the centre. Looks tempting, doesnt it? asked Lakshmi. If you insist, I smiled. (I never touch salad outside the home.) She turned to the waiter.Dont you have onion? she enquired. He blinked in puzzlement. So Lakshmi repeated the question. He still looked uncomprehending. Lakshmi hails from Kerala so I suggested she speak in Malayalam. She saw the sense of that and asked, Onion undoe? Enlightenment dawned and pat came the answer. Illa. (No) was the very short and very sweet answer.Why? demanded Lakshmi, lapsing into English. Her voice held a hint of irritation. The waiter literally wrung his hands in confusion. Ari illa. (Dont know.)Then, as if inspired, he added, Chechi undu. (Have an older sister.) Aniyan pronounced like onion means younger brother in Malayalam. I had a tough time keeping a straight face. Malayalam, Lakshmi, I prompted. She did switch to her mother tongue then. And bingo! The waiter nodded and hastened away to bring the smelly bulb!"

So, we reserved a fortnight just for this, the core of our Alaskan adventure!From the warm coastal Atabaskan native villages of ancient Alaskans around Anchorage, to the cooler frozen climes of the Denali National Park, into the virgin habitats of the grizzly bears inside the Clarkes National Preserve in the south-west, and the suspension bridge over the Yukon within Canadian Alaska during the White Pass Yukon Route Trail by the antique Frontier Rail, to the dwarfed and stunted vegetation of the tundra and the taiga (or the snow forest) characterised by coniferous pines, spruces and larches  we saw it all.We remembered the Klondike God Rush of 1898 and witnessed the stunning views of the Hurricane Gulch from 300 feet above the canyon again when we took the luxurious Gold Star for our return ride to Anchorage!For the helicopter ride into Lake Clarke National Preserve to encounter the grizzlies, we went to Homer  claimed to be the Halibut capital of the world; on the way to which we took a diversion to break the monotony of the drive from Whittier.This was to the beach at Ninilchik  where my grandchildren collected smooth flat-stone pebbles from the non-sandy waterline as souvenirs to inscribe each of our names on. On our way out of Homer, remembering the cute little Russian Orthodox Church with onion-shaped domes I had seen earlier, we decided to explore it further at Ninilchik village.At the Ninilchik Orthodox Church and its freshly maintained cemetery complex, we stumbled on to a fascinating tale of bygone days. Ninilchik in Kenai Peninsula, with a population of less than a 1,000, overlooks the volcanoes of Cook Inlet  Mount Spurr, Mount Redoubt, Mount Iliamna and Mount St Augustine.Historically an area used by Denaina Indians for fishing, we found Ninilchik to be also the oldest settlement on the peninsula. Even though Russian-Americans had reportedly dwindled down to almost nil in the present times, the spotless and charming beauty of fresh flowers with which the graves in the cemetery were decorated spoke another story!We learnt that Ninilchik was established by a Russian fishing company in the 1820s for its elderly and disabled employees, who could not endure the long journey back to Russia. However, local legend credits the Russian community here to have evolved from one single family  the Russian Grigorii Kvasnikov, his Russian-Alutiiq wife Mavra Rastorguev, and their children.Other Russian settlers soon congregated, and in 1901, they constructed the communitys Russian Orthodox Church perched on a hill overlooking the village below against the backdrop of acres of the pink fireweed swaying in the breeze. After Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, most residents elected to stay, and today, their descendants are many times removed form the core of the present community.And the fairy tale iconic place attracts a pack of tourists too, many of whomwe believed to be of Russian descent! Ninilchik boasts of a small fishing harbour and is known for its Salmonfest, with Halibut, in the nearby Cook Inlet, and the popular Pacific Razor Clams for digging when the tides are low enough on the beaches near Ninilchik.Panoramic views of the four Cook Inlet volcanos, the historical Old Village, the iconic Russian Orthodox church, the River and Deep Creek watersheds, abundant wildlife, and the bluff-lined beaches here are attractions that have indelibly planted this little village in the minds of everyone who encounters it."
59042b9d7be9e02646bdcab2,Mouth-watering Kashmiri delicacy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/520866/mouth-watering-kashmiri-delicacy.html,2016-01-02,,Deccan Herald,"Zulfikar Majid in Srinagar Jan 03, 2016, 23:59 ISTThe high-calorie mutton halwa requires long hours of preparationAs snow has draped the lofty mountains of the Kashmir Valley causing a dip in the mercury, Harissa, the mouth-watering mutton delicacy, is in huge demand these days. Harissa, a delicacy of Kashmir made only in winter, tempts people living here so much that whenever they choose to relish special dish, it first comes to their mind.Surviving the onslaught of junk food, old city of Srinagar is dotted with many Harissa shops but famous among them are mostly located in Aali Kadal and adjoining areas. Braving bone-chilling cold, people in small groups jostle through dense fog in the wee hours and swarm around these unique shops. Forgetting their worldly problems for some moments, they sit around a steaming earthen pot warmed by firewood in the shop and keenly watch every movement of a man using a big wooden spoon called dhagun in local parlance.Though the high-calorie delicacy requires long hours of preparation and is costly, people still prefer it due to its unique taste. If you have eaten Harissa once, you simply cannot ignore it, goes the old saying in Kashmir. Some call Harissa mutton halwa, as it is made of mutton with addition of rice or wheat as well as spices.The concoction is heated and constantly stirred for hours together until it becomes mushy and pasty. Onions fried in oil or ghee till they become golden brown, are poured onto it and when served at the caf or packed for home delivery, Kashmiri raita or kebabs are also added.Mohammad Shafi, 60, who owns one of the oldest Harissa shops in Srinagar is over-busy these days. We start making Harissa after first snowfall. Usually Harrisa season begins from November but its at peak in December and January, Shafi told Deccan Herald as he served Harissa to his customers from a big earthen pot known locally as mat, which is kept warm by firewood beneath it.As he adds cooking oil to the delicacy, a large number of people, including aged men, throng the shop. His son warms the traditional Kashmiri bread known as chout and sets plates as the customers wait. A kg of quality Harissa costs between Rs 900 and Rs 1,000, a plateful Rs 80-100.On an average I sell 40 kg in a day during peak winter as there is a huge demand for it. Some people pack and take it to home to eat with their families. Ive kept food-grade airtight containers for them, Shafi said. Some customers send Harissa to different parts of the country like Delhi and Mumbai for their relatives or officials. But Harissas shelf life is short and has to be consumed in three days, he said. It tastes best when its fresh, he adds.Harissa making is an arduous task rather an art which one learns by constant practice. I learnt it as a child by watching my late father. Our family is in this trade for over 100 years. People can make it at home, but they should use earthen pots instead of copper utensils to make it tastier, Shafi said.For the past some years, some affluent Kashmiri families have started the practice of sending large quantities of Harissa to the families of their newly-wed daughters. Normally, a well-to-do father sends five to seven kg of Harrisa to his daughters new home. We dress such gifts with kebabs to make the dish more attractive, Shafi said.According to him, no one knows the real way to prepare the dish except for a few families from the old city. After my fathers death, I decided to carry the business forward as it is a tradition of Kashmir, he says while emphasising how important it is to retain a connection to ones roots and to keep the traditions alive.Muzaffar Ahmad Shah, a businessman who had come from uptown to downtown to purchase two kg of Harrisa for his family, said: When I crave for Harissa are the only days when I wake up in the wee hours in winter.I have become a Harissa addict by relishing it for past 24 years. It (Harissa) is delicious and I relish it on every weekend during winters with my family. As Harissa shops open in the wee hours, one has to reach early in the morning in biting cold, Shah said.Some historians attribute Harissas origin in Kashmir to Central Asia, which influenced the art, custom, rituals, belief and the food culture of the Kashmiris. And thus they got the blessing in the form of a flavoursome delight, now known as Harissa.According to reputable historian of Kashmir Fida Hasnain, Mirza Hyder Duglat of Yarkand brought Harissa making to Kashmir during Chak period in 1540.Zareef Ahmad Zareef, a Kashmiri poet and considered an authority on Kashmirs cultural history, traced the roots of Harissa to the Mughal period. During Afghan rule Harissa was formally introduced in its present form in the Kashmir Valley. At that time the economic condition of Kashmiris was not good and they could not afford to relish Harissa. Instead, they would boil turnips as they were cheap alternative to Harissa. However, Mughals used to boil sheep feet known as Pacha to make a kind of Harissa, he said.Known for his satirical poetry, Zarief minces no words to say that Harissa was misused extensively as a means of corruption in Kashmir. Some people used to send Harissa to government officials and ministers for favours, he said. But Harissa has become a part and parcel of our culture now. It is also sent to in-laws after engagements and marriages as a token of love. Now Kashmiri Harissa is famous world over.Medicos say that Harissa is a good source of protein for humans. Harissa has muscle and tissue building protein. It should be consumed in the proportion of one gram of per kg of body weight, according to doctors. However, overeating Harissa can be counterproductive to health and lead to significant weight gain, doctors say.A story still told to children by parents is about an Afghan governor of Kashmir in the past who liked the dish so much that he did not know where to stop. He simply over-ate himself to death."

For onion, it was (-)64.19 per cent.The rate of inflation in sugar was at 35.36 per cent and that for fruits rose by 13.91 per cent during the month.""The pick-up in wholesale inflation was broadly in line with our expectation, with an adverse base effect outweighing the cooling effect of lower food inflation,"" ICRA Senior Economist Aditi Nayar said.Assocham said prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, has been rising at industry level but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should address using supply side responses.""Government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least 6 months,"" Assocham said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65 per cent and minerals (-)3.44 per cent.The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.42 per cent in August, up from 1.82 per cent in July.ICRA further said core-WPI inflation is expected to inch up further in the coming months and remain in a range of 0.5-2 per cent in the remainder of this fiscal.The WPI inflation for June has been revised upwards at 2.12 per cent, against provisional estimate of 1.62 per cent.""Wholesale inflation has undergone a sizable upward revision of 40-50 basis points for the last four months, which is a source of some concern,"" Nayar said.WPI inflation is expected to print between 4-4.5 per cent in the remainder of 2016, whereas CPI inflation would range within 4-5 per cent in the same months, ICRA said.The rise in WPI inflation in August is in contrast to the retail inflation which eased to a five-month low of 5.05 per cent in the month.The cooling of retail inflation and 2.4 per cent contraction of factory output in July has revived hopes for a rate cut by RBI in its next policy meet on October 4 to boost growth.In its monetary policy review last month, the RBI had maintained status quo on key rates citing upside risks to 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017.Moving towards the new regime, the government had in July notified 4 per cent inflation target for the next five years, based on which the monetary policy committee (MPC) would take its decisions going forward.It also provides for a margin of plus or minus 2 per cent in this target, thus fixing the upper tolerance level at 6 per cent till 2021.The MPC will set interest rates by majority, with a casting vote for the central bank governor in the event of a tie.Out of six members of MPC, three will be from RBI - the Governor, who will be the ex-officio Chairperson, a deputy governor and an executive director.The other three members will be appointed by the central government, on the recommendations of a search-cum-selection committee, headed by the Cabinet Secretary.It remains to be seen whether the October 4 policy could be decided by the MPC."

Laughter is indeed the best therapy for wellbeing of the body, mind and soul. In an article titled, Laugh your way to good health, its author Nick Gallo writes, Humour is a good medicine and can actually help keep you in good health.This ascription by the reno-wned graphics editor for several New York Times bestselling books, including Our Dumb World, a parody of the standard desk atlas created by the staff of The Onion, is in suppo-rt of many medical experts wh-o describe laughter as inner jogging, and good for a perso-ns cardiovascular system. In comparing laughter to jogging, it can well be said that when a person laughs heartily, several body cells and tissues are at w-ork leading to temporary lowering of blood pressure, a decreased rate of breathing and a reduction in muscle tension.What follows is a boost to the immune system, a decre-ase in the levels of stress hormones and an increase in the release of endorphins, the bod-ys natural feel-good chemicals. From these, a sensation of relaxed afterglow, ensues that helps in feeling relaxed and recharged.Laughter also comes to ones aid when the world outside looks gloomy, as it can ha-ppen many a time. As Mark Twain said, The human race has only one really effective weapon and that is laughter. For, laughter can lighten burdens, ease out worries, lessen fears, supplement courage, eliminate doubts and provide the right attitude for optimism in life. When one is laughing after all, there can be no room for anxiety, sadness and anger.Laughter therapy is thus a comprehensive cure that can reduce stress, increase energy, change perspectives, strengthen relationships and build bon-ds of friendship with the world around, enabling anyone to st-ay focused and accomplish more.In addition, laughter, when combined with other positive attributes, becomes a powerful antidote to lifes many pitfalls. As Gallo concluded, Laughter provides an enduring sense of humour and when combined with other inner resources suc-h as faith and optimism, acts as a potent force for better health and wellbeing.With so much power to heal and renew, laughter therapy is a tremendous resource for surmounting problems, strengthening relationship and enhancing health and wellbeing, both physical and emotional."

590471507be9e04154df6d12,Oddly enough: Record tourism worsens Cuban woes,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/twinkle-twinkle/oddly-enough-record-tourism-worsens-cuban-woes/,2016-12-10,,The Times Of India,"Tourism has surged in Cuba since the Obama dtente and in a healthy economy that would have been wonderful. But the many perversions of a Soviet-style economy fed by inefficient cooperatives and state-owned farms mean that the record arrival of visitors seems to have literally snatched the staples off ordinary Cubans plates. Once the collapse of the Soviet Union left the country ill-equipped to purchase fertilisers, animal feed, machinery, etc, a situation worsened by the US trade embargo, the Cuban government focused on organic agriculture. That has been greener but not more profitable, appetizing or plentiful.Azam Ahmed reports in NYT that, Tourists are quite literally eating Cubas lunch. Thanks in part to the United States embargo, but also to poor planning by the islands government, goods that Cubans have long relied on are going to well-heeled tourists and the hundreds of private restaurants that cater to them, leading to soaring prices and empty shelves.As onions, peppers, tomatoes, pineapples, limes, beer and soda rise beyond ordinary Cubans reach President Ral Castro has moved to capping agricultural prices. But as Ahmed points out, scapegoating middlemen does little to provide good, affordable produce for Cubans. Scapegoating the restaurants that have mushroomed to cater to tourists would be similarly wrongheaded. Its a supply side problem which can only be solved by encouraging not discouraging enterprise. Socialist policies discouraging profit have already taken a terrible toll on the economy; more of the same shall only worsen the countrys food insecurity.Meanwhile Irina Pino writes in the Havana Times, A psychological state has been created in poor people in Cuba so that they can do without so many things and hate consumerism like they would an infernal machine. In a mind game that demonetization has made so familiar here too, the act of queuing up for hours for food and basic items has been elevated as a virtue. But the grip of the mind game is loosening. Scarcity cannot remain a convincing virtue forever."
590473907be9e04154df70c7,Book Review: The Rise and Fall of Nations,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/just-like-that/book-review-the-rise-and-fall-of-nations/,2016-08-13,,The Times Of India,"As a student of economics, I must confess, that books written by economists are not exactly page-turners. In this case, it was different.I chanced upon The Rise and Fall of Nations by Ruchir Sharma and started flipping through the Prologue. That got me hooked. Ruchir begins with the story of the African king who sends his son out to learn the rhythms of the jungle. In the first year, the boy could identify the lions roar and the elephants trumpet. Each year as the boy goes back, he learns to hear the rustle of a snake  what remains unknown to the untrained. The king tells his son to keep going back until he can hear danger in the stillness and hope in the sunrise.Factories and onionsIf you keep your highlighter handy, you will pick up the signs that spell danger in the stillness and hope in the sunrise. For instance, his observation that the last five recessions (global growth less than 2%) since 1970, have originated in the US. The next recession will originate in China. Or that the S&P 500 Index starts to turn down seven months before the peak of an expansion and turn up four months before a recession bottoms out. Or those leaders would do well to invest in manufacturing because the masses while services usually need a better-educated population to draw from. Investing in technology is the next best option. Real estate and commodities are cursed. It is always factories first, says Ruchir.There is, of course, the danger that once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be useful. Too many people have an incentive to doctor numbers to meet it. In China, analysts who were skeptical of the official GDP figures started checking other indicators such as growth in cargo traffic and electricity consumption. In 2015 reports emerged that government authorities were instructing developers to keep the lights on even in empty apartment complexes. The aim was to drive up electricity consumption data so that it would confirm official growth claims.Danger in the stillnessRuchir creates a dashboard of 10 rules that explain the post-crisis world. These range from the obvious measures like inflation. That could be the equivalent of hearing the roar of the lion or trumpet of the elephant. High inflation kills growth while low inflation (around 2%) allows the government to invest in infrastructure that can be used when the economy slows down. The chapter called The Price of Onions talks about the price of onions as a measure that could provide a pulse (no pun intended) of the public mood. Just what Manmohan Singh and his advisors missed.In todays globalized world, in which cross-border trade and money flow often tend to restrain consumer prices but magnify asset prices, watching the price of stocks and houses is as important as tracking the price of onions.For me, the most valuable insights came from the chapter titled People Matter. The trigger for economic growth lies in a 2% increase in working population. In the next decade from 2020-2030, only one will grow at that rate  Nigeria. The political leaders have to create the economic conditions necessary to attract investment and generate jobs. The recent influx of refugees may actually be an answer to Germanys depleting working-age population. But is it enough to have people without having their necessary skills?Ruchir argues in his book that investment in the university system as was the huge investment Russia did in science and tech education has not created growth in Russia. It lacks a tech sector even today.The pay off in education is so slow and variable that it is almost useless as a predictor of economic change over a five-to-ten-year period. Beyond that, it is risky to make predictions about economic growth anyway. I wonder how this will play out as the digital tsunami creates disproportionate opportunities for developing nations to catch up.I emailed Ruchir to ask him why he had dismissed the importance of skills. He emailed back to say: yes skills matter but countries like Germany and Japan are facing such a demographic challenge, particularly for some low-end workers that any additions to their depleting labor force will be a net positive for the economy as long as they can assimilate the workers well  something admittedly historically European countries have not been great at doing. So assimilation more than skills is the challenge for them.What did I not like about the book? Applying each rule to dozens of countries in each chapter tends to amuse and then starts to get tedious. The book dazzles in the beginning but frazzles towards the end. If you never read books written by economists, give this one a shot."

Besides routine checkups and scans, there are certain foods that should be avoided and there are a few which are perfect for a healthy start.To maintain a high nutritional content in body, following an organic food diet is a good option. Organic diets are a great source of essential vitamins, minerals, potassium, iron and proteins that are healthy for you and your child.Why choose an organic diet over a normal diet?There are many reasons how organic is better but I would consider these to be the most important:Free from toxins that may cause damage to brain and nerve cellsSupports childrens neural and body developmentReal food and not pesticide factoriesReduces risk of cancerSimply tastes betterIs there a difference between natural and organic foods?Yes, both of them are different. Natural foods are usually considered as minimally processed foods that do not include hormones or artificial flavors. On the other hand, organic foods are strictly regulated and do not contain toxic substances such as synthetic pesticides, herbicides or chemical NPK fertilizers.Organic diet ideas for pregnant mothersBreakfast:Breakfast is the prime meal of the day for would-be moms as it helps you stay active throughout the day. I would recommend incorporating whole grains and fruits in breakfast meals for that extra added energy and to keep morning sickness awayOrganic eggs topped with organic spinach, mushrooms and grilled tomatoOrganic oats boiled with organic milk with added organic berriesOmlette with a wholegrain toastPorridge without sweetened rice or coconut milkPlain yogurt mixed with fresh berries, cinnamon, and vanilla. Use almonds to enjoy the crunchHealthy moong chaat is a nice and crunchy meal rich in nutrients like Vitamin A and C, Iron and FibreHot and fresh multiflour idlis but they may turn hard upon coolingLunchLunch is the best time for a dose a protein and consuming healthy vegetables, especially leafy green as they have high folic acid content, which is essential for fetal development.Whole wheat pita sandwich stuffed with greens like baby spinach and chopped veggiesSuper food salad that includes leafy green vegetables, energy-rich vegetables, high omega-3 nuts and dress it up with extra virgin olive oil and vinegarBeans and capsicum salad is an all-in-one treat for high levels of protein, fibre, calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin CBajra, moong dal and green pea khichdi, which is rich in fibre and proteinsBaked methi puris that are rich in iron and calciumDinner:Dinner time should include light meals for smoother digestion. One should always prefer low-fat foods and avoid consuming fried foods to keep insulin levels in control. Brown rice with a mix of green leafy and iron rich vegetables Chapati with a bowl of lentils A bowl of spinach salad along honey-peach smoothie, raspberry orange-punch or pineapple and basil smoothie as per tasteWhat to do for maintaining healthy eating habits during pregnancy?First of all, before consuming anything, you should be aware of its contents. Check label and expiry date to make sure that you are not eating anything which could affect your health or the babys.Remove brinjal, papaya, celery, onion, garlic, ginger, pepper, mustard, carom seeds and jaggery in your diet if you have history of abortionAvoid consuming green peas, potatoes and heavy cereals if you have habitual acidity, constipation and bloating issuesNever eat left over or frozen foodsRegular intake of Vitamin and Iron supplements as prescribed by your gynecologist for healthy growth of babyClosing ThoughtsNot only would-be mothers but everyone should opt for organic foods. Though organic foods are free of pesticides, but there are possibilities of organic foods being contaminated with bacteria. In short, no matter what you buy  organic or conventional  wash and cook meticulously before eating."

5904746d7be9e04154df7204,Ethiopian food: Thaal se thaal bajaa!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ethiopian-food-thaal-se-thaal-bajaa/,2016-08-25,,The Times Of India,"There are no forks or knives on the table. Not even spoons. Everyone is eating with their fingers and the only sound punctuating the Oohs and Yums is the occasional slurp. As I look around the room, I notice that even the most well-heeled customers are uncomplainingly and happily rolling up the bread, scooping the stew or vegetables and paying tribute to the chef by a single-minded focus on the delicious meal in front of them.I am at an Ethiopian restaurant Zeni in San Francisco with my sister, her husband and my younger son, The Foodie. We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."
590474a47be9e04154df725a,‘Maa…he pulled down my pants’,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/shweshwe/maa-he-pulled-down-my-pants/,2016-08-20,,The Times Of India,"Jai Mehta peeked out from the narrow gap in the middle of the dusty old maroon curtains. His little brown eyes were anxiously searching the packed audience seated in the school auditorium, from left to right and then back again to the left. Where was she? Why wasnt she here yet? Dont worry Jai beta, I promise I will make it to your Annual Day Concert. I just have one quick breakfast meeting, and then I will catch the flight to Mumbai, which will arrive much before time, his mother Kajal, had reassured him, over the phone, from Bangalore last night. Maybe her plane got delayed? It was probably raining out there. Or maybe she was stuck in a horrible traffic jam on the way from the airport? Jais mind was frantically thinking of all the possible reasons for her not reaching on time. He shut his eyes tight, and prayed, Hanumanji please make my Maa come soon. She had missed his football match last month, where he won the Best player trophy, and also his Open-day, because of which his teacher had been livid. But because Jai did well in his studies and was a disciplined child, she had let it go, with a warning to attend the next one. His parents could not attend most of his school events, due to their hectic work schedules. He felt sad that they were always so busy, although he was kind of used to it by now. But today was very different.Jai had made up his mind to disclose something very important to his mother, after the concert. Something he had never told her before, as he was confused himself. But now he could bare it no longer. Not for another day or even an hour. He was just too frightened of HIM. He hoped that after he told her, she would make it all go away, the pain and the fear. He wanted his Maa to come walking in through the rusty double doors, smile warmly, and give him a big thumbs-up sign, while mouthing best of luck! He somehow longed for the warmth and comfort of her presence right now.The Grade 2 skit, was about to start, and Jai knew he had to focus on playing the Prince, which was the lead role. The entire class had been rehearsing for a over a month, and finally the time had come to perform. He stood in the centre of the stage, wearing a shiny gold crown and a red velvet cape, his eyes still fixed on the doors, as the curtains went up and bright lights came on. The piano teacher Ms.Alex started playing the melodious background score. Jais best friend Ananya, who was playing the beautiful princess, widened her eyes, and gestured him to sing the opening lines. She softly prompted him, thinking that he had forgotten or was nervous. But that was not the reason. Jai just stood there, pools of tears welling up in his eyes, as he scanned the crowd one last time. He usually got disheartened but today he was heartbroken. He needed her and she didnt come. Maybe his father and mother didnt love him after all? Obviously, they didnt. Maybe he had done something wrong? But what? He could see the other kids waving out to their excited parents, who were blowing kisses back in return. They were so lucky.Jai tried to sing but the words didnt come out. Come on Jai, start singing. Everyone is waiting for you, the teacher whispered sternly with clenched teeth, which startled Jai, a shiver running down his spine. He was very uncomfortable whenever he heard a whisper, because it reminded Jai of HIM the person he was most terrified of Mahender Bhaiya, the house cook. His vicious image flashed before Jais eyes dark greasy face, ghutka (tobacco)stained rough hands, and droplets of sweat on his brow, as he licked his lips. He always smelled of onions and green beans, and each time he came close, Jai wanted to vomit. Aa mere pass baba, daro mat(come close to me little boy, dont be scared)he would whisper hoarsely, into his ears. His coarse prickly stubble would rub against Jais soft creamy cheeks. Yeh hum dono ka khel hail(this is our game), he would laugh cheekily, and stare with blood shot eyes, while pulling Jais pants down. And then he would he shuddered with the thought! He hated it so much.When he was younger, Jai believed that Mahender Bhaiya was actually playing a game with him. His parents were never home during the day, and left him in the care of a full-time educated nanny, Mary. Sometimes when she would go for her bath or do her prayers, Mahender would enter Jais room, with the pretext of watching over him. Mary was also quite happy to get some free time, especially when she wanted to step out for a few minutes to do some personal chores. The middle-aged cook, employed with the Mehtas for more than ten years was supposed to be their most trust worthy staff member. He would first give Jai a sweet boondi ka laddoo to eat, after which Jai would get slightly drowsy, and then the game would start. However, from a few months, since he turned seven, Jai felt that something was abnormal about this khel. Also recently their class teacher had given them a talk in school about the difference between good and bad touch. Though she had used an example of a girl while explaining, which made Jai unsure whether it can happen to a boy, to some extent he realised that was going on was wrong. So the next time when Mary had gone to the market, trusting him in Mahenders company, Jai resisted by holding on to his pants firmly, and saying, mat chuho(dont touch). Muh kholega toh maar dalega (if you open your mouth I will kill you), he threatened, showing him a sharp knife, kept in his pocket. Jai had seen him using it in the kitchen, while he brutally chopped chicken and mutton, until it was minced. He got so scared that he will do the same to him. So he kept quiet, and the torture continued, again and again.A couple of days back, when his mother left for Bangalore, and his father was tied up with something major in court, Mahender had really hurt Jai, while he was playing with him. After that he went to stay at his Nana-Nanis, refusing to go home until his mother got back. He was petrified, and he decided to tell his Maa about Mahender Bhaiyas dirty game. He had been desperately waiting for her to return, and as soon as the show was over, he would tell her. How he hated her job. If she was home all this would have never happened. And his dad? All he did was give him a goodbye hug when he left for work every morning. Even on holidays he was glued to his computer screen. Why did they have a child when they had no time? Suddenly, Jai heard his teacher call out to him again, JAI start now!! He knew he had to, so he started singing. The proud parents would applaud loudly when their child sung a part. But there was no one to cheer for him.Kajal Mehta, was hyperventilating, as she was very late. Her meeting in Bangalore, didnt finish in time for her to catch the first flight out, and so she had to take the next one. Driver, jaldi chalao(go fast), she screamed. The traffic was horrendous.God! God! God! Jai would never forgive her if she missed his performance. She was silently cursing her husband Vikrant, who was even more busier than her, and could never step in to help. Well, she couldnt blame him either. After all, he was the most famous and sought-after lawyer in the country. Kajal herself was a top investment banker and travelled all over the world for business. She was as passionate about her career as Vikrant was. Between them they made millions, and lived life extravagantly. Their home was a swanky plush penthouse in South Mumbai, that was designed ultra luxuriously! However they only spent a few hours there, usually to catch up on some sleep, after working twelve hours a daysometimes more! Jai was not a planned pregnancy for the Mehtas, and when they found out they were first completely taken aback. The timing was all wrong as Vikrant had many high profile political cases lined up, and Kajal was about to get a serious promotion in her firm. She did not want to quit, or even slow down at work. But at the same time, they both had always wanted to have a child. Maybe there is never a right time? There are so many working couples out there in the world, with kids! How did they manage? they contemplated. So they decided to go ahead with the pregnancy, and slowly figure it out along the way, step by step.When Jai was born he was very cute, fair with deep dimples, and hazel coloured eyes. Vikrant and Kajal fell instantly in love, ecstatic with their decision to have him! Money was not a criteria, so they appointed efficient nurses, around the clock, to handle the baby. Kajal managed to go back to work in just two months after delivering! Vikrants parents lived in Kolkata, so they couldnt help with Jai. But Kajals lived close by, and enjoyed watching over their grandson, whenever it was required, especially when they were both travelling. When he grew into a toddler, the nurses were replaced by a highly-recommended nanny Mary, who seemed extremely responsible. Jai was enrolled in the best school and his parents bought him lots of fancy toys from all their business trips. He had a dream room, with all the most expensive gadgets imaginable. But what Jai desired the most, he did not get.Time from his Maa and Paa.Deep down in her heart, Kajal knew that Jai was lonely. She did not admit it to Vikrant or anyone else, and carried the burden of guilt with her at all times. As much as she tried to balance her schedule, she could not spend as much time as she wanted to with her son. Lately she was feeling very torn between her career and him. She could see it in his eyes that he needed her and missed her. She missed him too. And finally after all these years, this morning, she made a drastic change. When her boss, inconsiderate as he was, delayed her at the meeting in Bangalore, she finally gave him a piece of her mind. It was the first time she had spoken up. Sir, from now on I will not be able to travel for business. Also my working hours have to be reduced, so that I can spend time with my child, who is growing up without me. If you cannot allow this, I will understand and resign on Monday morning, she said, somewhat shocked at her own decision. But she had had enough. She was tired of disappointing Jai and was craving spending time with him. The boss hesitated, but soon realised that he did not want to loose such a fantastic employee, and so he agreed to her conditions! Now, on the way to his school, Kajal was so excited and impatient to give Jai this good news! She could hardly wait. She was sure he would be thrilled! She prayed to Hanuman ji to make her reach soon.Jai took a bow, as the crowd gave him a standing ovation, at the end of the show. It didnt matter to him though, he was just glad that it was over. A few moments after the curtains came down, Kajal rushed in through the double doors. When she realised she had missed the show she froze. Jai came walking towards her slowly, his head hanging low. The rouge tint was still was on his cheeks, but smeared with tears. You missed it Maa, he said his voice cracking. Lets go. Kajal tried telling Jai about her conversation with her boss on the way home, but he refused to talk. He was so upset, that he closed his eyes, and went to sleep. So Kajal decided to wait and make the grand announcement on the dinner table when Vikrant would get home. Then they could celebrate with some wine and icecream for Jai!She dropped him home, and went to the supermarket to get some fresh ingredients for the Italian meal she planned to cook herself for the special evening. She had to also buy a tub of Jais favourite mint chocolate-chip ice-cream!! She was already starting to enjoy this new phase, of taking care of her family! It was something she was not used to at all, but secretly always wanted to! As she returned to the building, humming along with her favourite song playing on the stereo, she suddenly saw Mary, entering in through the gates. That was strange, she thought to herself. Mary was never allowed to leave the house when they were not there. So where was she coming from? Madam I had to give my sister some money, very urgent, so I went outside. Jai baba was sleeping, so I thought it would be okay, she answered sheepishly, when Kajal asked her. Maybe she does this often, when we are at work, Kajal thought to herself, worried. She went straight into the store-room to quickly put the melting icecream into the huge freezer. As she opened the heavy door she gasped as something fell out on to the floor, with a huge thud. Kajal was shocked out of her wits! She couldnt believe what she was seeing in front of her. She stared screaming. Loudly.They rushed him to the hospital, but he was already lifeless. The doctors wrote on the certificate: Death of eight year old male caused due to Hypothermia. When they went back home, shattered and grieving,Vikrant and Kajal found this scribbled note on Jais desk. Maa. I hate Mahender bhaiyas yucky game. He does bad touch to me when you are not at home. And you are always in office. Because I think you dont love me. I am going to hide in the big freezer, as he is looking for me right now. I am very scared. Please take me out when you come home. Jai.This story has been inspired by a true incident. In India, 53% children, are sexually abused, when they are between 5-12 years of age. Contrary to what we believe, 10% more boys are victims, than girls.What are the odds, that your child is as safe as you think HE or SHE is?"
5904751e7be9e04154df7311,The culture of continental breakfast in Delhi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/priyali-prakash-blog/the-culture-of-continental-breakfast-in-delhi/,2016-06-06,,The Times Of India,"Lets face the truth  majority of Delhiites are not known to be early-risers, especially during the weekends. However, the concept of meeting friends over breakfast instead of evening coffee or a round of drinks or late dinners is fast-catching up.While a place like the All American Diner is a front-runner when it comes to breaking fast early in the morning, a lot of new places, like the quaint little Tonnino or the student-friendly Big Yellow Door are coming up with quirky ways to attract customers and are quite successful too. And now, we have a new player in the fray in the form of our good ol Hard Rock Cafe.While the idea of a place, dedicated to jamming to rock music on evenings, serving breakfast sounds a little queer, HRC has tried hard to break out of its stereotyped image to diversify into something as challenging as a breakfast buffet.The factor that sets HRC buffet apart from others is that this is not a regular feature for the cafe, and has been conceptualised to be a speciality for days that have international sporting events, the telecast time of which coincides with the local breakfast time.The inclusion of parathas as the only Indian option seems more like an attempt to fit into the breakfast for all bracket, particularly for the Indian crowd, when the chef claims to have hand-picked an otherwise continental array of choices.Chef Brijesh tells us that the menu, which mostly comprises continental items, was designed keeping in mind the kind of crowd HRC generally attracts based on its brand value.The eggs-on-order live station was perhaps the best part of the HRC breakfast buffet. A choice of omelettes, fried eggs, scrambled eggs and akuri cooked to perfection, with add-on vegetables including onions and tomatoes as well as bacon, is just what was needed to lift up the spirits of this buffet.Coming to the continental choices too, the menu is pretty plain and simple. Bacon and sausages, baked beans, pancakes with maple syrup and honey and hash browns, along with choices of cereals, breads and fruits are the regulars on most breakfast buffets these days.While bacon and sausages were processed foods and tasted like they would at any regular eatery, pancakes were made in-house. The bite-sized pancakes were airy but dry and a tad bit too salty.Sauted vegetables were a good option for the vegetarians. A mix of bell peppers and broccoli tossed in olive oil and flavoured with oregano and a hint of basil was refreshing.Talking of refreshing, while the assorted fruits included beautifully cut water melons, musk melons and papayas, canned juices were a bit of a let-down since one would generally expect a breakfast buffet to be serving fresh juices.All in all, the breakfast buffet at HRC for Rs 899(AI) seems like a good deal but one would generally picture himself or herself having breakfast in a more naturally well-lit setting that is synonymous with the freshness and spirit of mornings rather than the dimly-lit Hard Rock Cafe that plays loud music and has an ever-persistent alcohol-infused air."
59048b887be9e04154df8534,Of Molly Cullah and other culinary adventures,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/of-molly-cullah-and-other-culinary-adventures/,2016-10-26,,The Times Of India,"I dont like reading your food columns anymore, grumbles my friend as we sit in a coffee shop and contemplate the intricate patterns on our coffee foam. Why? I look up, momentarily distracted from the womans face carved in my coffee. Its full of modak-shodaks, thali-shalis, she waves a perfectly manicured hand in the air, nearly clocking a passing waiter under the chin. I want to read something moremoreexciting.Well, my next one is on molecular gastronomy, I roll out the words quickly, giving her a sly glance over my cup. Molly Cullah who, she squeaks. Not who, I retort. What!Molecular gastronomy is the new fad that has taken the fashion world by storm these past few years. It is the ultimate fantasy in the food world where science meets cooking and is about the chemistry and physics behind the preparation of any dish. What is the temperature required for that perfect boiled egg? Why does a mayonnaise become firm? What makes a perfect souffl swell? The world of molecular gastronomists looks at such culinary issues from a technical and aesthetic standpoint.Simply put, molecular gastronomy is all about deconstructing the food on your plate. Remember the time in your idle youth, when you dismantled your grandfathers favorite clock in order to find out why the cuckoo went, er, cuckoo! And the ensuing uproar that followed.Well, think of molecular gastronomy as just that: dismantling all the ingredients in your dish  without the massive uproar! Chefs basically unravel dishes and create separate food blocks instead of having everything combined. So a discerning diner has the customized experience of deciding which combination of ingredients to put into his or her mouth. From deconstructed desserts to transparent pasta and faux caviars, molecular gastronomy dishes out a startling statement on the dinner table. Using lab-like equipment such as liquid nitrogen and evaporators, this unique cooking style presents regular food in ways that will astound the diner. Phrases such as sous-vide, flash frozen, food foam, faux caviar have become as familiar to culinary aficionados as science terms such as gelification, emulsification, and effervescence.In the last few years, I have been fortunate to be introduced to this form of cooking at restaurants in cities like Barcelona, NYC and London. My most memorable meal was at the wd-50 in NYC which unfortunately has since shut down due to real estate construction. This is where I was introduced to a dish called Oyster in its shell where the shell was actually edible and the dish was suffused with preserved lemon, snow pea, and hazelnut. And being a big fan of ravioli, I fell in love with the scrambled egg ravioli where not only was the filling made of scrambled egg and cream cheese, salt and cayenne, but the outer cover too was made of egg yolk, which we were informed had been piped into silicone square molds. Out of the freezer, the ravioli looked like giant frozen egg ice cubes, but when served hot the pasta was delicious with the consistency of creamy scrambled eggs. Served with a side of caviar and cucumber, the dish made us drool and lick our lips with every bite. And to top it all was an innocuous dish called Shrimp Grits, which was basically Cajun comfort food served in a new avatar. Served with pickled jalapeo, the traditional grits was replaced by finely ground shrimp tossed with green onion and seasoning.And now here I am with my friend who wants to read  and eat  something which is not mundane and banal. We are at a fancy restaurant in Mumbai at an abandoned mill turned into a food hub, sitting to eat a meal where liquid nitrogen, colored bubbles, and foam lead to a scintillating sideshow. The humble papdi chaat comes to us in a glamorous avatar with each ingredient separated to showcase its delicacy. The coriander chutney has been whipped into a luscious foam and the yogurt aerated into little bubbles that pop in the mouth. As we move from the chaat to other pices dart, I marvel at the new evocative and distinct way the chef has presented traditional dishes leading to a treat not only for the mouth but for the eyes as well.The piece de resistance is the paan mousse: as we stare with interest at our platter which contains paan leaves ingeniously arranged around wedges of kulfi, the waiter, with a dramatic flourish, pours liquid nitrogen over the platter. The result: a large amount of cold vapor which generates a lot of oohs and aahs from the surrounding diners too. The dish is ambrosial with the paan retaining its freshness in its frozen state to complement the kulfi-style mousse inside its wrapping. Cest magnifique!So how was the food, I quiz my friend, as we step out after that deliciously artistic meal. There is a smidgen of silence. Then, there was too much show-shaa, my friend sniffs haughtily. When I go to eat food, I want to eat real food! Clearly, Molly Cullah failed to impress!"
5904936d7be9e04154df8b28,A little taste of Indian heaven in Abu Dhabi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/shaira-mohan-blog/a-little-taste-of-indian-heaven-in-abu-dhabi/,2016-06-15,,The Times Of India,"Its a hole in the wall in one of the narrow alley streets in the Electra district of Abu Dhabis buzzing downtown.As most hole-in-the-walls have proved time and again, their food leaves us licking our fingers more than any fine dining or 5-star restaurant ever has. And Via Delhi is no exception.You can take the Indian out of India but you cant take the Indianness out of the Indian. This, in a nutshell, also perfectly describes the culinary taste palette of both my husband and I. True Punjabis to the bone (him even more so than I), with that weekly craving for tandoori chicken, kaali dal, bhindi and naan bread, we have always sought that one Indian haunt even on our prior two-year stint in Munich that we would frequent on a regular basis for its impeccable service and nostalgia  inducing food with authentic tastes from our kitchens back home.So it was no surprise when new friends in the city, also an Indian couple, took us to Via Delhi  quaint, tastefully decorated in an almost New York style theme complete with black and white framed pictures adorning the red-brick walls, an unusual set up for the typical Indian joints known to us that tend to go a tad overboard by proudly parading elements of their own culture through their interiors. Even their name logo has been designed to resemble the Disney font somewhat. And yet the the delicious food they serve that gladdens the palate to no end and inevitably makes one over-eat can not be more Indian.The freshly made Jaljeera drink complete with some Boondi garnishing and the squiggly straw that has me perpetually ordering two glasses at a go is a must-try here. Add to that, the tiny but immensely gratifying portion of meetha paan wrapped neatly in plastic and served at the end of this lipsmacking meal that makes for the perfect finale.The meat of the meal consists of a wide variety of scrumptiously made chicken, mutton and fish  Boti chicken a favorite of ours, cooked in rich flavors of spice and sauces that are far removed from the dollops of oil and lack of ghar ka touch that typically greet us in most other Indian restaurants. From the circa onions, raita curd to even the chicken and paneer tikka starters, nostalgia hits and you are transported back home.The service and staff adds the cherry on the cake. Hailing from different parts of north India the notable craftsmanship of the chefs hidden away in the tiny kitchen and exceptional recipes that come through in the magical flavors incumbent in the wide varierty of dishes, the cooks put on their best show day in and day out, leaving no stone unturned in mesmerising their audience. And the house is always full. The staff that serves you on the smart wooden tables is polite, friendly and go out of their way to make your dining experience exceptional. Small gestures go a long way in influencing your dining-out decisions. They stay with you.Electra is an area in Abu Dhabi that caters to many corporate offices, banks and official buildings. Myriad tiny restaurants, many of which offer Indian, Pakistani or asian fast food line the inner streets of this maze-like district buzzing with the 9 to 5-ers going about their business and popping in almost everyday for a quick lunch or coffee. In this vast ocean of choices and cuisines, a small joint like Via Delhi is just a lone boat, lost in the crowd. According to the owners, the search is on to look for a bigger venue for their restaurant to attract a larger chunk of both the emirati and expat customer that resides in this capital city in large numbers.Yet the small joint is always packed to capacity. There is an adrenaline rush when you enter Via Delhi , one of the few places where you dont mind the wait to be seated  something that can frustrate you even in 5-star hotels. Because you know the wait is going to be well worth it.Being an Indian foodie, my husband almost always wants to go to Via Delhi when we make plans for a meal out  Sometimes I need to intervene to make sure we get some culinary variety too! But it has most certainly become a permanent fixture in our roster of places to frequent here in Abu Dhabi.If you are planning a trip to this Emirati metropolis soon, I urge you to make your way to Via Delhi for that home away from home culinary experience. But, of course, you must attack the hummus and shwarmas first!"

Maybe more so when it comes to the news. This morning, Nirmalabai stormed in at full throttle, Why we have this toota-bhanga chopper? The country got a Rs 3,600-crore deal, and im stuck with your cheapie discounted one from last years Diwali Dhamaka. Ho, mala maiti, im not a VVIP, but why we poor bais should suffer?When i explained that this was about helicopters which had turned into hellicopters, she kicked back, Like that Tyagi fellow and Congress MPs you are evading proper answer. We bais know your tricks as dirty as the piles of bartan we have to manjo. Pucca, this dabba machine was made by some shady Punjabi company. Not even an Italian one. Was my part-timer taking secret lessons from the ED? Now, i began to understand what Tyagi was going through.Nirmalabai subjected me to the full hisssing, screaming parliamentary pressure cooker. We had replaced our manual Chinese chopper with a sleek electric one, but she was convinced that i and my family had got some hidden benefit out of the decision. Like, wed ask her to chop 10 onions instead of three for the Sunday akuri just because we now had a fine mechanical contraption. Hmmm, would that be finmeccanica in Italian?Before i could wander into this subsidiary thought, Nirmalabai again caught me in her whirring blades, and proceeded to cut me into bite-sized pieces. Boti-boti karna had suddenly become a threat perception instead of a simple kitchen instruction. My part-timer had metamorphosed into Subramaniam Swamy; before i can say jharoo-katka, shell demand a Rajya Sabha nomination. Where would i get a replacement, that too during the maddening summer exodus of bais?Nirmalabai threw down the jhharan like a gauntlet. Forget chopper, i felt i was being put through the blender, grinder, juicer, bhindi-slicer  Under her relentless grilling, my sweat began surfacing like Tyagi companies.Baap-re, what next? Will she bring up the creaky washing machine, and get Arnab to wave my dirty linen in front of the entire nation?***Alec Smart said: The Tyagi sacrifice. Will we say Ta-ta to the AgustaWestland JV?"
590494677be9e04154df8c94,The babble about bagels,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/the-babble-about-bagels/,2016-06-17,,The Times Of India,"Whats round, has a hole, is packed full of carbs and can be had at any time of the day or night? If you answered a donut, you just landed yourself a lemon!The answer is the Bagel, that chewy crusty bread, with dollops of cream cheese inside, making it a carb-laden delicious mouthful in every bite. Both the donut and the bagel are best-selling comfort foods but while the sweet donut is essentially a breakfast item, its savory cousin bagel is an all-day comfort food, especially if there are plenty of great toppings to go along with the soft and doughy inside.So now I am back in New York where the locals pride on two things: their pizza and their bagels. So familiar is this food to New Yorkers that a number of episodes of the popular series Suits revolve around conversations that the two protagonists Harvey Specter and Michael Ross have around bagel carts.What is this wonder bread anyway? According to popular belief, bagels date back to 1783, when they were created to honor King John III Sobieski of Poland, after he protected Austrias people from an attack by Turkish invaders. As the story goes, an Austrian baker created the bagel in the shape of a stirrup to honor the horseman king, and named it a beugel (the Austrian word for stirrup). The beugel quickly gained popularity throughout Eastern Europe, and, over time, the bagel evolved into a circular shape with a hole in the middle. The round bread first came to the US with immigrants through the portals of Ellis Island in the late 1800s. And even now, most of the popular bagel shops are on the Lower East Side where the early immigrants made their tenement homes.My New York morning usually starts with an early morning sprint to my favorite bagel shop to catch the first batch of freshly baked bagels. Baked did I say? Wrong! Because the bagel is the only bread that is boiled before baking it. Once the bagel dough is shaped into a circle, it is dipped in boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. After that, the bread is drained and baked for about 10 minutes. And that hole in the center is not just for looks! The bagel hole comes in handy to thread multiple bagels onto a dowel, making it very convenient for street vendors transporting and selling the doughy delights.Over the years the bagel has moved from its humble plain doughy self to the most designer bagels that the mind can possibly conceive. So there are the onion, garlic, rye , poppy seed bagels which are jostling for space in bagel shops with their more exotic versions ranging from cinnamon raisin bagel to the pumpernickel to the sun-dried tomato bagel. For those with more adventurous palates there are flavors like blueberry and the French Toast. I have tried these flavors and sworn never to go near these wannabes again. Some mash-ups are fun like the pumpernickel or the sesame bagel. But while French toasts are yum and bagels are awesome, marrying those two together is like The Odd Couple!New York is famous for its bagels, but there is something about the way they are served that annoys many New Yorkers. Bagel shops in the city often slather enormous amount of cream cheese on each bagel they serve, making it a royal gooey mess to eat. Most bagel lovers, including me, find that amount of cream cheese overwhelming and feel that it detracts from the taste of the bagel itself. So my first instinct when I buy my bagel: scrape off that excess.The traditionally accepted amount of cream cheese that is appropriate for a bagel is a schmear. That is a relatively small amount that is just enough to enhance the flavor and texture of a bagel. The cream cheese is meant to complement the taste of the bagel, not to overpower it. Like bagel, cream cheese has matured over the years to complement the bread. So even the most ordinary bagel shop will boast a plethora of cream cheese offerings from the plain-Jane Philadelphia cream cheese to more exotic ones like jalapeno asado, tofu cream cheese, horseradish and pickle, and all the combinations in between.So here I am on my first day in New York, sprinting down to my favorite bagel shop only to discover dozens of patrons already in line ahead of me. I am accompanied by my older son, The Health Nut, who is a big advocate of Bagel-on-the-go, the New Yorkers attempt to assuage a guilty conscience at eating so many carbs at breakfast. It is essentially a plain bagel with bacon, eggs and your choice of cream cheese. When its my turn, I ask for a sesame seed bagel with wasabi cream cheese on the side.As my son and I stroll back to our apartment clutching our prizes, I wonder how long before I am asking for a garlic naan bagel with tandoori masala cream cheese!"
5904949e7be9e04154df8ce2,Modi talks of samvedana. His party has other plans in UP,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/modi-talks-of-samvedana-his-party-has-other-plans-in-up/,2016-06-19,,The Times Of India,"On Thursday, June 16, Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Sangeet Som said he would organise a march  padayatra  to reassure people that the state would not turn into Kashmir. The implication was obvious.For those who came in late, heres the backdrop to Soms activism. Last week, Hukum Singh, who won a seat in Parliament from Kairana, UP, for the BJP in 2014, created a flap. He claimed 346 Hindu families had left this town because of persecution by Muslims.Media soon showed this claim was bogus: among the people on Singhs list, many had died of natural causes, most had migrated for better opportunities, jobs and schooling elsewhere. Hukum Singh was asked why he had forgotten to list Muslim families who had also left town. A slightly contrite Singh then said his list wasnt about Hindus and Muslims, but the menace of extortion. That claim, too, doesnt stand up to scrutiny: on Wednesday, TOI cited reports by district officials and police records that say only three families left Kairana fearing extortion.At first glance, this looks like a farrago of half-truths and lies, but theres a pattern to it.Kairana is a part of Shamli district, which borders Muzaffarnagar. Between August and September 2013, around six months before Lok Sabha elections, both were rocked by riots. Victims: 52 Muslims, 10 Hindus dead; over 50,000 driven out of home. Hukum Singh was accused of rioting; Sangeet Som was principal accused.The UP BJP believes its Lok Sabha sweep  71 of 80 seats  was due to what we politely call polarization. Once again, elections are due in UP next summer. The flare-up in Kairana bears an uncanny resemblance to events of 2013 in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. The BJP believes the formula that won it 2014 can be repeated in 2017.See the pattern?But heres the biggest contradiction: this sabre-rattling crashes headlong into another BJP narrative, laid down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has cultivated the image of a statesman overseas.Modi addressed the BJPs national executive  around 200 top leaders  in Allahabad recently. There, he took the high road of development. He said power was about great responsibility to get things done.And indeed, theres much on the table. For six months, November 2015 to April 2016, industrial production has shrunk every month, bar February this year. Indias economy is largely driven by investment. When investment grows, demand for capital goods soars. When this shrinks, its an ominous portent. For the last six months capital goods has fallen; in April by a horrifying 26%.Exports have shrunk, for the 18th month in a row, as have imports, showing India losing market share overseas and a lack of appetite for imported stuff  machinery to macaroni  at home. Services comprise over half our economy now. This slowed to a six-month low in May, the latest numbers.A growing economy needs to move things around. The real heavy lifting of stuff like fertilizer, coal, cement and iron ore is done on railways. Analysts look at rail freight figures to judge which way the economys core is, well, moving. Compared to a year ago, rail freight growth shrank 13.5%, an all-time low. The biggest falls were in fertilizer, coal and cement.After two years of drought, monsoons  which impact around 600 million livelihoods in our vast hinterland  are again patchy. I bought onion a couple of months ago at Rs 40 per kg. Today, its around Rs 100. I know now why consumer inflation has flared up.Yet, official statisticians put up heroic numbers at which the economy is supposed to be galloping. Taking their cue, Moodys  remember those guys who rated junk US subprime bonds as excellent?  says India will grow 7.5% this year. Well, good luck.But Modi must be sensing something of what the rest of India is feeling. Which probably explains why he felt compelled to tell his colleagues to pull themselves  and the economy  up by their bootstraps. He spoke about seven cardinal values party leaders and workers should follow. Among those, he listed saiyam (restraint), samvedana (sensitivity) and samvad (dialogue).These are laudable sentiments, if only the rest of the party were to listen. Modi talks of development and sensitivity. Sangeet Som, Hukum Singh and others light communal fires in UP.Clearly, there are two parallel narratives in the BJP today. These two stories, it hopes, will converge at the ballot box in UP next summer. But, as Euclid of Alexandria taught us in geometry, parallel lines never meet, except at infinity  which is impossible to grasp."

59049f537be9e04154df972d,A Yen for Japanese food,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/a-yen-for-japanese-food/,2016-04-30,,The Times Of India,"I am sitting with my Japanese friend, Keiko, in a restaurant in Tokyo and I am afraid to touch my food. She smiles as she sees my mesmerized look and says, Did you know that Japanese people like to eat with their eyes as well as with their mouths? I couldnt agree more. The plating is so artistic, the colors so enchanting and the food so delectable that a part of me wants to let my senses simmer in the visual feast. Arranged elegantly in front of me is a chicken and bamboo shoot stew, with a side dish of pork and beans cooked in a white sauce. The salad is served in martini glasses and the dessert plate looks like an evening at the northern lights with colors ranging from rose pink to neon green.As I wander around Japan on a week-long break, I realize how seriously the Japanese take food presentation. Whether it is a Bento Box, a Sukiyaki lunch or a Kaiseki dinner, I am left in absolutely no doubts about it. My friend informs me that ensuring how the food looks is the cooks last task and the diners first. Poor presentation, such as dull colors or an overcrowded plate might make a diner not want to eat the food. No wonder the Japanese have turned food presentation into a high art, creating a feast for the eyes, with inspirations drawn heavily from nature. The Japanese even have a special word for the rules of food presentation  moritsuke.Nowhere is this artistry more evident than in the Bento boxes that the Japanese take very seriously. Invented in the 16th century, a Bento Box is quintessentially Japanese: creative, healthy and colorful lunch boxes as much for adults as they are for kids. We eat one such Bento Box lunch at a restaurant in picturesque Miyajima, near Hiroshima. The location is particularly poignant because of the Hiroshima bombing and a singed Bento Box housed in its famous memorial. It belonged to Shigeru who on August 6, 1945, set off for his school with a Bento Box lovingly packed by his mother with his favorite food items to mark his 13th birthday. On his way to school, the bomb struck Hiroshima and everything within a few kilometers was incinerated. Three days later, his mother identified his charred body by the new Bento box clutched to his stomach.The Bento Box we are served is bursting with color and vitality. Unlike the West, where food is served mostly on uniform round plates, Japanese food is served on a variety of dishes with different shapes, textures, sizes and colors. Contrasting colors, to set off the food against the serving plates, are de rigeur. The combination of five colors  red, white, green, black, yellow  is always present in each arrangement and symbolize good health. As I tuck into my lunch, I wonder at how much time is spent by cooks in not only preparing each meal, but using ingenuity to come up with such artistic plating.I witness this again at one of the best meals I have during my Japanese soujourn: a Sukiyaki lunch. Sitting with my friends at a long table in a restaurant overlooking Lake Kawaguchiko at the foothills of Mt. Fuji, I am entranced at the number of ingredients put so delicately on the platter in front of me. Sukiyaki is a Japanese dish that is prepared and served in the hot pot style. It consists of meat (I have opted for thinly sliced fish) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table in a shallow iron pot in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Mixed in the pot are cubes of tofu, chunks of onions and leeks, shiitake mushrooms, greens and transparent shirataki noodles. Surrounding the pot are a variety of little dishes holding pickles, rice and the ubiquitous tempura. There is absolute silence as we tuck into the meal: the kind of silence that is only punctuated by oohs and aahs of an appreciative audience.Of course, its not that everything the Japanese eat or serve is so orderly and precise. The Japanese have a very quirky sense of humor and this idiosyncrasy, funnily enough, is brought out in a most unusual way. What I discover in Japan is that the Japanese are known for their goofy, over the top creativity, especially in the world of snacks. This creativity can yield both bizarre and delightful results. The flavor combinations defy reason and are so adorable that Japan, as a wit puts it is basically like the mad scientist of the snack world. So there I am scarfing down wasabi KitKats one day and licking a cone of Matcha green tea ice cream the next day. There are Mountain Dew-flavored cheetos and candy served in tiny toilet bowls. At a little Japanese store in Tokyo, I pick up candies shaped like Geisha girls and rice crackers in the shape of Japanese men and women dressed in traditional clothes. The flavors too are bizarre and range from soya jelly beans and wasabi to sakura blossoms.But the aha moment on this trip comes at a highly unlikely place: on a bullet train ride from Odawara to Hiroshima. The entire carriage has settled down peacefully for the three hour ride. As the train streaks through the countryside, most of us are dozing gently, lulled by the speed of the train and the zen-like atmosphere inside. An hour into the trip, my drowsy mind registers something. Pssst, says someone in a loud stage whisper. Who has the laddoos? I hear bodies shifting as my friends stir rapidly from their slumber. Pass the parathas please and dont forget to add the mango chutney! comes drifting down the carriage along with the smell of Indian parathas. Within seconds, I see my friends make a beeline for the seats which are rapidly disseminating Indian staple food. I cringe in my seat but surface momentarily to snatch one of the laddoos before the box disappears rapidly into the back of beyond. Arrey who has the lacchaas! And lo and behold, a packet of Haldirams aloo lacchaas starts its journey from the front of the carriage and is tossed blithely from hand to hand with a crackle and a snap.All this while the shell-shocked Japanese are sitting there clutching their briefcases close to their bodies, watching the Great Indian Circus unfold in their pristine bullet train. As quickly as the Indian food tsunami has started, it abates. As the last of the Haldirams are devoured, a collective sigh of satisfaction goes around and the group settles back into siesta mode. And the Japanese? They are still sitting wide-eyed as we exit at the next station! They may have the funny snacks but we have funny ways on where to eat them!"
5904b4ba7be9e04154dfac52,Translating Ashokamitran’s words – and his silences,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/translating-ashokamitrans-words-and-his-silences/,2016-04-06,,The Times Of India,"All these qualities abound in The Ghosts of Meenambakkam, wherein the nameless protagonist finds himself embroiled with a terrorist group, while still reeling from a personal grief. The pathos of his surreal situation contrasted with his bathetic observations make you want to laugh and cry at once. The narrator-protagonist is at the intersection of several tragedies, and demonstrates a startling mix of nonchalance, despondence and an unaffected disengagement. In Ashokamitrans delineation, these conflicting emotions dont clash, they somehow all build up into a nuanced culmination.Another arresting trait of Ashokamitrans, seen in full flow in the short stories, is this poetic quality of suggestion. Not for him the clichd short story with a fast-paced plot and a clever denouement; instead, the short stories tend to trail off into quiet endings that leave you looking for more, and then play back in ones memory with a residual heat. Ashokamitran never brings his plot into a full circle, he will inscribe an arc and leave it at that  and his si lences are devastatingly impactful.The anthology Still Bleeding from the Wound mostly features stories set in urban landscapes -Madras, Secunderabad and Bangalore -and they capture the flavours of those cities from two-three decades ago with an ethnographers precision. Extreme emotions like violence (Children), frustration (Liberation), or even horror of the supernatural (The Colours of Evil) are presented with an intense minimalist style that evoke a shudder and empathy in equal measure. Intellectual and political commentary is never made explicitly in the narrative.There are excellent moments of wry humour, I didnt write those letters with regular ink; rather I wrote them with tears No, thats not quite accurate. The letters were intended to bring tears to the readers eyes, so it would be more precise to say that I wrote them with a pen dipped in onion juice(The Colours of Evil). This only heightens the readers involvement with the character, who laughs because the only other alternative is to cry . The existential con cerns of the music teacher who will never be a singer (Evolution) and the has-been politician (Waiting in the Dark) attest to the efficacy of Ashokamitrans gripping aesthetic, free of any figurative language or clever tropes.Ashokamitrans aesthetic universe is unique and does not submit easily to English literary parlance. His reticent style builds up a sustained intensity of feeling. He crafts crisp narratives with near-anthropological insight using the most ordinary characters in quotidian settings. And ironic humour surfaces in the most unexpected corners.Kalyan Ramans sensitive translations have captured these contours most effectively . His keen attention toward changes in register, and a courageous hand in translating certain colloquialisms (e.g. I didnt steal and all in Spinning wheel) are praiseworthy . The choice of retaining several words in the original Tamil to convey the right flavour is admirable, and the glossary is helpful as well. Furthermore, he has been a close observer of Ashokamitrans craft, and is a practiced and experienced hand at rendering the latter into English. Kalyan has succeeded exceptionally in translating Ashokamitran the stories as well as the silences."

For one, everybody is in a foul mood at 0430 hours at check in and at the Immigration and the mood is made even worse by the mandatory fun loving group of half a dozen youngsters who are full of beans and in high spirits and wide awake and backslapping one another and you want to smack them as you toothpick your eyelids open.There is some aviation law that demands their inclusion on every oddly timed flight. So you have 151 zombies and this cheery cabal driving you crazy.People being people and this being early morning burps, snores and other indelicate bodily audios abound. The air is thick with the smells of garlic, onions and cooking oil dispatched in little gusts across the seats. Not to mention other genteel subjects like early morning breath and body odour in sardine can confines.The toilets become a UN designated crisis area 20 minutes after takeoff, the queue to go is also longer and a lot more aggressive with foot hopping impatience being the colour code for conduct  rap, rap, rap, hurry up, will you?Add on that distinct burnt bread smell of airline cuisine and it is enough to make your stomach turn. Which, ironically, is all that can turn because there is this tacit agreement on red eye flights that we are permitted to rest our greasy heads on the shoulders of strangers and they wont mind. Consequently, you have the swifter half leaning into the slower half with the latter suffering in stiff silence.Nobody accommodates anybody. I watch a guy who offers to sit in the middle excuse me seat and give up his aisle seat so he can be next to a friend, and this passenger refused, saying he would sit book-ended in his centre seat, period.The man and his wife next to me ceremoniously opened a packet of aloo parathas and mango pickle and even the sun which had kind of packed its bags to come out and beam through the porthole shrank and went back behind a cloud.Meanwhile the husband in the newly-wed couple on my left explained to his wife that Dubai to Delhi was 2 hours and 30 minutes while the reverse was 4 hours because the routes were different and she looked at him soulfully, with admiration spilling from her like rainwater from a spaniel. Such a lot of crock.Ban these flights  they stink."

Last Friday, back from the local Kolkata bazar, i surveyed my haul of the stuff a hungering, homesick Hon Bong desires. There i was, salivating over the prospect of kumro phooler bhaja, the crisp fritters of the yellow pumpkin flower, the cooling beler shorbot, a stir fry of onion stalks, pyaj koli, when, boom the pain struck. Its always a four- letter word, but this one was raised to 4,000 potency. It shot through my wrist, seized my hand in a vice, refused to allow my fingers to close into a fist to punch it back, or to turn my palm upwards in supplication for relief. My head reeled.The classic 4Ws +1H of a news report surfaced. Why here, far away from my doctor network? Whom to call? Where to go? What to do? How even to think straight. Fortunately, host-saheb was cooler than the ice he promptly laid on before getting on the phone. None of the lofty neuro guys was available, but, fortunately, the take-it-for-now option turned out to be the right one.Sumit Mukherjee, the physiotherapist, listened with the patience of a man used to Bengali patients. Along with us bawas, this is a breed whose hypochondria is matched by hyper-drama. He pressed hard on the culprit wrist bone, and declared, Snuff box.

So now i know theres DQ, in addition to IQ. And to TQ, shorthand at Khushwant Singhs Illustrated Weekly of the 70s; it stood for tit-quotient, the mandated photographs of bare-bosomed belles.So heres another story. Femina was down the corridor, home to stylish, cigarette-smoking Libbers  and a steno called Krishnan. He took perverse pleasure in going up to the women, taking a pinch out of his snuff box and loudly ah-chhooing into this stained handkerchief. One day the exasperated Prabha protested.

5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,,The Times Of India,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."
5904ea987be9e04154dfdb02,What the ponkh?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/what-the-phonk/,2016-02-15,,The Times Of India,"It is a lazy winter morning in Mumbai and finally for what it is worth, there is a nip in the air and the urge to have frequent cups of garam-garam chai. I am sitting all toasty and warm in my favorite recliner when the doorbell rings and a friend sashays in, radiating bonhomie and good cheer. I have just come from Surat and look what I have for you, she exults. Diamonds? I breathe hopefully. No silly, she giggles, waving a bejeweled hand towards a box she is carrying. Its ponkh!Ponkh? I squeak.Spoiler alert: for those of you who are hardcore carnivores, there is no meat in this story!What she has got back from her recent soujourn to Surat is a Gujarati delicacy called ponkh which is the local name given to tender jowar seeds or white millets. During a brief period in the winter months, the jowar grain is juicy and very tender and the seeds are just right to be harvested and eaten roasted. It is generally picked from fields and cooked there and then, with parties thrown to celebrate this young edible seed.My friends box reveals a bunch of packets neatly packed together: the green jowar seeds, three types of sev (fried gram flour noodles) and tiny sugar granules also known as sakkar-danna. The three sevs spread out in front of me are variously colored: a yellow one which is mildly spicy, a tomato-flavored red one, and the brown one which is hot and spicy and enticingly called limbu-mari (lime and pepper). The three flavors of the sev and their sharpness offset the slightly bland and sweetish taste of the ponkh. And I guess the sakkar-danas are provided to counteract the smoke-in -the-ears spiciness of the limbu-mari. Ponkh is sometimes eaten raw and sometimes slightly roasted and Gujaratis often wash it down with glasses of chhaas or lassi. My friend informs me that die-hard lovers of this delicacy even attend ponkh picnics in Surat.In Maharashtra, ponkh is known as hurda. As a child, I remember my mother talking about the hurda parties she used to attend on her visits to her hometown of Amalner, Maharashtra. During the season, the local farmers would throw a party in the middle of the fields where the young tender jowar was being roasted and eaten directly when it was still hot and tender. To accompany the hurda, the farmers wives would provide jaggery (gud), shengdana-lassun chutney (groundnut-garlic chutney), dry khobra chutney (dry coconut chutney), wangya chi bhaji (a brinjal preparation)and taak (butter milk).So now I am sitting with this big fat packet of ponkh and after diligently mixing the three sevs and a bit of the sugar granules with the green seeds, I carefully plate it on a salad dish and serve it to the family. Unfortunately, it does not set anyone on fire. The husband grimaces, the foodie wrinkles his nose and I stoically plod through the helping I have served myself. The next day, I decide to spice up the ponkh by serving it as a bhel. I add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, rock salt, a dash of chaat masala, and a few drops of lemon juice. On top, I add the rainbow colored sev, and serve it in the evening as an appetizer before dinner. The foodie son looks at it and exclaims, That thing again!My cook, the Garwahli genius, comes in from the kitchen to see what the fuss is all about. He takes a look at the ponkh offering, tastes it and then saunters off to the kitchen with something suspiciously sounding like Not on my table wafting on the breeze. With sarson ka saag and makke di roti on the menu, the poor ponkh is not getting its day under the sun in our house.Desperate to finish the huge mound of ponkh sitting forlornly in my kitchen, I call a few Gujarati friends and ask if they would want ponkh. Chokkas! Tarat mukaljo! (Of course, send at once) is the ardent response. And now, just as I am sitting back with a contented sigh that the ponkh has finally gone to places where it is being appreciated, my friend calls and asks how I liked the ponkh. Loved it, I squawk and cross my fingers for lying. Great, she chirps happily. Next year I will send you three kilos, and hangs up."
5904f8b27be9e04154dfe8d1,Bread-Poha or things like that,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sweet-n-sour/bread-poha-or-things-like-that/,2016-02-05,,The Times Of India,"Youve had a heavy lunch or a late one and if youre fitness (or thinness) freak you might forego dinner but if youre like me, who need their three-squares (and some intermediates), bread-poha is our salvation. Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

There is silence all around except for the occasional chirping of a bird or a distant car horn. As much as I try to focus on my breathing, my mind keeps going back to my busy schedule for the day. I open one eye and look at the girl lying next to me. She is snoring slightly. How can she do it? I shut my eyes tight, and try again. Do I over-think?I did not make a resolution this New Year. It is the first time in maybe fifteen years, that I did not say, This year I am going to lose weight! Though I could hear that line pop up at the back of my head all through New Years eve, I drowned it out with a few glasses of Mot! After all these years of following a somewhat repetitive routine the brain tells you what to do, even if you do not want it to. Its called muscle memory! So instead, I have made up my mind that this year, I am going to give myself ME. Find myself, the real and inner me. Pull myself out from the depths of a space where I have been comfortably hiding. Under layers of conditioning and practise. This is not a resolution as I tend to break those by the third week of January, which is about now! This a decision. Do I have the courage?Hmm So it must be around 9am already. I have to rush back home, as the hubby has an early meeting, and I need to be around while he leaves. Four egg whites with mushrooms, tomatoes and onions, very fluffy, no oil. The cook has been serving it to him for the past thirteen years! So what can go wrong with that if Im not around? Well invariably something does! I have to make sure that his shirt is pressed crisp with zero creases, and that he is wearing blue, his lucky colour, as he has an important buyer today! OhI almost forgot. I need to finalise with him the guest list for the dinner party we are having next week, as I have to send out a save the date today! I was supposed to ask him last night but then I didnt get the chance to as I had to accompany him for a business dinner, where I was busy entertaining three Chinese wifeys with stories on our Bollywood Badshah Shahrukh Khan! It always works! Do I try too hard to be the perfect-wifey?As I sit down with my chai, the staff will then attack me with the problems for the day! Bhabhi I have to go on leave today as my chachas son-in-law is going to the village, or bhabhi the washing machine has broken down, again! Each day there is a new issue, and it drives me up the wall! Also I have to give them instructions to start polishing the silveware for our party! It must sparkle like it is brand new. And tell them what to make as a snack when the kids get home from school. Mexican Tacos maybe? Do I sound like a typical bhabhiji?I must quickly escape to the salon to get my hair and nails done, as I have to go for a very social lunch! Now this is going to be an afternoon of complimenting on the face, talking behind each others back, and then discussing travel plans for the long Easter weekend. None of this really appeals to me, but not showing up is not really an option in this city! If you dont go once it is okay, maybe they will believe that you genuinely have the flu! But if you dont go twice, it is over! Your favourite aunt can be in the ICU, but you better not cancel twice! Its social murder or rather suicide. I mentally put together my outfit for this glamourous affair. Do I want to be part of this air-kissing society?Once Im done, I have to rush home cause the tween girl has her assessments going on! Anyone who has a child this age will agree with me that it is better to get home in time to hear their high-pitched complains on everything wrong that is happening in their lives! My best friend had a fight with me, she is so mean!, or then something else as earth shattering! This is always accompanied by water works, as in free flowing tears, and the mom you just dont get it dialogue! After the tweeny outburst we will have to study together for at least an hour! She must revise again. I mean whats wrong with trying to get perfect grades right? I must take the lil boy for his running practice as he has his school sports day in a couple of days. He is all excited but needs my constant cheering. It makes me go faster, he says, smiling! That reminds me that we have junior football league this Sunday, where full-on adrenalin and energy is required by us moms, to make sure their sons score! Im sure even Messi is not as driven to win, as our young boys are! Do I behave like an over-protective and pushy mom?Oh oh! I forgot to call my mother-in-law to check whether we are going to the Mata ki Chowki tomorrow? Being a non-Punju it is sometimes overwhelming the number of festivals and customs there are! All I know is that I attend them all, by putting on a blingy salwar-kameez, do parey paina'(touch feet and get blessings) to many Auntyjis, and eat yummy channa-kulcha and malai-phirni! Of course, vigorously moving to the beats of the dhol. I also better start my research on hotels and flights for our next family holiday. Golden Temple or Goa? Do I fit the part of a dutiful daughter-in-law?My legs are still killing me from my high impact Zumba class yesterday. I got a bit carried away and overdid the sexy hip rotations while squatting! I do try to keep myself in good shape, externally! Regular workouts, facials, tonnes of makeup, and not to forget carb-deprivation! Can you believe that I was actually dreaming of a divine molten chocolate fondant last night? But I cannot touch it until my cousins wedding next month. I have to wear a gorgeous sari, so I am working towards flat abs. Do I focus too much on my outward appearance?The soreness, coupled with the pain thanks to the stilettos I wore to the business dinner last night, are making me realize that my legs are not as young as they used to be! Im thinking of this, and cringing, because I have to get back on those damn heels tonight. We have to attend a friends 40th birthday dinner! Again, no excuses will work right. I mean its not like I dont want to go after all, its just a bunch of close buddies! A few beers down the hubbies will start to discuss the bad economy and who is surviving in these markets! We wifeys, taking big gulps of wine, will discuss our maids ( gods gift to womankind), or our kids achievements! My darling daughter came first in her elocution! Do I like hanging out with these friends?So it is going to be quite a hectic day, or rather week as usual! Am I complaining? Not really. But do you also sometimes feel that while you are struggling to juggle all your responsibilities, in the process, somewhere down the line, you lose yourself? Do we allow our inner self to take a backseat in our own life, while we go around making others happy, or perform our never ending duties? What about all the questions in my head? I realize now that they have one common simple answer, which is YES. These are all the roles I play, and I give it my best, every single moment. Also I actually enjoy this routine and value each bond I have. But am I putting in too much? Where is my own identity? Is this who I really am? No. I need to look deeper. And I know I will find myself.What is it that I want? For myself, and not anyone else! I have already made progress towards my decision for the year. I have found my voice, which comes straight from the heart and reaches you, through my writing. I will continue to discover who I am, and slowly rise to the surface. Hmm Suddenly I hear my yoga teachers voice,Open your eyes gently. I might not have been able to relax, as she asked us to, but at the end of the three minutes I have definitely decided to let go, so that I can find ME."

What image he projects to those waiting to malign it. Perhaps the mark of a gentle society then, is how it deals with conflict, and how it protests against those it dislikes.In India, we throw ink.Which is something Arvind Kejriwals office must be appalled at. Imagine a bunch of people who are anyway politically nave, trying to figure out how to wipe ink stains off their leader. Hes been inked more times than that girl with a dragon tattoo on her clavicle and a butterfly tattoo on her ankle. The AAP blames the BJP for doing it, but I doubt it: it totally goes against their Swacch Bharat mission.Consider a person called X, who throws ink at people he doesnt like. X is probably also the same guy who wrote Kick Me behind a classroom rivals bum. You found it funny then, but then you grew up, and X didnt. Maybe youd find it funny if he threw ink and didnt run away, but pointed and laughed at his victim. But youd have to be in a really good mood, like a Radio Jockey or something. As this would clarify, Im not a nice guy saying its rude to throw ink at people. No. Im just a boy, asking people for more imaginative insults.Thats where I miss Jaspal Bhatti. The only ink he threw was on paper, when he was scripting Flop Show, which more than smeared the faces of the establishment. Another time, he garlanded politicians with onions to protest against price rise. But thinking of smart ideas is hard work, so Im sure all that happens is this:Junior politician: Lets throw ink!Senior politician: Why?JP: Because we dont like his face!SP: Cant we just call a press conference and say that we dont like his face?JP: Thatll be too in-your-faceSP: Fine, lets throw ink onlyI wish every political party had that one khadoos Bengali creative director whod make a face and say, Think more. This idea has been done before. Because if youre in politics, you ought to be a man of ideas. And if you cant come with smart ideas to insult a tiny rival, Im sorry, we cant trust you with the entire bloody country. Even the tech-savvy army of bhakts would ask, Who needs ink when you have twitter?, before calling a dissenting writer a Pakistani agent. I dont know the history of ink attacks, but Im sure the first person to ever suggest it was told to stand at a corner, facing the wall.Maybe once were done arresting comedians for cracking jokes, we could look at laughing at the ink army. Every time someone throws ink at someone, respond with Seriously? Thats it?. Bring it to a point where even Bhupendra Choubey says, Ink is a matter of theummpast.Its the digital age, you can no longer be relevant when you work with ink. Someone needs to tell them that good protests are about making a point, not a mess."

All 18 of Jakartas measures affecting imported horticulture, animals and animal products were prohibited under WTO rules dating to its predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the panel said.Watch what else is making news:The import restrictions cover products such as apples, grapes, potatoes, onions, flowers, juice, dried fruit, cattle, chicken and beef, the U.S. trade office said in March 2015 when challenging the measures. New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay on Friday welcomed the ruling, saying the restrictions were estimated to have cost the countrys beef sector up to NZ$1 billion ($690.20 million).This is an important result for New Zealands agricultural exporters  and for trade fairness, McClay said in a statement. The arbitrators urged Indonesia to bring its measures into conformity.

Records published by the Nashik-based National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) showed that 13,56,381.48 metric tonnes (MT) of onions have been exported till September this year. This is a significant rise as compared to the 11,14,418.13 MT export of the vegetable in 2015. Although only about 10 per cent of the onion grown in the country has been exported, the figure is important to keep the price parity in wholesale markets.Watch What Else is Making NewsOver the past several months, onions were being sold at Rs 7 per kg in the Lasalgaon wholesale market here, causing losses to the growers.Last year, the average price of the produce in the same market was Rs 20 per kg. Excess production, especially in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, has been cited as the reason for the present glut, which had ensured that the prices remain subdued throughout the year.Earlier this year, the price of the bulb had touched an all-time low at Lasalgaon market as it was being traded at Rs 4.25 per kg  a record low in the last five years. In order to boost the price, the Central government had announced a 6 per cent export subsidy, which had helped in pushing some of the produce out of India.Jagdish Apsunde, an exporter from Nashik, said, at present, the Indian onions have good prices in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The minimum export price (MRP) is at zero and arrival of the bulb in the market is good. These two factors have at least ensured steady exports, he said. The export figures this year have surpassed the exports in the last two years. Apsunde said the Centre has been forthwith in settling subsidy claims, which has also helped exports.Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said steady exports have helped in holding the local prices. However, I feel the prices of onion at the wholesale markets will come down as soon as the bumper arrival of late kharif crop happens, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8e77be9e033b96e95d4,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,,Indian Express,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He alleges because of demonetisation he could not pay wages to labour.WATCH VIDEO: Shivraj Singh Slams Mamata For Criticising Demonetisation PolicyA bhag chashi or landless farmer, Nandi used to farm onions on one acre that belonged to his landlord. A Santhali tribal, Nandi lived with his family in remote Rahatpur village of Bardhaman district.Villagers said Nandi had been anxious about being unable to pay the labour he had hired to till the field he had rented. He had around Rs 20,000 in an account in the local Samavay Krishi Unnayan Samiti or SKUS. These Samitis are local branches of cooperative banks.He was always very sensitive. His labourers had been taunting him for days. Short of money himself, Nandi couldnt take the abuse anymore, said a villager.Since most famers do not have bank accounts, they deposit their savings in these SUKS branches. Nandi had a certain amount in SKUS but after the directive that no money transactions will take place in cooperative banks, Nandis money was stuck, said Swapan Debnath, who visited the Nandi home in the evening.Nandi is survived by his wife Sundari and son Nirmal. Sundari and their son had gone to another landlords field to work as hired help, leaving Nandi alone at home. When Nirmal, 24, and his mother came back from work they found him hanging from a tree in a corner of their courtyard.He owed his labour team Rs 3,000, said Debnath. Its the farmers who have been hit the most. Nandi was just one such case. Because of this government directive, their cash is stuck and this is harvesting season. Most farmers withdraw their cash in this season and deposit it back after selling their product, before the next season of sowing, Debnath said.Forget the farmers. We have had byelections in Monteswar assembly constituency in Bardhaman and we havent been able to pay party workers. One day we all just survived on puffed rice and tea because we didnt have the notes to buy proper food.

(Source: Reuters) An Iraqi soldier searches a house during clashes with Islamic State fighters in Al-Qasar, southeast of Mosul. (Source: Reuters)She survived the first stone that struck her, then the second. One of the Islamic State groups fighters bent down and pressed his fingers to the side of her neck to check her pulse. As her horrified neighbors watched, extremists threw a third stone at the young woman, who was accused of adultery. That one killed her.It was, for those who witnessed it, the cruelest moment in Mosuls two-year descent into fear, hunger and isolation. Before the siege, Iraqs second-largest city was arguably the most multicultural place in Iraq, with a Sunni Muslim Arab majority but also thriving communities of Kurds, Shiites, Christians and Yazidis. Together, they had created Mosuls distinct identity, with its own cuisine, intellectual life and economy.Watch What Else Is Making NewsBut the Islamic State group turned Mosul into a place of literal and spiritual darkness. It began with promises of order and a religious utopia that appealed to some, but over the course of 2 { years, the militants turned crueler, the economy crumbled under the weight of war and shortages set in. Those who resisted watched neighbors who joined IS turn prosperous and vindictive. Parents feared for the brainwashing of their children. By the end, as Iraqi troops besieged Mosul, the militants hanged suspected spies from lampposts, and residents were cut off from the world.The womans killing in Mosuls Samah district shook to the core those in the crowd forced to watch as their neighbor was dragged before them. It was in August, after the militants had lost strongholds in other parts of Iraq and Syria, prompting them to heighten their repression.Several witnesses described to The Associated Press how the woman and her alleged lover were paraded blindfolded through the streets. The militants summoned everyone they could find to watch.Still not dead, Samira Hamid recalled the militant pronouncing after he checked the womans pulse, before the lethal blow to her head. The man accused of being her lover was flogged 150 times and forced to go to Syria to fight in IS ranks.Another witness, Sarmad Raad, found recalling the killing nearly unbearable.I shut down, the 26-year-old said, I just lost my mind.The AP interviewed dozens of residents who have left Mosul since Iraqi troops began retaking outlying districts last month. They described life in a city that has been virtually sealed off from the outside under the rule of the Islamic State. They spoke from Mosuls edges and from the refugee camps that are their homes for the foreseeable future, even as smoke rose and artillery boomed from nearby front lines.For many among Mosuls Sunni Arabs, the siege by the Sunni militants of IS started as a respite from what they considered the heavy hand of Iraqs Shiite-led central government in Baghdad. As Iraqi soldiers vanished in those first few weeks, people were simply happy to see hated security checkpoints pulled down and traffic moving smoothly along streets lined with low, pale buildings. Sunni insurgents have long been active in Mosul, and Baghdads clampdowns against them usually only fueled residents distrust.But even as families strolled in the parks and shops stayed open, signs emerged that this group of fighters was unlike past insurgents who had worked strictly underground: trucks began hauling office furniture to various government buildings, according to a blog called Mosul Eye, written by a resident who took on the role of city historian. Islamic State extremists were moving in.Several weeks later, the group declared its caliphate stretching across its territory in Syria and Iraq.Within a month, the homes of Christians and other minorities were tagged with official stickers _ for statistical purposes, IS officials said, according to Mosul Eye. Christians and Shiites soon fled, leaving their marked homes and belongings behind.Kurds were soon targeted as well.If you turned in a Kurdish family, they gave you a car, said Hassan Ali Mustapha, a retired prison guard who walked with a heavy limp through the camp that is his familys new home. They made their escape from Mosul first on foot and then by Iraqi government truck. Mustapha himself said he moved to a home deserted by a Kurdish family, after a mutual friend asked them to keep Islamic State from taking it over.The group imposed the extreme, severe vision of Islamic law across its zone of control. Dress was strictly regulated, and clothes manufacturers were told to report to Islamic State offices to receive the acceptable measurements. Women were required to hide their faces and don black down to their fingertips. The fine for violations even as small as the wrong kind of stocking was 25,000 dinars, around 20 dollars. Repeat offenders got lashes.There was another, widely feared punishment as well: the womens brigade of religious enforcers used a metal-toothed device to deliver vicious, deep bites on women they deemed as dressing improperly, according to two women.Punishments were often public, and in a central square the group printed broadsheets proclaiming how it would respond to disobedience. In one case, according to a witness, there was a gleeful description of criminals being shoved into a commercial oven to roast to death.The militants took a cut of all business through fees, fines or taxes. Even roadside hawkers had to pay IS according to the size of the sheet on the ground where they displayed their wares _ 15,000 dinar ($12) per square meter. As they described indignities piling up, the camp residents dragged their feet in the dust to show just how small a space could be taxed.Residents learned to keep a mental tally of all the different rules _ and find ways to dissent.The most symbolic was the widespread refusal to send children to the schools, which the extremists took over.Mosul prides itself on an ancient history of knowledge. Near the center of the city are the ruins of the city of Nineveh where stone tablets more than 3,000 years old were discovered in a library, inscribed with the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, considered humanitys oldest surviving work of literature.But in the IS schools, lessons were about guns and warplanes. Mathematics courses couldnt use a plus symbol because it resembled a Christian cross. Mosuls biggest libraries were ransacked over a number of weeks, beginning in late 2014, and the extremists set up bonfires to torch books on science and culture, according to accounts at the time.Though IS threatened flogging and even death as punishments for absenteeism, students and teachers alike stayed away from the university, according to Mosul Eye.Schools once free to everyone now involved fees that few could afford without a steady paycheck. By mid-2014, steady income came only from joining the Islamic State group. Many dismissed entirely the thought of paying their dwindling cash for a worthless education.So we didnt send them to school, said Khodriya Ahmed, a mother of 12 from the outlying neighborhood of Gogjali. For two or three years, Daesh only educated their own children, she said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.Hussam Ghareeb, a former soldier, also refused to send his children to IS-run schools.He is living in a camp with his family, including his 6-year-old son Omar.God willing, you will be a doctor and help those who are hurt. Yes, son? he asked, turning to the boy. Omar has yet to set foot in a classroom.The groups propaganda insisted all was fine in the city. John Cantlie, a British journalist held hostage by the Islamic State group for four years, has made periodic appearances in videos filmed in Mosul, showing a market, an efficient IS motorcycle police force and a city continuing to function despite the threat of airstrikes from the Iraqi military and the U.S.-led coalition.Members of the actual police force, meanwhile, had either been killed or gone into hiding as IS hunted down policemen or soldiers to eliminate the group of people best able to fight against them.Oday Mustapha Suleiman, a former soldier, knew of two police officers killed by militants, as well as his brother. Suleiman himself spent most of his time inside his house for fear of being caught.They drove through the streets with a microphone, calling our names, he said. For 10 days I hid, just pacing between my room and the front door because they wanted to cut off my head.Azhar Yonas, a small, nervous man who fingered his prayer beads as he spoke, said his name was on an IS list of police officers so he went into hiding. Yonas estimated that a third of the 30,000 strong force was killed tossed into a natural pit outside the city believed to hold thousands of bodies.They said they put them in the hole so they would not make the land unclean, Yonas said.His youngest child was born July 3, 2014, a day before IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi mounted a dais in a Mosul mosque and gave a sermon demanding Muslims obey him as the newly declared caliph.Yonas wife gave birth at the hospital without him. He did not dare join her.The family skipped from relative to relative an estimated 100 times in 2{ years.Iraqis have big families, he said with a wry smile.As the siege wore on, the Baghdad government cut off the flow of money it had been paying civil servants, and airstrikes cut into Islamic States oil revenue and cash reserves. The infrastructure and services initially provided by the group broke down. Electricity cuts forced people to rely on oil lamps. Communications were cut off, although people still managed to make periodic, hushed calls to Alghan FM, a radio station founded by an exiled Mosul resident that has become a sounding board to those trapped in the city.Four months ago, satellite television went down. Six months ago, it was the internet, said the stations founder, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Mohammed, for his safety. IS wanted people to be isolated completely.IS enforcers cowed entire neighborhoods by forcing people to watch as they hacked off hands and lashed, beheaded or stoned offenders.Hamid, one of the residents of the Samah neighborhood who witnessed the stoning, said her 39-year-old son suffers from severe psychological problems and ran afoul of Islamic State when he wandered from home one evening. They accused him of being drunk, clubbed him with a gun and took him away. In detention, they beat him more. Finally the family found out where he was being held and brought him home.Only his eyes were untouched. Everything else was bruised. And he became like a parrot, just repeating what we would say, she said.Residents said IS fighters herded people into Mosuls central market nearly every week for public punishments. They forced all of us to watch, said Raad, the 26-year-old, speaking in the Hassan Sham camp midway between Mosul and Irbil where he and many of his neighbors have ended up.With the militants digging in as they lost territory elsewhere, Mosuls residents saw food supplies dwindle until onions and bread were all that was left. Prices that had been kept stable began to spiral. With food in short supply and jobs even scarcer, people started selling anything of value to anyone willing to buy.Khodr Ahmed sold his car for $400 dollars. But as that money ran out, he sent his young boys Bashir and Mushal out to hunt for scrap metal.As they scrounged, 9-year-old Bashir picked up what turned out to be an abandoned IS explosive. It blew off his hand and gouged a hole in his 10-year-old brothers shin.Poverty and hunger caused all of this, said Ahmed. And the poverty and hunger, he said, were caused by IS. For them, they were living the good life. They had food to eat, but because we did not join, there was nothing for us.Their neighbor was among those to reap the rewards of joining, the Ahmeds said. That family got a car and never wanted for food or electricity. But Khodrya, Ahmeds wife, said her refusal to fully accept IS rules for women earned her a death threat from the same neighbor _ one he never had the chance to carry out.In recent weeks, to further seal off Mosuls people from the world outside, Islamic State took to hanging people from street lights in residential neighborhoods, according to two men who fled Mosul, speaking on condition they not be named to protect their families. Most of the dead were caught using mobile phones, an act considered spying.Still, people within Mosul find ways to communicate, if only briefly.Saif, a man from the Zahra neighborhood, said his family inside the city managed to send quick texts to say they are safe. He spoke using only his first name to protect his relatives.Mustapha, the former prison guard, was among those to keep his cell phone. He wrapped it in plastic and buried it in the garden, making only brief phone calls. One of his sons lives in Irbil. They have not seen each other since IS took over, although the two cities were, in better days, just an hour apart by car.Mustapha now is unsure he would ever want to return home.Mosul is like a forest with hidden monsters, he said, but he knows everyone who joined the Islamic State. I can remember everything.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named. We are planning to provide transporters of at least onion, potato and tomato with some cash to enable them to continue plying. It will require expenditure of a few crore rupees, which is not a big deal, added the official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya) Groundnut auction in progress at Gujarats Gondal APMC. (Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya)AT 6 AM, theres still time for the auctions, but farmers have already filled a giant shed in this towns old APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard with their fresh harvested vegetables. About half-an-hour later, a freshly shaven Ghanshyam Pokar, the auctioneer for Shree Patel Group, a leading commission agency-cum-trading firm here, arrives and is immediately surrounded by buyers that include vegetable vendors. The auction, then, begins with bids as low as Re 1 per kg, before settling at Rs 2 for brinjal. In almost all others  cabbage, cauliflower, red/green chilli, carrot, radish, lemon, spring onion and ginger  the prices dont exceed Rs 10/kg. By 8 AM, when Pokar has finally wound up, the entire produce in the shed has been auctioned off.Bakul Savaliya, a farmer from the outskirts of Gondal  40 km from Rajkot city and housing Saurashtras, and one of Gujarats, biggest APMC  doesnt hide his disappointment. The 50 kg of carrots that he brought fetched a mere Rs 4 per kg. Ive been coming here for the last 10 days and prices have never crossed Rs 8. At these rates, can I recover anything other than my own labour of digging out the carrots, cleaning and lugging them here? asks this 34-year-old who has grown the vegetable on his 20-bigha holding (six bigha make a hectare).Ramji Jamod, another farmer from Jamwadi, a village five km from Gondal, is similarly bitter about his 15 kg of green chillies grossing just Rs 150 at Rs 10/kg. He has reasons to be so: It is biting cold, especially when I have to ride my bike and be here by 5 AM to find enough space for unloading the produce. And at the end, what am I getting?Dhiru and Ashok Mer with their groundnut crop. (Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya) Dhiru and Ashok Mer with their groundnut crop. (Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya)Jamods sole consolation is that he has started getting payment in hard cash. After Notebandi  the NDA governments November 8 announcement scrapping the legal tender status of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes  the Gondal APMC was closed for a couple of days.I tried hawking the vegetables myself, but found it too time-consuming and so returned to selling through the Shree Patel Group. They first did not pay anything for a whole week. Then, they paid Rs 7,000 in the old notes, of which I am still carrying Rs 4,000. But for the last two weeks, they have been paying in valid currency notes, says Jamod. While he attributes the fall in prices to notebandi, Pokar  whose firm earns a 6 per cent commission, charged on the price paid by the buyer, on top of a 0.7 per cent APMC user charge  blames it equally on the spike in arrivals from a good crop this time.The Class III-pass Jamod tills 50 bigha land taken on a three-year lease, costing Rs 80,000 annually. Paying it isnt an issue. My problem today is finding hard currency. The five quintals of kapas (raw unginned cotton) that I sold fetched me Rs 25,625, but the entire payment was through cheque. Since there was no cash, I had to borrow Rs 6,000 for paying the cotton pickers. I now need labour for picking the residual groundnut pods in the soil. As Im not sure when the cheque can be encashed, it looks we (wife and three children included) will have to do the job ourselves, he complains.Jamod, during the kharif (post-monsoon) season, had planted groundnuts in 30 bigha, cotton in 15 bigha and vegetables  mainly chillies and val papdi (broad beans)  in his remaining five bigha. He is yet to sell his 40 quintals of harvested groundnuts, waiting for prices to improve. Vegetable sales are keeping his family going for the time being.I have sold Rs 25,000 worth of produce so far. But I have also been spending Rs 2,500 per week on pesticides alone, apart from irrigating the standing chilly using tanker water. I have already purchased seven tanker loads, each costing Rs 1,500, notes Jamod. Given the acute water shortage, he has even resorted to harvesting tender green chillies. The ones that are half-ripe, he is allowing to further ripen, before harvesting, sun-drying and finally taking to the market.Meanwhile, in the Gondal APMCs new yard, Gujarats largest market for groundnut, the auctions start at 8:30 AM. On Monday  which saw arrivals of 16,043 bags of 35 kg each  the bids ranged from Rs 3,200 to Rs 4,305 per quintal. The average rate, at Rs 3,700 per quintal, was well below the Centres minimum support price of Rs 4,220.Among the 100-odd farmers waiting for their produce to go under the hammer is 35-year-old Dhiru Mer, who belongs to Kundani village in Rajkot districts Jasdan taluka. Although Jasdan has an APMC, he prefers travelling 80 km and paying Rs 2,000 to the trucker to sell at the Gondal yard, where prices are better. The auctioneer Hansraj Sardhara declares Mers two separate piles of groundnut sold at Rs 3,780 and Rs 4,055 per quintal. But Kishor Rajapara, who has placed the higher bid, is ready to pay Mer Rs 80,000 only through cheque. I feel bad, but we ourselves are being paid by cheque and banks are allowing us to make weekly withdraw of just Rs 50,000, states this trader. Mer picks out a Rs 20 note from his pocket, swearing he has nothing else  not even money to buy lunch.December is the peak season for groundnut arrivals. Normally, at this time, these would be one lakh bags daily, whereas we are hardly getting 15 per cent of that. Only farmers with debts to clear or having special family obligations are coming to sell, admits Jayantibhai S Dhol, chairman of the Gondal APMC.There is a dearth of buyers, too. The only ones active are the oil mills and even they arent stocking up. Farmers come to me every day demanding cash. But I am unable to oblige, because theres nobody to pay me by cash. I am issuing over 50 cheques daily, while running out of leaves every second day. There are many cases of delayed clearances and even bouncing of cheques, observes Haresh Vadodariya, a commission agent and also a director of the APMC.The cash crunch, post-demonetisation, has also slowed down rabi (winter) season plantings. Jayantibhai Hadwani, who cultivates 18 bigha in Navagam village of Junagadh districts Vanthali taluka, got 40 kg of coriander seeds from a fellow farmer, but had to spend four days in bank queues to deposit his old notes and withdraw new currency. On Monday, the 50-year-olds son lined up before the State Bank of Indias branch at Shapur, a nearby village, only to return empty-handed. Hadwani himself is owed Rs 15,000 by other farmers who had hired his tractor and thresher.Sagar Makadiya, a farmer from Khadpipli village in Junagadhs Mendarda taluka, has harvested 34 quintals of groundnut from eight of his familys 10 bighas. He does not want to sell at the current rates, but was forced to borrow Rs 5,000 to pay labourers for picking up the residual groundnut pods and prepare his field for sowing coriander. The coriander seeds and fertilisers, too, he purchased on credit. Last week, Makadiyas father sold three quintals of kapas from the remaining two bighas at Rs 5,140 per quintal. The trader who bought issued a cheque for Rs 16,000, which bounced, as the bank found that his fathers name had been spelt differently. So, Makadiyas father has gone back to the trader, requesting for a fresh cheque for the same amount.The worst-hit, though, are agricultural labourers. Six families from Nandurbar district of Maharashtra are currently camping in Khadpipli. Farmers here owe us over Rs 8,000. We want to return home, but the pending dues are holding us back, informs Sanjaya Nahade, who is one of those awaiting payment from equally cash-strapped farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a05287be9e033fa42eca5,Watch out for these four crops!,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-agricultural-producuction-wholesale-market-4404175/,2016-12-01,,Indian Express,"There are four major crops currently being planted or in the early stages of growth  wheat, onion, potato and chana (chickpea)  whose status needs close monitoring in the coming weeks, to ensure least production disruptions from demonetisation-imposed cash crunch.In three of the four commodities, tight supplies have already led to price rise. Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The deceased Vishwanath Vartak, a retired Public Works Department (PWD) employee, was in front of the State Bank of India (SBI) branch in Mulund (east) to exchange Rs 4,000 when he collapsed.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe incident took place at Hari Om Nagar in Mulund (east) outside the SBI branch around 11.30 am. Senior Inspector of Navghar police station Madhav More said the bank branch was hardly 100 metres away from where Vartak lived with his wife. Vartak had been suffering from high blood pressure for the past 20 years. As he reached the SBI bank branch and was climbing the stairs leading to the bank, he started feeling giddy and his hands and legs started to shiver, More said. He added, There was no crowd outside the bank when he started feeling uneasy.As Vartak reached the bank, he told a few people standing nearby that his hands were shivering and he was not feeling well. The people assembled there took him aside and gave him water. They thought he was having an epileptic fit and hence also tried making him smell onions to get him to regain consciousness. In the meantime, some people called the local medical practitioner. By the time the doctor reached the spot, Vartak had succumbed to what seems like a heart attack, More said.Vartaks two sons, who also live near the bank, were informed by the police and he was taken to a local hospital. We have sent his body to the Rajawadi hospital for the post-mortem report, the senior inspector said. He added, He had been battling health issues for the last two decades. It does not seem that the crowd had anything to do with him having suffered a heart attack. He was already feeling uneasy even before he entered the bank and there was no queue there. The post-mortem report will clarify the issue further, the senior inspector said.Kamlesh Hireshwar, the security guard who was present when the incident took place, said, I was in the bank when a customer came rushing in saying someone had collapsed just outside the bank. I rushed out and tried to revive him but he didnt respond to anything. He added, He did not even enter the bank so there is no question of him standing in line.A relative of the deceased said, The family is upset that the media is linking his death to the demonetisation issue. He had been having health issues for a while and his death has nothing to do with him being in the bank.According to the medical officer, the senior citizen was brought dead to Veer Savarkar Hospital in Mulund by Friday evening. He had no physical injuries and we referred the case to Rajawadi Hospital for post-mortem, the officer said.According to him, Vartak was suffering from hypertension for over seven years. He was on medication and undergoing treatment for it. According to his son, Aniruddh, Vartak only had age-related health problems.The port-mortem was carried out at Rajawadi Hospital. According to a medical officer, who was part of the autopsy, it seemed that Vartak had suffered a heart attack. He was battling no illness and was healthy. But his heart was weak due to old age, the medical officer said. Vartaks organs have been reserved for histopathology to determine the final cause of death.

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farm labourers harvesting late-kharif onions at a field near Nashik. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Its already a bit late in the season, but three out of Nandu Awatis seven-acres holding are yet to see any rabi onion plantings. The 42-year-old from Ambegaon, a village in Yeola taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, had sown onion seeds in his nursery by mid-October and begun transplanting the germinated seedlings from these towards the month-end. By November first week, he had finished transplanting in four acres, when disaster struck in the form of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. That was on November 8.I had to abruptly stop, as there was no cash to pay labourers and they werent ready to take the old notes lying with me. Nor are the new Rs 2,000 notes of any use, because people know you cant buy daily essentials and get proper change with these, observes Awati. He, like many other onion growers, was looking at a bumper crop on the back of good monsoon rains this time. Last two years, we suffered from drought. The year, we have enough water, but this cash crunch has upset all our calculations, he points out.Watch what else is making news:Onion cultivation is a highly cash- and labour-intensive affair. Transplanting of rabi season onion  which has to be done within a month of sowing  starts from October-end and continues for the next two months. In some pockets, transplantation extends to even mid-January, though anything beyond December tends to severely impact yields. Around 60 per cent of transplantation happens between November 15 and December 15, and this is when labour demand is really high. On an average, about 40 farm hands are required to undertake transplantation operations over an acre in a single day. It costs about Rs 7,000 per acre, and may go up to Rs 8,000 if the labourers are not locally sourced. Harvesting labour also costs the same amount. Out of our total cultivation cost of Rs 40,000 per acre, Rs 14,000-15,000 is for labour, with expenses on fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs making up the rest, informs Awati. According to Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takali Vinchur in Nashiks Niphad taluka, growing onions require twice as much labour as maize, moong (green gram) or wheat. Gorade managed to complete transplantation in two of his four acres land, when the sudden cash crunch forced him to suspend operations. The labourers in my field included 16 who were from various villages in Ratnagiri district. I had to tell all of them to leave, after they were half-way through their job. They were obviously not going to accept the withdrawn notes, he notes.Maharashtra produces roughly 30 per cent of Indias annual onion output of 185-195 lakh tonnes. Almost 60 per cent of it is from the rabi crop, which, depending upon the time of transplanting, gets harvested from end-February to mid-May. Rabi onions, especially from Maharashtra, are amenable to storage unlike the kharif (October-November harvesting) and late-kharif (December-January) crops. The stored rabi crop is what feeds the market during the April-September period, till the kharif onions are ready for harvesting.For farmers in Maharashtras onion belt  mainly Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune and Dhule districts  the acute shortage of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes to pay labour has affected transplanting operations. Data from the state agriculture department as on November 25 shows only 1.46 lakh hectares (lh) being planted to rabi onions. Last year, at this time, 2 lh had already been covered and overall acreage touched 2.5 lh, despite widespread drought conditions. The current years shortfall appears to be largely due to the inability to pay farm labour. Apart from local labour, the onion belt also engages farms hands from the Konkan region. They mostly comprise smallholder farmers, who, after harvesting paddy from their own fields in October, come to Nashik for transplanting of onion.Farmers like Awati and Gorade were keen to plant onions this rabi also because prices have recovered from their lows. The modal price of onion  the rate at which majority of trades happen  at Nashiks Lasalgaon wholesale market has risen from Rs 417 per quintal in September to Rs 587 in October and Rs 872 in November. Demonetisation has seemingly not just wrecked farmers plans, but also raised the possibility of prices climbing on account of lower rabi plantings. Deepak Chavan, director of Farm Features Private Limited, a Pune-based commodity research firm, believes that there will be significant price correction after March. Low mandi prices till a couple of months ago had already prompted farmers to switch to maize, wheat and chana (chickpea). The cash crunch post-demonetisation will only exacerbate the trend, he adds.While Chavan sees up to a quarter of the rabi onion area this time being diverted to less labour-intensive crops, Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, thinks otherwise. His take is that the onion belt farmers have no real competing alternative cash crop. Yes, absence of ready cash to pay labour is an issue, but farmers will find a way out of this, including by involving family members and neighbours in transplanting and harvesting operations, claims Patil. But he, too, admits that the total rabi onion area in Maharashtra will barely match the 2015 level  which itself was below the average of 3 lh  notwithstanding the abundant water availability.If Gorade and Awati are bemoaning the sudden stop to their rabi onion transplantation operations, the situation is worse for Rambhau Gangurde, a farmer from Dighwad village of Nashiks Chandwad taluka. He is stuck with five acres of his late-kharif onions still to be harvested. In the normal course, I would have harvested it from the coming week, allowing me to also grow rabi onions in three acres. But with the cash crunch, both harvesting of my existing crop and transplantation of rabi onions look a tall order, he complains.But the worst hit are farm labourers, who, without any forewarning, have seen all work opportunities drying up. Sharad Borade and his two brothers eke out a living working for daily wages at others fields. Residents of Takali Vinchur, the same village to which Gorade belongs, they have now decided to travel 63 km to Malegaon, a city in Nashik district. Farmers here have no cash to pay us. So, we have no option but to look for work away from home, says Borade, who isnt sure, though, whether things are any better in Malegaon. This withdrawal of notes, we are told, is good for us in the long run. I, too, hope the present hardships are temporary, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Earlier, we were getting hard cash. Now, the traders and commission agents pay us by cheque. The new system, were told, would ensure that buying will go on and our payments are on time. But effectively, it means standing for hours in front of banks, first to deposit these cheques and then withdraw whatever little we are allowed to, says this farmer from Sawargaon village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district.Soon after the Centres November 8 announcement, demonetising all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes, traders in all of Nashiks 17 wholesale produce mandis ceased operations, citing shortage of cash to pay farmers. On November 20, the district collector convened a meeting of stakeholders, wherein it was decided that farmers would henceforth be paid either by cheque or through electronic bank transfer. The markets have since opened  with most traders opting for payment through cheques.Watch What Else is Making NewsKusare, who had harvested around 100 quintals of late-kharif season onions from his 2.5 acres holding, isnt happy at all with the new arrangement. Only last week, he sold 25 quintals at the Pimpalgaon Baswant market, fetching him Rs 7,500 at Rs 300 per quintal. The trader wrote out a cheque for this amount drawn on ICICI Bank, which Kusare then took to deposit in his account at the Nashik District Central Cooperative Banks Sawargaon branch. Depositing the cheque took me four hours. The bank people told me it would be cleared only in 4-5 days. After five days, I stood in the queue again and, at the end of it, got just a Rs 2,000 note, complains Kusare.Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Pramod Kusare, a fellow-farmer from the same village, has a similar story to narrate. About eight days back, he took 50 crates of tomatoes (each of 20 kg) to Pimpalgaon Baswant and got a cheque of Rs 4,000 for it: I stood for three hours to deposit the cheque and queued up for another two hours after four days to collect a single Rs 2,000 note. I was informed that the banks cash position did not permit me to get more.For farmers like the Kusare, November-December happens to also be the peak planting time for rabi season crops  mainly onions, tomatoes, and wheat. For them, the move from instant cash to receiving cheque payments has translated into productive time in the fields getting diverted to standing for hours in serpentine bank queues.Just as Lasalgaon is for onions, Pimpalgaon Baswant  also in Nashik district  is known as the market that sets the price for tomatoes in the country. With an annual turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore, this APMC last year recorded total produce arrivals of over 76 lakh quintals, mostly tomatoes, onions and pomegranate. During the peak season, which is from November through the first week of December, daily tomato arrivals are in the range of 20,000-30,000 crates. Even now, 15,000-20,000 crates are arriving every day, with nearly 100 per cent payments to farmers being done though cheques issued by traders either on the same or following day.Somnath Nimse, one of the 557 traders/commission agents at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC, admits that clearing of cheques takes 5-6 days. We were willing to adopt electronic bank transfers, but the internet connectivity here isnt good to enable that, he notes. Tomato prices have crashed post-demonetisation; the average quoted rate, last Friday, at Nashiks primary produce markets was as low as Rs 20 per crate or Rs 1/kg. Its not just farmers. We ourselves are struggling to sell in other (terminal) markets, as the traders there are finding it difficult to arrange funds for making purchases, claims Nimse, who, in the past, has also exported tomatoes to Bangladesh. That trade has completely stopped after November 8. During the peak season, I myself make tomato purchases of Rs 25-30 lakh in cash per day. As against this, the government has specified a weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 for traders, which is a cruel joke, he adds.Traders at Lasalgaon, a market that is synonymous with onions and deals in some 40 lakh quintals of the bulb annually, have also moved almost entirely to cheque payments post-demonetisation. Right now, about 97 per cent of transactions are being done through cheques. We are quite happy having done away with cash payments. Our attempt would be next to go in for direct bank transfer, states Nitin Jain, a commission agent-cum-exporter based in this APMC that is 30 km from Pimpalgaon Baswant.Jagdish Apsunde, a trader and director at the APMC in Nashik  not far from the main city  has already taken the step of electronically transferring money into the accounts of farmers supplying to him. Ive got them to submit their bank account details along with a cancelled cheque to enable me to remit payments directly. This way, farmers are ensured of getting their money the very next day, saving them at least the trouble of having to deposit cheques, observes Apsunde, whose daily peak business in tomatoes and onions runs to over Rs 10 lakh.The Nashik APMC, which handles around 84 lakh quintals of produce annually, was closed for three working days after the demonetisation announcement. Since the meeting with the district collector, the bulk of the 1,300-odd traders here have adopted non-cash means to pay farmers. We are also in the process of getting a public sector bank to open a branch within our mandi premises, which should help farmers, informs KB Shevale, assistant secretary of the APMC.Arun Govindrao Wagh, chairman of the smaller APMC at Sinnar, isnt as enthusiastic about produce trading going cashless. Although we have moved to cheque payments, it doesnt help farmers, as they need cash for purchase of farm inputs and labour payments. How can one expect them to embrace debit or credit cards, leave alone internet banking? he points out.Farmers, on their part, seem resigned to accepting payments now largely through cheque. Pandit Gaikar recently sold 25 crates of cauliflower at the Nashik APMC, for which he received Rs 1,000. The nearest bank is 15 km away from my village. I couldnt possibly have gone all that distance to deposit a cheque for such a paltry amount, and further await payment. My trader was fortunately kind enough to agree and pay me Rs 1,000 in cash, remarks this farmer from Gangavhare near Nashik.Gaikar has harvested just a quarter of his cauliflower crop on one acre and has another two acres of brinjal almost ready to be picked and sold. I dont know what price I am going to get in todays cashless market. Even I get a price, will I be able to lay my hands on cash from the sale? Without cash, how am I going to fill diesel in my tractor and make labour payments for my next crop, within the little planting time available now? asks Gaikar. Thats a question bothering most farmers today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Narendra Vaskar Many wholesalers accepted Rs 500 denomination notes to avoid losses. Narendra VaskarTHE impact of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes on wholesale vegetable and fruit sellers at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Vashi was immediate. Generally conducting their daily transactions with buyers and sellers in cash, wholesalers faced losses Wednesday as business dipped sharply.Pradip Desai, a wholesale trader, said his loss for the day was nearly Rs 2,000. He, however, said he was willing to ignore the losses if there were long-term gains to be anticipated through a wipeout of black money. It is all for the good if it will help curb black money menace. I might have to bear some losses for three to four days but it is nothing when compared to the good it will do to the country, said Desai.WATCH VIDEO: Heres What The New Rs 2000 Note Looks LikeHe saw a 50 per cent reduction in his business Wednesday after not many retailers turned up at the market. Some who came had to be turned away as they had only the phased out currency notes to offer.Like Desai, many wholesalers had to buy the days produce from the sellers on credit, promising to return once the banks began to exchange the old notes for new currency.Ashok Gupta, another wholesaler, complained that he saw no business for over two hours in the morning as he refused to accept the big denomination notes. Fearing that his vegetables would perish, he began accepting the notes but saw a reduction in sales by 50 per cent.Despite buying smaller quantities of vegetables and drastically reducing the prices, he found it hard to clear his stock. While he usually clears it by noon every day, he had around 30 per cent vegetables left to sell even at 1 pm.WATCH: Serpentine Queues Outside Banks To Exchange Rs 500, Rs 1,000 NotesCarrots that usually sell at Rs 20 per kilo were eventually sold at Rs 12 and cluster beans (gavar) was brought down to half the price from Rs 24 to Rs 12 per kilo.The fruit sellers seemed to be in a better position.Anuj Harchandani, a fruit seller in the market, also saw a 50 per cent fall in demand but was still accepting notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. He said, I have no black money to hide. So, I am accepting all the money and will later exchange it in the banks.Another fruit seller Irshad Sheikh, however, didnt share the same thought. In the fear of standing in long queues at banks, he refused to accept the notes and hardly made any sales. Whatever little he did was through credit. He said he wont be majorly affected as whatever fruits did not get sold would be preserved in the cold storage to be sold later.Retailers across the city had different issues to face. While customers were unwilling to shell out their loose notes for vegetables, the retailers were hesitant to accept the big notes as many could not afford the time to stand in long queues in banks.Anticipating poor sales due to this, they bought smaller quantities of vegetables from the market.AUDIO: Worried About Replacing Rs 500 & Rs 1000 Notes? Dont Fall For This Fraud CallThe vegetable shops at Pali village were selling on credit. If people dont have small change to pay us, we are allowing them to pay us later. A physically challenged person needed 2 kg onions but did not have Rs 100. Though we didnt know him, we gave him the onions and asked him to pay later. We have to adjust in such circumstances, said Sanjay Kehurakte from Manohar Vegetables.However, not all were as accommodating. Humayun Seth, a retailer at Colaba market, said, Giving it on lesser price will lead to more losses. I am accepting Rs 500 if they buy for that money. Im not willing to give away the change that I have for nothing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A bumper vegetable crop and increased supply has triggered a slide in prices, which shows no signs of abating in the near future.Watch What Else is Making NewsOn Wednesday, the maximum price of tomatoes at the Pune marketyard was Rs 600 per quintal, a drop of 33 per cent from Rs 900 per quintal, the price it fetched on October 28.Similarly, prices of vegetables such as green peas, chillies, capsicum and cauliflower have dipped significantly as well. Only the price of onions has seen a slight correction, with the bulb trading at present at Rs 1,200 per quintal, as compared to Rs 800 per quintal on October 28.The supply of vegetables at the Pune market has been around 20 per cent higher than normal. The winter months usually witness increased supply of vegetables, as price corrections take place only in January.The cash-only vegetable market has also been hit by demonetisation, as both retail and wholesale buyers are at a loss while procuring cash from the market. Despite a sharp dip in prices, buyers dont have enough cash to spend in the market.There have been reports of farmers dumping their produce, such as tomatoes and methi, in the fields as the current prices do not even cover their transportation charges. Even the Pimpri wholesale market, which caters mostly to small retailers and traders, has come to a standstill over the last two days.Vishnu Salve, president of the traders association, said the three-day longweekend had left people with little or no money. On an average, traders used to conduct trade worth Rs 15,000 on a daily basis, but after demonetisation, it has come down to Rs 3,000. No one has money to spend these days, he said.Meanwhile, some traders in the Pimpri market have opted for alternate payment channels like online wallets or Point of Sales (PoS) machines, but Salve said such solutions are not viable. Other than operational hiccups, the vegetable trader is often short of time to even swipe cards or pay via an online wallet , he said. It was unlikely that the price situation would improve until the circulation of notes improves in the market, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He was 61.Sellers died Friday morning in Houston of pancreatic cancer, NASA said in a statement.Sellers shared his astronaut's perspective on climate change in Leonardo DiCaprio's documentary, ""Before the Flood,"" released this fall. He told DiCaprio that seeing the earth's atmosphere as a ""tiny little onion skin"" from space helped him gain a fuller understanding of the planet's delicacy.He also wrote a New York Times op-ed about grappling with the meaning of his life's work after learning he had terminal cancer. In both the film and the op-ed, he was optimistic, arguing that he expected human ingenuity to rescue the planet from a dire future of runaway global warming.""Piers devoted his life to saving the planet,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. ""His legacy will be one not only of urgency that the climate is warming but also of hope that we can yet improve humanity's stewardship of this planet.""In the op-ed, Sellers wrote that the best way he could imagine spending his final months was to continue working, despite knowing he would not live to see the worst of climate change or the harnessing of possible solutions.""New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate. There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks,"" Sellers wrote. ""History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots.""The British-born Sellers was deputy director for sciences and exploration at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He started working for NASA as a scientist in 1982 and joined its astronaut corps in 1996. He made three flights to the International Space Station, the last in 2010.""When I was a kid, I watched the Apollo launches from across the ocean, and I thought NASA was the holy mountain,"" Sellers said earlier this year when Bolden presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal, the agency's highest honour.""As soon as I could, I came over here to see if I could climb that mountain."""

Thousands of workers are being laid off as powerloom firms find it hard to function amid the cash crunch.WATCH VIDEO: Demonetisation: Relief For Common Man: Find Out MoreArvind Yadav (40), a powerloom machine operator, returned to Surat from his native place in Bihar on Thursday, only to hear from the powerloom factory owner that he should go back home and wait for a few more days as there is no demand of the grey cloth in the dyeing houses due to the present situation. The factory owner also told him that they had reduced the work force in the factory, located in Govindnagar area at Limbayat, Surat. Yadav, who has three minor children, was shocked to hear this, but he continued to stay on living on the savings in the hope that things would be fine in a few days.Yadav is not alone. Vishnu Tiwari (30), a native of Uttar Pradesh who works in a dyeing and printing factory at Pandesara GIDC, returned to Surat with his family recently, but had to go back to his hometown. The labour contractor who employed him told him that out of six printing machines in the factory, only four were running. The factory owners also told him that they faced problems in giving salaries as there was no demand from textile traders. The traders give the work of printing sarees and dress materials to dyeing and printing factories. It is estimated that the layoffs in textile units could be up to 40 percent.Powerloom worker Radheyshyam Prasad (35), who also belongs to UP and lives in Limbayat area of Surat, said, My monthly salary is Rs 16,000 and we take it in two instalments. My two children study in a municipal school and I have to pay a rent of Rs 1,000 to the landlord.The remaining amount is spent on food and other needs and whatever is left is saved. After Diwali vacations, we only brought Rs 2,000 cash from home. My meals have reduced to chapatis with green chilly and onions. We are living in the hope that some day things will get better.Watch what else is making news:Surat textile industry has at least 10 lakh people directly and indirectly associated with it. As perthe data from the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association, Federation of South Gujarat Textile Processing Association and Federation of Surat Weavers Association, there are over 4 lakh powerloom machines in Surat city, with 450 processing houses and over 65,000 textile trading shops in 165 textile markets.Besides, there are other labourers engaged in the transport and packaging sectors. The majority of workforce in the textile industry are migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, etc.Anil Patel, a powerloom factory owner in Govindnagar area, has 24 power loom machine setup. Earlier, there were 16 workers working in his firm, but now he has nine. The rest were asked to leave, given the liquidity crunch in the market.Patel told The Indian Express, Due to demonetisation, the condition of workers and factory owners are the same. At present, we are running only day shifts (7 am to 7 pm), while night shift is closed. I have only retained those workers whose service period is seven years or more. Those who worked for less than that have been asked to quit. We are facing cash crunch and there is no demand of grey cloth in the market. We have made two day shifts each of six hours and have adjusted all the nine workers in it. We also feel sorry for the laid-off workers, but what can be done? We are facing liquidity problem and cannot encash much from the banks.Kaisarali Peerzada, a powerloom owner, said, We have little cash in change with us which we got after standing in long queues. In the powerloom industry, salaries are paid twice  on the seventh and 25th of every month. The workers had taken salary till Diwali and gone to their native places and have now returned with little cash. We are also worried as the month draws to an end. We have assured workers that something would be done. The workers are taking Rs 100 -200 daily from us for their expenses.Federation of South Gujarat Textile Processing Association president Jitu Vakhariya said, We are somehow surviving. The textile processing units consist of dyeing, printing and parcel departments. We are controlling the production and the units are surviving with old job works. The unit remains open for four days in a week these days. The workers strength has been reduced as only few machines are operational. We dont get orders from the textile traders. He reiterates that the production has gone down by about 70 per cent in the wake of the cash crunch.There is no demand of cloth by textile traders. An average textile processing house employs a workforce of around 700 to 800 workers. The processing houses started after November 9, following DevDiwali, after the Diwali vacations, on October 30.Says Vakhariya, The owner keeps some cash on hand to overcome daily expenses, like machine repairs,and the purchase of raw materials. But now we are not getting enough money from the bank. The labour contractors are supporting us a lot and we have promised them that we will pay them when things get better. However, now workers wages have also gone down due to the shutdown.Baijnath Pandey, a textile processing (dyeing and printing) worker, works in the printing department in a processing unit. From UP, he shares a room in Surat with other migrant workers. He returned from his native place after the factory reopened on November 10, but was asked to go back. I and a few others have been refused work by the labour contractor. I have just returned from my native place and I dont have cash. I searched for the job, but nobody wants to hire at this point. I have my meals at a hotel where I have a credit account and I have told him that I will repay it as the money comes. I have decided to go back home and come back when things get better. There is no way out for survival in Surat, says Pandey.Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association President Sanjay Agrawal says, We were hoping to get good business in November and December, during Pongal and the marriage season. Due to cash crunch, people are not ready to spend money on clothes.The textile goods transporters in the city share the same fate. They carry hundreds and thousands of parcels in the trucks and deliver them to other states. The textile goods transport sector is also badly affected as majority of trucks are not plying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: File) Cash crunch has totally spoiled the business of fruit and vegetable vendors. (Source: File)A month after the withdrawal of high-denomination notes, agricultural remains one of the sectors hit hardest by demonetisation, as it grapples with major losses. While some farmers have incurred a loss as high as 60-70 per cent, rabi sowing has also taken a hit due to the cash crunch.The business of fruits and vegetables  from the farmers field to the consumers table  has always been cash-intensive, with barely any use of alternative modes of payment.As cash runs dry in rural areas, this business chain has all but collapsed, with little hope of a speedy revival. Shirram Gadve, president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India (VGAI), said the price of vegetables has dropped by almost 60 per cent across wholesale markets. Whatever sale is happening right now, it is distress sale, and thats causing major loss to the farmers, he said.Annually, the wholesale markets register trade of around Rs 1 lakh crore in the sale of fruits and vegetables. In fact, the months of November and December usually witness 10-12 per cent more consumption of vegetables than other months, due to easy availability and better prices.On an average, an acre worth of vegetables during this month fetches us Rs 1 lakh, but this year we have received only Rs 30,000 for that its such a loss, said Gadve. The onion trade also had seen losses, according to trade analysts, of around Rs 50 crore, as cash transactions have all but stopped. The poultry industry has also registered losses worth Rs 100 crore in Maharashtra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Gandhis twitter hack mostly consisted of offensive tweets but no information was leaked. Similarly for the INC, profane content was posted from their account as well.This was followed by the hacking of Vijay Mallyas account wherein information about the cars he owned, passwords for his online accounts, his emails were dumped on a particular website and the link put on his Twitter for everyone to access. The next victim was NDTV journalist Barkha Dutt, whose Twitter account also gave away personal IDs and passwords and email dumps. This was soon followed by another NDTV journalist Ravish Kumars Twitter being hacked.Screenshot of the tweets posted by the hackers on Rahul Gandhis twitter account.

While partial email dumps have been leaked, they have promised to leak more emails. They also claim that their next target would be Lalit K. Modi, businessman and IPL founder.The tweets by the group on these accounts have all been deleted and the accounts restored. However, this major security breach has threatened the lives of journalists and politicians online. The question remains  who are the Legion?In one of the tweets, the group asked for support at sigaint.org. Ironically, the website that the link leads to, claims to provide email protection to journalists and activists from dragnet surveillance that is prevalent online. Once you sign up with Sigaint, you will be given access to a Tor bundle through which you can access a website that has been hosted on the onion domain. The Tor and .onion combination exists to hide the online activities of a person.A tor web browser is used essentially to hide your identity and activities online and .onion is a domain suffix for private use. It designates an anonymous hidden service that can only be reached through the Tor network.Vijay Mallyas personal information was leaked out through the tweets. Vijay Mallyas personal information was leaked out through the tweets.Whether the Legion group is the same as the Sigaint network has not been established but for a tweet asking for support on the website. However, it does show that the group is well versed with the ways of hiding and revealing peoples identities.Legion group also leads to The Legion of Doom, a popular group of hackers that was active in the United States from 1980s to 1990s and then in 2000s. It now lies low. However, there doesnt seem to be an established or purported connection between the Legion of Doom and the Legion group that is hacking accounts in India.In response to the hacking of Twitter accounts of NDTV journalists, NDTV tweeted, Email, Twitter accounts of senior NDTV journalists have been hacked.

We are back. The tweets in the morning lacked wit, evidently.

Even the Food Ministry is also procuring pulses under Price Stabalisation Fund.""On onions and potatoes, he said that the centre will start MIS operation after the state governments send the proposal for the same. ""I have not received any proposal so far in case of onions and potatoes.""Asked for his views on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's demand to give bonus on rabi crops and farm loan waiver, the Minister took a dig at him saying that Gandhi is taking out his frustration for ""not being promoted as the party President"".He said farmers have faced some discomfort due to demonetisation but it has not impacted the ongoing sowing of rabi (winter) crops like wheat. ""In fact, rabi sown area till yesterday was higher than the year-ago period,"" he added.The Agriculture Ministry is aiming a record 270 million tonnes of foodgrains in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June), as against 252.22 million tonnes in the last year."

Farmers in Karnataka are realising this as they are unable to get reasonable prices for perishable commodities given the liquidity crunch.Trade in the farming sector happens mainly in cash. Given the cash shortage, farmers are forced to either accept the scrapped notes or sell the produce on credit without any documentation. This makes them vulnerable to cheating. The first few days after demonetisation were particularly bad. Vegetables were sold at throwaway prices as cash-strapped traders stayed away.Take onion, for instance, which can be stored for up to 60 days. There has been a bumper crop in Karnataka this year and APMC yards across the state have been flooded with the produce. The minimum support price (MSP) offered by the government for a quintal of onion is Rs 624, according to farmers.The APMC yard at Yeshwantpur was a picture of utter chaos from November 9 to 12. Onion was sold for as low as Rs 100 and Rs 200 per quintal. Krishnappa, who brought a truckload of onions from Bagalkot, said he saw the commodity being sold at Rs 200 per quintal at the Yeshwantpur yard. Kumar, a farmer from Chitradurga and district secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), said demonetisation badly affected the business in the first week.Things are now looking up, he said. Ironically, the BKS is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological parent.Bharat Shah, a wholesale merchant, said that at least Rs 1.5 crore worth of vegetables and fruits were destroyed in Bengaluru in the last one week because of the liquidity crunch.Both farmers and traders have incurred huge losses. We could not sell these commodities because people didnt have money to even buy them at the lowest possible prices. This is a rare phenomenon, Shah added.N Manjunath, a coconut wholesale dealer, said, Low-denomination notes are either unavailable or soiled. Farmers accept them unwillingly. The day they reject these notes, we will also discard them.Aware of the distress in the farming sector, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has directed all states to assess the impact of demonetisation on farmers. Karnatakas Department of Agricultural Marketing has started the work accordingly, a senior officer said."

In October this year, it was 3.39 per cent.Prices of pulses however continued to rule high in the wholesale market at 21.73 per cent last month, as per the Commerce Ministry data.Potatoes recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.Industry chamber Assocham said the fall in WPI is in tandem with the expectation which is reflective of the depressive state in the economy owing to the demonetisation.""Boost to industry is required from both monetary and fiscal policy, i.e. lowering of interest rates by RBI and reduction in tax rates by government in the coming budget to counter the effects of overall slowdown in economy,"" it said.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said however that rising global commodity prices and a waning of the base effect would push up WPI in December."

Be it buying groceries or objects of desire, there is a unique pleasure in visiting shops. For women, shopping gives them relief from the mental tension associated with daily chores. But I beg to differ.Though I often accompany my other half to the supermarket and jewellery shop, I feel out of place once I step in to the shops. At the supermarket, my job is to stand behind her and push the shopping cart while she leisurely picks up packets of foreign cheese and honey marketed by Patanjali.Though we returned from another country a few years ago after spending nearly quarter of a century there, the shopping pattern has not changed much. Extra virgin olive oil made in Spain, Anchor cheese and American apples! If my better half wants to spend more than five minutes in selecting an item, I happily tell her, Take your own time. Give me a missed call when you finish selecting your objects of desire.This is the time for me to roam around the supermarket. I go to the vegetable section and read the price of a kilogramme of potato and onion only to forget it within minutes. After that I go to the organic food section. Till date I have not found more than two customers buying from this counter. Then, I take a glass of payasam offered free of cost by the young girl who is there to promote the item.I say hello to the girl standing outside the perfume shop with a bottle of a new scent that she is desperately trying to sell. After spending more than 30 minutes at various sections in the supermarket without buying anything, I usually get the missed call from my wife. She would be near the cash counter with her shopping cart fully loaded. I once again check my wallet to confirm that there is enough cash.I pay the money to the cashier and push the cart all the way to the car. Accompanying my life partner to the jewellery shop is not pleasant either. When I enter the shop I feel trapped. When you go to a barber shop, there are magazines to read while you wait for your turn. If it is a dental clinic, there are old issues of popular magazines and other promotional materials from pharmaceutical companies.But in jewellery shops, I have never found any reading material for the customers. My problem: How to spend time while my partner shops for a gold chain? When I try to go for a coffee at a nearby shop, she tells: Wait, only ten minutes more. I still accompany my wife for shopping and pay all the bills as I have for many years. Life is like that."

He was 98 years old.Delligatti laid claim to one of the most indelible inventions in American cuisine since sliced bread -- a double hamburger with two beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions, which is covered in a special sauce.As owner of a McDonald's restaurant in western Pennsylvania nearly half a century ago, Delligatti convinced the company to venture away from its brief menu of simple burgers, fries and drinks, according to a 1993 profile of the Big Mac in the Los Angeles Times.He got permission to try his new burger in 1967 and sales jumped 12 percent, the Times said. Within a few years, McDonald's was advertising the Big Mac nationwide.""This wasn't like discovering the light bulb,"" he said. ""The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.""He said the idea came from rival burger restaurants in the mid-1960s.After the Big Mac's invention, the company expanded its menu further, creating an age of new menu items such as the Egg McMuffin and Filet-o-Fish.But, it was the Big Mac that became a cultural icon.In a statement, McDonald's said Delligatti was a ""legendary franchisee"" who made a ""lasting impression"" on the company.""We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman,"" the company said.McDonald's says it sells hundreds of millions of the oversized burgers globally, although sales have slowed in recent years as millennials reportedly show less interest in super-sized fast food.According to Delligatti's family he went on to own 48 McDonald's restaurants.He is survived by his wife Ellie, two children, and a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren."

Business at the market has seen a slump. (Express Photo: Amit Mehra) Hundreds of workers have been flocking to Azadpur mandi. Business at the market has seen a slump. (Express Photo: Amit Mehra)Post demonetisation, the slump in businesses across the capital has not just reduced the demand for workers but has also increased supply of cheap labour. This, in turn, has caused wages to plummet.Shabeer, a 57-year-old permanent worker in a steel untensil manufacturing unit in northwest Delhis Wazirpur, was told that November 10 would be his last working day. After paying their salaries in banned currency notes, the owner of the unit sacked 70 workers, including Shabeer, because orders for utensils had come to an absolute halt.Like Shabeer, thousands of workers have been fired or sent on forced leave in Wazirpur industrial area  which houses roughly 1,000 utensil and steel manufacturing units and employs roughly 70,000 workers. While most workers have been making their way back home to villages in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, many decided to stay back in the capital.Watch what else is making news:I decided to look for alternate work. Azadpur mandi usually has work for loaders and off-loaders. If I go back home, I would only burden my family so I decided to give it another shot in the city, he said.When Shabeer went to Azadpur mandi in mid-November looking for work, a few shopkeepers and contractors agreed to hire him. However, while the going rate for off-loading a 10 kg sack of onions was over Rs 20, Shabeer was being offered Rs 13 instead. I agreed because it was better than nothing. I would make Rs 200 a day, he said.Jitender Kumar, another worker at the mandi, said he made on Rs 100 on Sunday. He spend Rs 50 on lunch and saved the rest for dinner. Hundreds like Shabeer and Karan have been flocking to the mandi for work, but business at the market too has seen a slump.Rajender Sharma, president of the Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Traders Associations, said, Not only have prices of vegetables fallen, sales have fallen by 20-30 per cent, most customers are buying on credit. Around 80 per cent of my sales last month has been on credit.Sharma, who sells onions and potatoes at the mandi, said labourers are paid as per a fixed fare chart decided by the government. Other shopkeepers admitted that because business was down, ancillary work has been affected.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) Keaton, whos pursuing a Bcom in financial management, is not a complete stranger to India having come here along with the senior Jennings in 2010. (Source: Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)When I was nine or 10 we went to the nets. We were training. It was one of the days when I decided not to listen. He threw me the first ball, I got out. Second ball, I got out. He said you get out one more time were going home. He threw me another ball, I got out. He put his bag down and walked off. Then with a sheepish smile Keaton Jennings adds, From that day forward he was Coachy.The young Durham opener, on his first official day as a member of the England Test squad, isnt talking about some erstwhile coach. Hes talking about his father, Ray, who has always had a reputation of being a classical tough-as-nails man. And it somehow doesnt surprise you when he says, I cant remember the last time I called him dad.Theres a feel of the whatttt! about where Keatons cricket career stands at the moment when you look at his background. The senior Jennings represented his native South Africa in 14 unofficial Tests during the Apartheid era and his playing days were long behind him by the time they returned to international cricket. And Keaton, the 24-year-old born in Johannesburg, himself has played and captained the South Africa U-19 team. But here he is on the cusp of making his Test debut, for Englanda country he moved to only in 2011.He then recalls his surreal journey from being a future Protea batsman to suddenly shifting allegiances to the England jersey and attributes it to a train ride  something that most Mumbai cricketers can relate to  soon after the U-19 series five years ago.Yes I did, he says when asked about whether he had ambitions to play for South Africa post that series. But after working with John Windows up at Durham and the environment at Durham it started leaning that way (playing for England). Straight after that series I got on a train and rejoined the academy at Durham. I think it was out of Dover the train and it took me a couple of hours to get up north. But yes, I would say from that point I definitely pulled the pin and threw my lot in, he revealed.Keaton still sounds South African. Five years is not long enough for him to pick up the yakka accent, even if hes been based in the north eastern tip of the country. Even if he insists on saying, At the moment Im feeling very comfortable and very English, despite my accent. To his credit, he did seem rather comfortable answering the barrage of questions directed at him, and they covered every aspect of his life with the English media contingent pretty keen on subtly reminding of where he comes from.Growing up, I went to the same South African school as Graeme Smith, Neil McKenzie, the King Edward VII. I finished school and came over to England straightaway in April 2011, and then from there tried to part my way into English cricket. The following year through qualification reasons, and the guys up north made me feel really welcome, between Stokesy (Ben Stokes), Colly (Paul Collingwood), Woody (Mark Wood)  theyve been three of the main drivers  Mark Stoneman  in helping me settle down and pave the life in the UK, he says.At the time I sat down with my Dad and I felt it would be my best opportunity to live my dream in the UK and Im very glad as I sit here now to have made that hard decision, Keaton adds.Settling downAnd Keaton has settled down in the real sense of the word, having bought his own house  a nice little two-bed flat in Chester-le-Street as he puts it  and even has a local pub that he frequents.The more time you spend in a country, the more you feel welcome. Especially in the north-east, the people are very welcoming. And that made me feel part of the furniture essentially. Im blessed that theyve welcomed me and welcomed me with open arms, he explains.Keatons only still spent five seasons playing County cricket, having made his Durham debut in 2012 against Surrey in a match where he played alongside Stokes, Collingwood and Graham Onions. His first three seasons were rather unremarkable with his batting averages reading 21, 31.61, 24.75 and 32.50, scoring all of two centuries in that period. Then came the meteoric rise earlier this year when he topped the County run-scoring charts totalling 1602 runs at 64.08 with seven centuries to boot.And its not surprising that he hasnt quite caught the fancy, or even the eye, of the English media. It did come through when he got asked about the kind of batsman he was and his calibre against spin.Thankfully they didnt ask him whether he was right-handed or left, though you cannot be sure considering they never brought it up.Starting off at the Riverside, its quite a tough environment for a young opening batter, or for an opening batter in general. The wickets were quite spicy. Ive probably found a little bit of happiness outside cricket, and that made me a little bit more positive in trying to pick balls to try to score off, he says while refraining from calling himself an aggressive opener.Keaton is a South African about to play for England, but he reveals to have grown up being an Australian fan, waking up at stupido-clock in the wee hours of the morning to catch Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer open the batting and raves about meeting his idol Michael Hussey in 2009. He admits on being closer to his father than anyone else but believes its his mother whos been integral in maintaining a level of parity at home.Growing up in a cricketing family, you talk a lot of cricket and its very intense from a training and a professionalism point of view. But its a very loving environment. My mum softens my dad in some very nice ways and shes taken the edge off him at home. The outward persona of a very hard and concrete man  in the family house hes very loving and gentle, he says, the last line evoking many raised eyebrows in the media box.Keaton, whos pursuing a Bcom in financial management, is not a complete stranger to India having come here along with the senior Jennings in 2010, when he was the coach of the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. Drink lots of water and make sure its (from) closed bottles, is the major tip he claims to have received from his father about playing in India.And he doesnt seem too overawed by the dire backdrop that will frame his debut either. Hopefully we can land a few haymakers and throw some punches back.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

Their 15-year-old son, Balraj, dropped out of school in August to contribute to the family income by taking up petty electrical jobs. Before the introduction of the Aadhaar-based biometric authentication (ABBA) machine, they received their full grain entitlement of 18 kg.In March, they were informed that an Aadhaar card with the same unique number as Baburaos was in use in Mehoobnagar district. Consequently, both Baburao and Balraj were struck off the right-holders list. Despite various trips to the Circle Office and Mee Seva centres, their predicament has not been solved. To add to their woes, Jayammas fingerprint is not being recognised by the biometric machine since July.Jayammas household is among the 80 we surveyed in Hyderabad. We found that 38% of households reported fingerprint authentication issues, 31% made more than one trip to the shop and 27% reported machine connectivity issues resulting in either failed or delayed transactions. Certain households reported exclusion of members due to the absence of Aadhaar cards or Aadhaar seeding errors.Of the 50 that successfully transacted in October, we found that all households had received their full entitlement at the correct price. Strikingly, 71 of the 80 households reported receiving their full entitlements at the correct price prior to introduction of ABBA. Contrary to being a game changer for welfare delivery, persistent and pervasive issues have arisen with ABBA. It has imposed various challenges. Right-holders like Jayamma and Baburao who lack the resources to access the grievance redressal mechanism have resigned to their sour fate of denied entitlements.(Somanchi is a graduate student of Development Studies at TISS, Mumbai; Bej is a law student at NALSAR, Hyderabad)"

Banks rarely followed the Centres directive to make separate queues for women, senior citizens and the disabled. People having notes of lower denomination made a quick buck by swapping them for a commission. In North Karnataka, people in villages were not affected much when compared to their counterparts in urban areas. Their dependency on cash is less as this is neither harvesting nor sowing season. The only affected farmers were onion growers who faced difficulty in selling their produce. Some banks held note exchange melas in villages.

Reacting to inflation figures, apex industry body Assocham said the rise in WPI is in line with the industrys expectation as production denoted by index of industrial production (IIP) numbers released recently showed weak and unstable demand within the industry itself.This might have forced the industry to control and manage its over production and over capacity, which is already in existence, through restricting supply or put a cap on production that have resulted in an increase in WPI number.

The event was organised by Mobile10X Startup Hub, an IAMAI initiative to support app developers across the country in Bengaluru, in association with the Government of Karnataka.Interacting with Deccan Herald, Onionfans Chief Executive Officer Hutu said that the Chinese Unicorn company investors are here to understand the startup ecosystem. This is the first time that we are interfacing with Indian startups in Bengaluru to learn more about them. We are satisfied with the tech prowess of the city, and this year, Onionfans will allot a fund of $5 million as part of our seed investment, he said. Hutu said that Onionfans will help Chinese investors find companies for investment in the internet and technology space.There are lots of wealthy Chinese who are ready to invest their money. Since the market is volatile and theres no more investment opportunities in China, they are looking at opportunities abroad. We have an evolved startup ecosystem and Indians can learn from the mistakes committed by us, he said.Joe Wei, Founder of Grand Value Capital, said that Indians have creativity to come up with innovative solutions and the country has the advantage of having over one billion people. We are ready to invest in B2C companies, mobile internet companies, and other cutting-edge technology companies. Here, the bottlenecks of infrastructure and language barrier should be reduced, he said.Ku Kay Mok, Partner from Gobi Partners, said the Chinese Unicorns are ready to invest in Indian startups as it will give them better access to customers in North America and Europe. We are ready to invest in B2C companies in the software as a service (SaaS ) areas which will help the Chinese companies grow fast, he said.Mok said the Chinese investors are yet to explore companies here, compared with the startup ecosystem in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv. The Israeli companies are focusing on core technology. But the best Indian talent is heading tech companies in Silicon Valley. We should give opportunities in India and call them back. It will help India build global companies, he said.Eventhough China became Indias largest trading partner in 2008, investment flow from the country remained very limited.According to a Credit Suisse report, Indias internet and eCommerce business space bears close similarity with that of China, with a lag of 8-10 years.Besides investing heavily in Israel and Silicon Valley, Chinese internet companies and mobile ecosystem players are now influencing the valuation of Indian technology companies, especially eCommerce companies."

Darknet market sites such as Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Silk Road 3.0 and Silk Road Reloaded have been brought down or targeted by the law enforcement authorities. What is Darknet, why does it exist, and why are its sites often associated with the ancient Silk Road?The Internet might be compared to an iceberg, where the top one-third is out of water and clearly seen, while the remaining two-thirds are submerged. The top, visible portion of the Internet is known as the open web. Our search engines, such as Google and Firefox, have indexes to its sites and can lead us across the open network. For most of us, the open web is the Internet. However, the vast majority of Internet web pages are invisible to most Internet users.The remaining two thirds of the Internet sites are submerged, or concealed. These concealed segments are known as the Deep Web and the Dark Web, or the Darknet. They are accessible, but hidden from most users. These layers have been developed by technologies that allow Internet users to have anonymity on the web. They legitimately help individuals and companies to protect their security and privacy, and in many cases serve to protect users from censorship.The majority of pages residing in these layers are personal or corporate pages, administrative databases, or personal photo collections. Only a very small portion of the sites in Deep Web use sophisticated anony-mity systems, allowing operators to conceal identities and operate criminal activities.While there are many legitimate reasons an Internet user would wish to hide their identity, a majority of those who do so take simple measures such as using pseudo-nyms on social media sites, clearing the web browser history from their computer after use, or using unsophisticated encryption methods.Users who do not use some type of anonymity protecting measure should be aware of how easily online activities can be tracked and identities revealed. Websites and emails can be monitored and, unless encrypted, reveal vital information that violates user privacy.Anonymity on the open web: Before a device can use the Internet as a highway for information, it requires an Internet Protocol address, or IP address, which can be recorded and often linked to individual users. However, some routers use Network Address Translation protocol, or NAT to assign a single IP address to the router and mask the multiple, individual devices on a particular local area network (LAN). If you use a wireless router to connect your devices, you are probably using this technique.Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide anonymity and protection by tunnelling and encryption. Tunnelling establishes a covered communication network route which isolates the transmission.When penetrated, it redirects and re-establishes the tunnel along another line of communication. Should the message be intercepted, it is also encrypted so the interloper will be unable to read the contents of the transmission. The disadvantage of the VPN is that a single entity (the provider of the service) has access to the identity of all users and their communication partners.The other, more robust anonymity systems offer stronger protection. The most popular anonymity system is known as Tor. Originally developed as a research project in 1995, Tor became operational in 2003 and has been maintained and improved by Tor Project Inc. Tor conceals a users data within the Tor network, hiding the users IP address and other identifiers from the websites they visit, thereby disguising the users online activities.Internet communicationAnyone monitoring Internet communication will find it extremely difficult to trace these activities back to a specific user. Tors popularity stems from its ease of use, as one does not need a detailed knowledge of computers to use the system.Tors benefits enable anonymous use of the open web using the Tor browser, and anonymous publishing of web services as part of the Tor Hidden Services.Tor enables users to access the open web and circumvent censorship, anonymously participate in activism and journalism, provide undercover online surveillance of specific websites, protect personal security and privacy, and anonymously conduct peer-to-peer file sharing.Delving deeper on to the Darknet, users link to Tor/onion sites, which are part of the Tor Hidden Services (THS) network. Because THS addresses end with .onion rather than traditional co.in addresses, they are commonly referred to as onion addresses. The THS sites are not indexed by common search engines, such as Google and Bing, making them more difficult to locate. There is no central recording of existing THS sites and not all THS addresses are published.Where the Darknet really becomes black: While a large portion of Tor users are conducting legitimate business, anonymity on the dark side does lead to an increased potential for criminal activities. These activities include criminal marketplaces for drugs, child pornography, terrorism and other nefarious activities. The most prominent hidden marketplace on Tor was Silk Road.The site enabled users to buy and sell illegal drugs and commodities. Silk Road was active from February 2011 until July 2013, where the site processed over $1.2 billion worth of illegal sales between 4,000 vendors and over 1,50,000 customers. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation took down the site in October 2013, although several other illegal sites have since taken its place.Can we/should we block access to these sites? The long-standing public debate concerning online anonymity centres around the rights of individual citizens to be anonymous online, thereby protecting their freedom of speech and other individual freedoms or whether total anonymity leads to unethical and criminal behaviour.Most governments agree that banning online anonymity systems completely is not an acceptable solution. China attempted to do so, only to discover that dissidents were using secret entrance nodes to the Tor network called bridges to continue their acti-vities. Is the Internet our modern Silk Road?(Iyengar is a distinguished Ryder Professor and Director, School of Computing and Information Sciences, Miami; Miller has been with US Air Force for over two decades and is Coordinator, Discovery Lab, Florida International University)"

The distressed farmer said he incurred more than Rs 700 per acre for cultivating onions and paid Rs 780 towards transportation charges for bringing the produce to the APMC. File Photo/Agencies (representational).A farmer from Karanjgaon village in Nashik district has claimed to have got the rate of 5 paise per kg for onions, prompting him to dump his produce of 13 quintals in his field in protest, even as a trader blamed poor quality of bulb for the low price. Sudhakar Darade, who hails from Niphad taluka, said his onions got valued at Rs 5 per quintal (100 kg) at Saikheda sub-agriculture produce market committee (APMC) on Tuesday.He said his entire produce of 13 quintals was offered a rate of Rs 65 in total. The distressed farmer said he incurred more than Rs 700 per acre for cultivating onions and paid Rs 780 towards transportation charges for bringing the produce to the APMC. Upset over the valuation, Darade returned home and threw 13 quintal of onion in his field.Nashik district is known for production of red onions. The onion market in Lasalgaon in district is Asias largest wholesale APMC for onions. I had cultivated onions on my 10-acre land in November- December last year. I stored around 1,000 quintals of onions at home, hoping that I will get good price in April. However, auctioning of onions got severely affected due to the 35-day strike at APMCs in district during June-July, as a result of which onions perished, he said.However, sources at APMC said that condition of onions brought by Darade was bad and their size was small. Onions are currently auctioned at Rs 600-700 per quintal in APMCs, but farmers are bringing wet onion stock. On Tuesday, one farmer (Darade) brought onions for auction at Saikheda. However, most of his produce was wet and rotten. Still, some of his good quality onions were valued at Rs 25 per quintal, but wet and perished onions were valued at Rs 5 per quintal or 5 paise per kg, said Suresh Kamankar, an onion trader.Meanwhile, protesting against the low price of onions, Nashik unit of NCP yesterday dumped onions on the premises of all taluka offices in the district, demanding the Minimum Support Price (MSP) at Rs 2,000 per quintal. Onions are being sold at APMCs at Rs 600-700 per quintal. However, farmers are in distress as they could not recover even the production cost, said Nashik district NCP president Ravindra Pagar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The WPI was (-)1.99 per cent in November.Prices of pulses shot up 56 per cent in December and that of vegetables rose 20 per cent, while onion prices went up by 26 per cent, respectively. Wholesale inflation has been rising for the fourth month in a row mainly because of shooting food prices.The wholesale fuel prices, however, dropped 9.15 per cent year-on-year in December, while prices of manufactured goods declined 1.36 per cent, helping to keep the wholesale inflation in the negative territory. Disinflationary pressures in manufacturing products outlined weakness in the commodities sector. The industry warned that continuous decline in WPI numbers for manufactured products could adversely impact the pricing power of manufacturers.The continuation of the deflationary trend is an indication of weak demand in the economy, besides being the spillover effect of lower oil and commodity prices. The latest data on industrial production once again highlights the precarious nature of recovery in this sector. We hope that the central bank will respond to the situation appropriately and take steps that would aid the process of industrial recovery. At this juncture, propelling growth and creating jobs should be a priority and all policy levers should be geared towards that objective, industry body Ficci stated.Lack in overseas and domestic demand has contracted industrial production in November. The index of industrial production fell the most in over four years by 3.2 per cent on sharp fall in manufacturing output. According to official data, the consumer inflation too has edged up for the fifth straight month in December on rising food prices, signalling a return of price rise in the coming months."

According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."

The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

Now it is a case of excess production, said Deepak Chavan, a Pune-based agriculture commodity analyst, who belongs to a farming family.This has come as a matter of concern for the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED).As per the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF), last year ( June 2014 to May 15) the country saw a production of 189 lakh tonnes, which increased to 203 lakh tones this crop year.NHRDF reportAccording to data of NHRDF for Tuesday, 10,500 quintals arrived  and sold at minimum Rs 300 per quintal and maximum Rs 858 per quintal while the modal price was Rs 630 per quintal.However, Sanjay Pingle, a member of Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), begged to differ.If the quality of onions is good, you get good prices....good quality onions are being sold at good prices.....not at five paise per kg or five rupees a quintal, he said."

However, with onion prices touching new lows, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate,"" said Parbhane, the sole bread-earner for his family of five.Parbhane explains the math: he has two acres of farm land in which he grew onions by spending Rs 80,000.""On May 10, I sent 952 kg of onions in 18 gunny bags through a truck to the Pune-based Agriculture Produce Market Committee and received Rs 16 per 10 kg. So, per one kg, it works to one rupee and sixty paise,"" said Parbhane.""The total onion was sold for Rs 1,523.2. Out of the earnings, the middlemen took away Rs 91.35 as commission, labour charges were Rs 59 and Rs 18.55, and Rs 33.30 was paid against miscellaneous charges. Rs 1,320 was paid to the truck driver, who transported the produce to APMC.""He claimed that after all the deductions, he is taking home only Re 1. He was informed that the prices of onion had plunged drastically that particular day.""I was expecting at least Rs 3 per kg. However, I was disappointed after receiving such a deal,"" the farmer said. ""For four months, I took care of my produce and watered the onions at the time of load-shedding. Forget the profit, I am unable to recover even my expenditure on growing onions.""There were no comments on the farmer's claim from APMC. Local media reports quoted the trader who bought the onion as saying that produce was of smaller size and inferior quality.Meanwhile, a delegation of onion traders and APMC members from Lasalgaon in Nashik has met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking his intervention on the issue of plummeting prices of onions."

He has often spoken of how much he misses his mother, and that he thinks of her every day.Diana's solo visit to the 17th-century mausoleum - built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife - came to symbolise her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles.The couple separated months later.Three of the Taj Mahal's four minarets were swathed in scaffolding for repairs.

More than a dozen Congress MLAs and 25 former MLAs and Ministers took part in the march.Rohtak Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was also present.The BJP government in Haryana has been facing major opposition to its recently-launched crop insurance scheme from the Opposition, including the Indian National Lok Dal. The scheme purportedly aimed at protecting the interests of the farmers is, ironically, being opposed by farmers as well at some places.Saying that the march on Saturday was just a warning to the BJP government to mend its anti-farmer ways, Mr. Hooda said, adding that the scheme was being imposed on the farmers without their consent and premium was being directly deducted from their accounts. The terms and conditions of the scheme are all anti-farmers. It is a scheme to benefit the private insurance agencies and not the farmers. The BJP government in Haryana is acting on the behalf of these companies instead of protecting the interests of the farmers. They cannot do this, said Mr. Hooda.The scheme treats a village as a unit, which puts the farmer at a disadvantage while the premium is being collected from all the farmers. If the government claims to be pro-farmer, it must pay the entire premium and insure the farmers, demanded Mr. Hooda.He said that farmers in the State were in a bad shape and not getting adequate price for their produce. Blaming the BJP government for their plight, Mr. Hooda said that though the prices of agricultural produce such as tomatoes, paddy, cotton and onion had nose-dived, the end consumers were not getting it at any cheaper rates.He said that all sections of the society had become fed up with the government and had lost all hopes. The BJP government came to power both at Centre and in State making a host of promises, but they have failed to deliver on them. But now the masses had no hope from them. They have lost all hopes, said Mr. Hooda.The Congress leaders later submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Governor, to the Karnal Deputy Commissioner demanding that the scheme be immediately withdrawn."

The reason is that we do predictions based on satellite imaging and give production estimates to the government, said Misra while addressing an award ceremony of Gujarat Innovation Society (GIS) where Ela Bhatt, the founder of SEWA, Ahmedabad was awarded along with 14 other innovators.So if they know that the sugarcane production in UP and Maharashtra is going to be low, the government gets time to book sugar from Brazil. That is the reason why the prices of sugar have been between Rs 20-40 per kilogram during the last 10 years. The prices are lower than the inflation rates, he added.We (ISRO) has given the country so many communication satellites. Through the television programmes aired through these satellites we make the country laugh and also make them cry; fights in family happen and they stop as well. We do not give importance to this, but only when we do something like a Mars mission then ISROs contribution is acknowledged, Misra said while stressing on the innovations done by scientists at this institution.The senior ISRO scientist said that Indians do not respect the fact that a lot of innovations happen in the country with frugal finance. He narrated how SAC was planning to buy a special kind of CNC machine from Germany, but got the same made through a local company in Rajkot. If we had bought from Germany, it would have costed us Rs 12 crore, and we only paid Rs 1.5 crore to the local company. We ended up saving a lot of money, Misra said about a decision that was made a couple of months back.The chief guest of the event Dr C Muralikrishna Kumar from Niti Aayog said the NDA government under the Atal Innovation Mission will begin work on the establishing 500 tinkering labs in schools across the country in the next one month. We will set up a challenge where schools will compete to set up these laboratories that will boost the spirit of innovation among school children.Meanwhile, the GIS awards that were given out during the event included Ela Bhatt, founder of SEWA. She was given the Gujarat Ratna A life for innovation award. Diamond baron, Savji Dholakia, Managing Director of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd., and Mr. Jaysukh O. Patel received the Hercules Award for conducting the highest and biggest loyalty program ever for employees in Surat and for a LED Motion Sensor Light for prevention of electricity wastage in Ahmedabad, respectively.The Achievers Award were bestowed upon Dr. Harish R Gershom for inventing HARISOPHONE, a musical instrument for augmenting the cure of human ailments through sound therapy in Ahmedabad , and Mr. Vijay Kothari who received it for conceptualizing the Waste Out of Wealth (WoW) Program meant for shredding secret records of companies and waste management and pollution prevention in Ahmedabad.The trendsetter awards were given to Nikisha Bhadreshbhai Jariwalas innovation that deals with an exquisite way to transliterate Gujarati text into Braille, a crucial aid for the visually impaired in Surat. Ahmedabad-based Vinit Naranbhai Patel was recognized for developing a resource recovery process for preventing pollution and reducing carbon footprints, while Saumil Anilkumar Parikh fetched the Trend Setter Award for a process to differentiate genuine medicines through specially designed Aluminum foil, Ahmedabad.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5922dff97be9e01fd59ac29d,A tale of parched Maharashtra village: Each family in Shilatane village spends Rs 100 a day to buy water,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/waterless-maharashtra-pune-water-buy-expensive-parched-each-family-in-shilatane-village-spends-rs-100-a-day-to-buy-water-2814250/,2016-05-23,,Indian Express,"Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day. Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day.AS ONE enters the village Shilatane, around 50 kms from Pune, a prominent sight that meets ones eyes are large-size blue colour barrels placed outside each house. Since past three months, the dwellers of this village have been buying water, spending Rs 50 for each barrel that can store 200 litre of water. On an average, a family buys at least two barrels of water; the number varies if the members in the family are more.Ask Nanda Vilas Chavan, a housewife, whos busy pouring water into a small vessel from one of the barrels, about the water situation in her village, and she responds, Although we have been using water judiciously for last three months, we need at least two barrels of water every day, given that we have five members in the family. A barrel comes for Rs 50 and thus, we end up spending Rs 100 every day. The amount is not easy to shell out as our only source of income is agriculture, which is also badly affected by water shortage.Asha Vijay Bhanusghare, another woman says, Our entire monthly budget has got disturbed. We are spending Rs 3,000 to 4,000 every month only on water. Its a basic necessity for survival and one cannot cut costs here. And so even though we are reducing our expenses in other areas, we are keeping aside this amount every month.The village, which has a population of 2,500 people, is one of the 40 villages that are located around River Indrayani, which is currently completely dry. The river originates in Kurvande village, near Lonavala. The sarpanch of the village Shilatane, Hemant Shivaji Bhanusghare, informs that the rivers water dried in January itself and since then, the water condition has been bad.The villagers, he says, depend on Indrayani for water needed for agriculture and their cattle. It is not the first time that it has happened. This is a struggle we face every year. Hence, all the farmers have shifted to single crops, he says, adding, Theres nothing we can do after January. You can find barren farm lands across this area. The drinking water through water pipeline connected to Pavana Dam is supplied to all villages once in four days. Around 40,000 litre of water cannot last for four days in a village that has 2,500 people. The situation of houses that are situated on the higher side is worse because the water pressure is so low that it cannot reach them. People have no choice but to buy water from the tankers. The villagers are taking their cattle 2 km away from village for water. Even the milk production of cows and buffaloes has reduced due to shortage of fodder and water, he says.Chandrakant Andre, a farmer, shares that in comparison to previous years, when he grew potato, tomato, onion and sugarcane, now he grows just one crop in a year as there is no water for agriculture, which has reduced his annual income. Andre says he is waiting for rains, after which he will sow either jawar or chana.Prafull Kadam, a water activist who works in the area, cites that while Valvan Dam is just six kms from the village, the village gets water from Pavana Dam, which is 16-17 km away. Till 18-20 years ago, the Tata firm that owns the Valvan Dam would leave water in Indrayani river during summers. Later, they shifted focus to hydroelectricity and hence, stopped leaving water. And then began our sufferings. Its sad that people with limited income have to buy water especially when the state water policy GR states that drinking water should be given priority, says Kadam.Kadam says that though people suggest watershed as a possible solution, it doesnt have much scope at this time of the year for various reasons. Landholding capacity is less here; the area has hard rock; space for water structure treatment is not there; and instead of an even ground, the area has slopes. Thus, watershed wont yield any result here, he elaborates.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Esha Roy visits the border district of West Bengal and finds the fault lines run deep  through poppy fields, a fake currency network and an underground arms market that thrives in Maldas mango orchards.It took an entire month for Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwaris remarks against Islam to reach Bengals border district. It wasnt from the news channels or from Tiwaris arrest in Lucknow on December 2, 2015, that Muslim organisations that work in and around Malda town came to know of what happened. It was through the internet, says a member of a local youth club at Ghariyalichak, the Muslim colony that is now considered the epicentre of the January 3 violence that broke out in town.The Kaliachak police station after the mob attack. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) The Kaliachak police station after the mob attack. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)On January 2, on the eve of the protest rally, small tempos fitted with mikes inched through Muslim colonies in and around Kaliachak, about 23 km from Malda town, calling people to attend the rally. A week earlier, the Edara-e-Shariya, the main organising body, had distributed pamphlets on the proposed rally in nearby villages  Sultanganj, Churiwala, Dariyapur, Kasimnagar, Sujapur and countless others.So we knew we had to assemble at the taxi stand at Kaliachak, says the Ghariyalichak youth who participated in the rally. The state administration has said that there were at least 1.5 lakh protesters who had gathered that day.The taxi stand, located on National Highway 34 that connects the town with the rest of Malda, is now packed with Kaliachaks white Ambassador taxis. On the morning of January 3, a Sunday morning, the stand was cleared and empty. A stage was set up, a mike installed. From eight in the morning, hordes of protesters started streaming in to Kaliachak, some from far-flung villages, many carrying effigies and boards tied to rickety sticks, demanding Tiwari be hanged for his comments.I went around nine, a good hour after everything had started. People were still coming in. There were thousands and thousands of them. I was shocked. I dont think the organisers expected so many people to turn up. Thats why, in the middle of their speeches, they kept making announcements to keep calm, kept reminding people that this was meant to be a peaceful rally and that there should be no violence or untoward incident, says the youth.Within the next hour, chaos descended on Kaliachak. The mob quickly became agitated and violent. Despite warnings from the organisers that the rally would be called off, effigies began to be burned. Sensing that things were about to go awry, a group of local boys surrounded the three Hindu temples inside Gharialichak, encircling them so that they could be protected.Within an hour of the start of the rally, the protesters burnt effigies and set fire to vehicles. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Within an hour of the start of the rally, the protesters burnt effigies and set fire to vehicles. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)And then, a BSF vehicle, a Bolero, sped into the crowd from nowhere. The protesters got really angry then. People felt that the BSF had endangered their lives driving at such speed into the crowd. They surrounded the vehicle and started hitting it, breaking the windows, says an eyewitness. The BSF refused to comment on the matter.The vehicle moved forward and a BSF jawan fired into the air to disperse the crowd, he says. Hearing the firing, all hell broke lose. Thousands surrounded the car and forced the jawans off the vehicle, they were beaten up. It was only after they apologised that they were allowed to go, says the eyewitness.Seeing that matters had gone completely out of hand, the organisers announced that the rally had been called off. They asked people to disperse and head home. But tempers had been fanned to a pitch by then and the mob headed toward the Kaliachak police station, a stones throw away from the protest site.Kaliachak is notorious as the crimal den of the border district, Fake notes printed in Bangladesh cross the border to Kaliachak. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Kaliachak is notorious as the crimal den of the border district, Fake notes printed in Bangladesh cross the border to Kaliachak. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)The Kaliachak police station faces a row of shops that form the heart of the towns main bazaar. Being Sunday, the market was shut. The mob, armed with rods and guns and cans of kerosene and petrol, proceeded to burn down the police station compound. The police barracks were set on fire, as was the main building, the rooms for the Home Guards and most importantly, the maalkhana which housed records of the criminal activity and the criminals of the area. Many in Kaliachak and Malda say that it was these records that were the target of the mob. Subabrata Ghosh, the inspector in charge, was beaten up. Poppy seeds seized in various raids by the police and kept at the station were stolen, as were arms and ammunition.Im sorry but I cant talk about that incident, says Ghosh, turning his face away. Eleven constables from the thana have since been transferred and another seven sub-inspectors have been placed in the reserve force. The police station now stands freshly painted in white and blue to cover the scars of that Sunday.Work of repairing the station began the next day and was completed within 48 hours, say locals. Skeletons of burnt bikes have been hidden away in one corner of the compound, the bigger vehicles that had been burnt have been shifted to a border police station to keep them out of sight, tucking away memories of the humiliation of that day.But 78-year-old Chittaranjan Saha has not forgotten. The double-glazed black glass windows which he had installed in his four-floor building, which serves both as a commercial establishment as well as his residence, remain broken.The police station now stands freshly painted in white and blue, (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) The police station now stands freshly painted in white and blue, (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)He sold all his land to live in front of the Kaliachak police station, thinking the location would keep him safe. But it did not. The ground floor houses furniture shops run by two of his sons and clothing and utensil stores that he has rented out to others. He has rented out the first floor to a bank and other offices. He lives on the second with his family. The third he has rented out to three families, including a Muslim family.When the mob came, I pleaded with them with my hands folded to not damage my building. They kept asking if I was a Hindu. I told them yes, I am, but there are Muslims living and working here as well. But they did not listen. There were thousands of them. I was standing downstairs, watching people rush into the colony when this happened. Something like this has never happened in Kaliachak before. This has never been a communal town, he says.By 1 pm, it was all over. Residents had locked themselves inside their homes. From rooftops and windows, they say, spirals of thick black smoke rose to the sky. Near the Paanchtala masjid in Kaliachak, a three-storey building is home to the offices of the Edara-e-Shariyah, the organisation that held the rally. The office now has its shutters down. There is much speculation in Malda regarding the organisation and its members. We hadnt even heard of this organisation before this incident, said the member of a political party who didnt want his name or that of his party to be revealed.Some say that CPM leader and retired school teacher, Abdur Rauf, is one of its leaders and the main organiser of the rally. Raufs is the first name in an FIR registered by the Malda police. He is now on the run. His wife Shefali Khatoon, herself a CPM leader, flatly denies that Rauf had anything to do with the Edara-e-Shariyah. This is a conspiracy. He was not a member. He had gone to the rally out of curiosity, she told The Sunday Express.The townPosters in Malda against Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwari.

(Source: Express photo Partha Paul)The silt from the widening of NH-34 hangs in clouds, clinging onto buildings and cars in Kaliachak. Hills of large white sacks stand bound on either side of the national highway, filled with plastic and garbage waiting to be melted down and recycled in factories. Lines of trucks with West Bengal, UP, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand number-plates crawl past Kaliachak on their way to the Bangladesh border to deliver goods  onions, wood, chipped stones.Kaliachak is notorious as the criminal den of this border district. This is the centre of the Fake Indian Currency Network. Fake notes are printed in Bangladesh and then cross the border to Kaliachak from where it is distributed across Bengal and then across the country, says Ambar Mitra, secretary of the CPMs Malda district committee.On December 12, police arrested 25-year-old Salim Sheikh. Sheikh, who dropped out of school, works as a labourer in a nearby brick kiln. Sheikh had agreed to carry Rs 1 lakh in fake Indian currency notes to Kaliachak and then to Farakka station, a major transit point in West Bengal for such notes. He was given Rs 5,000 to do the job.A police officer in Malda who didnt want to be named says that in recent months, the BSF has been recovering fake notes worth Rs 3-4 crore a day. Around 30 km from Kaliachak lies Golapganj. Golapganj falls under the jurisdiction of the Kaliachak police station. Even by Kaliachaks abysmal standards, Golapganj has a notorious record. The road from Kaliachak to Golapganj is flanked by fields of sunshine-yellow mustard, gold-tipped corn and quiet villages. Today, 10 days after the January 3 attack, a cavalcade of officials  excise, police, BSF  accompanied by earth diggers, are on their way to raid poppy fields in Domaichak Mouja under the Shahbajpur gram panchayat.Last year, we destroyed 4,000 acres of poppy fields. We later came to know of another 8,000 acres but couldnt conduct the raids on time, says an inspector with the Malda police.BSF official on guard at the Mahadipur check-post. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) BSF official on guard at the Mahadipur check-post. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)Heroin, made from the resin of poppy plants, sells here for Rs 70 lakh a kg. Earlier, poppy cultivators would extract the resin and sell it to manufacturers or to middlemen. We have heard that the buyers are refusing to take the raw material now. They want the finished product. So heroin labs have started coming up  in Kaliachak, Malda, Nadia, Bahrampur. We have heard that the filters for making heroin are also being produced in Malda now, says the inspector.The villages here are abjectly poor. Poor farmers, who cant afford to grow cash crops, rent or sell their lands to bigger poppy cultivators. The poppy cultivators give the farmer anywhere between Rs 15,000 and 30,000. Sometimes the same farmers are employed to till the land. Most of the time, the land is not even properly demarcated and there are no records with the Bengal Land Revenue Office. Arrests then become extremely difficult, says the inspector.Officials both in the Malda administration and the police as well as the political parties, including even the BJP, point out that the January 3 incident was tied to Maldas dark record. It was an attempt to burn the records. Especially since the BSF had been coming down hard on smugglers over the past year and numerous arrests have been made. We know for a fact that there was nothing communal about Sundays rally. The violence was just a pretence to carry out their actual intention of destabilising efforts to clamp down on these illegal trades, says Mitra.Fear and angerSubodh Singh Rays paan shop at the entrance of Baliadanga colony was gutted in the mob violence. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Subodh Singh Rays paan shop at the entrance of Baliadanga colony was gutted in the mob violence. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)For the past ten days, the colony of Baliadanga has been cordoned off. Rusty tin sheets block two of the main entrances to the colony. According to the 2011 Census, Kaliachak Block I has 89.3 per cent Muslim population. In neighbouring Sujapur, the Muslims make up 98 per cent of the population. Baliadanga is one of its few Hindu-dominated colonies and was often used by many as a thoroughfare. It is located right behind the Kaliachak police station.Subodh Singh Ray, 75, owns a paan shop at the entrance of Baliadanga. At 11 am, he had gone home for lunch. Then I got a phone call from someone in the colony saying my shop had been burnt. I had goods worth over a lakh. I used to keep my bank books and other documents in the shop. Its all gone. My wife and I are old. I dont know why the Muslims did this. We never had any trouble before, says Ray, who has now set up a kiosk selling cigarettes and gutka right next to his old shop.A number of homes in Baliadanga have broken windows, shop entrances and boards have been broken and pulled down. They came armed. They had guns and lathis. When we saw them enter the colony, all of us locked our gates and hid inside and waited for them to pass. Have you seen what they have done to the police station? And the police didnt do a thing. This is because (Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee has been protecting the Muslims. I was myself a member of the CPI(M) before but I will vote for the BJP this time  as a matter of fact, I will campaign for them. The Muslims here identify us (Hindus) with Modi whether we support him or not. If that is the case, then we might as well vote for him, says a resident. He points out that a number of RSS supporters live in the colony  and the numbers are growing.The son of Ekhlasur Rahman, who was arrested after the rally. (Source: Express photo by Patha Paul) The son of Ekhlasur Rahman, who was arrested after the rally. (Source: Express photo by Patha Paul)The atmosphere of fear and suspicion does not belong to Baliadanga alone. In Asirhaji, the police broke into the home of 40-year-old Ekhlasur Rahman and took him away in the middle of the night. Like most Muslim villages in the area, this one too is poor. Most villagers work as labourers, carpenters or sell scraps of timber. Rahmans 60-year-old neighbour Rab Momin says the village now lives in constant fear. We heard about the rally only the evening before. They told us that someone had insulted Islam. But we have nothing to do with that. We just want to earn our living. None of us, including Rahman, attended the rally. He was our village chief. So if they can take him, who knows who the police will take next, says Momin. It wasnt us. It wasnt anyone from the Muslim villages around. We are peaceful, law-abiding citizens. We think people from outside came and did this,he says.The fight for MaldaMalda is Bengals mango country. Mango orchards cover large swathes of the land. But these groves harbour another of Maldas dark secrets  its illegal arms trade.In the past three years, the Kaliachak police station has raided six arms factories. These factories were hidden away in the mango groves. They were makeshift factories, shacks not larger than 1010 feet where men were making country-made pistols and bombs, says a police official.With such a reputation, it has been difficult for Maldas administration to attract investment. There were a number of small industrialists who had initially wanted to invest in Malda. But they withdrew because of the law and order situation. The administration had set up a food processing complex which is now lying empty because no one wants to start manufacturing here. So its a vicious cycle  till the time employment is generated, the poor will keep getting sucked into criminal activities, but as long as crime exists, investors would not want to come, says a government source.The office of Edara-e-Shariyah, the organisation that held the rally, is now shut and its members are on the run. (Source: Partha Paul) The office of Edara-e-Shariyah, the organisation that held the rally, is now shut and its members are on the run. (Source: Partha Paul)The owner of Maldas biggest hotel, Golden Park, has bought land to build the towns first mall, but is hesitant to start, he says. But there has been a few positives. The West Bengal government has pumped money for the development of infrastructure in the district. Twenty nine new nursing homes have opened over the past few years. The Malda medical college was established in 2012 and its first batch of resident doctors are to graduate next year.We are trying to expand health facilities even more. We have a huge footfall at the medical college, which caters to patients and students not just from Bengal but also from Bihar and Jharkhand, says Additional District Magistrate Malda Debatosh Mandal.The Gour Banga post-graduate university was also set up in 2012, besides three new government colleges in south Malda, Manekchand and Gajour. A hundred new madrasas have been set up since 2012. The number of teachers and para-teachers in schools across the district have gone up. Besides, Mamatas cycle scheme for girl students holds promise. With barely months to go before the elections, trucks full of cycles with the Trinamool symbol are being driven in.Political insiders say the fight for Malda will be Mamatas toughest. With the legacy of Congress leader and former Malda MP AB Ghani Khan Choudhry still running strong, the district remains a Congress stronghold. Choudhry, popularly known as Barkatda, was Malda MP for 26 years before he died in 2006. There has been a number of defections to the Trinamool, including of Congress MLAs A N Khan Choudhry (Ghani Khan Choudhrys younger brother) from Sujapur and Sushil Ray from Gajal and Forward Block MLA from Harishchandrapur Tajamul Hussain, says Malda Trinamool Congress (TMC) president Moazzam Hossain.Last year, the Malda police destroyed 4,000 acres of illegal poppy fields. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Last year, the Malda police destroyed 4,000 acres of illegal poppy fields. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)But things dont look good for the TMC just yet. While political analysts admit that the party has been gaining ground, a Congress-CPI(M) tie up, which is likely in Malda, may spoil the TMCs plans. The factional disputes within the TMC dont help the party either. TMC leader Bakul Sheikh was expelled from the party two months ago and another TMC leader, Surjan Sheikh, was taken into police custody after a police raid at his home recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition.While the BJP had gained ground in the last election, cornering a little over 19 per cent of the vote share, they havesince lost steam. This is why they are raising the Kaliachak incident. They are desperate to regain some ground, says a TMC worker.BJP Malda district general secretary Ajoy Ganguly admits that the Kaliachak incident is important for the party.This is an important issue for us and will be our main platform for the elections. Of course, it was not a communal incident, everyone knows that. It was a criminal activity. But what on earth was Mamata Banerjees police doing? Why are their hands tied, he asks."

Fall in onion prices is taking a toll on farmers, despite a bumper crop this season.In a bizarre claim, a farmer has said he could earn only Re 1 from sale of nearly a tonne of onions at the district Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).According to Devidas Parbhane, 48, the fall in onion prices is already taking a toll and like him, several others have got a raw deal despite a bumper crop this season.Every day, we are hearing news about farmer suicides from drought-hit regions. However, with onion prices touching new lows, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate, said Parbhane, the sole bread-earner for his family of five.Parbhane explains the math: he has two acres of farm land in which he grew onions by spending Rs 80,000.On May 10, I sent 952 kg of onions in 18 gunny bags through a truck to the Pune-based Agriculture Produce Market Committee and received Rs 16 per 10 kg. So, per one kg, it works to one rupee and sixty paise, said Parbhane.The total onion was sold for Rs 1,523.2. Out of the earnings, the middlemen took away Rs 91.35 as commission, labour charges were Rs 59 and Rs 18.55, and Rs 33.30 was paid against miscellaneous charges. Rs 1,320 was paid to the truck driver, who transported the produce to APMC.He claimed that after all the deductions, he is taking home only Re 1. He was informed that the prices of onion had plunged drastically that particular day.I was expecting at least Rs 3 per kg. However, I was disappointed after receiving such a deal, the farmer said.For four months, I took care of my produce and watered the onions at the time of load-shedding. Forget the profit, I am unable to recover even my expenditure on growing onions.There were no comments on the farmers claim from APMC.Local media reports quoted the trader who bought the onion as saying that produce was of smaller size and inferior quality.Meanwhile, a delegation of onion traders and APMC members from Lasalgaon in Nashik has met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking his intervention on the issue of plummeting prices of onions.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,,Indian Express,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express Avtar Singh with his cotton and cucumber crop. ExpressEven as concern over declining water table and over exploitation of water in Punjab for paddy continues to grow, some farmers in the state are adopting innovative techniques to save water.Avtar Singh, a farmer based in Pandwa village in Phagwara has inter-cropped cotton crop with cucumbers and is practicing capillary action irrigation which also helps in conserving water. Last year, he had inter cropped cotton with maize which, he claims, doubled the yield.He irrigates his fields after every two weeks, helping him save a lot of water which would otherwise have been used to flood the land.Cotton is deep rooted and a long duration crop. It does not need much water but Punjab farmers are in habit of flooding fields, he said. Judicious use of water never came to them naturally. We have inter cropped cotton with cucumber. We are not directly irrigating cotton but instead, focussing on cucumber. The water that seeps into the soil also reaches the cotton crop. Also, through bed plantation, more water is saved.Last year, he harvested 15quintal per acre of cotton compared to the 8 quintal per acre that most other farmers, who used conventional methods, got.This year picking would be even better. I have adopted concept of bio-diversity in agriculture. Farmers need to go the way nature wants and monoculture (growing single crop) is nowhere in nature. I have noticed that cotton balls are thicker if grown like this. Growing cucumber has also controlled pests and no whitefly or bollworms have infected my crop, he added.Paramjit Singh Gill from village Chungawan of Moga cultivated red garlic, a crop that is not familiar to Punjab, and has reaped profit of Rs 1 lakh per acre. Gill said, I got this variety from Jammu and Kashmir and is grown mostly in hilly areas. Punjab farmers are unaware of any garlic except white ones. This variety gives dark pinkish fruit commonly known as red garlic in J&K. Compared to Rs 25,000 per acre saved in paddy/wheat cultivation, I am saving Rs 1 lakh/acre.Another farmer, Sukhvir Singh from village Sampla in Fatehgarh Sahib has grown onions on seven acres, muskmelon on five acres, tomatoes on two acres, chillies on two acres and pumpkin (used for sweets) on one acre. It was always a risky decision to give up paddy farming but now my farm is giving me Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakh profit.Swaran Singh Mann, assistant director horticulture said, It is always advisable to grow two or more crops together. Farmers are now opting for strawberries, papaya, guavas, peaches etc which consume less water than paddy.Dr SS Kukal, additional director research (natural resources and plant health management), Punjab Agricultural University, said, It is absolutely right that inter-cropping cotton with vegetables is best way for natural farming and saving water. With capillary action, water that seeps inside soil will come up and replenish soil. Cotton will not need separate irrigation. It saves almost 90% water and higher yield.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The KR Market, Nayandahalli, Deepanjalinagar, Vijayanagar and Magadi Main Road wore a deserted look, with just police personnel patrolling the area. People remained indoors due to the curfew and prohibitory orders.There was an uneasy calm in New Timber Yard Layout, off Mysuru Road. There were more police personnel and patrolling vehicles than commuters. Gutted vehicles were left uncleared.Just a km away, there were remains of about 20 lorries, four-wheelers and buses, which were partially or completely gutted .

With large police presence here, we hope there are no untoward incidents, Krishnamurthy of Bapujinagar said.Fruit and vegetable vendors were seen clearing their stocks by selling them cheap. Tomatoes, potatoes and onions were sold at less than Rs 5 a kg. Getting stocks for the next day was a worry as the Yeshwantpur APMC yard and other wholesale markets remained closed.With hotels shut, Good samaritans like Subhash and his friend Suresh from Sanjaynagar were seen distributing packaged water bottles and biscuits to policemen and people. Fuel stations remained closed in areas where curfew was in force, while a few of them remained open in other areas.Commercial establishments remained shut and paramilitary forces stood guard all along Magadi Road.

While, prices of beans and carrots have come down in the last two weeks, cost of tomatoes and cabbage has increased considerably.Tomatoes, that used to cost Rs 55 per kg at Hopcoms and Rs 20 per kg at wholesale markets, are now available at Rs 72 per kg and at Rs 50, respectively. Similarly, cabbage, which was earlier available at Rs 28-30 per kg, is now priced at Rs 40.

Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."

Bigger the challenge, sharper his instincts to take it head on.It is a glowing testimony to the Delhi batsmans growing maturity and self-belief. Importantly, his aggression has not been limited only to the folds of his persona. It has been constructively used by him as a weapon to tame the adverse situations.While India seems to be peaking at the right time for World T20, it is Kohli's stunning form that holds promise for the team ahead of the mega event.That the 27-year-old thrives under pressure isnt new. Majority of his 50-over centuries have come while chasing. He has now also imposed himself in Twenty20 format, where he is ranked No.2. The faith he has in his abilities has stood out in the last couple of months the way he has guided India's batting in the format.Against Pakistan, India were in middle of a tense chase and the left-arm tearaway Mohammad Aamir was on fire. Kohli, too, was beaten by him but had the nerve to congratulate him in the middle of the match.Unlike others, he was relishing the challenge. He took his time before unleashing back-to-back boundaries off Aamir, who in his first three overs was sensational, even unplayable at times. But Kohli loves to challenge his own limits.His counterattacking skills surfaced again in Tuesdays contest against Sri Lanka. Indian openers were dismissed cheaply but Kohli dug in. He saw Yuvraj Singh going for the big hits and wisely allowed him take centrestage.With the cricketing acumen he has, Kohli can pick the bowlers he wants to go after and pace the innings beautifully. Even defending a ball for him has to have the aggression. Captaincy in Tests has only added to his game.Dhoni admitted that Kohli has grown into a mature cricketer. Over the years, he has turned into somebody who reads the game very well. Overall he's looking a much more matured cricketer. But at the same time he's backing that with the skill he has. He's someone who puts in a lot of effort in training. Overall, he's been just fantastic for the side.Stats prove claimStatistics further attest the this view. Kohli has a batting average of 93.16 in successful chases in T20Is, his aggregate being 559 in 12 innings, including six fifties.In T20Is this year, Kohli is averaging 103.66  his aggregate being 311 in six innings, including four fifties (the scores being 90 not out followed by 59 not out & 50 vs Australia, 7 vs Bangladesh, 49 vs Pakistan and 56 not out vs Sri Lanka).Yet Kohli is not the man who would muscle the ball out of the stadium.He has hit 139 boundaries against his 27 sixes in 34 T20 international innings. His consistency, however, has been achieved with his pragmatic approach about his skill set.I have come to terms with the fact that I cant hit too many sixes so I would focus on boundaries. I have moulded my games towards that and try to hit the ball in the gaps and get boundaries rather than hit sixes which is a higher risk shot,"" he recently said. There is no doubt Kohli remains an important cog in Indias wheel of fortune."
