Modi listed the Mudra scheme, increased LPG coverage and rural electrification as big achievements at a closed-door parliamentary party meeting in the morning. During the Lok Sabha sitting soon after, at least two BJP members voiced discontent on specific issues and got support from other party MPs. ""You have given a very elaborate reply but the problem remains as it is. The price of pulses is not coming down and that of onions is not going up,"" BJP MP Hukum Singh said during Question Hour. Hukum appeared unhappy that agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh had washed his hands of the problems of onion farmers, raised by another BJP MP. Replying to Sumedhanand Saraswati's plea to save onion farmers, the minister had said: ""A price stabilisation fund has been set up for potato, onion and pulses. Earlier it was with the agriculture ministry but now it has gone to the food and civil supplies ministry."" After the minister spoke about e-trading being introduced by the government, Hukum said: ""Of what use is e-trading, when farmers are being compelled to sell their onion at Rs 2/kg and even Rs 1/kg? The government should provide a solution...."" The caustic remark led to mild flutter in the treasury benches and many MPs were seen expressing their support. On another issue, another MP, R.K. Singh, embarrassed home minister Rajnath Singh. After Rajnath had firmly denied there was ever a provision for housing in the Centre's police modernisation scheme, R.K. Singh spoke up. ""I just want to clarify one fact. There was a provision for housing in the police modernisation scheme... it has been stopped since the Centre has increased the share of taxes to the states,"" the BJP MP said. Many party members were seen suppressing giggles. ""He should be made the minister,"" an Opposition MP quipped, prompting Rajnath's junior, Kiren Rijiju, to step in. ""What is this?"" he protested. The intervention seen as ""undesirable"" by many party leaders came after Rajnath had rejected Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge's claim that earlier there was a provision for housing. ""Police modernisation fund is never allocated for housing,"" the minister had said. Congress members loudly contested the denial. Rajnath remained firm till his own party MP overruled him. The minister did not contest the MP, who had retired as home secretary before joining the BJP and intermittently speaks out against the government and the party. Yesterday, another BJP MP from Bihar, Bhola Singh, had said: ""With regard to Reliance, the policy of the previous government and in some instances the present government remains the same. I want to know what is the compulsion of the government in resolving the dispute clearly and firmly with the company."" Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said with Modi as Prime Minister, there was no question of compromise, but many BJP MPs were seen congratulating Bhola."
58ff0ab57be9e0420db2bc11,"Minister absent, govt 'sorry'",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160505/jsp/nation/story_83929.jsp,2016-05-05,"New Delhi, May 4: The scheme has smart written into it with a capital ""S"" but the government was left smarting. Not often does the Speaker haul up the ruling dispensation. And if that wasn't enough, a minister had to say ""sorry"" too. The moment of embarrassment came after neither railway minister Suresh Prabhu nor his junior, Manoj Sinha, was found to be not present in the Lok Sabha today when the House took up a question relating to a smart card scheme for train tickets during Question Hour, the 11am-to-12-noon daily slot when Parliament is in session. Under the railway ministry's ""Go-India Smart Card"" initiative, the smart cards can be used at designated counters for getting tickets. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan voiced her displeasure after the Opposition accused the government of not following rules. ""The concerned minister should be present till the Question Hour is over.... This is not fair. It should not happen again,"" she said. Parliamentary affairs minister M. Venkaiah Naidu then apologised on behalf of the government. ""The government feels sorry for this. On behalf of the government I am feeling sorry.... It will not be repeated,"" Naidu told the House. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seen in the House in the morning, was not present when his government was left red-faced. According to rules, the cabinet minister concerned is required to be present in the House to answer questions from MPs related to their ministry. If the minister cannot attend the proceedings, he or she can inform the Speaker and seek permission to depute the junior minister. Prabhu was unavailable today, so Sinha was deputed for the Question Hour session as queries related to the ministry had been listed for the day. Sinha was present in the House in the morning and had even answered questions from MPs relating to passenger amenities at stations. But he left after some time, apparently assuming that the next listed question on railways would not be taken up because of time constraints. It wasn't the smartest thing to do, although the House usually manages to take up a maximum of five questions in the hour-long slot. Unfortunately for Sinha, eight questions were taken up today, partly because one was skipped as the two MPs who -OVERMATTER- had posed the query were absent. The first and the seventh questions related to railways. ""He was very much here. He might have thought that we may not reach up to that question. But it is incorrect,"" Naidu said. Yesterday, too, the government had been left discomfited when two BJP MPs criticised their own government. One MP criticised the government for failing to control rising prices of pulses and help distressed onion farmers. The other embarrassed home minister Rajnath Singh by pointing out that he was not well informed on police modernisation. Today, Opposition Congress members were on their feet demanding that the Speaker pass a stricture against the government. ""They (the government) are not following rules. The other day, no cabinet minister was present during a discussion in the House. We remained silent. You (the Speaker) tell us to follow the rules but they (the government) don't follow rules,"" Congress leader in the House Mallikarjun Kharge said. But Mahajan refused to entertain the demand, saying she had warned the government."

When he was appearing for class X examination, a division of property in his undivided family left him with merely Rs 7. Faced with acute poverty and eking out a living from a nominal Rs 7, the 1966-born Ratneshwar is today an author writing best sellers like Jeet ka jadu, a script-writer for TV serials, and president of Centre for Readership Development (CRD), all rolled into one. Magic in you, the English version of one of the best-sellers of 2015 Jeet ka Jadu, saw pre-booking orders for 20,000 copies.Besides, an international movie is likely to be made on his forthcoming book Rekhna Meri Jaan, which is not only based on global warming but also depicts an unusual love story with Bangladesh in the backdrop.However for Ratneshwar, who turns 50 this year, the road to success has not been a smooth one. Born in Bihars Warsaliganj, Ratneshwar childhood was spent mostly at Barahiya in Lakhisarai district in the company of his three step-brothers. The property dispute and division of assets later rendered Ratneshwar poorer.At a tender age, he was also slapped with a notice of loan worth Rs 10,000, which was taken during the wedding of his elder brothers daughter. Ratneshwar sold his mothers ornaments to repay the loan and took to farming to eke out a living.I would walk 8 km every day to reach my farm where maize and wheat were cultivated. My mother would give me sattu, salt and onion as lunch. In the absence of father, I faced acute penury in the early childhood days, he told Deccan Herald.But despite hardships, the son of the soil from Lakhisarai never gave up. His family sent him to Pataliputra school in Patna for further studies. When he was in Class V, he used to tell stories to his classmates. Soon he was nicknamed story master. He would be invited to other classes as well to narrate stories, where he would speak extempore.I was not very good at studies but when it came to telling/narrating stories, I would do so impromptu, said Ratneshwar, who later, with the help of one of his relatives, left Bihar and shifted to Nagpur for higher studies.There I completed my Class XII from St Francis College and then graduated from Nagpur University, he said. In 1988, when he was barely 22 years of age, he wrote a story Main Jaichand Nahin which was published by an Hindi publication. This story received wide acclaim.The features editor of the newspaper invited him over for a cup of tea where Ratneshwar expressed his eagerness to work for the Hindi daily. He was told to meet the editor next day at 10 am sharp. That day, it was raining heavily. I did not have an umbrella. But still I rushed to the editors office where I reached 15 minutes before the scheduled time.When the editor saw me completely drenched and enquired about it, I said: I had to reach your office on time, although I did not have money to purchase an umbrella. Deeply impressed with my honest answer, the editor called in the features editor and asked him to show me the desk where I would work, averred Ratneshwar, dwelling on his beginning as a trainee journalist. He did not continue with the newspaper for too long. But writing continued to be his passion. So he authored one book after another, all in Hindi, which sold like hot cakes. In between, Ratneshwar shifted to teaching where he taught Mass Communication at Dr Zakir Hussain Institute. This was followed by becoming a guest lecturer at Patna University, Ranchi University, IIMC, Delhi University and Benaras Hindu University (BHU).In 2006, Ratneshwar shifted to Mumbai. Struck by the glitz and glamour of the tinsel town, the author made his debut as a script writer for the TV serial Mano Ya Na Mano, for Star One. Later, noted film-maker Prakash Jha, amazed at his multi-tasking ability, assigned him the job to launch a news channel Maurya TV. In the meantime, Ratneshwar continued writing. In 2011, Lt Hudson followed by Jeet ka jadu became one of the best sellers and won him plaudits.In December 2015, the English version of Jeet Ka jadu, worked wonders for me. There were pre-booking orders for 20,000 copies of Magic in you, something unusual for a book being translated from Hindi, averred Ratneshwar.At present, the author is giving final shape to his latest book Rekhna Meri Jaan, based on global warming. Its not only based on global warming in Antarctica but its a love story in the backdrop of Bangladesh, he says, refusing to share more details as a Hollywood movie is slated to be made based on his book. Talks are in the preliminary stage. But since its an off-shore movie, it wont be prudent to share more details right now, he signs off."

Telegraph picture Have puja at home but feel like snacking? Breaking a fast but don't feel like cooking? Want to carry some food for your conservative mother-in-law who doesn't take onion and garlic? If you've faced these situations and wracked your brains for a solution without finding any, here's Iskcon (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) to your rescue with its satvik food. Iskcon has launched its Govinda's eatery in Jamshedpur, its first foray in Jharkhand, on September 9 to mark Radha Ashtami. A mobile unit for now for lack of space, the van is parked in Bistupur at Inner Circle Road behind Gopal Maidan. The timings are between 5.30pm and 10pm. Govinda serves about 25 dishes, including dosa, vegetable cutlet, aloo paratha, chilli paneer and gobi manchurian, all free of onion and garlic. In fact, the food is prasad. Just like bhog in temples, food first served to lord Krishna is then mixed with what is prepared for mass-scale consumption. Govinda's restaurants are famous across the world for satvik food. They have a presence in 1,000-plus venues across the world, including New York City, Los Angeles, Hawaii and Tuscon to name a few. In the New York restaurant, apart from samosas, tofu and quinoa salad are their pop picks. In fact, there's a Govinda's eatery wherever there is an Iskcon temple. ""In India, there are about 130 temples with its headquarters at Mayapur in Bengal. But, in Jamshedpur, there is no temple as yet,"" said P. Jagannath Das, a preacher of Iskcon. ""Still, we wanted to offer satvik food to people and they are liking it,"" he said. According to Das, a majority of the menu changes everyday. ""Quantity is less, there is no wastage and no stale food. Ask anyone who's tried our food anywhere in the world. We are known for our fresh, homemade offerings without preservatives, which are as healthy as possible. The cooks are Iskcon members who maintain utmost cleanliness and hygiene while preparing food,"" Das said. Since its launch, business has been brisk. ""Who normally finds satvik food in the city? It's great for some communities who avoid going to restaurants because they don't want garlic or onions. Food here is also very hygienic and tasty,"" said Suresh Sonthalia, Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry president, who went to the outlet on Day One. Govinda's is a good way to have satvik food and generate revenue for the organisation that undertakes social projects. Iskcon runs the Akshaya Patra project that prepares midday meals to around 63 government schools in East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan daily."

Picture by Faryal Rumi Indias famed culture of unity in diversity reflects in Chhath, Bihars biggest festival, as well. Chhath holds special importance for Hindus in Bihar. During these four days, thousands of people worship the Sun God for long life and good health. However, the festival encompasses all, regardless of faith. For instance, it is the busiest time of the year for Maimoon Khatoon, Mohammad Maqoon and many other slum-dwellers who live near the New Patna Club. For the past five decades, the duohave been making mitti ka chullah (clay stoves) for Chhath devotees who cook prasad on stoves during the festive season. For Maimoon, 72, making the stoves for devotees is not just a means to earn money, but a labour of love.I make all the stoves in traditional style with determination and devotion. For making stoves, I give up eating non-vegetarian food and avoid meals prepared with onion or garlic. Making these stoves is a time-taking process, so I start preparing it a month before the festival, she said. The clay stoves range between Rs 40 and Rs 80. For me, devotees praise is more important than money. I do not negotiate for price and sell the stoves at whatever they offer. During Chhath, Sanija Khatoon, 30, and her whole family get busy making clay stoves for devotees. Its been 55 year since my in-laws have been preparing chullahs for this festival. It is really nice that during Chhath, a festival of faith and purity, devotees use stoves made by us. We buy clay from farmers in nearby rural areas for around Rs 5,000 per tractor. We leave the clay under the Sun to make it crisp and grind it. After that we add water and make a big dough and later mould it into chullahs, said Sanija. Around 70 families near Beer Chand Patel Marg are involved in procuring and selling clay stoves. Shaheeda Khatoon, 41, sells flowers and garlands at the nearby temples. Shaheeda, who has also been helping her family prepare Chhath stoves for the past two decades, said: I have full faith in gods and goddesses and will live my life to serve them. Just like Id and Bakri Id, I celebrate all festivals with full enthusiasm and devotion. Sakeena Bano, 33, makes earthen pots, brass soops and dalas for Chhath. These are essential items for the festival, especially on the day when women offer arghya to the Sun, said Bano, who lives near Bans Ghat. On other days, she sells puja flowers and steel utensils. Every year, slum dwellers clean the Collectorate and Anta Ghats two days before Chhath, said Mohammad Ishtiyaque. We do not clean it because of money but to get the appreciation and blessings of the devotees."

The district was, once, known for its heavy rainfall. Rivers like Tunga, Bhadra, Hemavathi, Vedavathi and Yagachi were flowing throughout and keeping the region green.With a decline in rainfall, the water flowing in the rivers have reduced drastically. Chikkamagalurus water woes will only worsen if the decline in groundwater resource is anything to go by.ComparisonThe noticeable drop in the water table may be blamed on the poor monsoon. Compared to last year, the district has received 15.16% less rainfall this year. The normal average rainfall in the district is 190.4 cm. This year, no taluk has received normal rainfall. On an average, Sringeri and Mudigere taluks, situated on the periphery of Western Ghats, were receiving the highest 365.9 cm rainfall in a year, while Kadur taluk used to get 60.36 cm rainfall. This year, however, the district did not receive heavy rainfall like the Malnad.Growers of various horticulture and agriculture crops worry about losing yield. There was a delay in the onset of monsoon. We were expecting good rainfall in July and August, but there were no sufficient rains. Even farmers in Kadur who had borewells could not provide water for their crops, said the farmers.Drought tagThe state government has already declared Kadur, Chikkamagaluru, Mudigere, NR Pura and Koppa taluks as drought-hit, however, the representatives and the farmers organisations are demanding that the entire district be declared drought-hit.Majority of the borewells have gone dry in the plateau. The local bodies have already started supplying tanker water in several villages of Lakya and Ambale hoblis. Coffee, cardamom, black pepper, arecanut, and onion crops have started withering."

The funds, being sanctioned by the government towards the repair of government school buildings, is too meagre, she added.Chaitrashri exhorted Chinnaswamy to bring the woes to the notice of the government and impress upon the authorities towards increasing the annual grants to address the problems faced at many levels.Chaitrashri, who also brought to the commissions notice that the maintenance grants for school buildings is also proving less, rued that the prevailing drought has worsened the situation. The deputy commissioner is directing the authorities to sink borewells at required places, utilising calamity relief fund. The government should declare support price for arecanut and onion crops, and develop roads in Malnad region, she added.She said earlier 30 kg of rice per month was being provided to eligible ration card holders. But it has now been reduced to 3 kpg.The newly introduced coupon system to avail ration under Public Distribution System (PDS) has caused more troubles than relief. Bhagyalakshmi bonds are not distributed in a regular manner, she stated.Honorarium hike soughtThe honorarium of Zilla and Gram Panchayat members should be revised, she demanded. Executive Officer of Tarikere Taluk Panchayat Gangadhar Murthy said the Panchayat can explore its commercial avenues by buiilding a commercial complex of 20 shops on the available space. It will ensure regular income to the local body, he added.The funds towards the maintenace of anganwadis and school buildings is inadequate, so also drinking water supply. The Panchayat is also finding it difficult to pay daily wagers as per the wages fixed by Labour Department, he said.Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R Ragapriya said the lack of staffers in Zilla Panchayat, Women and Child Development Department and also Education Department increased the work pressure on the employees. Such is the situation that, some of the officials lack information on Multi-village scheme and also professional skills. Such shortcomings should be addressed by starting a separate department, she demanded.At some places, there is a need to build residential quarters to accommodate district- and taluk-level officials, she said.In his address, Chinnaswamy said, even though there has been an increase in central grants up to 50%, the problems faced by the districts are also on upward mode. Owing to lack of rainfall, livestock are facing drinking water related problems.Chikkamagaluru and Hassan districts that come under Malnad region need special grants to take up road development works, he added.Chinaswamy suggested the Panchayat authorities to submit their grievances in the form of questionnaire to the Commission.Commission Member H D Amarnathan said a decision on collecting taxes in industrial areas will be taken after due consultation with Zilla Panchayat chief executive officer.He also informed the meeting that Central government is the decision-making authority and there is no provision to relax it."

According to a press release issued by environment and wildlife conservation activist G Veeresh, The Department of Animal Husbandry is tasked with the conservation of indigenous Amrit Mahal breed of cattle with a dedicated breeding centre set up at Kaval area. To guard the area, the guards are hired on a contract basis. But the guards, instead of restricting to their job, have indulged in illegal cultivation of commercial crop.Though they are allowed to grow ragi, maize and also hay for cattle feed, they have taken to large-scale cultivation of commercial crops. It is suspected that the higher officials in the department have colluded with the guards in the illegal activity.To substantiate this, Veeresh has recalled that when the similar activity came to light during the previous year, the officials seized the crop and also auctioned it. Now, the guards have already harvested the crop, he claimed.Wildlife sanctuaryThe state government has declared Amrit Mahal Basur Kaval Area as a wildlife sanctuary in the year 2002. While the Forest Department was tasked with the protection of the sanctuary, the Department of Animal Husbandry has retained the breeding and the conservation centre under it.The kaval area also has the credit of being the only forest in open plain coming under Amrit Mahal. It is also a habitat for wild animals like wolves, leopards, black bucks, besides birds and snakes.Instead of taking up conservation activities, the Forest Department has been focusing more on civil works like building artificial lakes, watch towers, trenches among other works, Veeresh charged.The district administration should take a call at the earliest in the interest of saving wildlife from annihilation, he said in the release.DH News Service"

Farmers, who had sowed their land with the hope of reaping a bumper harvest are now feeling dejected. Crops like ragi, jowar and onion have borne the brunt of scanty rains. More importantly, scarcity of rain has also led to acute drinking water shortage in some parts of the taluk.The monsoon had failed last year as well. However, the good rainfall during last rabi season ensured that the taluk did not face drinking water crisis. The monsoon, though was promising in the beginning, fizzled away in the later days. And now, the rains have virtually disappeared.Onion was sown on more than 2,500 hectares in Kadur taluk. Since there was no sign of rains, the farmers irrigated the crop using water from borewells for a few days. But, the borewells too failed owing to drastic depletion of groundwater. With no water, the crops have started withering, apparently affecting the yield.The recent crash in the price of onion has added to the worries of the farmers. They fear that with the prevailing price for the produce, they may not be able to recover even their investment. The farmers in Biluvala, Nagagondanahalli, Basooru and Maccheri have left the onion crops on the field without harvesting it.A farmer in Maccheri village stands to lose his onion crop grown an acre. The plants have already dried up and there are bleak chances of he recovering his investment of Rs 35,000 on seeds and fertilisers.The deficient rainfall has adversely affected ragi sown on 35,000 hectares in the taluk. Wild boars have been destroying jowar grown in Yagati hobli. Groundwater has been exploited to the hilt in the taluk. As a result, the authorities have imposed restrictions on sinking of borewells. However, a majority of the borewells have gone dry. Under these trying circumstances, farmers are also struggling to save their coconut and arecanut plantations. Drinking water crisis has assumed grave proportion in Panchanahalli, Yagati and Singatagere hoblis as well. With no other viable alternatives, the farmers in the taluk are looking up to the sky for any sign of rain."

Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust activist D V Girish, Wildcat Member C Sridev Hulikere and State Wildlife Board former member S Girijashankar said some farmers had cultivated onions on Kaval land last year too. Some officials are cooperating with the growers for personnel benefits, they charged.He said Amrit Mahal Kaval land holders are allowed to grow staple foodgrains on two acres land. The produce can be used for consumption and the grass should be handed over to the Amrit Mahal Breed Conservation Centre, Ajjampur, to be used as feed for cattle being reared at Amrit Mahal Kaval land, according to a new order. But, the centres officials and its joint director at Birur have flouted all the rules and have allowed the growers to cultivate onions last year, they claimed.The green activists charged that the growers had misused hundreds of acres of land belonging to Amrit Mahal Kaval to cultivate onions and earned lakhs of rupees as profit last year. The officials have been backing the illegal activity.The Kaval land has been fenced and the land is being levelled for cultivation now. This will result in scarcity of fodder for cattle. Some others are also involved in the name of Kaval land holders, they claimed.They said the state government has declared the land as community conservation reserve area. The Forest Department has been directed to conserve the species which are in the verge of extinction in the plain region. But, the department officials have failed to construct lakes and watch towers.They are also not initiating any measures to stop the illegal activities. The Kaval land is being encroached upon due to the negligence of the officials of the departments concerned, the green activists charged. They urged the district administration to ban the cultivation of commercial crops on the Kaval land and take action against the violators. The deputy commissioner has to intervene in the matter to carry out action as required and preserve Amrit Mahal variety of cattle, they urged."

While farmers should get high price for their produce, consumers should get quality produce at a fair price.Kammaradi said, Only 41 per cent of agricultural produce are being sold at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) in the state, while the rest are being sold at villages to private traders. Even after 60 years, we could not bring at least 60 per cent of the produce under market purview. The market should go to farmers rather than farmers coming to the market. This could bring a large quantity of produce under the market purview.He said the present minimum support price (MSP) prescribed for crops by the Centre was inadequate and did not meet the actual expenses of farmers.The state government should take measures to prevent the sales of agricultural produce below MSP in APMCs by giving statutory status to MSP. Many crops like onion and coconut do not get MSP, he pointed out.Kammaradi told educational institutions to have an official tie-up with KAPC to boost the farming sector.Managing Director of Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS) Manoj Rajan, former director of Institute of Development Studies, the University of Mysore, H S Gopala Rao, former director of Madras Institute of Development Studies V K Nagaraj, former vice chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences P G Chengappa and former chairman of KAPC S Bisaliah were present."

The farmers were told that for onions to be sold, they should be of the best quality with a diameter of 30 mm, along with other criteria. They were informed that they could sell up to 50 quintals of onions if they obtain the card from the Horticulture department after submitting their crop certificate (bele drudhikarana patra), Aadhaar card and bank account details.However, till this day, not even one kilogram of onions has been purchased at the centre.Anasuya, Manager of the Kadur branch of Karnataka Government Marketing Federation, said that no decision has been taken on the distribution of purchased onions. The remuneration to be given to the farmers towards the transportation of the crop is yet to be decided.Farmers in Kadur and Tarikere have been requested to bring onions of fixed standards. However, the farmers bring in those onions remaining after the sale of 70% of the crop. These are smaller in size and hence, cannot be purchased, according to the norms.Hence, the farmers have to cooperate, she added.The farmers have incurred losses after the market price came down drastically. Though the support price came to their rescue, the farmers are left in the lurch due to confusion prevailing over the purchase of the crop.Farmers who bring their crops to the centre, simply make their way back to their farms along with the crop, bearing the additional cost of transportation.This year, November 30 is the last date for the purchase of onions. But, the means of distributing the purchased onions has not yet been decided, the farmers said."
