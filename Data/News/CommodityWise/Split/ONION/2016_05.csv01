590414247be9e02646bdb987,The technical chef,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/586290/technical-chef.html,2016-12-12,"The technical chefBy Harini Raghavan, Dec 13, 2016, 23:51 ISTAfter each session, he would muse at the many ingredients and the variety of spices used.On a rainy day, when I returned home late in the evening tired and cold, what I needed was just a hot cup of coffee instantly. Relieving myself of the shoes and the heavy handbag, I dragged my feet towards the kitchen. The sight on the kitchen counter, with scattered utensils, tampered roll of kitchen towel and spilt food particles, brought a sudden surge of anger in me and drained away my appetite for coffee.I came to the living room and curled up on the sofa. Moments later, I heard footsteps coming down from the first floor which I chose to ignore, pretending to be angry at the person who had caused the devastation in the kitchen! I lay still to the sound of the clutter of plates in the kitchen. A few minutes later, my husband came up to me with a plate of onion pakodas, the smell of which made me stir up to a sitting position.As we gorged on the plate of pakodas he explained how, in an attempt to surp-rise me with a nice snack, he had gone through an unimaginably tough time! He had dug out the old recipe book to figure out the proportions, rummaged through the kitchen cabinets for the ingredients and the teary, onion cutting ordeal had almost dissuaded him from continuing with the task. But his ego didnt let him give up. Amid sweat and stress, he had completed the frying job. He had gone upstairs to freshen up before I returned, to cover up his struggle in the kitchen!We both agreed that the taste was not too bad, which encouraged him to make coffee at which he generally does not go wrong. Sipping the coffee, he confessed that it is worthwhile to learn cooking, at least the basic things. He decided right then that I should teach him how to cook a few dishes which we regularly eat. After the most needed refreshments, I agreed to it and teaching sessions started the same evening.Every evening, my husband would cook two items following my instructions. He would make notes of every dish he cooked. I should add here that his only demand during these sessions was for an apron, which we bought. He would wear it religiously and start cooking, adorning the look of a Master Chef! He perfected a dozen items, cooking under my able guidance. After each session, he would muse at the number of ingredients and the variety of spices used. This continued for about two months.One evening, during the cooking session, answering my daughters phone call, I heard him say, Dont think cooking is easy. It is a technical job. It needs full concentration. One must know the correct proportions and combinations... Make sure to learn a handful of recipes from Amma when you come home next. It will be valuable. We must admire her skills. All these days, we happily gobbled up these delicious items without a word of appreciation for her and the amount of time she spent preparing these dishes.As I looked at him thankfully, he admitted that he sincerely meant every word of it. Now, I know if I am tired or bored or not at home I can always bank on my husband to take over the cooking. He takes it as a fun activity and is a specialist now!"
59041f117be9e02646bdc1e5,Learning skills behind the bars,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/546479/learning-skills-behind-bars.html,2016-05-14,"Learning skills behind the barsR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, May 15, 2016 23:59 ISTWhen they were imprisoned for different reasons in Trichy District Prison, most of them were crestfallen. They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."

The evening was free so we went to the Vadakkanathan Temple. After that we sat on a stone bench under a large and spreading tree. The gentle breeze and the serene atmosphere did much to soothe the spirit.Lakshmi was in a mood to reminisce. She spoke at length about the good old school, where she was a boarder and didnt have a care in the world. She recalled the ruses she and her friends used to wrangle permission from the warden to go shopping or watch a movie always escorted by a senior boarder, of course. Sometimes, the senior turned out to be stricter than the warden! After a lengthy pause in the conversation, Lakshmi slid off the bench and said, You know what? I am hungry. She sounded as if she had made a major discovery. So we flagged an auto and returned to the hotel we were staying at. We headed straight to the restaurant where an attentive waiter seated us and stood by to take our order. I placed my order and so did Lakashmi. As an afterthought, she asked for salad as well. The pleasant-mannered, cheerful youth was only too eager to oblige. With the air of a magician producing a rabbit out of a hat, he put the plate of salad on the table. It looked impressive with slices of tomato, cucumber and carrot artistically arranged on a lettuce base with a mound of shredded cabbage in the centre. Looks tempting, doesnt it? asked Lakshmi. If you insist, I smiled. (I never touch salad outside the home.) She turned to the waiter.Dont you have onion? she enquired. He blinked in puzzlement. So Lakshmi repeated the question. He still looked uncomprehending. Lakshmi hails from Kerala so I suggested she speak in Malayalam. She saw the sense of that and asked, Onion undoe? Enlightenment dawned and pat came the answer. Illa. (No) was the very short and very sweet answer.Why? demanded Lakshmi, lapsing into English. Her voice held a hint of irritation. The waiter literally wrung his hands in confusion. Ari illa. (Dont know.)Then, as if inspired, he added, Chechi undu. (Have an older sister.) Aniyan pronounced like onion means younger brother in Malayalam. I had a tough time keeping a straight face. Malayalam, Lakshmi, I prompted. She did switch to her mother tongue then. And bingo! The waiter nodded and hastened away to bring the smelly bulb!"

59048b887be9e04154df8534,Of Molly Cullah and other culinary adventures,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/of-molly-cullah-and-other-culinary-adventures/,2016-10-26,"I dont like reading your food columns anymore, grumbles my friend as we sit in a coffee shop and contemplate the intricate patterns on our coffee foam. Why? I look up, momentarily distracted from the womans face carved in my coffee. Its full of modak-shodaks, thali-shalis, she waves a perfectly manicured hand in the air, nearly clocking a passing waiter under the chin. I want to read something moremoreexciting.Well, my next one is on molecular gastronomy, I roll out the words quickly, giving her a sly glance over my cup. Molly Cullah who, she squeaks. Not who, I retort. What!Molecular gastronomy is the new fad that has taken the fashion world by storm these past few years. It is the ultimate fantasy in the food world where science meets cooking and is about the chemistry and physics behind the preparation of any dish. What is the temperature required for that perfect boiled egg? Why does a mayonnaise become firm? What makes a perfect souffl swell? The world of molecular gastronomists looks at such culinary issues from a technical and aesthetic standpoint.Simply put, molecular gastronomy is all about deconstructing the food on your plate. Remember the time in your idle youth, when you dismantled your grandfathers favorite clock in order to find out why the cuckoo went, er, cuckoo! And the ensuing uproar that followed.Well, think of molecular gastronomy as just that: dismantling all the ingredients in your dish  without the massive uproar! Chefs basically unravel dishes and create separate food blocks instead of having everything combined. So a discerning diner has the customized experience of deciding which combination of ingredients to put into his or her mouth. From deconstructed desserts to transparent pasta and faux caviars, molecular gastronomy dishes out a startling statement on the dinner table. Using lab-like equipment such as liquid nitrogen and evaporators, this unique cooking style presents regular food in ways that will astound the diner. Phrases such as sous-vide, flash frozen, food foam, faux caviar have become as familiar to culinary aficionados as science terms such as gelification, emulsification, and effervescence.In the last few years, I have been fortunate to be introduced to this form of cooking at restaurants in cities like Barcelona, NYC and London. My most memorable meal was at the wd-50 in NYC which unfortunately has since shut down due to real estate construction. This is where I was introduced to a dish called Oyster in its shell where the shell was actually edible and the dish was suffused with preserved lemon, snow pea, and hazelnut. And being a big fan of ravioli, I fell in love with the scrambled egg ravioli where not only was the filling made of scrambled egg and cream cheese, salt and cayenne, but the outer cover too was made of egg yolk, which we were informed had been piped into silicone square molds. Out of the freezer, the ravioli looked like giant frozen egg ice cubes, but when served hot the pasta was delicious with the consistency of creamy scrambled eggs. Served with a side of caviar and cucumber, the dish made us drool and lick our lips with every bite. And to top it all was an innocuous dish called Shrimp Grits, which was basically Cajun comfort food served in a new avatar. Served with pickled jalapeo, the traditional grits was replaced by finely ground shrimp tossed with green onion and seasoning.And now here I am with my friend who wants to read  and eat  something which is not mundane and banal. We are at a fancy restaurant in Mumbai at an abandoned mill turned into a food hub, sitting to eat a meal where liquid nitrogen, colored bubbles, and foam lead to a scintillating sideshow. The humble papdi chaat comes to us in a glamorous avatar with each ingredient separated to showcase its delicacy. The coriander chutney has been whipped into a luscious foam and the yogurt aerated into little bubbles that pop in the mouth. As we move from the chaat to other pices dart, I marvel at the new evocative and distinct way the chef has presented traditional dishes leading to a treat not only for the mouth but for the eyes as well.The piece de resistance is the paan mousse: as we stare with interest at our platter which contains paan leaves ingeniously arranged around wedges of kulfi, the waiter, with a dramatic flourish, pours liquid nitrogen over the platter. The result: a large amount of cold vapor which generates a lot of oohs and aahs from the surrounding diners too. The dish is ambrosial with the paan retaining its freshness in its frozen state to complement the kulfi-style mousse inside its wrapping. Cest magnifique!So how was the food, I quiz my friend, as we step out after that deliciously artistic meal. There is a smidgen of silence. Then, there was too much show-shaa, my friend sniffs haughtily. When I go to eat food, I want to eat real food! Clearly, Molly Cullah failed to impress!"
5904949e7be9e04154df8ce2,Modi talks of samvedana. His party has other plans in UP,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/modi-talks-of-samvedana-his-party-has-other-plans-in-up/,2016-06-19,"On Thursday, June 16, Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Sangeet Som said he would organise a march  padayatra  to reassure people that the state would not turn into Kashmir. The implication was obvious.For those who came in late, heres the backdrop to Soms activism. Last week, Hukum Singh, who won a seat in Parliament from Kairana, UP, for the BJP in 2014, created a flap. He claimed 346 Hindu families had left this town because of persecution by Muslims.Media soon showed this claim was bogus: among the people on Singhs list, many had died of natural causes, most had migrated for better opportunities, jobs and schooling elsewhere. Hukum Singh was asked why he had forgotten to list Muslim families who had also left town. A slightly contrite Singh then said his list wasnt about Hindus and Muslims, but the menace of extortion. That claim, too, doesnt stand up to scrutiny: on Wednesday, TOI cited reports by district officials and police records that say only three families left Kairana fearing extortion.At first glance, this looks like a farrago of half-truths and lies, but theres a pattern to it.Kairana is a part of Shamli district, which borders Muzaffarnagar. Between August and September 2013, around six months before Lok Sabha elections, both were rocked by riots. Victims: 52 Muslims, 10 Hindus dead; over 50,000 driven out of home. Hukum Singh was accused of rioting; Sangeet Som was principal accused.The UP BJP believes its Lok Sabha sweep  71 of 80 seats  was due to what we politely call polarization. Once again, elections are due in UP next summer. The flare-up in Kairana bears an uncanny resemblance to events of 2013 in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. The BJP believes the formula that won it 2014 can be repeated in 2017.See the pattern?But heres the biggest contradiction: this sabre-rattling crashes headlong into another BJP narrative, laid down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has cultivated the image of a statesman overseas.Modi addressed the BJPs national executive  around 200 top leaders  in Allahabad recently. There, he took the high road of development. He said power was about great responsibility to get things done.And indeed, theres much on the table. For six months, November 2015 to April 2016, industrial production has shrunk every month, bar February this year. Indias economy is largely driven by investment. When investment grows, demand for capital goods soars. When this shrinks, its an ominous portent. For the last six months capital goods has fallen; in April by a horrifying 26%.Exports have shrunk, for the 18th month in a row, as have imports, showing India losing market share overseas and a lack of appetite for imported stuff  machinery to macaroni  at home. Services comprise over half our economy now. This slowed to a six-month low in May, the latest numbers.A growing economy needs to move things around. The real heavy lifting of stuff like fertilizer, coal, cement and iron ore is done on railways. Analysts look at rail freight figures to judge which way the economys core is, well, moving. Compared to a year ago, rail freight growth shrank 13.5%, an all-time low. The biggest falls were in fertilizer, coal and cement.After two years of drought, monsoons  which impact around 600 million livelihoods in our vast hinterland  are again patchy. I bought onion a couple of months ago at Rs 40 per kg. Today, its around Rs 100. I know now why consumer inflation has flared up.Yet, official statisticians put up heroic numbers at which the economy is supposed to be galloping. Taking their cue, Moodys  remember those guys who rated junk US subprime bonds as excellent?  says India will grow 7.5% this year. Well, good luck.But Modi must be sensing something of what the rest of India is feeling. Which probably explains why he felt compelled to tell his colleagues to pull themselves  and the economy  up by their bootstraps. He spoke about seven cardinal values party leaders and workers should follow. Among those, he listed saiyam (restraint), samvedana (sensitivity) and samvad (dialogue).These are laudable sentiments, if only the rest of the party were to listen. Modi talks of development and sensitivity. Sangeet Som, Hukum Singh and others light communal fires in UP.Clearly, there are two parallel narratives in the BJP today. These two stories, it hopes, will converge at the ballot box in UP next summer. But, as Euclid of Alexandria taught us in geometry, parallel lines never meet, except at infinity  which is impossible to grasp."

5904b4ba7be9e04154dfac52,Translating Ashokamitran’s words – and his silences,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/translating-ashokamitrans-words-and-his-silences/,2016-04-06,"All these qualities abound in The Ghosts of Meenambakkam, wherein the nameless protagonist finds himself embroiled with a terrorist group, while still reeling from a personal grief. The pathos of his surreal situation contrasted with his bathetic observations make you want to laugh and cry at once. The narrator-protagonist is at the intersection of several tragedies, and demonstrates a startling mix of nonchalance, despondence and an unaffected disengagement. In Ashokamitrans delineation, these conflicting emotions dont clash, they somehow all build up into a nuanced culmination.Another arresting trait of Ashokamitrans, seen in full flow in the short stories, is this poetic quality of suggestion. Not for him the clichd short story with a fast-paced plot and a clever denouement; instead, the short stories tend to trail off into quiet endings that leave you looking for more, and then play back in ones memory with a residual heat. Ashokamitran never brings his plot into a full circle, he will inscribe an arc and leave it at that  and his si lences are devastatingly impactful.The anthology Still Bleeding from the Wound mostly features stories set in urban landscapes -Madras, Secunderabad and Bangalore -and they capture the flavours of those cities from two-three decades ago with an ethnographers precision. Extreme emotions like violence (Children), frustration (Liberation), or even horror of the supernatural (The Colours of Evil) are presented with an intense minimalist style that evoke a shudder and empathy in equal measure. Intellectual and political commentary is never made explicitly in the narrative.There are excellent moments of wry humour, I didnt write those letters with regular ink; rather I wrote them with tears No, thats not quite accurate. The letters were intended to bring tears to the readers eyes, so it would be more precise to say that I wrote them with a pen dipped in onion juice(The Colours of Evil). This only heightens the readers involvement with the character, who laughs because the only other alternative is to cry . The existential con cerns of the music teacher who will never be a singer (Evolution) and the has-been politician (Waiting in the Dark) attest to the efficacy of Ashokamitrans gripping aesthetic, free of any figurative language or clever tropes.Ashokamitrans aesthetic universe is unique and does not submit easily to English literary parlance. His reticent style builds up a sustained intensity of feeling. He crafts crisp narratives with near-anthropological insight using the most ordinary characters in quotidian settings. And ironic humour surfaces in the most unexpected corners.Kalyan Ramans sensitive translations have captured these contours most effectively . His keen attention toward changes in register, and a courageous hand in translating certain colloquialisms (e.g. I didnt steal and all in Spinning wheel) are praiseworthy . The choice of retaining several words in the original Tamil to convey the right flavour is admirable, and the glossary is helpful as well.

Last Friday, back from the local Kolkata bazar, i surveyed my haul of the stuff a hungering, homesick Hon Bong desires. There i was, salivating over the prospect of kumro phooler bhaja, the crisp fritters of the yellow pumpkin flower, the cooling beler shorbot, a stir fry of onion stalks, pyaj koli, when, boom the pain struck. Its always a four- letter word, but this one was raised to 4,000 potency. It shot through my wrist, seized my hand in a vice, refused to allow my fingers to close into a fist to punch it back, or to turn my palm upwards in supplication for relief. My head reeled.The classic 4Ws +1H of a news report surfaced. Why here, far away from my doctor network? Whom to call? Where to go? What to do? How even to think straight. Fortunately, host-saheb was cooler than the ice he promptly laid on before getting on the phone. None of the lofty neuro guys was available, but, fortunately, the take-it-for-now option turned out to be the right one.Sumit Mukherjee, the physiotherapist, listened with the patience of a man used to Bengali patients. Along with us bawas, this is a breed whose hypochondria is matched by hyper-drama. He pressed hard on the culprit wrist bone, and declared, Snuff box. Here i was in agony, and this dude was invoking 18th century addictions and affectations?Turns out this is a sheath around two tendons along the wrist, and its inflammation is De Quervains syndrome. So now i know theres DQ, in addition to IQ. And to TQ, shorthand at Khushwant Singhs Illustrated Weekly of the 70s; it stood for tit-quotient, the mandated photographs of bare-bosomed belles.So heres another story. Femina was down the corridor, home to stylish, cigarette-smoking Libbers  and a steno called Krishnan. He took perverse pleasure in going up to the women, taking a pinch out of his snuff box and loudly ah-chhooing into this stained handkerchief. One day the exasperated Prabha protested. And the incorrigible Krishnan retorted: You go puff-puff, so why I should not go snuff-snuff?His point, my pain  neither to be sneezed at.***Alec Smart said: RSS shifts to long pants. More cover-up?"
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

Records published by the Nashik-based National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) showed that 13,56,381.48 metric tonnes (MT) of onions have been exported till September this year. This is a significant rise as compared to the 11,14,418.13 MT export of the vegetable in 2015. Although only about 10 per cent of the onion grown in the country has been exported, the figure is important to keep the price parity in wholesale markets.Watch What Else is Making NewsOver the past several months, onions were being sold at Rs 7 per kg in the Lasalgaon wholesale market here, causing losses to the growers.Last year, the average price of the produce in the same market was Rs 20 per kg. Excess production, especially in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, has been cited as the reason for the present glut, which had ensured that the prices remain subdued throughout the year.Earlier this year, the price of the bulb had touched an all-time low at Lasalgaon market as it was being traded at Rs 4.25 per kg  a record low in the last five years. In order to boost the price, the Central government had announced a 6 per cent export subsidy, which had helped in pushing some of the produce out of India.Jagdish Apsunde, an exporter from Nashik, said, at present, the Indian onions have good prices in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The minimum export price (MRP) is at zero and arrival of the bulb in the market is good. These two factors have at least ensured steady exports, he said. The export figures this year have surpassed the exports in the last two years. Apsunde said the Centre has been forthwith in settling subsidy claims, which has also helped exports.Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said steady exports have helped in holding the local prices. However, I feel the prices of onion at the wholesale markets will come down as soon as the bumper arrival of late kharif crop happens, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8e77be9e033b96e95d4,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The price of red chillies has also come down to Rs60 a kg, from the Rs70 before demonetisation.The rate of onion has dropped to Rs20 a kg from Rs25, while the rate of cauliflower has decreased to Rs60 from Rs65 a kg. The rate of capsicum has come down to Rs30 a kg from Rs40, while the rate of bottle gourd has now come down to Rs20 a kg, from Rs30.Vegetable vendors have stopped taking Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes.

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya)AT 6 AM, theres still time for the auctions, but farmers have already filled a giant shed in this towns old APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard with their fresh harvested vegetables. About half-an-hour later, a freshly shaven Ghanshyam Pokar, the auctioneer for Shree Patel Group, a leading commission agency-cum-trading firm here, arrives and is immediately surrounded by buyers that include vegetable vendors. The auction, then, begins with bids as low as Re 1 per kg, before settling at Rs 2 for brinjal. In almost all others  cabbage, cauliflower, red/green chilli, carrot, radish, lemon, spring onion and ginger  the prices dont exceed Rs 10/kg. By 8 AM, when Pokar has finally wound up, the entire produce in the shed has been auctioned off.Bakul Savaliya, a farmer from the outskirts of Gondal  40 km from Rajkot city and housing Saurashtras, and one of Gujarats, biggest APMC  doesnt hide his disappointment. The 50 kg of carrots that he brought fetched a mere Rs 4 per kg. Ive been coming here for the last 10 days and prices have never crossed Rs 8. At these rates, can I recover anything other than my own labour of digging out the carrots, cleaning and lugging them here? asks this 34-year-old who has grown the vegetable on his 20-bigha holding (six bigha make a hectare).Ramji Jamod, another farmer from Jamwadi, a village five km from Gondal, is similarly bitter about his 15 kg of green chillies grossing just Rs 150 at Rs 10/kg. He has reasons to be so: It is biting cold, especially when I have to ride my bike and be here by 5 AM to find enough space for unloading the produce.

After Notebandi  the NDA governments November 8 announcement scrapping the legal tender status of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes  the Gondal APMC was closed for a couple of days.I tried hawking the vegetables myself, but found it too time-consuming and so returned to selling through the Shree Patel Group. They first did not pay anything for a whole week. Then, they paid Rs 7,000 in the old notes, of which I am still carrying Rs 4,000. But for the last two weeks, they have been paying in valid currency notes, says Jamod. While he attributes the fall in prices to notebandi, Pokar  whose firm earns a 6 per cent commission, charged on the price paid by the buyer, on top of a 0.7 per cent APMC user charge  blames it equally on the spike in arrivals from a good crop this time.The Class III-pass Jamod tills 50 bigha land taken on a three-year lease, costing Rs 80,000 annually. Paying it isnt an issue. My problem today is finding hard currency. The five quintals of kapas (raw unginned cotton) that I sold fetched me Rs 25,625, but the entire payment was through cheque. Since there was no cash, I had to borrow Rs 6,000 for paying the cotton pickers. I now need labour for picking the residual groundnut pods in the soil. As Im not sure when the cheque can be encashed, it looks we (wife and three children included) will have to do the job ourselves, he complains.Jamod, during the kharif (post-monsoon) season, had planted groundnuts in 30 bigha, cotton in 15 bigha and vegetables  mainly chillies and val papdi (broad beans)  in his remaining five bigha. He is yet to sell his 40 quintals of harvested groundnuts, waiting for prices to improve. Vegetable sales are keeping his family going for the time being.I have sold Rs 25,000 worth of produce so far. But I have also been spending Rs 2,500 per week on pesticides alone, apart from irrigating the standing chilly using tanker water. I have already purchased seven tanker loads, each costing Rs 1,500, notes Jamod. Given the acute water shortage, he has even resorted to harvesting tender green chillies. The ones that are half-ripe, he is allowing to further ripen, before harvesting, sun-drying and finally taking to the market.Meanwhile, in the Gondal APMCs new yard, Gujarats largest market for groundnut, the auctions start at 8:30 AM. On Monday  which saw arrivals of 16,043 bags of 35 kg each  the bids ranged from Rs 3,200 to Rs 4,305 per quintal. The average rate, at Rs 3,700 per quintal, was well below the Centres minimum support price of Rs 4,220.Among the 100-odd farmers waiting for their produce to go under the hammer is 35-year-old Dhiru Mer, who belongs to Kundani village in Rajkot districts Jasdan taluka. Although Jasdan has an APMC, he prefers travelling 80 km and paying Rs 2,000 to the trucker to sell at the Gondal yard, where prices are better. The auctioneer Hansraj Sardhara declares Mers two separate piles of groundnut sold at Rs 3,780 and Rs 4,055 per quintal. But Kishor Rajapara, who has placed the higher bid, is ready to pay Mer Rs 80,000 only through cheque. I feel bad, but we ourselves are being paid by cheque and banks are allowing us to make weekly withdraw of just Rs 50,000, states this trader. Mer picks out a Rs 20 note from his pocket, swearing he has nothing else  not even money to buy lunch.December is the peak season for groundnut arrivals. Normally, at this time, these would be one lakh bags daily, whereas we are hardly getting 15 per cent of that. Only farmers with debts to clear or having special family obligations are coming to sell, admits Jayantibhai S Dhol, chairman of the Gondal APMC.There is a dearth of buyers, too. The only ones active are the oil mills and even they arent stocking up. Farmers come to me every day demanding cash. But I am unable to oblige, because theres nobody to pay me by cash. I am issuing over 50 cheques daily, while running out of leaves every second day. There are many cases of delayed clearances and even bouncing of cheques, observes Haresh Vadodariya, a commission agent and also a director of the APMC.The cash crunch, post-demonetisation, has also slowed down rabi (winter) season plantings. Jayantibhai Hadwani, who cultivates 18 bigha in Navagam village of Junagadh districts Vanthali taluka, got 40 kg of coriander seeds from a fellow farmer, but had to spend four days in bank queues to deposit his old notes and withdraw new currency. On Monday, the 50-year-olds son lined up before the State Bank of Indias branch at Shapur, a nearby village, only to return empty-handed. Hadwani himself is owed Rs 15,000 by other farmers who had hired his tractor and thresher.Sagar Makadiya, a farmer from Khadpipli village in Junagadhs Mendarda taluka, has harvested 34 quintals of groundnut from eight of his familys 10 bighas. He does not want to sell at the current rates, but was forced to borrow Rs 5,000 to pay labourers for picking up the residual groundnut pods and prepare his field for sowing coriander. The coriander seeds and fertilisers, too, he purchased on credit. Last week, Makadiyas father sold three quintals of kapas from the remaining two bighas at Rs 5,140 per quintal. The trader who bought issued a cheque for Rs 16,000, which bounced, as the bank found that his fathers name had been spelt differently. So, Makadiyas father has gone back to the trader, requesting for a fresh cheque for the same amount.The worst-hit, though, are agricultural labourers. Six families from Nandurbar district of Maharashtra are currently camping in Khadpipli. Farmers here owe us over Rs 8,000. We want to return home, but the pending dues are holding us back, informs Sanjaya Nahade, who is one of those awaiting payment from equally cash-strapped farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a07e97be9e033fa42edf4,Demonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangs,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-farmers-onions-4404162/,2016-12-01,"Farm labourers harvesting late-kharif onions at a field near Nashik. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farm labourers harvesting late-kharif onions at a field near Nashik. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Its already a bit late in the season, but three out of Nandu Awatis seven-acres holding are yet to see any rabi onion plantings. The 42-year-old from Ambegaon, a village in Yeola taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, had sown onion seeds in his nursery by mid-October and begun transplanting the germinated seedlings from these towards the month-end. By November first week, he had finished transplanting in four acres, when disaster struck in the form of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. That was on November 8.I had to abruptly stop, as there was no cash to pay labourers and they werent ready to take the old notes lying with me. Nor are the new Rs 2,000 notes of any use, because people know you cant buy daily essentials and get proper change with these, observes Awati. He, like many other onion growers, was looking at a bumper crop on the back of good monsoon rains this time. Last two years, we suffered from drought. The year, we have enough water, but this cash crunch has upset all our calculations, he points out.Watch what else is making news:Onion cultivation is a highly cash- and labour-intensive affair. Transplanting of rabi season onion  which has to be done within a month of sowing  starts from October-end and continues for the next two months. In some pockets, transplantation extends to even mid-January, though anything beyond December tends to severely impact yields. Around 60 per cent of transplantation happens between November 15 and December 15, and this is when labour demand is really high. On an average, about 40 farm hands are required to undertake transplantation operations over an acre in a single day. It costs about Rs 7,000 per acre, and may go up to Rs 8,000 if the labourers are not locally sourced. Harvesting labour also costs the same amount. Out of our total cultivation cost of Rs 40,000 per acre, Rs 14,000-15,000 is for labour, with expenses on fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs making up the rest, informs Awati. According to Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takali Vinchur in Nashiks Niphad taluka, growing onions require twice as much labour as maize, moong (green gram) or wheat. Gorade managed to complete transplantation in two of his four acres land, when the sudden cash crunch forced him to suspend operations. The labourers in my field included 16 who were from various villages in Ratnagiri district. I had to tell all of them to leave, after they were half-way through their job. They were obviously not going to accept the withdrawn notes, he notes.Maharashtra produces roughly 30 per cent of Indias annual onion output of 185-195 lakh tonnes. Almost 60 per cent of it is from the rabi crop, which, depending upon the time of transplanting, gets harvested from end-February to mid-May. Rabi onions, especially from Maharashtra, are amenable to storage unlike the kharif (October-November harvesting) and late-kharif (December-January) crops. The stored rabi crop is what feeds the market during the April-September period, till the kharif onions are ready for harvesting.For farmers in Maharashtras onion belt  mainly Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune and Dhule districts  the acute shortage of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes to pay labour has affected transplanting operations. Data from the state agriculture department as on November 25 shows only 1.46 lakh hectares (lh) being planted to rabi onions. Last year, at this time, 2 lh had already been covered and overall acreage touched 2.5 lh, despite widespread drought conditions. The current years shortfall appears to be largely due to the inability to pay farm labour. Apart from local labour, the onion belt also engages farms hands from the Konkan region. They mostly comprise smallholder farmers, who, after harvesting paddy from their own fields in October, come to Nashik for transplanting of onion.Farmers like Awati and Gorade were keen to plant onions this rabi also because prices have recovered from their lows. The modal price of onion  the rate at which majority of trades happen  at Nashiks Lasalgaon wholesale market has risen from Rs 417 per quintal in September to Rs 587 in October and Rs 872 in November. Demonetisation has seemingly not just wrecked farmers plans, but also raised the possibility of prices climbing on account of lower rabi plantings. Deepak Chavan, director of Farm Features Private Limited, a Pune-based commodity research firm, believes that there will be significant price correction after March. Low mandi prices till a couple of months ago had already prompted farmers to switch to maize, wheat and chana (chickpea). The cash crunch post-demonetisation will only exacerbate the trend, he adds.While Chavan sees up to a quarter of the rabi onion area this time being diverted to less labour-intensive crops, Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, thinks otherwise. His take is that the onion belt farmers have no real competing alternative cash crop. Yes, absence of ready cash to pay labour is an issue, but farmers will find a way out of this, including by involving family members and neighbours in transplanting and harvesting operations, claims Patil. But he, too, admits that the total rabi onion area in Maharashtra will barely match the 2015 level  which itself was below the average of 3 lh  notwithstanding the abundant water availability.If Gorade and Awati are bemoaning the sudden stop to their rabi onion transplantation operations, the situation is worse for Rambhau Gangurde, a farmer from Dighwad village of Nashiks Chandwad taluka. He is stuck with five acres of his late-kharif onions still to be harvested. In the normal course, I would have harvested it from the coming week, allowing me to also grow rabi onions in three acres. But with the cash crunch, both harvesting of my existing crop and transplantation of rabi onions look a tall order, he complains.But the worst hit are farm labourers, who, without any forewarning, have seen all work opportunities drying up. Sharad Borade and his two brothers eke out a living working for daily wages at others fields. Residents of Takali Vinchur, the same village to which Gorade belongs, they have now decided to travel 63 km to Malegaon, a city in Nashik district. Farmers here have no cash to pay us. So, we have no option but to look for work away from home, says Borade, who isnt sure, though, whether things are any better in Malegaon. This withdrawal of notes, we are told, is good for us in the long run. I, too, hope the present hardships are temporary, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a129d7be9e033fa42f334,NASA climate scientist and astronaut Sellers dies at 61,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/588098/nasa-climate-scientist-astronaut-sellers.html,2016-12-24,"Washington, Dec 24, 2016, AP 14:24 ISTPiers Sellers, a climate scientist and former astronaut who gained fame late in life for his eloquent commentary about the earth's fragility and his own cancer diagnosis, has died. He was 61.Sellers died Friday morning in Houston of pancreatic cancer, NASA said in a statement.Sellers shared his astronaut's perspective on climate change in Leonardo DiCaprio's documentary, ""Before the Flood,"" released this fall. He told DiCaprio that seeing the earth's atmosphere as a ""tiny little onion skin"" from space helped him gain a fuller understanding of the planet's delicacy.He also wrote a New York Times op-ed about grappling with the meaning of his life's work after learning he had terminal cancer. In both the film and the op-ed, he was optimistic, arguing that he expected human ingenuity to rescue the planet from a dire future of runaway global warming.""Piers devoted his life to saving the planet,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. ""His legacy will be one not only of urgency that the climate is warming but also of hope that we can yet improve humanity's stewardship of this planet.""In the op-ed, Sellers wrote that the best way he could imagine spending his final months was to continue working, despite knowing he would not live to see the worst of climate change or the harnessing of possible solutions.""New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate. There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks,"" Sellers wrote. ""History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots.""The British-born Sellers was deputy director for sciences and exploration at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He started working for NASA as a scientist in 1982 and joined its astronaut corps in 1996. He made three flights to the International Space Station, the last in 2010.""When I was a kid, I watched the Apollo launches from across the ocean, and I thought NASA was the holy mountain,"" Sellers said earlier this year when Bolden presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal, the agency's highest honour.""As soon as I could, I came over here to see if I could climb that mountain."""
