But for members of Mar Thoma Church, the true spirit of Christmas is all about caring for the environment. From the last nine consecutive years, the members have been making the churchs Christmas tree from trash.This year the 25-foot-tall tree has been made using waste cardboard boxes and the wreaths have been made using potato and onion sacks. The tree was officially inaugurated with lighting and Christmas carol service on Sunday at Mar Thoma Church on Primrose Road, near Hosmat Hospital.Daniel Thomas, a church member, told DH that 20 school and college students collected over 400 cardboard boxes and 35 sacks. Some members brought a few items from their homes and neighbourhood while some were purchased from those selling recycled items. The boxes were then painted and put up using a pulley and ladder. The tree was made in three weeks. he said.Recycling itemsThomas said the idea is to spread the message that before things go to dump, they have one more life. By creating Bengalurus tallest Christmas tree out of recycled items, the church wants to tell people that not everything needs to be thrown away, some can be used again."

(Express Photo) At the dhaba in Jullena. (Express Photo)More than a week after demonetisation was announced, Shanu is in a dilemma. Owner of a roadside eatery at Jullena in Jamia Nagar, Shanu has a hard choice to make every time a customer says he will pay later.I have to turn a lot of loyal customers away because they dont have cash. I feel guilty not feeding them, but what do I do? I cant give them food on credit. I also have to get my supplies and pay my workers every day, he said.WATCH VIDEOFor 13 years, Shanu has served affordable lunch and dinner to at least 200 people every day. Anyone can eat unlimited food  daal, sabzi, chapatis, rice and onion and radish salad for Rs 40. Its the most affordable meal for a whole section of society outside their homes, he said.But for the last couple of days, things have been shaky. My business has come down by half. Before November 9, I used to make at least Rs 10,000 per day, now it is hard to make even Rs 4,500, he said.Of the Rs 4,500, Shanu spends almost Rs 500-600 to pay his four-member staff  two cooks, one cleaner and one waiter. A third of the earnings are spent on supplies for the next day. He also has to pay rent and for cooking gas. At the end of the month, I save around Rs 10,000. I dont think Ill be able to save that much this month, said Shanu, a father of three and the familys only earning member. I dont know how Ill pay school fees for my children this month.The dhaba mostly caters to daily wage labourers and rickshaw pullers whose families dont live in the capital.WATCH VIDEO: How Demonetisation Impacts Rural PopulationMoinuddin, a 40-year-old carpenter from Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, ate at the dhaba on credit on Wednesday, but was turned away on Thursday. I understand why the dhaba cant give me food on credit anymore. Everyone is short on cash right now. The dhaba also needs money to run the business, he said.I feel bad sending people away, knowing they might sleep hungry. But if I keep giving food on credit, my business will close in three days, Shanu said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: File) Cash crunch has totally spoiled the business of fruit and vegetable vendors. (Source: File)A month after the withdrawal of high-denomination notes, agricultural remains one of the sectors hit hardest by demonetisation, as it grapples with major losses. While some farmers have incurred a loss as high as 60-70 per cent, rabi sowing has also taken a hit due to the cash crunch.The business of fruits and vegetables  from the farmers field to the consumers table  has always been cash-intensive, with barely any use of alternative modes of payment.As cash runs dry in rural areas, this business chain has all but collapsed, with little hope of a speedy revival. Shirram Gadve, president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India (VGAI), said the price of vegetables has dropped by almost 60 per cent across wholesale markets. Whatever sale is happening right now, it is distress sale, and thats causing major loss to the farmers, he said.Annually, the wholesale markets register trade of around Rs 1 lakh crore in the sale of fruits and vegetables. In fact, the months of November and December usually witness 10-12 per cent more consumption of vegetables than other months, due to easy availability and better prices.On an average, an acre worth of vegetables during this month fetches us Rs 1 lakh, but this year we have received only Rs 30,000 for that its such a loss, said Gadve. The onion trade also had seen losses, according to trade analysts, of around Rs 50 crore, as cash transactions have all but stopped. The poultry industry has also registered losses worth Rs 100 crore in Maharashtra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The tweets have all been deleted and the accounts restored.Twitter-verse has of late seen a tense atmosphere with four major Indian accounts being hacked by a group called Legion. It started with the hacking of the accounts of the Indian National Congress (INC) and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. Gandhis twitter hack mostly consisted of offensive tweets but no information was leaked. Similarly for the INC, profane content was posted from their account as well.This was followed by the hacking of Vijay Mallyas account wherein information about the cars he owned, passwords for his online accounts, his emails were dumped on a particular website and the link put on his Twitter for everyone to access. The next victim was NDTV journalist Barkha Dutt, whose Twitter account also gave away personal IDs and passwords and email dumps. This was soon followed by another NDTV journalist Ravish Kumars Twitter being hacked.Screenshot of the tweets posted by the hackers on Rahul Gandhis twitter account.

While partial email dumps have been leaked, they have promised to leak more emails. They also claim that their next target would be Lalit K. Modi, businessman and IPL founder.The tweets by the group on these accounts have all been deleted and the accounts restored. However, this major security breach has threatened the lives of journalists and politicians online. The question remains  who are the Legion?In one of the tweets, the group asked for support at sigaint.org. Ironically, the website that the link leads to, claims to provide email protection to journalists and activists from dragnet surveillance that is prevalent online. Once you sign up with Sigaint, you will be given access to a Tor bundle through which you can access a website that has been hosted on the onion domain. The Tor and .onion combination exists to hide the online activities of a person.A tor web browser is used essentially to hide your identity and activities online and .onion is a domain suffix for private use. It designates an anonymous hidden service that can only be reached through the Tor network.Vijay Mallyas personal information was leaked out through the tweets. Vijay Mallyas personal information was leaked out through the tweets.Whether the Legion group is the same as the Sigaint network has not been established but for a tweet asking for support on the website. However, it does show that the group is well versed with the ways of hiding and revealing peoples identities.Legion group also leads to The Legion of Doom, a popular group of hackers that was active in the United States from 1980s to 1990s and then in 2000s. It now lies low. However, there doesnt seem to be an established or purported connection between the Legion of Doom and the Legion group that is hacking accounts in India.In response to the hacking of Twitter accounts of NDTV journalists, NDTV tweeted, Email, Twitter accounts of senior NDTV journalists have been hacked. Attempts being made to use emails out of context. We are asking relevant authorities, including courts, to take strong action. Barkha Dutt and Ravish Kumar, however, did not individually respond to the hacking incident.Barkha Dutt and Ravish Kumar did not say anything regarding the attack on their personal Twitter accounts.

Even the Food Ministry is also procuring pulses under Price Stabalisation Fund.""On onions and potatoes, he said that the centre will start MIS operation after the state governments send the proposal for the same. ""I have not received any proposal so far in case of onions and potatoes.""Asked for his views on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's demand to give bonus on rabi crops and farm loan waiver, the Minister took a dig at him saying that Gandhi is taking out his frustration for ""not being promoted as the party President"".He said farmers have faced some discomfort due to demonetisation but it has not impacted the ongoing sowing of rabi (winter) crops like wheat. ""In fact, rabi sown area till yesterday was higher than the year-ago period,"" he added.The Agriculture Ministry is aiming a record 270 million tonnes of foodgrains in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June), as against 252.22 million tonnes in the last year."

Farmers in Karnataka are realising this as they are unable to get reasonable prices for perishable commodities given the liquidity crunch.Trade in the farming sector happens mainly in cash. Given the cash shortage, farmers are forced to either accept the scrapped notes or sell the produce on credit without any documentation. This makes them vulnerable to cheating. The first few days after demonetisation were particularly bad. Vegetables were sold at throwaway prices as cash-strapped traders stayed away.Take onion, for instance, which can be stored for up to 60 days. There has been a bumper crop in Karnataka this year and APMC yards across the state have been flooded with the produce. The minimum support price (MSP) offered by the government for a quintal of onion is Rs 624, according to farmers.The APMC yard at Yeshwantpur was a picture of utter chaos from November 9 to 12. Onion was sold for as low as Rs 100 and Rs 200 per quintal. Krishnappa, who brought a truckload of onions from Bagalkot, said he saw the commodity being sold at Rs 200 per quintal at the Yeshwantpur yard. Kumar, a farmer from Chitradurga and district secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), said demonetisation badly affected the business in the first week.Things are now looking up, he said. Ironically, the BKS is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological parent.Bharat Shah, a wholesale merchant, said that at least Rs 1.5 crore worth of vegetables and fruits were destroyed in Bengaluru in the last one week because of the liquidity crunch.Both farmers and traders have incurred huge losses. We could not sell these commodities because people didnt have money to even buy them at the lowest possible prices. This is a rare phenomenon, Shah added.N Manjunath, a coconut wholesale dealer, said, Low-denomination notes are either unavailable or soiled. Farmers accept them unwillingly. The day they reject these notes, we will also discard them.Aware of the distress in the farming sector, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has directed all states to assess the impact of demonetisation on farmers. Karnatakas Department of Agricultural Marketing has started the work accordingly, a senior officer said."

In October this year, it was 3.39 per cent.Prices of pulses however continued to rule high in the wholesale market at 21.73 per cent last month, as per the Commerce Ministry data.Potatoes recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.Industry chamber Assocham said the fall in WPI is in tandem with the expectation which is reflective of the depressive state in the economy owing to the demonetisation.""Boost to industry is required from both monetary and fiscal policy, i.e. lowering of interest rates by RBI and reduction in tax rates by government in the coming budget to counter the effects of overall slowdown in economy,"" it said.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said however that rising global commodity prices and a waning of the base effect would push up WPI in December."

Be it buying groceries or objects of desire, there is a unique pleasure in visiting shops. For women, shopping gives them relief from the mental tension associated with daily chores. But I beg to differ.Though I often accompany my other half to the supermarket and jewellery shop, I feel out of place once I step in to the shops. At the supermarket, my job is to stand behind her and push the shopping cart while she leisurely picks up packets of foreign cheese and honey marketed by Patanjali.Though we returned from another country a few years ago after spending nearly quarter of a century there, the shopping pattern has not changed much. Extra virgin olive oil made in Spain, Anchor cheese and American apples! If my better half wants to spend more than five minutes in selecting an item, I happily tell her, Take your own time. Give me a missed call when you finish selecting your objects of desire.This is the time for me to roam around the supermarket. I go to the vegetable section and read the price of a kilogramme of potato and onion only to forget it within minutes. After that I go to the organic food section. Till date I have not found more than two customers buying from this counter. Then, I take a glass of payasam offered free of cost by the young girl who is there to promote the item.I say hello to the girl standing outside the perfume shop with a bottle of a new scent that she is desperately trying to sell. After spending more than 30 minutes at various sections in the supermarket without buying anything, I usually get the missed call from my wife. She would be near the cash counter with her shopping cart fully loaded. I once again check my wallet to confirm that there is enough cash.I pay the money to the cashier and push the cart all the way to the car. Accompanying my life partner to the jewellery shop is not pleasant either. When I enter the shop I feel trapped. When you go to a barber shop, there are magazines to read while you wait for your turn. If it is a dental clinic, there are old issues of popular magazines and other promotional materials from pharmaceutical companies.But in jewellery shops, I have never found any reading material for the customers. My problem: How to spend time while my partner shops for a gold chain? When I try to go for a coffee at a nearby shop, she tells: Wait, only ten minutes more. I still accompany my wife for shopping and pay all the bills as I have for many years. Life is like that."

Her husband Baburao is an onion vendor.Together they earn Rs 7,000 per month. Their 15-year-old son, Balraj, dropped out of school in August to contribute to the family income by taking up petty electrical jobs. Before the introduction of the Aadhaar-based biometric authentication (ABBA) machine, they received their full grain entitlement of 18 kg.In March, they were informed that an Aadhaar card with the same unique number as Baburaos was in use in Mehoobnagar district. Consequently, both Baburao and Balraj were struck off the right-holders list. Despite various trips to the Circle Office and Mee Seva centres, their predicament has not been solved. To add to their woes, Jayammas fingerprint is not being recognised by the biometric machine since July.Jayammas household is among the 80 we surveyed in Hyderabad. We found that 38% of households reported fingerprint authentication issues, 31% made more than one trip to the shop and 27% reported machine connectivity issues resulting in either failed or delayed transactions. Certain households reported exclusion of members due to the absence of Aadhaar cards or Aadhaar seeding errors.Of the 50 that successfully transacted in October, we found that all households had received their full entitlement at the correct price. Strikingly, 71 of the 80 households reported receiving their full entitlements at the correct price prior to introduction of ABBA. Contrary to being a game changer for welfare delivery, persistent and pervasive issues have arisen with ABBA. It has imposed various challenges. Right-holders like Jayamma and Baburao who lack the resources to access the grievance redressal mechanism have resigned to their sour fate of denied entitlements.(Somanchi is a graduate student of Development Studies at TISS, Mumbai; Bej is a law student at NALSAR, Hyderabad)"

The government has only Rs 130 crore under the scheme. The Centre has not clarified whether it will extend any financial assistance. The state government, however, will soon devise a method to purchase areca nut from farmers, he added.The Centre has fixed Rs 25,100 per quintal for white (chali) variety and Rs 27,000 per quintal for the red variety. The MIS will be in force between December 7 and 31, 2016.Jayachandra said the government has purchased 7.37 lakh quintals of onion from 11,452 farmers under the MIS in the last 37 days, spending Rs 57.49 crore. The government could earn only Rs eight crore by selling the onions it had purchased. This had resulted in an additional financial burden of Rs 48.96 crore on the government, which is yet to dispose 1.20 lakh quintals of onion.The minister accused the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) of not purchasing copra from farmers at the rate fixed by the Centre.

But I had to wait in a queue for half an hour, Chandrashekar of Puttur, a resident, said.In Mysuru, crowds persisted outside banks and ATMs but relatively thinned in banks. Banks rarely followed the Centres directive to make separate queues for women, senior citizens and the disabled. People having notes of lower denomination made a quick buck by swapping them for a commission. In North Karnataka, people in villages were not affected much when compared to their counterparts in urban areas. Their dependency on cash is less as this is neither harvesting nor sowing season. The only affected farmers were onion growers who faced difficulty in selling their produce. Some banks held note exchange melas in villages.

Darknet market sites such as Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Silk Road 3.0 and Silk Road Reloaded have been brought down or targeted by the law enforcement authorities. What is Darknet, why does it exist, and why are its sites often associated with the ancient Silk Road?The Internet might be compared to an iceberg, where the top one-third is out of water and clearly seen, while the remaining two-thirds are submerged. The top, visible portion of the Internet is known as the open web. Our search engines, such as Google and Firefox, have indexes to its sites and can lead us across the open network. For most of us, the open web is the Internet. However, the vast majority of Internet web pages are invisible to most Internet users.The remaining two thirds of the Internet sites are submerged, or concealed. These concealed segments are known as the Deep Web and the Dark Web, or the Darknet. They are accessible, but hidden from most users. These layers have been developed by technologies that allow Internet users to have anonymity on the web. They legitimately help individuals and companies to protect their security and privacy, and in many cases serve to protect users from censorship.The majority of pages residing in these layers are personal or corporate pages, administrative databases, or personal photo collections. Only a very small portion of the sites in Deep Web use sophisticated anony-mity systems, allowing operators to conceal identities and operate criminal activities.While there are many legitimate reasons an Internet user would wish to hide their identity, a majority of those who do so take simple measures such as using pseudo-nyms on social media sites, clearing the web browser history from their computer after use, or using unsophisticated encryption methods.Users who do not use some type of anonymity protecting measure should be aware of how easily online activities can be tracked and identities revealed. Websites and emails can be monitored and, unless encrypted, reveal vital information that violates user privacy.Anonymity on the open web: Before a device can use the Internet as a highway for information, it requires an Internet Protocol address, or IP address, which can be recorded and often linked to individual users. However, some routers use Network Address Translation protocol, or NAT to assign a single IP address to the router and mask the multiple, individual devices on a particular local area network (LAN). If you use a wireless router to connect your devices, you are probably using this technique.Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide anonymity and protection by tunnelling and encryption. Tunnelling establishes a covered communication network route which isolates the transmission.When penetrated, it redirects and re-establishes the tunnel along another line of communication. Should the message be intercepted, it is also encrypted so the interloper will be unable to read the contents of the transmission. The disadvantage of the VPN is that a single entity (the provider of the service) has access to the identity of all users and their communication partners.The other, more robust anonymity systems offer stronger protection. The most popular anonymity system is known as Tor. Originally developed as a research project in 1995, Tor became operational in 2003 and has been maintained and improved by Tor Project Inc. Tor conceals a users data within the Tor network, hiding the users IP address and other identifiers from the websites they visit, thereby disguising the users online activities.Internet communicationAnyone monitoring Internet communication will find it extremely difficult to trace these activities back to a specific user. Tors popularity stems from its ease of use, as one does not need a detailed knowledge of computers to use the system.Tors benefits enable anonymous use of the open web using the Tor browser, and anonymous publishing of web services as part of the Tor Hidden Services.Tor enables users to access the open web and circumvent censorship, anonymously participate in activism and journalism, provide undercover online surveillance of specific websites, protect personal security and privacy, and anonymously conduct peer-to-peer file sharing.Delving deeper on to the Darknet, users link to Tor/onion sites, which are part of the Tor Hidden Services (THS) network. Because THS addresses end with .onion rather than traditional co.in addresses, they are commonly referred to as onion addresses. The THS sites are not indexed by common search engines, such as Google and Bing, making them more difficult to locate. There is no central recording of existing THS sites and not all THS addresses are published.Where the Darknet really becomes black: While a large portion of Tor users are conducting legitimate business, anonymity on the dark side does lead to an increased potential for criminal activities. These activities include criminal marketplaces for drugs, child pornography, terrorism and other nefarious activities. The most prominent hidden marketplace on Tor was Silk Road.The site enabled users to buy and sell illegal drugs and commodities. Silk Road was active from February 2011 until July 2013, where the site processed over $1.2 billion worth of illegal sales between 4,000 vendors and over 1,50,000 customers. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation took down the site in October 2013, although several other illegal sites have since taken its place.Can we/should we block access to these sites? The long-standing public debate concerning online anonymity centres around the rights of individual citizens to be anonymous online, thereby protecting their freedom of speech and other individual freedoms or whether total anonymity leads to unethical and criminal behaviour.Most governments agree that banning online anonymity systems completely is not an acceptable solution. China attempted to do so, only to discover that dissidents were using secret entrance nodes to the Tor network called bridges to continue their acti-vities.

File Photo/Agencies (representational). The distressed farmer said he incurred more than Rs 700 per acre for cultivating onions and paid Rs 780 towards transportation charges for bringing the produce to the APMC. File Photo/Agencies (representational).A farmer from Karanjgaon village in Nashik district has claimed to have got the rate of 5 paise per kg for onions, prompting him to dump his produce of 13 quintals in his field in protest, even as a trader blamed poor quality of bulb for the low price. Sudhakar Darade, who hails from Niphad taluka, said his onions got valued at Rs 5 per quintal (100 kg) at Saikheda sub-agriculture produce market committee (APMC) on Tuesday.He said his entire produce of 13 quintals was offered a rate of Rs 65 in total. The distressed farmer said he incurred more than Rs 700 per acre for cultivating onions and paid Rs 780 towards transportation charges for bringing the produce to the APMC. Upset over the valuation, Darade returned home and threw 13 quintal of onion in his field.Nashik district is known for production of red onions. The onion market in Lasalgaon in district is Asias largest wholesale APMC for onions. I had cultivated onions on my 10-acre land in November- December last year. I stored around 1,000 quintals of onions at home, hoping that I will get good price in April. However, auctioning of onions got severely affected due to the 35-day strike at APMCs in district during June-July, as a result of which onions perished, he said.However, sources at APMC said that condition of onions brought by Darade was bad and their size was small. Onions are currently auctioned at Rs 600-700 per quintal in APMCs, but farmers are bringing wet onion stock. On Tuesday, one farmer (Darade) brought onions for auction at Saikheda. However, most of his produce was wet and rotten. Still, some of his good quality onions were valued at Rs 25 per quintal, but wet and perished onions were valued at Rs 5 per quintal or 5 paise per kg, said Suresh Kamankar, an onion trader.Meanwhile, protesting against the low price of onions, Nashik unit of NCP yesterday dumped onions on the premises of all taluka offices in the district, demanding the Minimum Support Price (MSP) at Rs 2,000 per quintal. Onions are being sold at APMCs at Rs 600-700 per quintal. However, farmers are in distress as they could not recover even the production cost, said Nashik district NCP president Ravindra Pagar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
591f554e7be9e025a5d4d36a,Food prices put upward pressure on WPI in Dec,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/523086/food-prices-put-upward-pressure.html,2016-01-14,"Food prices put upward pressure on WPI in DecJanuary 15, 2016, New Delhi, DHNS 22:33 ISTIndias wholesale inflation remained in negative territory, but inched up in December due to pressure on prices of pulses and vegetables.For the 14th month in a row, wholesale prices fell in December but the rate of decline at 0.73 per cent was the slowest in last one year as food prices shot up, indicating return of inflationary pressures ahead of RBIs monetary policy review. The WPI was (-)1.99 per cent in November.Prices of pulses shot up 56 per cent in December and that of vegetables rose 20 per cent, while onion prices went up by 26 per cent, respectively. Wholesale inflation has been rising for the fourth month in a row mainly because of shooting food prices.The wholesale fuel prices, however, dropped 9.15 per cent year-on-year in December, while prices of manufactured goods declined 1.36 per cent, helping to keep the wholesale inflation in the negative territory. Disinflationary pressures in manufacturing products outlined weakness in the commodities sector. The industry warned that continuous decline in WPI numbers for manufactured products could adversely impact the pricing power of manufacturers.The continuation of the deflationary trend is an indication of weak demand in the economy, besides being the spillover effect of lower oil and commodity prices. The latest data on industrial production once again highlights the precarious nature of recovery in this sector. We hope that the central bank will respond to the situation appropriately and take steps that would aid the process of industrial recovery. At this juncture, propelling growth and creating jobs should be a priority and all policy levers should be geared towards that objective, industry body Ficci stated.Lack in overseas and domestic demand has contracted industrial production in November. The index of industrial production fell the most in over four years by 3.2 per cent on sharp fall in manufacturing output. According to official data, the consumer inflation too has edged up for the fifth straight month in December on rising food prices, signalling a return of price rise in the coming months."
591f62b47be9e025a5d4dbcc,India set to go  on organic diet,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521019/india-set-go-organic-diet.html,2016-01-03,"Mamta Bhardwaj Jan 04, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTOne of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under organic certification, India has an organic food market estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."
591fba827be9e025a5d51795,"FM hits back at Rahul, says NDA has brought down inflation",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560718/fm-hits-back-rahul-says.html,2016-07-28,"New Delhi, Jul 28, 2016, PTI 20:16 ISTHitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today reeled out statistics in Lok Sabha to assert that the NDA government had brought down inflation and expressed hope that prices of essential commodites will come down further after a ""good"" monsoon.After Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the government had failed to control prices, particularly of the essential commodities, Jaitley contended that the NDA government had inherited high inflation from the UPA dispensation.""Any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics,"" he told the Congress Vice President while intervening in a debate on price rise and asked him to compare the status of inflation during the UPA government and that prevailing now.Referring to Gandhi's attack on Modi for criticising the then Congress-led government over inflation in February 2014, Jaitley said, ""This is a topic of statistics and not sloganeering. The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

Now it is a case of excess production, said Deepak Chavan, a Pune-based agriculture commodity analyst, who belongs to a farming family.This has come as a matter of concern for the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED).As per the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF), last year ( June 2014 to May 15) the country saw a production of 189 lakh tonnes, which increased to 203 lakh tones this crop year.NHRDF reportAccording to data of NHRDF for Tuesday, 10,500 quintals arrived  and sold at minimum Rs 300 per quintal and maximum Rs 858 per quintal while the modal price was Rs 630 per quintal.However, Sanjay Pingle, a member of Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), begged to differ.If the quality of onions is good, you get good prices....good quality onions are being sold at good prices.....not at five paise per kg or five rupees a quintal, he said."

However, with onion prices touching new lows, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate,"" said Parbhane, the sole bread-earner for his family of five.Parbhane explains the math: he has two acres of farm land in which he grew onions by spending Rs 80,000.""On May 10, I sent 952 kg of onions in 18 gunny bags through a truck to the Pune-based Agriculture Produce Market Committee and received Rs 16 per 10 kg. So, per one kg, it works to one rupee and sixty paise,"" said Parbhane.""The total onion was sold for Rs 1,523.2. Out of the earnings, the middlemen took away Rs 91.35 as commission, labour charges were Rs 59 and Rs 18.55, and Rs 33.30 was paid against miscellaneous charges. Rs 1,320 was paid to the truck driver, who transported the produce to APMC.""He claimed that after all the deductions, he is taking home only Re 1. He was informed that the prices of onion had plunged drastically that particular day.""I was expecting at least Rs 3 per kg. However, I was disappointed after receiving such a deal,"" the farmer said. ""For four months, I took care of my produce and watered the onions at the time of load-shedding. Forget the profit, I am unable to recover even my expenditure on growing onions.""There were no comments on the farmer's claim from APMC.
