More than a dozen Congress MLAs and 25 former MLAs and Ministers took part in the march.Rohtak Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was also present.The BJP government in Haryana has been facing major opposition to its recently-launched crop insurance scheme from the Opposition, including the Indian National Lok Dal. The scheme purportedly aimed at protecting the interests of the farmers is, ironically, being opposed by farmers as well at some places.Saying that the march on Saturday was just a warning to the BJP government to mend its anti-farmer ways, Mr. Hooda said, adding that the scheme was being imposed on the farmers without their consent and premium was being directly deducted from their accounts. The terms and conditions of the scheme are all anti-farmers. It is a scheme to benefit the private insurance agencies and not the farmers. The BJP government in Haryana is acting on the behalf of these companies instead of protecting the interests of the farmers. They cannot do this, said Mr. Hooda.The scheme treats a village as a unit, which puts the farmer at a disadvantage while the premium is being collected from all the farmers. If the government claims to be pro-farmer, it must pay the entire premium and insure the farmers, demanded Mr. Hooda.He said that farmers in the State were in a bad shape and not getting adequate price for their produce. Blaming the BJP government for their plight, Mr. Hooda said that though the prices of agricultural produce such as tomatoes, paddy, cotton and onion had nose-dived, the end consumers were not getting it at any cheaper rates.He said that all sections of the society had become fed up with the government and had lost all hopes. The BJP government came to power both at Centre and in State making a host of promises, but they have failed to deliver on them. But now the masses had no hope from them. They have lost all hopes, said Mr. Hooda.The Congress leaders later submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Governor, to the Karnal Deputy Commissioner demanding that the scheme be immediately withdrawn."

The onion market in Lasalgaon in district is Asia's largest wholesale APMC for onions.""I had cultivated onions on my 10-acre land in November- December last year. I stored around 1,000 quintals of onions at home, hoping that I will get good price in April. However, auctioning of onions got severely affected due to the 35-day strike at APMCs in district during June-July, as a result of which onions perished,"" he said.However, sources at APMC said that condition of onions brought by Darade was bad and their size was small.""Onions are currently auctioned at Rs 600-700 per quintal in APMCs, but farmers are bringing wet onion stock. On Tuesday, one farmer (Darade) brought onions for auction at Saikheda. However, most of his produce was wet and rotten. Still, some of his good quality onions were valued at Rs 25 per quintal, but wet and perished onions were valued at Rs 5 per quintal or 5 paise per kg,"" said Suresh Kamankar, an onion trader.Meanwhile, protesting against the low price of onions, Nashik unit of NCP yesterday dumped onions on the premises of all taluka offices in the district, demanding the Minimum Support Price (MSP) at Rs 2,000 per quintal.""Onions are being sold at APMCs at Rs 600-700 per quintal. However, farmers are in distress as they could not recover even the production cost,"" said Nashik district NCP president Ravindra Pagar."

5922dff97be9e01fd59ac29d,A tale of parched Maharashtra village: Each family in Shilatane village spends Rs 100 a day to buy water,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/waterless-maharashtra-pune-water-buy-expensive-parched-each-family-in-shilatane-village-spends-rs-100-a-day-to-buy-water-2814250/,2016-05-23,"Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day. Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day.AS ONE enters the village Shilatane, around 50 kms from Pune, a prominent sight that meets ones eyes are large-size blue colour barrels placed outside each house. Since past three months, the dwellers of this village have been buying water, spending Rs 50 for each barrel that can store 200 litre of water. On an average, a family buys at least two barrels of water; the number varies if the members in the family are more.Ask Nanda Vilas Chavan, a housewife, whos busy pouring water into a small vessel from one of the barrels, about the water situation in her village, and she responds, Although we have been using water judiciously for last three months, we need at least two barrels of water every day, given that we have five members in the family. A barrel comes for Rs 50 and thus, we end up spending Rs 100 every day. The amount is not easy to shell out as our only source of income is agriculture, which is also badly affected by water shortage.Asha Vijay Bhanusghare, another woman says, Our entire monthly budget has got disturbed. We are spending Rs 3,000 to 4,000 every month only on water. Its a basic necessity for survival and one cannot cut costs here. And so even though we are reducing our expenses in other areas, we are keeping aside this amount every month.The village, which has a population of 2,500 people, is one of the 40 villages that are located around River Indrayani, which is currently completely dry. The river originates in Kurvande village, near Lonavala. The sarpanch of the village Shilatane, Hemant Shivaji Bhanusghare, informs that the rivers water dried in January itself and since then, the water condition has been bad.The villagers, he says, depend on Indrayani for water needed for agriculture and their cattle. It is not the first time that it has happened. This is a struggle we face every year. Hence, all the farmers have shifted to single crops, he says, adding, Theres nothing we can do after January. You can find barren farm lands across this area. The drinking water through water pipeline connected to Pavana Dam is supplied to all villages once in four days. Around 40,000 litre of water cannot last for four days in a village that has 2,500 people. The situation of houses that are situated on the higher side is worse because the water pressure is so low that it cannot reach them. People have no choice but to buy water from the tankers. The villagers are taking their cattle 2 km away from village for water. Even the milk production of cows and buffaloes has reduced due to shortage of fodder and water, he says.Chandrakant Andre, a farmer, shares that in comparison to previous years, when he grew potato, tomato, onion and sugarcane, now he grows just one crop in a year as there is no water for agriculture, which has reduced his annual income. Andre says he is waiting for rains, after which he will sow either jawar or chana.Prafull Kadam, a water activist who works in the area, cites that while Valvan Dam is just six kms from the village, the village gets water from Pavana Dam, which is 16-17 km away. Till 18-20 years ago, the Tata firm that owns the Valvan Dam would leave water in Indrayani river during summers. Later, they shifted focus to hydroelectricity and hence, stopped leaving water. And then began our sufferings. Its sad that people with limited income have to buy water especially when the state water policy GR states that drinking water should be given priority, says Kadam.Kadam says that though people suggest watershed as a possible solution, it doesnt have much scope at this time of the year for various reasons. Landholding capacity is less here; the area has hard rock; space for water structure treatment is not there; and instead of an even ground, the area has slopes. Thus, watershed wont yield any result here, he elaborates.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Fall in onion prices is taking a toll on farmers, despite a bumper crop this season.In a bizarre claim, a farmer has said he could earn only Re 1 from sale of nearly a tonne of onions at the district Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).According to Devidas Parbhane, 48, the fall in onion prices is already taking a toll and like him, several others have got a raw deal despite a bumper crop this season.Every day, we are hearing news about farmer suicides from drought-hit regions. However, with onion prices touching new lows, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate, said Parbhane, the sole bread-earner for his family of five.Parbhane explains the math: he has two acres of farm land in which he grew onions by spending Rs 80,000.On May 10, I sent 952 kg of onions in 18 gunny bags through a truck to the Pune-based Agriculture Produce Market Committee and received Rs 16 per 10 kg. So, per one kg, it works to one rupee and sixty paise, said Parbhane.The total onion was sold for Rs 1,523.2. Out of the earnings, the middlemen took away Rs 91.35 as commission, labour charges were Rs 59 and Rs 18.55, and Rs 33.30 was paid against miscellaneous charges. Rs 1,320 was paid to the truck driver, who transported the produce to APMC.He claimed that after all the deductions, he is taking home only Re 1. He was informed that the prices of onion had plunged drastically that particular day.I was expecting at least Rs 3 per kg. However, I was disappointed after receiving such a deal, the farmer said.For four months, I took care of my produce and watered the onions at the time of load-shedding. Forget the profit, I am unable to recover even my expenditure on growing onions.There were no comments on the farmers claim from APMC.Local media reports quoted the trader who bought the onion as saying that produce was of smaller size and inferior quality.Meanwhile, a delegation of onion traders and APMC members from Lasalgaon in Nashik has met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking his intervention on the issue of plummeting prices of onions.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."
