Thakkar was kidnapped from his onion chawl in Pimpalgaon Baswant on December 19, 2012, and an extortion demand of Rs 15 crore was made by the abductors.A local court has sentenced eight persons to life imprisonment for abducting a trader here in 2012 and acquitted three others due to lack of evidence. Sessions Judge A J Mantri at Niphad held eight of the 11 accused guilty of abducting onion trader Shankarlal Mulji Thakka in the district on December 19, 2012 and sentenced them to life imprisonment yesterday.The Judge also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 each. The remaining three accused were acquitted due to want of evidence. According to Special Public Prosecutor Ajay Misar, Thakkar was kidnapped from his onion chawl (place for storing produce) in Pimpalgaon Baswant on December 19, 2012, and an extortion demand of Rs 15 crore was made by the abductors.The accused had called Thakkars brother Karsan and the deal was sealed at Rs 5 crore. The amount was to be handed over to the abductors at Kharshinde village in Ahmednagar district, Misar said.On a tip off, a Nashik rural police squad along with Ahmednagar police laid a trap and arrested 11 persons, while Thakkar was rescued on December 20 morning.

They rose to Rs 850-900 during April-June, which would have just about covered his inputs costs, but not theexpected returns from storing the crop harvested in March.But then came the shocker. Prices, which should have gone up in the lean season, actually started falling. For the current month, the modal price  the rate at which most sales have taken place  at the Lasalgaon market has averaged Rs 421 per quintal, below even the Rs 706, Rs 829 and Rs 844 levels for the preceding three months. Ushir realised a mere Rs 210 per quintal for the five quintals that he sold last in late-August. Worse, after all that, he still has 80 quintals left to sell.Ushir has, since Tuesday morning, been on a fast unto death at the office of the Nashik district collector. He has been joined by 100 other farmers, who are doing a sit-in to draw attention to the plight of growers in this onion belt.Popat Ushir (second from left) sitting on a fast unto death at the Nashik collector office. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Popat Ushir (second from left) sitting on a fast unto death at the Nashik collector office. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)We will continue this agitation till two of our demands  a minimum support price of Rs 1,950 per quintal for onion and a subsidy of Rs 500 per quintal to farmers against their sales till rates stabilise in the open market  are met, said Santosh Gorade. This farmer, from Takali Vinchur in Niphad taluka, had stored 140 quintals from his 1.5 acres, more than half of which got rotten. The balance crop he sold mostly at Rs 250-300 per quintal, while realising a maximum rate of Rs 459 in July.This has never happened  prices in August-September being lower than in April, pointed out Bhaskar Gavali from Bramhangaon Vinchur, a village in Niphad. Farmers like him stock the rabi season onions harvested from end-March in sheds  basically on-farm structures constructed on raised platforms to prevent direct contact of the bulbs with the soil. Rabi onions, unlike the kharif (arrivals during October-November) and late-kharif (January-March) crops, are amenable to storage because of their lower moisture content. A dry, heat-protected and well-ventilated environment ensures no sprouting or rotting, while allowing farmers to realise better prices during the off-season before the kharif crops arrival.The kharif and late-kharif crops make up roughly a fifth each of Indias total onion production, with the remaining 60 per cent coming from the rabi season.Last year, the average modal price at Lasalgaon  a benchmark rate-setting market for the country  rising from Rs 1,093 per quintal in April to Rs 1,198 in May, Rs 1,554 in June and Rs 2,118 per quintal before scaling stratospheric heights of Rs 4,100-plus in August-September. It led to the Centre imposing a minimum export price (MEP) of$ 700 per tonne on August 23. As a result, exports ground to a halt. By the time the MEP was removed on December 23, prices had crashed to Rs 1,000 per quintal. And with the high prices in August-September inducing farmers to plant more area, the countrys onion production rose by 11 per cent to an estimated 210 lakh tonnes in 2015-16. Prices, then, fell instead of rising in the off-season.The average modal price for this month (Rs 421/quintal) is the lowest for September in a decade. And with the kharif crop from the South starting to arrive, prices may go still lower, predicted Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).The brunt of it is being borne by farmers. The present price will not cover even transport cost to the mandi. It is better from us to simply discard the crop and plough it back to the field, stated Gavali, who had stored 180 quintals of rabi onions from 1.2 acres, hoping for a minimum price of Rs 1,200 per quintal. Instead, the maximum rate he has realised over the last six months is Rs 850.The Centre has responded by announcing a 5 per cent export subsidy on onions, with the Maharashtra government also providing a Rs 100 per quintal grant to all farmers who sold the bulb in APMC mandis from July 1 to August 31. This will hardly help, as the markets in Nashik operated for only 24 days during this period due to the APMC traders strike. In any case, what was the point allowing just a two-month window when it is the stored onion crop that is arriving? asked Holkar.About 20,000 farmers are estimated to have sold nearly 3 lakh quintals in the Lasalgaon market during the two months, making them eligible for payments of Rs 3 crore. Back in 2008, the Maharashtra government had declared a similar subsidy of Rs 50 per quintal following a glut. However, the subsidy was given for January-March and 16,288 farmers received Rs 6.75 crore for the 13.5 lakh quintals sold during the full three-month period then.Farmers this time deserved at least Rs 500 per quintal subsidy and these should have covered sales during June-August, added Holkar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5929756a7be9e0138af8e1a0,Maharashtra: Farmers wait for government funds to build scientific warehouses,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-farmers-wait-for-government-funds-to-build-scientific-warehouses-3737981/,2016-11-05,,Indian Express,"Onions are rotting in warehouses across Maharashtra because of unscientific storage spaces and to avoid risking this, many farmers are dumping their produce wholesale in the market, causing price fluctuations. Despite this, for seven months now, the district agriculture office at Nashik has not accepted applications from onion farmers who want to avail government subsidy to build scientific storage units for their produce. Also, at least 2,100 farmers from Nashik who had applied for money under the subsidy scheme in 2015-16 have still not received it. And yet, the state government has earmarked Rs 5 crore under the scheme for 2016-17. The problem: the state has stipulated that these funds are to be disbursed only to new applicants, and the Nashik office has been told it should not accept any new applications until all earlier applicants receive their funds. A proposal to disburse the funds for this year to the 2,100 applicants from last year has not yet received a response.Maharashtra is responsible for 25-30 per cent of the total onion production in the country and 80-85 per cent of its exports. In this, Nashik contributes at least 50 per cent of the states onion output.The problem of rotting onions, and price fluctuations, is caused due to the lack of proper storage facilities available to farmers. Those which are available are unscientific and end up causing harm to the stored crop. In such spaces, the onion crop undergoes physiological loss in weight, rotting and sprouting.Thus, many farmers dump their entire harvest in the market, causing a glut. This causes wide price fluctuations creating unrest among consumers as well as farmers. As a solution, the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board had formulated a subsidy scheme for scientific onion storage. Under this scheme, at least 25 per cent of the construction cost of a scientific storage unit with capacity between 5-50 metric tonnes would be borne by the state government. The idea is that this would encourage farmers in setting up scientific onion storage systems, minimize storage losses and quality deterioration of the produce and help farmers fetch better prices.Last year in Nashik district, a total of 4,307 farmers had applied to get support under the scheme. Of these, 2,264 applicants were given help from the available funds creating 49,500 metric tonnes of scientific storage space. However, 2,100 applicants could not get the money due to lack of funds. The district agriculture office was told that until the funds are not disbursed for the 2,100 applicants, no new applications should be accepted by their office.The state government has earmarked Rs 5 crore under the scheme for 2016-17. It has stipulated that the money should be disbursed only to new applicants. District level officials said they have approached the state government to allow the funds to be given to the 2,100 applicants. We have moved a proposal seeking distribution of this years funds to last years applicants who have not received funds. However, we are yet to receive a response, said a district-level agriculture officer.Farmers say they have been left in the lurch by the authorities. We are asked to upgrade the way we undertake agriculture and when we do it, the government delays in helping out the farmers. If this is the way we look at this sector, I am afraid not many people will be interested in pursuing this profession in the long run, said Nilesh Patil, an onion farmer from Dindori.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Till recently, traders and commission agents used to charge commission from the farmers and that would be deducted from the latters final bill.

Chairman of the Lasalgaon Market Committee Nanasaheb Patil said the government agencies, including NAFED, aim to buy 15,000 metric tonne onions this season.Onion prices over the last few months have been going down due to excess production of late kharif crop. In June last year, prices of the bulb had breached the Rs 50 per kg price in wholesale with its repercussions being felt across the country. The central government had increased the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of the product in order to control the prices. Over-production of late kharif onions had sent the prices down.Although the government had reduced the MEP to zero, subsequently, price of the bulb had failed to increase. The modal price of onion at the Lasalgaon market over the last few days has been hovering around Rs 7 per kg.Patil said despite the initial scare, area and productivity of rabi onions have been good. Due to the drought, many people had uprooted their cane crops and gone for onion cultivation, especially in Ahmednagar, he said.Estimates state that the production of rabi onions would be 15-20 per cent more of the normal produce this season. Rabi onions it might be recalled are the only onions which can be stored and fed the market till the next kharif onions get ready.In view of the constant slide of the prices, NAFED had decided to increase its target of buying from Lasalgaon. Along with NAFED, other government agencies like Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB), will also participate in the purchase which will see a buffer stock being created. This will have a stabilising effect on the market, he said.The total quantum of the purchase he said would be around 15,000 metric tonnes. The state agriculture department has also taken steps to increase storage facility at the farm level also.NAFED in the past had floated tenders for construction of an air-conditioned storage facility for onion at Niphad. Although tenders were floated, Patil said the government is yet to give permission for the same.

Express photoA day before the AAP government completes one year in power in the capital, Congress Saturday released a report card on the performance of the administration and gave it zero out of 100. The partys Delhi unit chief Ajay Maken said the AAPs tenure in government has been about blame game and politics of conflict.I will give zero marks to the Kejriwal government because I cannot give it negative marks, said Maken.The Congress leader claimed Delhi had become the strike capital of the country with several thousand employees  doctors, teachers, safai karamcharis and government officials  going on strike every few months.The party also released a booklet listing the failures of the AAP government, including AAPs compromises on its own principles, continuing support to tainted MLAs, dilution of the Janlokpal bill and nepotism.The Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) has also organised a rally from Rajghat to ITO crossing to mark Chhalawa Diwas, on the one-year anniversary of the government Sunday.Maken also accused the Kejriwal government of fraud and claimed it had come out with the weakest version of the Janlokpal Bill. The AAP has become Khaap and the Aam Aadmi Party has become the Khas Aadmi Party (party for the privileged) that is promoting VIP culture, said the Congress leader.He claimed that the one year of AAPs governance was marked by scams in which several ministers of the Kejriwal-led government were implicated. The onion scam, the sugar scam, the auto permit scam, the fake degree scam these scams and the conflict with the Centre have brought development in Delhi to a standstill.

Patil, who is also on the board of directors of NAFED, said it was a welcome move as last year NAFED had taken the decision to procure onions only in March and the procurement process started in May.The prices are down this year causing great distress to farmers. The decision of bodies like NAFED to increase their procurement will hopefully help in stabilising and increasing the price of onions in the coming months, he said.Prices of the bulb at the Lasalgaon Market over the last few days have been dwindling with excess arrival plaguing the market.On Thursday, the modal price fetched at the Lasalgaon market was Rs 900 per quintal with 16,000 quintals of the bulb arriving at the market.Last year, on the same day, 22,793 quintals of onion had arrived at the market and the modal price of the bulb was Rs 1,470 per quintal. Over the last month or so, prices have dipped by over Rs 300 per quintal. The failure of the government to reduce the Minimum Export Price (MEP) in time, Patil said, has resulted in the current scenario.Harvest of rabi onions will start in the next 15 days. In all probability, NAFED will start procuring onion only in March or April. Last year, the modal price was above Rs 16 and so procurement had become costly. However, this year the prices are subdued and the increased procurement will increase the price and stop slide for rabi onions, he said.Maharashtra produces around 60 per cent of the rabi onions in the country which feeds the markets till September- October as this is the only onion which can be stored.However, the present slide, Dipak Chavan, commodity analyst with Farm Features services, said, will take a toll on the total onion production in the county. Around 20-30 per cent of rabi onion is sown in the North Indian states and the sowing activity happens quite late. The price slide in the commodity will certainly effect that sowing, he said.Chavan also said that even in rabi onions many farmers have gone for the short duration one which would be hitting the markets soon as they are perishable.The area under cultivation for non-perishable rabi onion has been hit and the effects would be be seen later during the year, he concluded.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.Mango growers in the country are planning to increase the volume of export of their produce to the United States this year. Last year, India exported 271 metric tonnes of mangoes to the US. Officials hope the figure will go up to 400 tonnes this year.Succulent Indian mangoes take a circuitous route through the countrys onion belt to head for the US. A sprawling irradiation facility set up in Lasalgaon, located 240 km north of Mumbai and approved by the United States agriculture department, treats these mangoes before they are exported.Till a decade ago, Indian mangoes had been banned from the US market for a period of 17 years over fears that pests would be imported through these mangoes.It was only in March 2006 that the then US President George W Bush during his India visit signed an agreement allowing the import of Indian mangoes to that country.India cultivates mangoes on nearly 2.2 lakh hectares and has production in the range of 19.51 million tonnes. It accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total mango production in the world. Nearly 30 varieties of mangoes are grown in India, with Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka having the highest production.Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.The major five importing countries of Indian mangoes are UAE, Bangladesh, UK, Saudi Arabia, and Nepal.Interestingly, in spite of the high returns that the US market gives, exports to that country did not look up once the ban on Indian markets was lifted.Officials at Krushi Utpadan Sanrakshan Kendra (KRUSHAK), the irradiation centre, however, said they hoped to export 400 tonnes to the US this year.The US market would fetch an exporter four times the price than to any other country. Last year, the price fetched per tonne of exports was Rs 70,360. In the US, it was Rs 2.55 lakh. It is the fear of maintaining standards that is keeping Indians away from this market. This year, we hope we will reach the 400-tonne mark to the US, said a Maharashtra State Agriculture Management Board official.The irradiation plant set up at a cost of Rs 8 crore in 2002 was initially meant to treat onions. The members of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States agriculture department had subsequently visited the plant and have a go-ahead for the facilitys compliance for mangoes too.Before 2007, Indian mangoes had for 17 years faced non-trade barriers, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary (plant health) measures, from the US, which feared pests like fruit flies and weevils could be imported through mangoes.However, this mango quarantine through irradiation has allayed the fears. During irradiation, foods are exposed briefly to a radiant energy source such as gamma rays or electron beams. This not only helps in killing harmful bacteria but also increases the shelf life of the fruit.The facility built by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has a processing capacity of 1 tonne every hour and BARC charges Rs 500 to irradiate every tonne of mango.Varieties like Alphonso are too sweet for the palate of Americans. It is Kesar that sells in those markets. A single Kesar fetches close to a dollar. However the packing, quality maintenance and paper work involved puts off most traders from approaching the US market, said Shirish Jain, a Gujarat-based exporter of Indian mangoes.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

I wont sell until they at least cross Rs 1,000, says this farmer from Sarole Thadi, a village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka just about 18 km Lasalgaon that houses Indias largest wholesale onion market.Last year, Nagare, who grows onion in one out of his total five-acre holding, realised an average rate of Rs 1,300 per quintal. But he could sell only six tonnes, as the crop itself suffered damage from unseasonal rains in March. This time, he has produced 11 tonnes, but prices are lower: If they dont improve soon, I will lose money yet again.There are many farmers like Nagare, who are unable to fathom the wild fluctuation in onion prices over the last year and more. Between April and September, the average modal price  the rate at which the maximum number of trades happen  in Lasalgaon soared from Rs 1,093 to Rs 4,130 per quintal. For a brief period, during the third week of August, they even hit Rs 5,000-5,000/quintal levels. That was, of course, the time when pyaaz was all over the newspapers and TV channels. The price spiral was partly a result of Indias onion output dropping to 189.28 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2014-15, from the preceding years 194.02 lt, and also average monthly exports of over one lt per month during January-July 2015.Share This Article Related Article Demonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangsDemonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangs As onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-insAs onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-ins As onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidyAs onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidy Price crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmersPrice crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmers The Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter storyThe Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter story Onion growers in tearsBut since December  with the arrival of the 2015-16 kharif and late-kharif crops  prices have been on a downward slope, falling below Rs 1,000 per quintal by early February. The new rabi onion crop hitting the market after harvesting during March-May has taken prices even lower; they fell to Rs 600 per quintal levels in mid-March, before recovering a tad thereafter. The resultant distress to farmers is hardly making headlines.What farmers here are unable to comprehend is how prices have crashed, that too in the midst of a drought of the kind Maharashtra is currently seeing. Rabi onion area in the state, in fact, has dipped to around 1,90,000 hectares this year, as against over 3,42,000 hectares in 2014-15. According to Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, the decline would have steeper but for some extra area being sown under the crop in Ahmednagar and Aurangabad. Towards November-end, water from the Gangapur dam in Nashik was released for Marathwada. As this water passed through Ahmednagar and Aurangabad, farmers along the canal uprooted their ratoon sugarcane and planted onion in its place, he points out.The sugar commissionerates data shows a 40 per cent acreage reduction under ratoon cane  which grows from the stubble of the harvested plant crop  this time in Maharashtra. Kashinath Sanap from Baktarpur village of Ahmednagars Kopargaon taluka is among those who decided to divert four acres of his cane area to onion. There was no water to sustain a 12-month ratoon cane crop. So, I went for rabi onion, he says. But he, too, is disappointed that the crop is selling in Kopargaon at below Rs 700 per quintal.Patil believes that the Lasalgaon market is now witnessing a heavy influx of onions from Ahmednagar and Aurangabad  which is also the reason for prices plunging. These farmers, unlike the ones in the traditional onion belt of Nashik, Pune and Dhule, have no facilities for on-field storage. So, they have no option but sell at the earliest, he notes.Farmers in the main onion belt have the capacity to hold back their crop a little longer. But even they, Patil admits, cannot expect prices to go up much, especially with onion acreages in other states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan rising significantly. The Nashik-based National Horticultural Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) has estimated this years rabi onion crop to be 15-20 per cent higher, with overall production for 2015-16 pegged at 203 lt.Rabi onions have longer shelf life and are amenable to storage. NHRDF has projected that around 45 lt of rabi onions would be stored by farmers and traders in the current marketing season due to availability of good quality bulbs. This is more than the 40 lt from last years rain and hail-damaged crop.Farmers in Nashik, Pune and Dhule alone have constructed storage capacities aggregating some 14 lt. Such on-farm structures, typically of 25-30 tonnes capacity and costing a couple of lakhs, have been built through special subsidies from NABARD and the state agriculture department. But farmers hopes of making money from stored onions, this time, have been dashed by crashing prices, for which they largely blame theCentres move to impose minimum export price (MEP) restrictions on onion. During the price surge in August, the MEP was hiked to $700 per tonne, putting a virtual halt on shipments.As domestic prices went into free fall, the MEP was eventually scrapped on December 23. But for farmers, who were harvesting their kharif onions, it was too late.Omprakash Raka, a trader-cum-exporter from Nashik, recalls that till about 6-7 years back, NAFED used to have monthly meetings with all concerned stakeholders to take regular stock of the onion supply position. These interactions allowed informed decisions, including that on MEP, to be taken. But that practice has been replaced by fixing of MEPs in an ad hoc manner, he claims. The main beneficiaries of Indias MEP restrictions have been exporters in China, Egypt and Pakistan. They have all reported good crops this year, even as India is struggling to regain its lost market share from these players.The Centre has now directed NAFED and other state agencies to procure 15,000 tonnes. NAFED is expected to start procurement from April 18, with the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board and others to wade in towards May. This, it is hoped, would help push up realisations above Rs 1,000 per quintal. But unlike last year, the chances of any price spiral seem remote.While that may be good news for urban consumers, for Maharashtras farmers this would translate into yet another cycle of losses. Santosh Gorade from Takli village in Niphad taluka has stored around 6.5 tonnes of his produce in anticipation of higher prices. He sums up the situation best: Temperatures here have already crossed 40 degrees Celsius. If they continue at this level, the bulbs will start rotting, forcing us to go for distress sale. There was no acche din for us last year and we dont see it this season as well.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Photo by Sahil Walia) The budgeted Plan outlay for the Department of Agricultural Research and Extension has barely risen from Rs 2,800 crore in FY12 to Rs 3,691 crore in FY16. (Source: Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Everyone knows Indian agriculture is in deep crisis, impacting around 115 million farmers and an equal number of landless cultivators. Two consecutive bad monsoons and falling commodity prices have resulted in the imports of edible oils and pulses touching all-time-highs, even as its exports of agri-products  from basmati rice, soya meal, sugar, milk powder and tea to guar-based products  have registered significant dips. From being an exporter of maize, we are now importing for animal feed production.How much would the Narendra Modi governments initiatives, including the recent Budget, help address the problems?Some of its new flagship programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana can certainly boost agricultural growth and farm incomes, subject to proper implementation. There are others such as the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, Rashtriya Gokul Mission (for conservation of indigenous cattle breeds) and soil and animal health cards, whose scope currently does not extend beyond general statements of noble intent apart: how these will realistically enable doubling of farmers income in five years isnt clear.On the other hand, there are some interventions showing this governments thinking to be no different from that of the previous one. As CM of Gujarat, Modi had, very rightly, criticised the then government in New Delhi for lack of cohesion and allowing individual ministries to become a law unto themselves. Unfortunately, that is precisely what is being seen today in agriculture.Under this government, there have been minimum export price restrictions on onions, stockholding limits on pulses and an order to control cotton seed prices. There is even a panel under the agriculture ministry now to decide the maximum sale price  a different kind of MSP  for cotton-seeds. This, despite the latest Economic Survey identified the order as regressive and unproductive. Also, it goes beyond the Centres mandate to fix prices under the Essential Commodities Act, by interfering with contractual agreements signed between the licensor and licensees of a technology.The Cotton Seeds Price Control Order is a manifestation of the growing hostility to technology innovations that benefit farmers directly by increasing incomes through higher crop yields  as Bt cotton has done. The same demonising of scientific endevours explains state governments turning down applications for even conducting field trials of GM crops.Such indifference, apart from reducing agricultural R&D to mere rhetoric while demoralising the countrys bioscience academia and industry, is a contrast to the of the first NDA regime under Atal Bihari Vajpayee that took a proactive step to approve Indias first biotech crop, Bt cotton, in 2002. We know how it led to Indias production rising more than two-and-a-half times.The subsequent period has largely been marked by apathy, bordering on aversion, to agricultural technology development and the private sectors role in this. Proof of it is the Seeds Bill and the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority Bill, both stuck since 2004. There is absolute lack of coordination on policy not just between the Centre and states, but even within the Centre (note the discordance between the agriculture ministry and finance ministrys Economic Survey on the desirability of the Cotton Seed Control Order). The delay in clearance for even GM mustard, a public sector product developed by Delhi University with support from the National Dairy Development Board, further confirms this absence of clarity and vision. Today, we have a massive laying-off of PhD and MSc researchers, along with skilled technicians, happening across private plant science and seed/biotech firms.The situation has been made worse by stagnant public sector investments in R&D. The budgeted Plan outlay for the Department of Agricultural Research and Extension has barely risen from Rs 2,800 crore in FY12 to Rs 3,691 crore in FY16. If one takes the Rs 3,000 crore that would actually be spent as per the revised estimates for this year, it amounts to a decline in real inflation-adjusted terms. The 2016-17 Budget has allocated Rs 3,700 crore; how much of it actually gets spent is anyones guess. This again is contrary to the Vajpayee-led NDA governments pledge to hike R&D investments to 2 per cent of GDP over five years.India cannot afford the current policy and regulatory uncertainty in farm research, which will ultimately put its food security permanently in the hands of Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Australia, Malaysia or Indonesia. A return to the pre-Green Revolution era is neither in farmer nor national interest.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Even in the dehat (rural) areas and riot victim camps, theft is the basic problem.The NHRC team that visited Kairana in July-August to investigate claims of Hindu exodus submitted a report saying that the re-settling of Muzaffarnagar riots victims here had changed the demographics of the area. It also claimed that Muslim youths tease Hindu girls in Kairana town, leaving them scared to step out of home.WATCH VIDEO: Power Struggle In Mulayams Party: Heres What People SaySuleman, 60, originally from Fugana village of Muzaffaranagar, lives in the Hassanpur Colony relief camp set up by the Jamait-e-Ulema near Bhura road in Kairana Dehat. Expressing surprise at the NHRC report, he says they barely ever visit Kairana town.My three sons crush stones all day, then we get one meal a day. None of the families in the camp could offer qurbani this Eid, neither did we have the money for even sewain. We are so busy with our own problems, how we will go tease girls, that too in Kairana town some 20 km away? In the money we would spend going there, we can cook 10 chapatis.The camp has no sanitation facility, leaving at least half the members of each family suffering from diseases, says Mohd Imran. For clean drinking water, they must either walk several kilometres, or risk the solitary handpump, he adds.Around 29,300 persons affected by the Muzaffarnagar riots are estimated to be living in 65 colonies spread across Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. Ninety percent of them are located 15-20 km from nearby towns, where the NHRC report said Hindu girls were teased. The Indian Express visited almost 20 such camps in Kairana in Shamli district, and Kandhla and Muzaffarnagar in Muzaffarnagar district.Mohammad Rafique lives just a few houses from Suleman in Hassanpur Colony, which houses around 1,200 refugees in 128 one-room pucca houses and around 80 huts. Rafique and his family of seven could only afford a straw hut.For the first time since the family was displaced in the riots, he recently held a celebration  on October 8, his daughter got married.The 54-year-old, originally from Khekhada village in Baghpat, spent the days leading to the ceremony trying to repair their dilapidated hut that had collapsed several times during the monsoon. Then he despaired about what to feed the guests. I dont have money. I earn barely Rs 100-200 a day doing labour, he says.WATCH VIDEO: Samajwadi Party Crisis Deepens: Heres How It Will Impact UP PollsRafiques daughters in-laws told him it was okay. However, tears in his eyes, Rafique says he can never pardon himself. Unko chulhe ki roti aur pyaaz hi khila paya. Beti ko ek naya joda bhi nahin de paya. Allah ko kya munh dikhaunga (I could only feed them a roti and onion; could not give my daughter one new dress. How will I answer to Allah)?At another relief camp in Kairana Dehat, Jinnat Colony, women talk about their men who recently left to search for work. They are not expected back for the next six months. Similar is the case in nearby Safa Colony. Around 600 riot displaced stay in Jinnat Colony, which has around 78 one-room houses, with no sanitation or power connection. Safa Colony has 91 houses with around 500 people.Tamanna, 10, has never been to school but likes flipping through books to look at the pictures. She sits fiddling with a ribbon as father Mohd Nadeen talks about getting her married soon. This place is not safe at all. Its actually no more than a forest, he says.Like Jinnat Colony, Ashraf Ali Colony in Kandhla with 450-500 riot victims and Aman Garden with around 90 such families, located in deserted areas, dont have electricity. Four people have died of snake bite here since 2014, says Salimuddien, from Lisaad village in Muzaffarnagar, who lives in Hamza Colony.Imtiaz Ali, who lives in Ekta Colony-1, Budhana, Muzzafarnagar, worries about the fact that his children havent gone to school for three years. Here school is too far away and I am not at home to take them and get them back. I am forced to send them to a nearby madrasa. I know they wont have a better future with this, he says.Maulana Mohammad Mustakeem, a maulana of the mosque visited by inmates of several camps near Kandhla town, says there are thefts and dacoities almost every week. There is no power in any of the camps hence they are easy targets for thieves, he says.Abul Sattar, a resident of Safa Colony, says he had begged Samajwadi Party MLA Nahid Hassan for a power connection after a snake bit his mother while she was offering namaz at sunset. She survived.Apart from the claim that Hindu women were facing harassment, the NHRC report said that due to resettlement of 25/30 thousand members of Muslim community in Karana town from Muzaffarnagar district, the demography of Kairana town has changed in favour of the Muslim community.On October 17, the National Commission of Minorities contradicted the NHRC on this, pointing out that as per the 2011 Census, Kairana, with a population of 89,000-plus, was more than 80 per cent Muslim. Kandhla similarly is nearly 70 per cent Muslim.Reiterating that Kairana town already had a Muslim majority, Wajid Hassan, Nagar Palika Chairman of Kandhla and a Samajwadi Party leader, says, Addition of 2,000 riot victims there has not made them more dominating.He adds, The declining law and order may cause people to migrate, and if so, it is the state governments job to act. But criminality does not have a religion or a community. It is disgraceful for the NHRC to communalise this alleged law and order problem in Kairana by casually pointing the finger of blame at those who are themselves victims.NHRC spokesperson Jaimini Srivastava says the commission has already submitted its report and there is nothing to say as of now.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran) Sangharsh Dongre with his father Tau Trimbak Dongre at their farm in Adhegaon village, Solapur. (Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran)Sangharsh Trimbak Dongre completed his Bachelor of Engineering from the S K N Sinhgad College of Engineering at Pandharpur in Maharashtras Solapur district in 2015. His family, which farms 12 acres at Adhegaon, a village in the rain shadow Mohol taluka of Solapur, spent Rs 7 lakh for his four-year undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering.More than a year later, the 24-year-old is yet to find a job and has gone back to farming. His sole consolation: Only one out of the 189 who passed out of my batch has managed to land a job at Tata Motors. The next batch, too, has graduated this year and they are all jobless like us.Watch what else is making newsSangharsh was among the lakhs of aspirant educated rural youth from the Maratha community who took part at a rally in Solapur on September 21. Such mammoth rallies have been taking place in towns and cities across Maharashtra all through this month. A central demand in these protests  by peaceful, but angry young men and women  has been reservation quotas for Marathas in government jobs and educational institutions.At the heart of the unrest is an agrarian crisis stalking Maharashtras rural countryside, stemming from shrinking landholdings over time and magnified by the back-to-back droughts and price crash  whether ofsugarcane, cotton and soybean or onion and milk  over the last two years. Coupled with the overall bleak jobs scenario and inability to cope with the high cost of education in private professional colleges, it has stoked discontent amongst the community that is being reflected in the spontaneous street actions now.Sangharshs engineering education  as of many others from his background who saw investment in higher professional studies as a passport for a future beyond agriculture  was financed largely by a loan of Rs 4 lakh from the State Bank of India. His younger brother, Vinayak, is doing his first year of BHMS (Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine & Surgery) at Sataras Sawkar Homeopathic Medical College, yet another private educational trust institution. The annual expenditure, at Rs 1.10 lakh, is lower than the Rs 1.50 lakh or so incurred for Sangharshs degree, though the course here is of four-and-a-half years followed by one year of internship.We chose BHMS because admission to a regular medicine (MBBS) course would have entailed donation of Rs 15-20 lakh on top of annual fees of Rs 4-5 lakh. Also, we decided not to go for any loan and fund from our own incomes and savings, says Sangharsh. That hasnt been easy for the family of four  including his father Tau Trimbak Dongre and mother Savita  exclusively reliant on agriculture.Till 2012, Sangharshs father grew sugarcane before shifting to pomegranate due to uncertain availability of irrigation water. Our average net yearly income has been Rs 2.5-3 lakh. The last two years have been particularly bad because of the monsoon totally failing. Although pomegranate requires less water compared to sugarcane, we have had to use tanker water for irrigation even in this case, complains Sangharsh.The familys agricultural woes, combined with the zero returns from investment in an engineering degree, have been an obvious source of frustration. All through this difficult period, Sangharsh has kept touch with his erstwhile college colleagues through a WhatsApp group, which they use to exchange notes and information on prospective job openings. Hes also part of a separate 250-member group linked to the ongoing pan-Maharashtra Maratha protests.Sangharsh relates to both the key demands expressed in the protests: Scrapping the SC & ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (which is used to harass ordinary farmers like my father), and reservations for Marathas in government educational institutions (how can we afford expensive private education with the meagre income generated from our farms?).At every rally  from Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur to Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Nanded, Hingoli, Buldhana and Amravati  the emotive plank that has united rural Marathas is reservation. The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), the organisation spearheading the massive muk or silent marches, has sought to highlight the economic backwardness of the community, even though it is considered socially forward by virtue of owning much of the agricultural land in Maharashtra.We constitute a third of the states population, but three-fourths of our people are still engaged in farming where incomes are uncertain. Investment in education is the only way to secure the future of our children. That is, however, beyond the means of most rural households, points out Sachin Gaikwad, an MKM activist and sports director at the Brahmdevdada Mane Institute of Technology in Solapur.Bhanumati Pawar, who was present at the rally in Nanded where the women outnumbered men, is most concerned about the high cost of private education. If my son gets admission in any private engineering college, the minimum fees would be Rs 1.5 lakh a year. If he can secure a seat through quota in a government institution, our financial burden will reduce considerably, observes this 45-year-old, who cultivates 10 acres at a village in the outskirts of Nanded.The irony is that many of the private education institutions dotting the state are promoted by Maratha politicians, mainly from the Opposition Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Prominent names include D Y Patil, Patangrao Kadam, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Rajesh Tope and Balasaheb Thorat, each of them controlling education trusts or deemed universities running a chain of engineering, medical, pharmacy, management and other professional course colleges.These institutions were originally the offshoots of cooperative sugar mills, dairies and banks that came up across rural Maharashtra from the mid-fifties to the eighties. The founders were mostly grassroots Maratha leaders, who used the cooperatives both as vehicles for development of their regions and also for furthering their political interests. Education was an extension activity, which unfortunately degenerated into a money-making business. The public trusts that many of these leaders created effectively become private family-controlled institutions, admits a former NCP minister, who himself controls one such cooperative-cum-educational empire near Pune.The politically dominant Maratha leaders well-versed with agricultural issues are themselves responsible for the backwardness of our community, alleges Ashok Prataprao Patil, a farmer from Chakur in Latur district.According to official data, Maharashtra has 19 government and government-aided engineering institutions with an annual student intake capacity of 6,097. On the other hand, there are as many as 348 such unaided (private) institutions with an aggregate intake capacity of 1,47,770. The picture is practically the same in every other technical stream, barring medicine where the private sector has comparatively less presence.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena administration has been sympathetic to the Marathas demand for reservations both in education and jobs. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has declared his governments commitment to grant reservation to the community, while noting that the students from rural areas are restless, as they cannot afford the higher fees in private colleges.At the same time, though, Fadnavis has drawn attention to the fact that even a 16 per cent quota in government engineering institutions would translate into just over 900 seats. Equal, if not more, emphasis should be laid on skill development and providing new avenues for employment in rural-based industries. The state government is working on a scheme for skill development linked to the setting up of district-level hubs for textile, food-processing and allied industries. The proposed project also aims at roping in private partners for training of rural youth, who can find employment in the units that would come up in these hubs.That, of course, is a more durable solution to a problem with both short- and long-term implications.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

President of a farmer-producer company, a festive Diwali seemed around the corner for his group of farmers cultivating nearly 1,000 acres of moong (green gram) and urad (black gram).But towards end-September, the water body not far from their village adjoining the Kada Medium Irrigation Project suddenly filled up to 40 per cent capacity, after having been practically bone dry for months. I knew something was wrong, says this progressive farmer in his 40s, who uses every available agro-met service to plan his cropping schedule.WATCH VIDEO|Fortunately, it was raining heavily in just the five-km area around the Kada project, covering Dadegaon and nearby villages. Garjes group managed to harvest their urad and moong crops in the nick of time. But just a few days later, his own onion crop got washed away. Other group members similarly saw their soyabean crops suffer severe damage from the torrential rains through the first week of October. Small patches of bajra (pearl millet) and cotton were also destroyed.Shock after repeated tragedies is how Amol Jadhav, a local journalist and a farmer himself from Kaij in Beed, describes the latest setback. After consecutive drought years that crippled the rural economyof Marathwada  impoverishing even relatively better-off agricultural households  it is the excess rains from the withdrawing southwest monsoon that has caused heavy losses for many farmers of the region this time.Marathwada received 824.8 mm of rainfall during June-September, over a fifth higher than its normal quota of 682.9 mm for the four-month monsoon season. And it hasnt stooped raining even after September 30. During October 1-12, Latur district has recorded 200 per cent excess precipitation, with these at 197 per cent for Hingoli, 172 per cent for Nanded, 171 per cent for Beed and 159 per cent for Osmanabad. The regions other three districts  Jalna (111 per cent), Parbhani (104 per cent) and Aurangabad (73 per cent)  have also registered above-normal rains so far this month, even if not to the same extent.In all, out of the 76 talukas in the Marathwada region, 23 have already received more than 125 per cent of their total average annual rainfall quota. And significant part of these rains have come since the last week of September  just when the standing kharif crop has been due for harvesting or closer to maturity. The contrast with the situation just a few months back  when the Maharashtra government pressed in a record number of water tankers for the parched regions villages and towns  couldnt have been starker. This time, an estimated 3,800 villages of Marathwada have been affected by excess rains, as opposed to its 9,000 villages that were declared drought-hit earlier in the year.According to initial estimates made by district collectors, crops worth more than Rs 500 crore have been damaged in Latur, Beed and Osmanabad alone. That figure is likely to go up with more detailed village-level surveys. An early assessment has pegged the total crop loss across Marathwada at 9,15,431 hectares, out of the 49 lakh hectares area that was planted to crops during the current kharif season. Latur has been the worst hit, accounting for nearly 3,94,000 hectares of the regions total affected farmland. In Beed, as much as 3,68,000 hectares out of the districts 7,98,000 hectares of agricultural land have officially sustained crop damage.Soyabean has been almost wiped out. Out of the 2,40,000 hectares that was sown under the crop, approximately 2,05,000 hectares has been washed away or damaged, said Beed district collector Naval Kishore Ram. Soyabean, which has become increasingly popular among Marathwadas farmers over the past decade, is a light plant particularly prone to losses from either water-logging or extreme dryness.Besides soyabean, another one lakh hectares under Bt cotton has also been affected in Beed. Areas such Patoda and Majalgaon with fields on the banks of the Sindphana and Bindusara  tributaries of the Godavari  are reported to have suffered damage extending to all crops, including soyabean, cotton, tur (pigeon-pea), moong and urad.While soyabean has been the worst-affected, farmers say that even the cotton bolls have been soaked and damaged, while tur in many places has witnessed sprouting of the grains. An assessment of damage from fungal infections is also still underway.The India Meteorological Departments rainfall map depicting the south monsoons performance for the whole season has shown only four sub-divisions in the country to have received excess rains this time. Marathwada is among the four  a rare occurrence for a region that has experienced deficit monsoon in three out of the preceding four years.This year, it has rained so much that six of the 18 floodgates on the Dhanegaon dam across the Manjara River had to be opened. Farmlands across one km of either bank in Beeds Kaij and Ambajogai talukas and in several places of Latur are still water-logged. The same Dhanegaon dam ran dry early this summer, necessitating a dramatic supply of drinking water to Latur city via railway wagons. Latur municipality, then, was in a position to supply water only once a month.But wouldnt these excess rains be of help at least in the coming rabi season? Garje isnt optimistic even about that: One in every four or five farmers is facing problems of severe erosion of their soils from the latest rains. That will make field preparation for the next crop challenging. In some areas, the flooded farmland is too soggy for farmers to even enter the fields for any kind of land preparation for sowing, according to Garje.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Twenty kg of rice, 10 kg of wheat and 2 kg of pulses. Sugar, oil, potatoes, tomatoes and onions, and candles. A visit by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat (on Tuesday) and announcement of Rs 10 lakh in compensation. That was an official at the office of the District Magistrate in Bageshwar, listing what Sohan Rams family  his father, wife and two children  is getting as compensation.On October 5, Dalit labourer Ram was killed, allegedly by a government school teacher from the upper-caste Thakur community, who hurled casteist slurs before cutting his throat with a sickle, for entering and defiling a flour mill in Kadaria village.The accused, Lalit Karnatak, was arrested the next day but his brother and father, who have been accused of threatening Rams family against filing a complaint, are absconding. It took two more days for the promised rations to reach Rams family, after the case was reported by local media. But on Monday, with the brutal killing triggering protests in Dehradun and Bageshwar, and the assembly elections scheduled next year, the state government has sprung into action.All efforts are on to nab the other accused, said Bageshwar SP, Sukhbeer Singh, even as district officials and police officers spent most of Monday preparing for Rawats visit. An empty field was being prepared as a helipad, with about 200 police personnel asked to report to the village on Tuesday.The sudden rush for damage-control also led to a bizarre situation. After the Chief Ministers visit was confirmed on Monday, officials at the DMs office inquired about the financial status of Rams widow to facilitate the cash compensation  only to realise that she didnt have a bank account.The Bahujan Samaj Party, meanwhile, has called for a Jan Akrosh rally on Wednesday to protest the killing. We will not let this issue die. Cases of caste-based discrimination are growing and have become a problem in Bageshwar. Karnataks father and brother, who threatened Rams family, are still absconding. We are expecting 2,500 people at the rally, said Sundar Kumar Syunewal, district head, BSP.According to the 2001 census, Bageshwar district has the highest proportion of Scheduled Castes  25.9 per cent  in Uttarakhand. According to local leaders and officials, a few cases of caste discrimination and violence have been reported from the area but such brutality is not common.The National Crime Records Bureau report for 2015 says that crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes grew by 59 per cent in Uttarakhand between 2014 and 2015. While 62 cases were reported in 2014, this number grew to 93 in 2015.This year, conflict over caste-based discrimination in Uttarakhand flared up four months ago, when Dalit leader Daulat Kunwar and BJP MP Tarun Vijay raised the issue of entry of Dalits in temples in the state. Kunwar and Vijay had entered the Silgur Devta Temple near Dehradun in May, following which the priests carried out a nine-day long cleansing ceremony.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express At present, Nashiks Lasalgaon is the largest onion market in the country. ExpressIn what can be termed as the second phase of agricultural reforms in Maharashtra, the state government has decided to start a terminal market in Aurangabad. Maharashtra Minister of Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh Thursday announced that the state government would also establish the first-ever special commodities market for onions at Solapur soon. By definition, terminal markets sit at the top of the markets and has special facilities for grading and separating of agricultural commodities. Such terminal markets are expected to cater to export, domestic, wholesale as well as retail markets.Termed as zero garbage market, the basic difference between normal markets and these markets is that the latter are called zero garbage markets  no wastage  as goods enter the market sorted and graded.The terminal market in Sambhajinagar (Aurangabad) would be constructed in a private-public-participation (PPP) mode and would be established over 50 acres of the market committee, he said. Deshumkh said the tender process and bidding would start soon and the project would be completed at war footing.On paper, export-oriented terminal markets bring in good handling and business practices in the field of agricultural goods. With its insistence on grading and packing, wastage is minimised. These markets are mostly run on the hub-and-spoke model and executed in a public-private-partnership mode. The proposed market in Aurangabad would be the fourth such market being planned in the state. A few years ago, the state government had planned for three such markets in Mumbai, Nagpur and Nashik but none of the projects has seen the light of the day.All three previous markets had faced land issues which had acted as the major impediment towards them being set up.The Mumbai market was to be set up over 100 acres and was budgeted at Rs 250 crore. However, the land allocated to the market was confiscated by the revenue officials on grounds of legal technicalities and the matter is pending before the Thane additional collector.Similarly, the Nashik market was to be set up over 60 acres at a cost of Rs 60 crore and the Nagpur market was to be set up over 100 acres at Rs 50 crore. Both Nashik and Nagpur faced issues over land and failed to take off.Special commodities market is a market which caters to a single commodity (in the case of the one being planned at Solapur, it is onion) and provides various infrastructure and technology to promote both export and domestic trade.Nashiks Lasalgaon market is the largest onion market in the country, Deshmukh said, adding the Solapur district also had a strong onion growing belt and the government wished to develop the same. Annually, Solapur market sees a trade of over 45 lakh tonnes in onions.Dilip Mane, the chairman of the Solapur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), however, expressed doubts about the viability of the project. The existing trade itself is in jeopardy any new market will find it difficult to take off, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Kharif onions are planted between May and July and the harvesting is done after September. Kharif, late kharif and rabi are the three major onion seasons round the year. Kharif onions are planted between May and July and the harvesting is done after September.After a bumper crop last year, onion sowing has reduced significantly across the country this year. Estimates show that this year, kharif onion production will be around 60 per cent of its normal production. Drought and consistent low prices of the bulb over the past few months are said to be the main reasons for this dip in the major kharif onion growing states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Kharif, late kharif and rabi are the three major onion seasons round the year. Kharif onions are planted between May and July and the harvesting is done after September. On an average, 2 lakh hectares come under kharif onion production, annually, in these three states and that includes 1 lakh hectares in Maharashtra alone.This year, a reduction of around 40 per cent in onion sowing area in the state would subsequently result in a dip in production in the months to come. The monsoon has picked up across the country, but lack of rainfall in June seems to be the major reason for this dip.In Maharashtra, the state government had issued advisories to the farmers and asked them not to start sowing till soil moisture content was 30-40 per cent. This, many say, has resulted in a drastic drop in the sowing area.Also high prices of maize, soyabean, pulses and vegetables has seen farmers using their farmland to grow these crops, instead of onions. Area under pulse production, in fact, has grown by 46 per cent in the state and many onion farmers have opted to grow pulses due to the good prices.Over the past five to six months, the onion trade has been going through a sustained slump with prices at an all-time low. This, despite a long period of drought which had actually seen a reduction in onion area at least in Maharashtra. Over the last month or so, onion trade in the Nashik district has been in the doldrums due to the ongoing strife between traders and the market committee.However, chances of an immediate price rise seems to be remote given the carry forward stock of onion the country has to deal with.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express Lasalgaon, Asias largest onion market, has seen a steady fall in the prices in the last few days. ExpressOVER A month after the central government decided to slash the minimum export price (MEP) of onion to zero, prices of the bulb have started hitting rock bottom across major market yards in the state. Increased arrival and limited avenues for sales has pushed the prices down. Market watchers say it would continue to remain so for the next fortnight or so.On Saturday, the modal price fetched by the bulb at the Lasalgaon market  the largest onion market in the state  was Rs 1100 per quintal. A total of 20,940 quintals of onions arrived at the market. A year ago on January 30, 2015, the modal price at Lasalgaon was Rs 1375 per quintal and 16,269 quintals arrived at the market.Manmad, another major onion market in Nashik district, saw 12,000 quintals of onions arriving and the modal price of the commodity was Rs 950 per quintal. The market at Manmad a year back had seen 11,472 quintals of onions arrive and the modal price of the bulb was Rs 1275 per quintal. In accordance with the trend at the wholesale markets, the retail markets have also seen a price correction of onion.Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri Vegetable Market, said the price of onion over the last few weeks had been between Rs 10-15 per kg. The arrival has increased, so prices have fallen, he said.The dip in the prices of onion comes at a time when the arrival of the late kharif crop is in full swing across market committees in the state and the country. Harvested between December and January, the late kharif crop feeds the market till the arrival of the rabi onion in March  April. This year, the state has seen a record sowing of onion on over 3 lakh hectares and the productivity is also supposed to be record breaking.Last month, the central government had decided to reduce the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions to zero to stop the price slide. December had seen the MEP being corrected twice before that. The central government had reduced the MEP to $400.However, the price slide now shows that slashing of MEP to 0 has no effect on the market. Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of the Lasalgaon Market committee, said that the governments decision came too late. There were reports of record sowing and a bumper crop was expected. MEP should have been reduced right at the start of the season. With arrival slated to remain high over the next fortnight, we do not expect any price rise in the markets, he said. Patil also said that the size of area of sowing rabi onions had increased. In Ahmednagar, Patil said, many farmers had decided to grow onions instead of cane. Water being a scarce commodity, onion cultivation has more appeal for farmers than cane. The summer crop of onion would be good this time, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

She is worried that the school has not begun even the first chapter in science with barely three months to go.Vijay Namdeo, preparing for his XII board exams, is struggling with mathematics, as is every other student who has chosen that subject. The school has no teacher for mathematics in class-XII.The ashram shala, or tribal school, in this Naxal-hit district houses some 175 students from classes I to XII. The Maharashtra tribal welfare department has set aside a budget of Rs 1,200 crore for ashram shalas, which are a prominent feature of an integrated tribal policy that the government is working on. Officials said they are providing every possible facility from a central kitchen to uniform and books.There will be no shortage of funds when it comes to providing the best facilities to tribal students, said Minister for Tribal Welfare Vishnu Sawara.However, a senior secretary conceded, mismanagement in tribal residential schools is a fact despite huge funds having been set aside for their functioning. And the reason they are so short of teachers is apparently that qualified teachers are rarely willing to stay in these schools for very long.School authorities at Permili were not willing to come on record. We have good basic infrastructure, said a senior official involved in the management of the school. But the biggest problem is to get teachers who would come regularly and take lessons. The standard of teachers and continuity in covering all subjects has always been a problem here.The Permili school is one of 529 ashram shalas across Maharashtra, aimed at bringing tribal children to mainstream education.Permili is a little village dotted with bamboo and grass huts. The school stands out as a sprawling concrete cement structure. Students come from the interiors of the Naxal belt  Sironcha, Allapalli, Gadchiroli.At the centre of the residential school is a playground. Kanchan Pilvatre of class-VI said food is not a problem. Lunch comprises rice, roti and curry; evening tea includes puffed rice cooked with onions and potatoes along with cooked gram, and dinner is again roti, curry and rice. But what we want is regular lessons, said one girl.Subhash Nana Atram of class-XII said, We have only two teachers, who come and teach Marathi and biology. We have lodged complaints as science students find it difficult to handle physics, chemistry and mathematics.

(Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform.
