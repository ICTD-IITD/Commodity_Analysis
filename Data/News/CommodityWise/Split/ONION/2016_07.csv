His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

In October, it was 3.39%.Food prices went up 1.54% from a year earlier, following a 4.34 percent rise in the preceding month. Among food prices, potatoes recorded the highest rise (37%), followed by pulses (21.7%). In contrast, prices declined for onion (-51.5%) and vegetables (-24%).Cost of manufactured products increased by 3.2%, compared to a 2.7% rise in the previous month.The WPI inflation for September has also been revised upwards at 3.8% against the provisional estimate of 3.57%.Wholesale rates, measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), indicates the annual rate of price rise in bulk buys for traders reflecting the.Retail inflation, announced on Tuesday, too dropped to a two year low of 3.63% reflecting lower consumer demand.Industry body Assocham said that the fall in WPI numbers was in tandem with the expectations and was due to the depressive state in the Indian economy owing to the demonetisation announcement."

As 2016 comes to a close, we analysed the status of these five problems, and challenges that will continue in 2017.1. Agriculture recovers, but benefits uncertain after demonetisationOver the fiscal year 2016-17, agriculturewhich employs more than 700 million peoplewill grow by 4%, estimated CRISIL, a research agency.Recovering from twoand some places even threeconsecutive drought years, agriculture, for the first time since 2013, saw a growth of above 3% in the second quarter of 2016-17, over the same period in 2015-16.Record summer crop production of rice, at 93.8 million tonnes, and pulses, at 8.7 million tonnes, is estimated in 2016-17, according to advance estimates by the agriculture ministry.Source: Key Economic Indicators, Office of the Economic AdvisorBut the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016 has been a setback to the rural economyon which 800 million people, or 65% of Indias population, dependlargely driven by cash.Vehicles entering a rural market yard in Maharashtra dropped, onion prices halved in the biggest onion market in the country, the fishing economy in Goa faced roadblocks, and flower farmers in Madhya Pradesh lost business, as IndiaSpends visit to these regions revealed.Read | Farmers forced to dump their produce as note ban turns bumper crop worthlessSimilar reports from Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and other parts of the country appear to have dampened the bright agricultural prospects of 2016. But there is hope that cash pressures will ease in the long term, and the rural economy will be back to normal, according to a Livemint report.2. Good monsoon; India signs climate change agreement; India has half of the worlds 20 cities with the most toxic airFrom a severe drought in 11 states in June just before the arrival of the monsoon, Indiabarring Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Keralareceived normal rains in 2016. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra received 20% more rain than normal.Overall, rainfall patterns have become more irregular over the last decade. Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasingas a part of complex changes in local and world weatheraccording to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2016.Read | 116 farmers committed suicide in 2016; 10 states reeling under droughtIn 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise of the earths temperature to under two degrees Celsius by the year 2100.India also signed a legally binding international agreement, starting 2028, to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)gases that can have global warming potential up to 12,000 times more than carbon dioxide (CO2)as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.Still, India will have to do more to prepare itself for the effects of climate change in the future. Between 2030 and 2050, a study, conducted by the University of Oxford, projected 136,000 climate-related deaths in India, according to an answer given by the environment ministry in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).Even as CO2 concentration levels in the world breached 400 parts per million, levels that will last our lifetime, thick smog engulfed the nations capital and other northern states, with the concentration of toxic particles reaching up to 45 times above safe levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).Between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with a population above 14 million, Delhis ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of 2016 WHO data. Indian cities make-up half of the worlds 20 most toxic cities, according to data from the WHO.3. India still home to 40 million stunted children, largest number in the worldEven with declining child undernourishment rates, India is home to over 40 million stunted children under five, more than any other country in the world, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Stunting refers to low height for age.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaIndia ranks 120 out of 130 countries in prevalence of wasting (15.1%), or low weight for height, according to the 2016 Global Nutrition Report, which ranks countries from lowest to highest prevalence.At current rates of decline in malnutrition, Indiacurrently lagging behind several poorer African countrieswill achieve the current stunting rates of Ghana or Togo by 2030, and that of China by 2055, stated the report.India also does poorly on indicators that could help reduce malnutrition.For instance, there is a link between improved health of the mother and lower stunting prevalence in children under five, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. States such as Goa and Kerala, with 99% of institutional deliveries, had amongst the lowest levels of stunting in the country. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, states that have some of the highest levels of stunting, have just about 65% institutional deliveries.Improved sanitation also impacts the health of children, as seen in the state of Mizoram, which reported a 13% decline in wasting prevalence and 5% decline in underweight children in ten years, when there was a 10% improvement in household access to a toilet, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Still, there are 93.1 million households in rural India without access to a toilet.4. Education budget rose 4.8%, but millions are dropping out before secondary schoolLast year, we wrote about how India had reduced its education budget, even though the country has 282 million illiterate peopleequivalent to the population of Indonesiaand 18% of those who went to school were unable to complete secondary school.Read | Secondary education will empower India in the 21st centuryFor the financial year 2016-17, the central government budgeted Rs 72,394 crore on school education, higher education and adult literacy programmesa rise of 4.8% over 2015-16.Still, the 2016-17 budget amount is 12.5% less than the 2014-15 budget estimate, according to budget data. The government spent 16% less than the original budgeted amount of Rs 82,771 crore in 2014-15.Source: Union Budget, Ministry of FinanceFurther, challenges of retaining students in school remain, putting Indias large working population860 million by 2020at risk, IndiaSpend reported in May 2016.Net enrolment in primary education, the number of primary age school children enrolled in school, as a proportion of the total primary school age population, remained constant: 87.3% in 2015-16 compared to 87.4% in 2014-15, according to District Information System for Education data.Enrolment in secondary schools rose slightly, from 48.5% to 51.3%, which suggests that many students drop out before secondary schoolthat is, grade nine.Even fewer32.3%enrolled in higher secondaryclass 11 or its equivalentin 2015-16.5. Growth likely to be muted; opinion dividedTrade and growth forecasts for 2016 were lower than that of 2015, while declining wholesale inflation was not being passed to consumers, IndiaSpend had reported in December 2015.The move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, 2016, is likely to slow down economic activity in 2017, but some experts say claims are exaggerated.Gross value added (GVA) growth for the financial year 2016-17 has been revised to 7.1% from the earlier estimate of 7.6% due to demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement issued on December 7, 2016. Demonetisation is expected to affect cash-intensive sectors such as retail and transportation and reduce demand due to adverse wealth effects.Ambit Capital, a financial services firm, slashed its growth projection for the current year by 330 basis points to 3.5, BloombergQuint reported on December 19, 2016.Now heres the other side: Economists are talking nonsense on GDP decline, Aditya Puri, managing director of HDFC Bank, told Business Standard on November 30, 2016.Consumer inflation is expected to remain in single digits (5% in December 2016-March 2017 quarter), but there is a risk it could increase, the RBI said, due to volatility in global crude oil prices, increased turbulence in financial markets and the effects of demonetisation.This story first appeared on Indiaspend.

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read |After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less. People are poor and earn very little, there is not even one ATM here, there is electricity for only a few hours in a day, and infrastructure is in shambles, said Aashiq Hussain, a government employee. And do you think we can do e-transactions when the mobile internet network is so weak in the village? he added.Consequently, the local grocer, chemist, tailor and gas cylinder seller are all using cash in their daily transactions.Khokh, PunjabNek Singh, who sells seeds and saplings  from potatoes to tomatoes, chillies and onions has not had a change of heart.Few weeks ago, the owner of the sprawling nursery had been critical of note-bandi. Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat. Business is picking up once again, though one manufacturer said sales were still down. As against the normal sale of 1,000 kg a month, I now sell 500 kg, he said.Though the papad maker has survived, two of his staff were not as lucky. They were laid off and are currently unemployed.Bastar, ChhattisgarhThough dirt poor, the tribals of the region dreaded the demonetisation effect. Everyone in the region expected a fresh wave of extortion by Maoists seeking to replenish their coffers depleted by the banning of high-value currency.The fear still persists though the extortion hasnt begun yet.

The blockade of NH2 and NH37  the two lifelines of the state  by the United Naga Council (UNC) in protest against the creation of several new districts is still in place. The supplies brought in by the trucks are likely to ease the situation for a few days, but there is widespread fear that Manipur will slide back into hard times again.Read | Medical emergency in Manipur: 57-day blockade cripples health servicesScarcity of essentials has become a way of life, said a resident of Manipur, witnesses to protracted blockades enforced by different outfits even in the past.Manipur relies on other states for supply of most of its essential needs. But due to the blockade, no trucks had reached the state since December 12.I was stranded at Jiribam over seven days. There was nothing to do and we were uncertain what to do because of the blockade, said Tapas Nath, who brought a truckload of potatoes from West Bengal.Usually it takes just three days for him to cover the distance from Dhupguri in West Bengal to Manipurs capital. This time it took him 10 days. He hopes to return back safely soon, with police escort.The blockade by the UNC against the creation of new districts which it alleges benefits other communities at the cost of Nagas has seen residents scurrying for essentials such as petrol and vegetables. Prices of most items in short supply have skyrocketed.Petrol pumps across the capital have been closed for weeks. The scarcity has spawned a thriving backmarket. The going rate of one litre of petrol, which had reached nearly Rs 300 few days back, is Rs 140 these days.Taking advantage of the gap between the demand and supply of fuel, people have started selling petrol and diesel in black.We received our last supply of fuel several weeks ago. There was such a huge rush of customers that we ran out of petrol and diesel in a couple of hours, said Bikash Thapa of United Brothers filling station at Chinmeirong West.To fill the demand and supply gap ,theres jugaad. Women with plastic drinking water bottles filled with petrol and diesel can be seen doing brisk business on the streets.Most of the petrol available in black market is adulterated. One needs to have good contacts to get pure petrol or diesel, but the price could be a bit higher that the market rates, said Norendra Singh, a taxi driver.Some residents say due to the ongoing scarcity, petrol and diesel are also being smuggled in from Myanmar through the Moreh border, located 110 km away from Imphal.The petrol and diesel coming from Myanmar has a lighter tinge than the ones we usually get in petrol pumps here. We buy whatever we get as theres no choice, said L. Bikram, an auto-rickshaw owner.While petrol and diesel can be purchased at premium, the bigger problem many households are facing is due to the non-availability of LPG cylinders to run kitchens.One LPG cylinder can cost Rs 2000 and more on the black market. It has become difficult to manage day to day affairs at home because of the blockade, complained Sarojini Devi, a housewife at Chinmeirong East.Prices of vegetables like potatoes and onions and cereals and pulses have more than doubled since the blockade began, forcing many households to cut down on their expenses.Travelling both inside and outside the state have also turned into an ordeal. Passenger buses from Imphal to other important towns in Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland have stopped operating from November 29 due to the blockade.Nearly 20 buses carrying passengers to other states used to leave Imphal daily, prior to the blockade. Our business has been the worst hit, said Romeo Singh, an Imphal agent of Guwahati-based Network Travels.The situation is expected to ease for the next few days with the arrival of the trucks filled with goods.

After selling Tutor Vista to UK-based Pearsons for 700 crore in 2011, he and his wife started Growth Story, a platform that scouts for ideas and enables entrepreneurs to become successful. They also launched Portea Medical and online jewellery platform Bluestone.We get the idea, get the founders together, get the money to start the company, and handhold them through the initial days, says Ganesh.E-grocery was an idea Ganesh thought six years ago, and started BigBasket. There were already 26 players in the space (However, most of them have shut shops since then).Unlike most of BigBaskets competitors, Ganesh knew online grocery was not just getting shopkeepers on the platform and delivering products. To run the business, you need people with deep domain knowledge of grocery.So he handpicked the team that launched Fabmall and FabMart, which was acquired by Aditya Birla More. It took Ganesh three months to convince the five founders  Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, VS Ramesh, VS Sudhakar and Abhinay Choudhari  to run BigBasket.I wouldnt have done this if it was not for this team, says Ganesh, who is also the promoter of BigBasket.Ganesh also knew it was important to raise some early money. BigBasket raised $10 million in series A funding from private equity player Ascent Capital. Most of the others couldnt raise that much amount of capital.BigBasket does around 50,000 orders a day and has 2.5 million active customers, most of whom do three to four transactions a month. It is on its way to achieve a gross merchandise value (GMV) (the total number of goods and services sold on e-commerce platform excluding discounts and promotions) of 1,800 crore. Its nearest competitor, though the numbers arent available, would be half its size, according to estimates.In the initial days, BigBasket got its products from METRO Cash & Carry and HyperCity. It gave the company some scale, but only 60% of the order basket was filled (Which means customers did not find four out of every 10 products).It was then that the founders  Ganesh calls them maniacs of execution  knew it was time to build the supply chain, get the products into warehouses, ensure that fill rates (the fraction of customer demand that is met through immediate stock availability, without back orders) go up. Only then, the business could be sustained.Others thought keeping inventory was a cost... We did it from early days. From the beginning, we bought fresh foods and staples. For other items we used METRO, says Vipul Parekh, co-founder, BigBasket.But soon, Parekh and the other founders realised that it was important to build the supply chain further. They went to farmers and procured directly from them, which saved the cost of middlemen. It also kept prices lower than the neighbourhood vendor.Currently BigBasket procures 70% of all its fruits and vegetables from farmers. The category contributes 45% to the companys sales.Buying vegetables online was a big shift, and a challenge. Buyers like to see and check fruits and vegetables before buying, which wasnt possible on an online platform. Parekh and his team had to understand the ripeness of the fruits like bananas and mangoes. Now, we have size, shape and ripeness index for every fruit and vegetable, says Parekh.Onions come from Nasik, apples from Himachal. The company has 25 collection centres near farms. It has engaged agronomists to help farmers produce fruits and vegetables.Meanwhile, while BigBasket built its supply chain, others started lagging. PepperTap, funded by Snapdeal, shut shop. LocalBanya and others failed to raise money. Grofers, BigBaskets biggest rival, closed operations in nine locations.Our understanding of the offline grocery market came handy the fallouts were a set of indications that we were doing the right thing, says Parekh.Basket fill rates are at 99.6%. But returns are as low at 1.2%  the e-commerce industry average is 15% to 20%, depending on the category. On-time delivery is 98.5%. Parekh wants to take it to 99.5% in 2017.While getting the scale helped BigBasket get contracts with large consumer goods companies, including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle, Parekh and his team knew that the money was in private labels, and food and grocery.Already, 40% of BigBaskets business comes from private label, and Parekh hopes to take it to 45% next year. Margins are 6% to 15% higher in private labels  in products, such as honey, snacks, stationary, fruits and vegetables, and staples. Private labels, apart from fruits and vegetables, bring in 15% of its revenues.The company has also increased its total stock-keeping units (unique number of products) to 22,000. Even a large-format store like Big Bazaar has 10,000-12,000.But theres a new competitor doing the rounds. Amazon has started delivering groceries in eight cities. But Parekh is not worried. We have very low marketshare in each city we are present in We want to become the biggest grocer in each of the 25 cities, he says.Meanwhile, the company has also launched a wholesale vertical to supply to hotels, restaurants and caterers. The business is called Horeca. We will eventually sell them (private labels) to retailers, says Parekh."

Chouhan is the convenor of the committee, which will set common goals to pursue by the BJP-ruled states in a time-bound manner to ensure benefits of government schemes and will submit a report to BJP national president Amit Shah.Speaking to the media before the second meeting of the committee, Sahasrabuddhe said they will discuss various issues concerning welfare of poor and poverty alleviation. We will discuss issues like housing for all, education of poor, healthcare, employment avenues and ways to double the income of the farmers, he saidSahasrabuddhe said they will also deliberate on strengthening the scope and implementation of the governments pro-poor welfare schemes.We have discussed many of these already. But now it will be more focused. The outcome will be presented to party president Amit Shah as a draft, he said.People getting free stuff not healthy custom in the long runVinay Sahasrabuddhe on Monday said people getting used to getting free stuff is not healthy a tradition in the long run, stressing that the government is committed to long-term welfare schemes, which focus on empowering citizens and making them self reliant.During an informal interaction with the media, Sahasrabuddhe, when asked to comment on BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiyas recent statement on how good leaders focus on long-term public welfare schemes, said the government at times has to go for populist schemes like providing relief to farmers when they are in distress or during natural disasters. However, he added that barring these exceptional circumstances, the norm of a good governance is empowering people.If Kailash Vijayvargiya says something about some officials, it doesnt mean he is targeting the government. I have not come across his statement. We take his views in the right spirit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes in the empowerment of people. Our countrymen have a strong sense of self respect; they dont like to have free stuff all the time. People want to work hard and earn their livelihood with self respect, Sahasrabuddhe said.But we cannot have same standard for all schemes. We cant afford to go to extremes. At times, when people are in a difficult situation like a natural disaster, the government has to provide them relief by providing them free stuff, he said.Vijayvargiyas statement holds significance as chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has taken many populist decisions this year, including the buying over 10 lakh quintals of onions from farmers. Meanwhile, BJP leaders in the state have been avoiding commenting on Vijayvargiyas statement  when questioned, most say such statements are Vijayvargiyas personal views."

We have put forward a proposal at the general council meeting and will talk to mayor and commissioner on the issue, said Congress corporator Monu Saxena.If needed, we wont hesitate to (stage a) demonstrate. After the Uri terror attack that killed 19 soldiers and the following strikes, we need to ban goods from China and Pakistan in Bhopal, said Saxena.Congress corporator Yogendra Chouhan demanded that the BMC ban goods from Pakistan such as mangoes, onions and carpets.During the question hour, Sageer accused the civic body of being involved in corruption and sought to know how much the BMC gets from movable and immovable properties. The statements angered mayor Alok Sharma who asked Sageer to follow the code of conduct.The council gave nod to the proposals presented during the meeting. The BMC has received offers for three shops located at the multi-level parking projects at MP Nagar and Sant Hirdaram Nagar. These shops are among the 92 shops for which BMC has decided to sell it to the highest bidder.Under the Immovable property transfer rules 2016, the lease of Kendriya Bhandar Nigam, Chola road will be renewed for 30 years. Also, 18 shops at the multi-level parking in Sant Hirdaram Nagar will be allotted to the State Bank of India on rent for five years.Just like the BMC has started garbage collection from door to door, the waste dumped on roads by residents during construction would now be picked up by the BMC using dumpers for a charge of Rs 1,500 per trip.The other decisions included termination of deputations of six officers. The action was taken after a HT report highlighted that the officials were not following rules and extending their deputation for more than three years."
5b2e2a619855b7245313f062,MP Onion Farmers Left Teary-Eyed as Govt Steps Fail to Arrest Crash,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-onion-farmers-left-teary-eyed-as-govt-steps-fail-to-arrest-crash/story-PYSApJIcMc6UVmbtcHLuHP.html,2016-08-15,,Hindustan Times,"Spiralling price of onions last year prompted Madhya Pradesh farmers to grow the crop in a big way. The result is a glut that made the vegetable dirt-cheap this monsoon.In Ratlam mandi, the price dipped to 20 paise a kg four months ago. Frustrated farmers abandoned onions, which were left to rot in quintals on roadsides. Identical onion rate were prevalent in the Neemuch market in mid-April. The state government stepped in, well aware of the role onions can play in politics as much as with the economy. Soaring onion price was a major factor behind the BJPs debacles in the 1998 assembly elections in Delhi, Raj as than and Madhya Pradesh when the party-led NDA ruled the Centre.A cautious chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in early June the procurement of onions at Rs 6 a kg from farmersmany of whom were selling the crop below Rs 1 per kg. Never has the 1956-formed state bought a vegetable, authorities claim.The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MarkFed) purchased 10.40 lakh quintals of onions from farmers. Already loan-burdened, their woes continued. From remote areas, farmers transported onions to mandis, only to be rejected for poor quality. The state intervened again, and ordered all mandis to buy onions. But it was late.FRETTING FARMERSKallu Kurmi of Newada village in Rehli tehsil of Sagar district has half his onions rotting. Sagar mandi (50 km away) didnt take my produce, he says. Im left with 300 gunny bags of onions.This, despite Union minister for food Ram Vilas Paswan announcing in May the purchase of 15,000 tonnes of the bumper crop. MarkFed bought onions at Rs 6/kg. We did it till end-June, by when rains came and made storing difficult, says its managing director BM Sharma.Former state agriculture director GS Kaushal attributes the farmers plight to administrative shortsightedness .The government should have built storage facilities , he notes .They arent expensive for onions. In the end, traders, middlemen and corporate houses gain, points out Kaushal. The farmers sells onions cheap, the consumer buys it at high prices.OUT OF TUNE?Kausal notes that Maharashtra is the lone state that has worked upon providing storage facility to onion farmers. If Madhya Pradesh could spend more than Rs 60 crore on the purchase of this crop from the farmers, why cant it spend some amount on space to store onions? he asks. Not working in this direction, the expert says, only helps in to create a perpetual situation where farmers get less and consumers pay moremuch to the benefit of the links in between.Madhya Pradesh has not emulated a nearby state, where hoarding of onions beyond a stipulated limit is banned and punishable. The Te lang ana Onion Dealers (Licensing, Storage and Regulation) Order, 2016, warrants license to sell the crop and a minimum retail price for it.In July last year, the central government extended its ban on stockpiling beyond the stipulated amount to curb prices of onion. ICAR 2014-15 data ranks Madhya Pradesh as the third-largest oniongrowing stateafter Maharashtra and Karnataka. The central Indian state produced 28,42,000 tonnes of onion in 1,17,000 hectares of land.POLITICAL SHOTSThe Opposition Congress says the onion fiasco has exposed the government s failure in making agriculture profitable.Deepti Singh, the partys state spokesperson, said the Chouhan government failed to notice the need for stronger onion storage facilities despite knowing that the farmers had gone to sow the seeds in large scale .The laxity turned out to be nightmarish for the common people , she added.The partys MLAs walked out of the state assembly recently, flaying the government for selling onion at Rs 4 per kg when the market price was Rs 10.Party legislator Jaivardhan Singh alleged the government was not paying the farmers money for the onion sit purchased. You bought onion worth Rs 62 crore from 40,000 farmers, but paid them only Rs 23.95 crore, he told treasury benches.Minister of state for cooperatives Vishwas Sarang said the government sold 7,000 quintals of onions in two days. We floated tenders to sell onions, but got quotes as low as 60 paisa to Rs 3.16 per kg. That is why we sold onions at Rs 4/kg, he reasoned. The balance amount will reach farmers in a week or so.TOUGH TO DISPOSERecently, the government asked the district collectors, jail administration and departments running government hostels to buy onions. Some collectors ordered employees to purchase at least 50 kg of onion per head. MarkFed is to sell onions at fair-price shops across the state. There will be open auction, too. As of now, 7000-8000 quintals of onion is being disposed of daily, says Sharma. If onions have brought tears in the eyes of the farmer, the government is equally worriedthough for a different reason. For instance, not long ago, the Chouhan government faced allegations from the Delhi government over rise in the prices of this bulbous vegetable so essential to the cuisine of people of all classes.That was in 2013, when Haroon Yusuf, who was food and civil supplies minister in the Sheila Di ks hit cabinet, attributed the soaring onion rates in the national capital to deliberate hoarding by Madhya Pradesh. The minister went on to claim that it was done at the instance of the Delhi unit of the BJP for political gains ahead of assembly elections. The MP government rubbished the charge, calling it baseless."

Prices of every day ingredients such as onions and potatoes have risen by about 75% and 50%, forcing many residents to keep them out of the daily diet.Customers in a number of city localities, including South City, DLF, Sushant Lok and Malibu Towne, paid between Rs 75 to Rs 90 for a kilogram of tomatoes on Tuesday. The cost of tomatoes had earlier risen from Rs 30 to Rs 60 around the second week of June.Residents said that tomatoes are essential in any kitchen and the ever increasing prices have forced them to avoid using the fruit in any dish. Chirag Sahani of Sector 31 said, No more tomatoes in salads. The fruit is too expensive that I first thought my vegetable seller was joking about the rates.The prices of onions, potatoes and brinjals have also increased by Rs 20 per kilogram on an average. The prices are likely to rise further in the next couple of days because of a delay in supplies and as the local production has been exhausted.Even the wholesale prices are extremely high. We are trying to reduce our profit window so that the people do not have to pay excessively high amounts for vegetables. The customers are complaining daily but there is not much we can do about it, Jitender Kumar, a retail seller in Sector 40, said.Officials of Gurgaon agricultural marketing committee said that the rise in prices is only seasonal.As the monsoon arrives, prices of vegetables start rising. The local supplies, which come from different parts of the state, including Mewat, Farrukhnagar and other areas, are over. We are depending on supplies from Himachal Pradesh, but because of the rain and road blockades, the trucks are not able to reach here on time, Deen Mohammad, state agriculture officer (Haryana), said."

Today, its being sold at Rs 3 every kg. The government should immediately buy them from the farmers, who do not have storage facility, Saraswati said.Agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said the government had set up a price stabilisation fund for potato, onion and pulses but it has been shifted from his ministry to the food ministry. He replied in detail about the e-NAM, the electronic trading platform for agriculture market.You have given an elaborate reply. But the problem remains as it is. Dal prices are not going down and that of onion are not going up, Kairana MP Hukum Singh said during the question hour.Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to intervene by saying the question relates to e-trading, but the MP was unfazed. What will we do of e-trading? Today, farmers are selling onion for Rs 2 per kg. There should be solution to the problem and it will be solved only when the government enters the market, buy onion and save farmers. Singh evaded the question, saying it did not fall under his ministry.Earlier, replying to a separate question, home minister Rajnath Singh found himself in a difficult spot when party MP RK Singh disputed one of his claims.Following a remark of Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge that the Centre has discontinued a housing scheme under which 75% funds were provided by the Centre while states used to provide 25%, the home minister said police modernisation funds are not given to states only for construction of houses for policemen.I want to tell the House that it is not correct to say many state governments run housing schemes through the funds given by the Centre. Police modernisation fund is not given only for housing. It is possible that some state governments use the funds for housing. But police modernisation funds are not given for housing, he said. RK Singh, however, said there was a housing component under the police modernisation funds given to states, which was perhaps stopped now.Related storiesIs Air India safe to fly, asks Opposition; govt defends safety recordDefense spending nose-dived, woefully insufficient: Parl panelPolice suicide, army shortage, doping: What was discussed in both Houses today"

Divisional commissioner Ravindra Pastore said all the collectors of the adjoining districts had asked the farmers to grow more vegetables. The farmers were even provided with seeds to this effect months ahead of the festival. He assured that the vegetable supplies would be arranged from the adjoining districts at the administration and the wholesalers end. Superintendent of police MS Verma said special care would be taken to ensure safe movement of vehicles carrying food stuff and milk to the city in the nights.However, peoples fear is not baseless as over five crore people are expected to visit the city with five lakh population during the festival time. This is going to put pressure on food availability, sources said.Pushkaran Dubey, an old city resident who usually buys one kg of potato and onion, bought 50 kgs of each on Friday as he fears short supply during the Simhastha.Even if other leafy vegetables are not available, I could at least have aalu ki sabzi for my family and guests who are expected to come for the fair, he told HT.Not only Dubey, many citizens could be seen buying veggies with long shelf value from the market.One Usha Chhajlani, a resident of Mahashewta Nagar, said that she had stocked a sack each of tuwar dal, rice and besan along with 15 kg tins of edible oil and other groceries. She said procuring the usual food stuff could be a problem during the Simhastha in the face of high demand. My house is going to be flooded with relatives from different cities so preparations to serve them have to be made early, she said.Arun Agrawal, owner of a leading cereal shop, said the police allowed unloading only during the night during the fair. Arranging workers would then be a problem, which might also timely supply of food items."

She was speaking metaphorically. As you know very well, much of politics is about cooking up things, explained a veteran, and theres no need to grill the poor girl about it. How else will we promise pie in the sky unless we learn how to cook up a storm? queried a politician-cum-chef. We have to get enormous amounts of black money past the Election Commissions scrutiny to fund our campaigns, explained a good egg, and we have to cook the books well in order to do that. Otherwise well get chicken feed.Our party is known for its half-baked ideas, pointed out a baker-cum-politician proudly, adding they sold like hot cakes. It takes long years of cooking to know how to have a finger in every pie, said a big cheese who was an expert in pork barrel politics.Read: Bihar board Inter toppers at venue for acid testEvery politician should know how to stir the pot of communal and caste passions, its meat and drink to us, said a pot-stirrer. A writer of potboilers said that was a fine kettle of fish. If you cant stand the heat, you should get out of the kitchen, said a member of the kitchen cabinet. We politicos are in the business of adding a bit of masala here, a little tadka there. We need to learn how to soup up things. Plain vanilla is boring, he said. He said the best fish was to be got from troubled waters.But some disagree. I have a beef with what the topper said. Cooking is part and parcel of politics, but she shouldnt have spilled the beans, said the veteran. And now they have turned up the heat and she is toast, he added. Another guy said no, the girl was a hot potato and she should be dropped like one. Besides, too many cooks spoil the broth, he added. A thoughtful chap said while the whole thing was food for thought, her goose was now cooked and she was now dead meat. He then warned the veteran that he could be lynched for possessing beef.Read: Bihar board results send alarm bells ringingA communist said that while Mao had said a revolution is not a dinner party, he hadnt mentioned whether it was lunch and lunch involved cooking. An egghead said one couldnt make omelettes without breaking eggs. A big fish said the girl should now make humble pie and eat it. A small fry said all politicians needed to learn the art of buttering up and currying favour and know which side their bread was buttered. He added they must also know how to sugarcoat things for their bosses, while making mincemeat of the opposition, rubbing salt in their wounds and ensuring they have egg on their faces.A politician who was no spring chicken summed up the sentiment by saying the girl certainly knows her onions but she must learn how to save ones bacon and to have her cake and eat it too. That would bring home the bacon and be the icing on the cake, he said, before pushing off, saying he had other fish to fry.Manas Chakravarty is Consulting Editor, MintThe views expressed are personal"
