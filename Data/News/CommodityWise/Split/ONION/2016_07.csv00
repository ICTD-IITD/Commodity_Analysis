In October, it was 3.39%.Food prices went up 1.54% from a year earlier, following a 4.34 percent rise in the preceding month. Among food prices, potatoes recorded the highest rise (37%), followed by pulses (21.7%). In contrast, prices declined for onion (-51.5%) and vegetables (-24%).Cost of manufactured products increased by 3.2%, compared to a 2.7% rise in the previous month.The WPI inflation for September has also been revised upwards at 3.8% against the provisional estimate of 3.57%.Wholesale rates, measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), indicates the annual rate of price rise in bulk buys for traders reflecting the.Retail inflation, announced on Tuesday, too dropped to a two year low of 3.63% reflecting lower consumer demand.Industry body Assocham said that the fall in WPI numbers was in tandem with the expectations and was due to the depressive state in the Indian economy owing to the demonetisation announcement."

As 2016 comes to a close, we analysed the status of these five problems, and challenges that will continue in 2017.1. Agriculture recovers, but benefits uncertain after demonetisationOver the fiscal year 2016-17, agriculturewhich employs more than 700 million peoplewill grow by 4%, estimated CRISIL, a research agency.Recovering from twoand some places even threeconsecutive drought years, agriculture, for the first time since 2013, saw a growth of above 3% in the second quarter of 2016-17, over the same period in 2015-16.Record summer crop production of rice, at 93.8 million tonnes, and pulses, at 8.7 million tonnes, is estimated in 2016-17, according to advance estimates by the agriculture ministry.Source: Key Economic Indicators, Office of the Economic AdvisorBut the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016 has been a setback to the rural economyon which 800 million people, or 65% of Indias population, dependlargely driven by cash.Vehicles entering a rural market yard in Maharashtra dropped, onion prices halved in the biggest onion market in the country, the fishing economy in Goa faced roadblocks, and flower farmers in Madhya Pradesh lost business, as IndiaSpends visit to these regions revealed.Read | Farmers forced to dump their produce as note ban turns bumper crop worthlessSimilar reports from Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and other parts of the country appear to have dampened the bright agricultural prospects of 2016. But there is hope that cash pressures will ease in the long term, and the rural economy will be back to normal, according to a Livemint report.2. Good monsoon; India signs climate change agreement; India has half of the worlds 20 cities with the most toxic airFrom a severe drought in 11 states in June just before the arrival of the monsoon, Indiabarring Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Keralareceived normal rains in 2016. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra received 20% more rain than normal.Overall, rainfall patterns have become more irregular over the last decade. Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasingas a part of complex changes in local and world weatheraccording to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2016.Read | 116 farmers committed suicide in 2016; 10 states reeling under droughtIn 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise of the earths temperature to under two degrees Celsius by the year 2100.India also signed a legally binding international agreement, starting 2028, to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)gases that can have global warming potential up to 12,000 times more than carbon dioxide (CO2)as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.Still, India will have to do more to prepare itself for the effects of climate change in the future. Between 2030 and 2050, a study, conducted by the University of Oxford, projected 136,000 climate-related deaths in India, according to an answer given by the environment ministry in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).Even as CO2 concentration levels in the world breached 400 parts per million, levels that will last our lifetime, thick smog engulfed the nations capital and other northern states, with the concentration of toxic particles reaching up to 45 times above safe levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).Between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with a population above 14 million, Delhis ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of 2016 WHO data. Indian cities make-up half of the worlds 20 most toxic cities, according to data from the WHO.3. India still home to 40 million stunted children, largest number in the worldEven with declining child undernourishment rates, India is home to over 40 million stunted children under five, more than any other country in the world, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Stunting refers to low height for age.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaIndia ranks 120 out of 130 countries in prevalence of wasting (15.1%), or low weight for height, according to the 2016 Global Nutrition Report, which ranks countries from lowest to highest prevalence.At current rates of decline in malnutrition, Indiacurrently lagging behind several poorer African countrieswill achieve the current stunting rates of Ghana or Togo by 2030, and that of China by 2055, stated the report.India also does poorly on indicators that could help reduce malnutrition.For instance, there is a link between improved health of the mother and lower stunting prevalence in children under five, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. States such as Goa and Kerala, with 99% of institutional deliveries, had amongst the lowest levels of stunting in the country. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, states that have some of the highest levels of stunting, have just about 65% institutional deliveries.Improved sanitation also impacts the health of children, as seen in the state of Mizoram, which reported a 13% decline in wasting prevalence and 5% decline in underweight children in ten years, when there was a 10% improvement in household access to a toilet, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Still, there are 93.1 million households in rural India without access to a toilet.4. Education budget rose 4.8%, but millions are dropping out before secondary schoolLast year, we wrote about how India had reduced its education budget, even though the country has 282 million illiterate peopleequivalent to the population of Indonesiaand 18% of those who went to school were unable to complete secondary school.Read | Secondary education will empower India in the 21st centuryFor the financial year 2016-17, the central government budgeted Rs 72,394 crore on school education, higher education and adult literacy programmesa rise of 4.8% over 2015-16.Still, the 2016-17 budget amount is 12.5% less than the 2014-15 budget estimate, according to budget data. The government spent 16% less than the original budgeted amount of Rs 82,771 crore in 2014-15.Source: Union Budget, Ministry of FinanceFurther, challenges of retaining students in school remain, putting Indias large working population860 million by 2020at risk, IndiaSpend reported in May 2016.Net enrolment in primary education, the number of primary age school children enrolled in school, as a proportion of the total primary school age population, remained constant: 87.3% in 2015-16 compared to 87.4% in 2014-15, according to District Information System for Education data.Enrolment in secondary schools rose slightly, from 48.5% to 51.3%, which suggests that many students drop out before secondary schoolthat is, grade nine.Even fewer32.3%enrolled in higher secondaryclass 11 or its equivalentin 2015-16.5. Growth likely to be muted; opinion dividedTrade and growth forecasts for 2016 were lower than that of 2015, while declining wholesale inflation was not being passed to consumers, IndiaSpend had reported in December 2015.The move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, 2016, is likely to slow down economic activity in 2017, but some experts say claims are exaggerated.Gross value added (GVA) growth for the financial year 2016-17 has been revised to 7.1% from the earlier estimate of 7.6% due to demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement issued on December 7, 2016. Demonetisation is expected to affect cash-intensive sectors such as retail and transportation and reduce demand due to adverse wealth effects.Ambit Capital, a financial services firm, slashed its growth projection for the current year by 330 basis points to 3.5, BloombergQuint reported on December 19, 2016.Now heres the other side: Economists are talking nonsense on GDP decline, Aditya Puri, managing director of HDFC Bank, told Business Standard on November 30, 2016.Consumer inflation is expected to remain in single digits (5% in December 2016-March 2017 quarter), but there is a risk it could increase, the RBI said, due to volatility in global crude oil prices, increased turbulence in financial markets and the effects of demonetisation.This story first appeared on Indiaspend.

5b2e21139855b7245313e6ba,Farmers Forced to Dump Their Produce as Note Ban Turns Bumper Crop Worthless,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-forced-to-dump-the-produce-as-note-ban-turns-bumper-crop-worthless/story-q79Oaf8eGTLX0yaHXwkJLL.html,2016-12-26,"Farmers across India are battling a steep fall in wholesale vegetable prices and are forced to discard their produce as a nationwide cash crunch following the scrapping of high-value banknotes hurts demand.The crash in wholesale prices comes at a bad time for farmers, who reaped a bumper crop and were hoping for good returns to make up for losses induced by two straight drought years.Andhra PradeshLast Wednesday, S Raju, a farmer from Anantapur district, brought around two tonnes of tomatoes to Bowenpally market in Secunderabad but had to return home empty handed.Raju said he spent nearly Rs 4 per kg to raise the tomato crop and it cost him another Rs 2 per kg to transport the produce to Secunderabad, more than 400 km from Anantapur.But he was shocked when traders at Bowenpally offered not more than Rs 2 a kg for his crop.Raju realised the price quoted was not sufficient even to meet the transportation cost, as he had to travel back to Anantapur.Frustrated, he unloaded boxes of tomatoes and dumped them in the market yard, before cursing the traders and market authorities. Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read |After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"
5b2e2a619855b7245313f062,MP Onion Farmers Left Teary-Eyed as Govt Steps Fail to Arrest Crash,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-onion-farmers-left-teary-eyed-as-govt-steps-fail-to-arrest-crash/story-PYSApJIcMc6UVmbtcHLuHP.html,2016-08-15,"Spiralling price of onions last year prompted Madhya Pradesh farmers to grow the crop in a big way. The result is a glut that made the vegetable dirt-cheap this monsoon.In Ratlam mandi, the price dipped to 20 paise a kg four months ago. Frustrated farmers abandoned onions, which were left to rot in quintals on roadsides. Identical onion rate were prevalent in the Neemuch market in mid-April. The state government stepped in, well aware of the role onions can play in politics as much as with the economy. Soaring onion price was a major factor behind the BJPs debacles in the 1998 assembly elections in Delhi, Raj as than and Madhya Pradesh when the party-led NDA ruled the Centre.A cautious chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in early June the procurement of onions at Rs 6 a kg from farmersmany of whom were selling the crop below Rs 1 per kg. Never has the 1956-formed state bought a vegetable, authorities claim.The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MarkFed) purchased 10.40 lakh quintals of onions from farmers. Already loan-burdened, their woes continued. From remote areas, farmers transported onions to mandis, only to be rejected for poor quality. The state intervened again, and ordered all mandis to buy onions. But it was late.FRETTING FARMERSKallu Kurmi of Newada village in Rehli tehsil of Sagar district has half his onions rotting. Sagar mandi (50 km away) didnt take my produce, he says. Im left with 300 gunny bags of onions.This, despite Union minister for food Ram Vilas Paswan announcing in May the purchase of 15,000 tonnes of the bumper crop. MarkFed bought onions at Rs 6/kg. We did it till end-June, by when rains came and made storing difficult, says its managing director BM Sharma.Former state agriculture director GS Kaushal attributes the farmers plight to administrative shortsightedness .The government should have built storage facilities , he notes .They arent expensive for onions. In the end, traders, middlemen and corporate houses gain, points out Kaushal. The farmers sells onions cheap, the consumer buys it at high prices.OUT OF TUNE?Kausal notes that Maharashtra is the lone state that has worked upon providing storage facility to onion farmers. If Madhya Pradesh could spend more than Rs 60 crore on the purchase of this crop from the farmers, why cant it spend some amount on space to store onions? he asks. Not working in this direction, the expert says, only helps in to create a perpetual situation where farmers get less and consumers pay moremuch to the benefit of the links in between.Madhya Pradesh has not emulated a nearby state, where hoarding of onions beyond a stipulated limit is banned and punishable. The Te lang ana Onion Dealers (Licensing, Storage and Regulation) Order, 2016, warrants license to sell the crop and a minimum retail price for it.In July last year, the central government extended its ban on stockpiling beyond the stipulated amount to curb prices of onion. ICAR 2014-15 data ranks Madhya Pradesh as the third-largest oniongrowing stateafter Maharashtra and Karnataka. The central Indian state produced 28,42,000 tonnes of onion in 1,17,000 hectares of land.POLITICAL SHOTSThe Opposition Congress says the onion fiasco has exposed the government s failure in making agriculture profitable.Deepti Singh, the partys state spokesperson, said the Chouhan government failed to notice the need for stronger onion storage facilities despite knowing that the farmers had gone to sow the seeds in large scale .The laxity turned out to be nightmarish for the common people , she added.The partys MLAs walked out of the state assembly recently, flaying the government for selling onion at Rs 4 per kg when the market price was Rs 10.Party legislator Jaivardhan Singh alleged the government was not paying the farmers money for the onion sit purchased. You bought onion worth Rs 62 crore from 40,000 farmers, but paid them only Rs 23.95 crore, he told treasury benches.Minister of state for cooperatives Vishwas Sarang said the government sold 7,000 quintals of onions in two days. We floated tenders to sell onions, but got quotes as low as 60 paisa to Rs 3.16 per kg. That is why we sold onions at Rs 4/kg, he reasoned. The balance amount will reach farmers in a week or so.TOUGH TO DISPOSERecently, the government asked the district collectors, jail administration and departments running government hostels to buy onions. Some collectors ordered employees to purchase at least 50 kg of onion per head. MarkFed is to sell onions at fair-price shops across the state. There will be open auction, too. As of now, 7000-8000 quintals of onion is being disposed of daily, says Sharma. If onions have brought tears in the eyes of the farmer, the government is equally worriedthough for a different reason. For instance, not long ago, the Chouhan government faced allegations from the Delhi government over rise in the prices of this bulbous vegetable so essential to the cuisine of people of all classes.That was in 2013, when Haroon Yusuf, who was food and civil supplies minister in the Sheila Di ks hit cabinet, attributed the soaring onion rates in the national capital to deliberate hoarding by Madhya Pradesh. The minister went on to claim that it was done at the instance of the Delhi unit of the BJP for political gains ahead of assembly elections. The MP government rubbished the charge, calling it baseless."
5b2e31f19855b7245313f826,BJP MP Makes Veiled Criticism over Price Rise,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/buy-onion-save-farmers-bjp-mps-veiled-criticism-over-price-rise/story-H5eiT6pOOWKYaABJD4X0JO.html,2016-05-04,"The plight of onion farmers and rising prices of pulses echoed in Lok Sabha on Tuesday with BJP MPs making veiled criticism of the Centre for the second consecutive day.Sumedhananda Saraswati (Sikar) and Hukum Singh (Kairana) raised the matter in Lok Sabha, seeking intervention to buy onion from the farmers.When there was a crisis seven-eight months back, onions were sold at Rs 50 per kg. Today, its being sold at Rs 3 every kg. The government should immediately buy them from the farmers, who do not have storage facility, Saraswati said.Agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said the government had set up a price stabilisation fund for potato, onion and pulses but it has been shifted from his ministry to the food ministry. He replied in detail about the e-NAM, the electronic trading platform for agriculture market.You have given an elaborate reply. But the problem remains as it is. Dal prices are not going down and that of onion are not going up, Kairana MP Hukum Singh said during the question hour.Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to intervene by saying the question relates to e-trading, but the MP was unfazed. What will we do of e-trading? Today, farmers are selling onion for Rs 2 per kg. There should be solution to the problem and it will be solved only when the government enters the market, buy onion and save farmers. Singh evaded the question, saying it did not fall under his ministry.Earlier, replying to a separate question, home minister Rajnath Singh found himself in a difficult spot when party MP RK Singh disputed one of his claims.Following a remark of Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge that the Centre has discontinued a housing scheme under which 75% funds were provided by the Centre while states used to provide 25%, the home minister said police modernisation funds are not given to states only for construction of houses for policemen.I want to tell the House that it is not correct to say many state governments run housing schemes through the funds given by the Centre. Police modernisation fund is not given only for housing. It is possible that some state governments use the funds for housing. But police modernisation funds are not given for housing, he said. RK Singh, however, said there was a housing component under the police modernisation funds given to states, which was perhaps stopped now.Related storiesIs Air India safe to fly, asks Opposition; govt defends safety recordDefense spending nose-dived, woefully insufficient: Parl panelPolice suicide, army shortage, doping: What was discussed in both Houses today"
