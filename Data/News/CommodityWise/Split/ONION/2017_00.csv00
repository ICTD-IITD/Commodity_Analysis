Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

Looking at the daily arrivals, it looks productivity is higher even though the acreage was lower, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Around 20% of the countrys total onion output is grown during the kharif season. Since the kharif onion cannot be stored, farmers sell off the produce in domestic as well as overseas markets.The arrival of quality onions has boosted exports in the last few weeks. About 13,56,381 tonnes of onions have been shipped abroad in the April-September period of this fiscal.The government is still assessing onion production figures for the 2016-17 crop year (July-June). Last year, the countrys onion output was higher at 20.99 million tonnes. Maharashtra contributes more than a quarter of the countrys overall output."

However, this can be injurious to health,"" an editorial said.Saamna criticized Modi for not setting a deadline to offer relief to common citizens who had to suffer because of his November 8 move to demonetise high-value currency notes. ""The PM hasn't announced the exact details of the black money which his government has unearthed in the last 50 days...He should tell us as to why people were subjected to cruel hardships...Tell us how many more citizens should lay down their lives (for the cause of demonetisation),"" the editorial said.Saamna said the maternity benefit plan was not original. ""Under Modi's plan, a pregnant woman opting for institutional delivery will receive financial aid of Rs 6,000 in her bank account ... . However, the scheme was flagged off by the UPA regime in 2010, and was called the Indira Gandhi Matruttva Sahyog Yojana ,"" Saamna said.The editorial said that the scheme had continued even after it was amalgamated with the national food security scheme, added Saamna.In a televised address to the nation on New Year's eve, Modi unveiled a package of sops, including the maternity benefit scheme, which, the PM added, was aimed at encouraging institutional deliveries in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality. Saamna warned that Modi's plan to offer 60 days' interest waiver on loans for rabi crops would be a non-starter because of the precarious financial condition of the district cooperative central banks.""The RBI has declined to accept old and cancelled notes deposited in the district cooperative banks. The PM's waiver announcement will add to the woes of these banks. They lack the financial strength to suffer the fresh burden. Worse, the Centre is yet to release this year's rabi crop aid to these banks,"" the daily said.Recalling the case of Chhotalal , a young man from north India who had no cash to perform the last rites of his mother, Saamna said: ""Chhotalal couldn't get Rs 2,000 from the bank to arrange for his mother's funeral. There are lakhs of such Chhotalals across the country ... . They are cursing the government.""Signing off, Saamna said: ""We have affection for Modi...but stating truth is an act of not crime but 'deshbhakti'."""

Earlier, the highest onion export was recorded at 18.73 metric tonne during the financial year 2009-10.Nafed director Nanasaheb Patil said, ""The onion export has increased threefold because of the zero Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions and also introduction of Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) benefits at 5% for onion exporters, which have been extended upto March 31.""""This year, there had been excess onion production in the country. Around 25 lakh metric tonne production was in excess in the country.

The cost of production for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal. Hence, farmers are still incurring heavy losses.""This has also led to the rise in export. Farmers actually must benefit from onion export. Earlier, there were some specific onion growing pockets, but areas under onion plantation are spreading now. Hence, government need to make a proper policy to match the demand and supply of onions,"" Patil added."

Bhujbal was the party's prominent leader from the region and held sway over the local bodies.On Wednesday, various hoardings welcoming Sharad Pawar had been put up at Pimpalgaon ahead of his visit.

New hoardings with Bhujbal's picture were placed on Wednesday evening.When asked about this during a press conference, Pawar said, ""Bhujbal has made great contribution for the development of Nashik city. Hence, there is no question of giving directive that his photo should not been included in the hoardings. We will not take any such decision about Bhujbal until the court gives its verdict.""The NCP is facing tough times as four of its leaders, including Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer, are under arrest in the past 10 months.

Karunakaran on Monday seeking compensation for crop loss occurred due to monsoon failure.In their petition, the farmers said they used to raise paddy, onion and chilli crops on over 1,000 acres with water available in Melapavoor tank and Pattipathu tank. Since the northeast monsoon failed, most of them did not raise crops this season and the few who cultivated paddy, onion and chilli with the little water available in these two irrigation tanks had suffered a huge loss.Hence, the Collector should recommend to the government to declare the district as drought-hit so that they could get compensation. Moreover, those farmers who did not raise crops and were struggling to save their cattle should also get some assistance to save their families from starving, the petitioners said.Against churchAnother group of villagers from Chettiyur in Tenkasi taluk submitted a petition against giving approval for constructing a church in their village.The petitioners said an application seeking permission for constructing the church was submitted on June 20 last by a few outsiders and the application was rejected as no Christian family was living in the village.The same applicants submitted another application on September 2 last seeking permission for constructing a community hall at Chettiyur which housed over 500 Hindu families.Similar community halls they built at Nattarpatti and Meenakshipuram are being used as churches. Hence, their move is an indirect attempt to construct a church in our village.If the permission is granted, it will lead to religious conversion and needless tension among villagers, said K.

(Hardeep Singh) The humble litti of Bihar-Jharkhand is on the roast for bon vivants from across the world. Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the event manager of the Global Investors' Summit (GIS) in Ranchi, has roped in grub start-up GoLitti for the GIS food court in Hotwar on February 16-17 and the latter hopes to take the desi litti places with its trendy Chinese and Italian range of the traditional atta-sattu preparation. GoLitti - the state's lone branded litti joint that opened shop at Eastern Mall on Dangratoli Road only last month - is the brainchild of three friends, two of them BIT-Mesra alumni and the third a chartered accountant who left a plum job with Goldman Sachs in Bangalore to realise a big dream out of a small dough. Recalling his amazing culinary journey along with school friends and businessmen Kamal Bagla (23) and Sameer Kataruka (24), chartered accountant-turned-food manager Ankush Raj (23) told this newspaper how the inherent desire to make the homemade litti popular like the samosa or momo gave birth to GoLitti. ""A few years ago, when I moved to Delhi for my CA studies, I missed our litti-chokha, which is basically a super healthy baked dough ball stuffed with sattu (chickpea flour) and served with roasted and mashed potatoes, tomatoes, onion, chillies and spices. I shared my cravings with my Bridgeford School pals Kamal and Sameer one day, months later, and all of a sudden we had the idea,"" said Ankush. Raising a brand from a drawing room idea was no easy task. ""But, if there's will, there's a way. I quit Goldman Sachs in September last year and came to Ranchi. My businessmen friends, who are BBA graduates from BIT-Mesra, backed my dream while my mother Rita Sinha (49), a great cook, helped us rediscover litti in many avatars,"" Ankush said. GoLitti was born on January 15 this year, and is already a hot favourite with local residents and visitors alike, which includes representatives of the CII. ""We sell litti under two categories - evergreen and trendy. The first comprises the traditional baked variety along with Jain (no onion and garlic) and ghee-fried. The trendy menu boasts manchurian, schezwan, shashlik, corn, paneer, dahi, matar and mixed vegetable varieties among others,"" Ankush said, adding that officials of CII liked their preparations so much that the invite to join the GIS food court was almost immediate. And all this for just Rs 40 to Rs 95 a plate! ""We wanted to make litti loveable for all and we did it. Nothing pleases us more than when customers exclaim 'wow' after tasting our food. We will open a second joint in Ranchi in April. We are keeping fingers crossed and hoping that the summit will help us take GoLitti global,"" Ankush added."

Apart from 33 projects, for which no-objection certificates have been given, MHADA has given 1,56, 520.41 sq.m. additional area for 432 projects. Out of this, only 31,319.79 sq.m. has been handed over to MHADA, the minister said.Mr. Shelar said developers were taking advantage of the MHADAs careless attitude. As a result, only a few works have begun. The people who are to get houses are kept waiting. Will an SIT will be formed to investigate this issue? he asked. He added that the total cost of the area that had not been handed over to MHADA was around Rs. 6,000 crore.Mr. Waikar said, The matter will be probed transparently by SIT. He also assured the Assembly that action would be taken against developers of projects where no work had been done in the last eight to ten years.As per the rules, the developer must hand over the area under which redevelopment has taken place to MHADA. There have been complaints that developers, in connivance with officials, have instead sold it off at market value.Congress MLA Nitesh Rane saidofficers involved in giving clearance certificates should also be probed. Mr. Waikar accepted the demand."

Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"
