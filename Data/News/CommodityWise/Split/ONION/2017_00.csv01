Now, Kolkata's street food is available on online food delivery platforms. From bhelpuri, soda shikanjiand papri chaatto rose khass, phuchka and even paan -everything can be ordered online and delivered at your doorstop.The online menu of Sandip Soda Shikanji at Vivekananda Park now lists everything from rose milkshake and kachha aam milkshake to kala khatta and khass. Mouthwatering pictures of khatta meetha churmur , dahi pakora chaat and dahi phuchka are all available on line as are paans from Ashok Paan shop on Bondel Road ""It's been three months since we started offering this servi ce to keep pace with the digital world,"" said Rahul Kumar Chaurasia from Ashok Paan shop, adding that the app helps them deliver to places as far away as Tollygunje and Kasba.Most of his clients opt for gundi paan, which costs Rs 8 each, but there are also many takers for the special singara paan that costs Rs 50.Delivery boy Bapi Roy says he delivers street food worth Rs 300-400 each day . ""There is one client on Mayfair Road who has ordered lachha paan worth Rs 150 at least 25 times in a month!"" Roy said.Piku Pandit, who runs the popular Durga Pandit Ka Phuchka Stall , is upbeat about online delivery . ""Clients who can't physically come down are happy to be served this way . On some days, I even get as many as 15 online orders,"" said Pandit, who packs extra chillies, onion and lime with every order. Sandip Das, the owner of Sandip Soda Shikanji stall, insists that it is important to ride the app bandwagon to survive. ""This shop was set up by my grandfather. Elderly people might not understand apps, but I need to be savvy to survive.There are days when I get 50 orders through the app,"" Das said.He rues that he can't serve online customers his trademark golas because he hasn't been able to ""get the packing right"".Advocate Tridib Sen drives down to Das's stall only to have the gola. The rest he orders online. ""Time and distance are important. In my profession, it is difficult to find time to go and have food on the streets. Since these are now available online, why wouldn't I avail the facility? It costs approximately Rs 10 more per delivery but that doesn't pinch my pocket at all. In betwe en work, all I need to do is go online and order a masala thumsup or a shikanji and it's delivered within minutes,"" Sen said.Piyali Saha, in-charge of an educational institute, places online phuchka orders at least thrice a month. ""Of course, the fun of having phuchka on the streets is missing at home or office.Yet, it's better than not having it at all. It's all about adapting to the need of the hour,"" she said. There's one catch though.Customers can no longer cajole for a free sukhha puchka or a helping of bhujia to top the chaat. But that's a small sacrifice to make for street food delivered straight to your workstation."
58f519067be9e01a17c9295c,The summer fruit king,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/the-summer-fruit-king/articleshow/58087550.cms,2017-04-09,"Summer is the time for nature to put the brightly coloured kokum or bhirandam fruits on their trees, mainly in India's Western Ghats region. Seven species of this garcinia indica are endemic to the Ghats, growing its dense canopy of leaves and yielding fruit even with little or no care.It is no wonder, then, that Goans, as in the rest of the Konkan, learnt to harvest this fruit in the summer and devised ways to use it year round. Just like the mango panh or panak, the fresh bhirandam fruit is also used to make a refreshing summer drink.The fruits are washed and broken open to separate the seed and outer rind. Adding water little by little, the pulp is extracted from the seed and skin of the fruit. As bhirandam are known for their sourness, one requires at least half a kilo of jaggery for the extract of every 15 medium-sized fruits. Dilute the mixture of the pulp and jaggery to a thin, transparent consistency and add salt and pepper and cardomom powder to taste.The skin of the fruit left behind can then be dried in the summer sun to get the blackish solam, which are preserved and used as a souring agent in food , in place of tamarind, round the year. Usually, the rind of bhirandam are dried without extracting the pulp and if you have made your solam after taking the pulp from it, you will need to add more of them to achieve the sourness you desire.To store the kokam extract like a squash, much after the summer is gone, add minimal water when extracting the pulp and add jaggery and salt to it and bring the mixture to a boil. Cool and store in a bottle in the refrigerator. This squash can be preserved for up to six months, if done right.If you are not a fan of sweet drinks, just soak the dried sollam into some water and squeeze the sourness out of them. Add salt, finely chopped green chillies, asafoetida and coriander and dilute with water to make a drink of thin consistency. This footi kodi is usually had following a meal and is believed to help digestion. But one may also gulp it down as a drink with a ting of jaggery for taste.Kokum also gives us the famous Goan sol kodi, with coconut milk, had as an accompaniment to a rice meal.Solam are also locally used to rub on insect bites for relief from the sting.They are especially useful when cooking local forest produce like aalloo, surran and maadi, which are rubbed with the sollam so that they do not irritate the mouth on eating. The solam are rubbed on the hand while cutting these foods too, to safeguard the hands from the itching sensation.Sollam are a key ingredient in tisreo sukhem, the vegetarian gravy tondak where sollam add the flavour in the absense of onion in the masala and in the mixed vegetable Goan khatkhatem. It goes with any fish curry too.If you have a kokum tree in your reach, the tender, reddish leaves of the tree are also edible and carry the same sourness as the fruit. Eating these leaves with salt is just a fun, childish thing to do, if you find yourself in the Western Ghats, near a kokum tree in the summer."

The money was being transported from Mumbai to a city in Kerala through Bengaluru. We suspect it was part of a hawala racket, said a senior police officer.Based on a tip-off, a team of policemen intercepted the goods vehicle on airport road and arrested Mohammed Afzal (23), a resident of Vidyaranyapura and native of Kozhikode, and Abdul Nazeer (44) and Shamshuddin (39), both from Kozhikode."
58f52473a3d24b0b70c1dcf1,Major projects on the verge of completion,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Major-projects-on-the-verge-of-completion/article17126656.ece,2017-02-01,"With the financial year coming to an end, Madurai Corporation is hopeful of completing its projects taken up in the last two years before March 31.But the question that keeps repeating is: Whether such new infrastructural facilities like bridges and new shops for markets outside the city had brought in relief from existing markets (shandies) and encroachements? The answer is: NO.Two years ago, the Corporation authorities had planned to construct two bridges (near Aruldosspuram and Obula Padithurai) connecting north and south Madurai after demolishing the existing causeways, all at a cost of Rs. 30 crore. This is expected to give substantial relief to motorists, who relied more on the century-old Albert Victor Bridge.Now, the major work on the bridge has almost been completed and it will ready for public use soon, said Corporation Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri on Tuesday. Approach roads to the fly-over are being laid and the work should be over in about a fortnight. Lights and other fittings, among others, have to be installed. Work is going on in full swing, he added.Fruit marketLike the two bridges, the Corporation had taken up construction of 240 shops near the integrated bus stand at Mattuthavani for fruit vendors who would exit from Vakkil New Street, Simmakkal and other pockets. Except for laying under ground drainage and road on the new campus, the shops are ready. We hope to put them to use in less than two months, Mr. Sandeep Nanduri said.Though the Corporation had planned other projects, the prevailing drought had forced the authorities to focus on providing drinking water first to all residents for now. But, in long term perspective, the city should be kept free from markets and encroachers. Though the Corporation council resolved to work on this line two years ago, when V.V. Rajan Chellappa was the Mayor, in reality , the resolution is in cold storage.The onion market on South Marret Street is yet to be moved out. As a result, it has always been a problem for smooth flow of vehicles. To add to the woes, mounting vegetable waste on the road not only encroaches the carriage space, but also emanates bad odour. Though officials claimed to have succeeded in shifting onion sellers, the attempt got stuck due to political interference from the back door, officials in the Town and Country Planning department said.Likewise, unchecked encroachments on roadsides on busy thoroughfare, by all types of vendors, had crippled movement of even two-wheelers and pedestrians in and around Meenakshi Temple, Netaji Road, South Avani Moola Street and a few other stretches, considered as tourist spots.Omni bus standAfter the Corporation established the omni bus stand at Mattuthavani, the congestion experienced in and around Periyar bus stand, Tirupparankundram Road, Palanganatham and Arapalayam had reduced to a great extent. Keeping this in mind, the authorities should shift the onion market, which would be a blessing for road users.When the Corporation is ambitious to give a facelift to the temple city after it was selected for the Smart City Project, the official machinery should work towards getting recognition as the number one clean city in the country."

Shweta , a homemaker , said, ""Two days ago I bought lady's finger for Rs 45 a kg. Today, it is available for Rs 60 though one vendor offered me the same at Rs 50 rupee per kg if I bought more than two kgs.""Likewise, the price of pumpkin shot up from Rs 12 to 20 per kg in the market. Cabbage, which sold for Rs 15 apiece, is selling at Rs 35 per piece now. The price of cowpea, or lobiya, has risen from Rs 40 to 60 per kg.Similarly, capsicum was priced at Rs 35 per kg last week but is now available for Rs 70 per kg. The cost of cauliflower has gone up from Rs 15 to 25-30 per piece.There is also a rise in the prices of onion which was earlier Rs 15 but has now gone up to Rs 35 a kg. ""In my house, no dish is ever cooked without onions. With this sudden rise in the vegetable prices and month-end near, it has become difficult to stick to the family budget,"" said Nusrat Kazmi.A wedding planner from Chowk told TOI that because buffalo meat wasn't readily available anymore, the demand for vegetables and paneer had shot up. Paneer is priced at Rs 300 a kg. A vegetable vendor in Nishatganj pointed out that the prices are likely to shoot up another 10 to 15% because of summer."

Following sharp political reactions, Maharathy ordered a fresh probe into the death citing that his statement was on the basis of an inquiry report filed by the Bargarh district collector.The two officers, deputy director agriculture Naba Kishore Das and assistant director horticulture Sushil Seth visited Kenpali for the second probe into the suicide. Sources said the villagers gathered around them and insisted them to make their findings public.A copy of the report, purportedly signed by the two officers, showed Hadu suffered damage of vegetables (cabbage, onion and chilli), paddy. He could not sell cabbage due to underrate while could not water his farm properly because of erratic water supply.""We visited Hadu's farm land. We are providing the below mentioned report to the villagers, the two officers wrote"". Das, when contacted, said, ""We have nothing to hide. We showed our findings to the villagers as they wished"".The BJP, which had called a state-wide agitation on Tuesday, seeking Maharathy's resignation over the issue deferred it by a day owing to day-long mourning in the state following the demise of former Lok Sabha speaker Rabi Ray. ""We will hold our protest on Wednesday,"" said BJP state vice-president Sameer Mohanty. Irrespective of the BJPs decision at the state-level, certain district units such as in Bargarh and Keonjhar, went ahead with their protest against Maharathy on Tuesday itself."

He said for the past some time there had been almost no export of vegetables to Pakistan via Attari.""In the wholesale market here, potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, onion are being sold for Rs 2, Rs 11, Rs 4 and Rs 8 per kg. However, in retail markets all vegetables are sold in the range of Rs 10-Rs 20 per kg,"" he maintained.Sethi said farmers' worst period started during demonetization when there was no cash flow in the market and they were forced to sell their produce at any price. ""Hoping to get the best price as had happened in the past year, farmers had brought a large portion of their fields under vegetable cultivation and also got bumper crop, but demonetization played the spoilsport. Now, with the glut of crops, the only hope now is to export vegetables to Pakistan, which is struggling with their supply,"" said president of association Ravinder Singh.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha president Satnam Singh Ajnala blamed the government for not fixing MSP for vegetables and its inability to set up vegetable-based agro industries in Punjab. ""Since there is no MSP, farmers are being exploited by commission agents and the government is not doing anything,"" he said, adding that the MSP of vegetables would at least ensure that farmers wouldn't be at loss. Besides, he opined that the government should have a dependable transportation network to immediately supply vegetables where there was a deficit."

With the figure of the last three months yet to come in, the country's onion export is expected to reach 30 lakh tonne.Moreover, the onion export increased three times more during the April-Dec period of 2016-17 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015-16.According to sources from National Agriculture Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed), the country exported 24 lakh tonnes of onion during the April-December period of the current financial year as against 6.94 lakh tonne during the same period in 2015-16.NAFED director Nanasaheb Patil attributed the record onion exports to the Centre's export policy. ""The Union government removed the MEP on onions in December 2015 and it has impacted the overseas sale of onion,"" he added.According to him, the Centre has also introduced Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) of 5% for export of onions since August 2016. This has overall led to the rise in onion export.""Considering an export of 2.5 lakh tonne a month on an average, the onion export of the country may touch 30 lakh metric tonne by the end of the current financial year,"" said Patil.Onions from India are exported to countries such as Malaysia, Kuwait, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Norway, Bangladesh, the UK, Russia, Singapore, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, UAE and Italy."

Once looked down upon as a poor man's food, the fruit, which is now being hailed as the new vegan superfood , is making its way into everything from biryanis to burgers.From the unripe pods to seeds and the ripe fruit, all forms of the bumpy green fruit with a golden heart is making its way to Indian meals. Malayalis use it to make everything from vegetable dishes to payasams, for Bengalis, it is the ""gaach patha"" or ""mutton that grows on the tree"". In the West, the chewy pods are fast becoming a substitute for meat while, in India, people are using it to replace carbohydrates.Jackfruit is high in dietary fibre, is a rich source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, and is packed with phytonutrients, which may reduce the risk of many cancers, says Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital.""Vitamin C helps in the absorption of iron,"" she says. The fruit is also a rich source of riboflavin, which helps to heal oral ulcers, and the Vitamin A in it prevents macular degeneration of the eye. ""It is also an important source of magnesium so it further helps in the absorption of calcium, and fights osteoporosis."" It is these health benefits that people abroad are discovering says Regi Mathew, mentor and director of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, a `neo'stalgic gourmet company. Praveen Anand, executive chef at ITC hotels, says it is being used extensively in their hotels. ""In north India, we have kathal (jackfruit) ki biriyani, as well as kormas, and kebabs made of it,"" he says.The fruit is said to be among the top food trends of 2017. ""This January, at the Fancy Food Show in the US, the star ingredient was jackfruit,"" says restaurateur M Mahadevan, adding that it is used as a meat replacer in restaurants in New York and San Francisco.""The young fruit is considered a good replace ment for pulled pork and is served on burgers along with caramelised onion chutney ,"" says Mahadevan. He is planning to stock jackfruit chips and jams in Hot Breads stores there.Entrepreneurs have been quick to spot the marketing potential. Keralite James Joseph gave up a flourishing career with Microsoft to launch Jackfruit365 in 2013. ""I have always wondered why jackfruit doesn't feature on the menu in five-star hotels,"" says Joseph, adding that he realised it was because the fruit was `too sticky, smelly and seasonal'. So he came up with the idea of selling freeze-dried jackfruit.""The ripe fruit can be used to make pies and panna cotta, while the unripe pods can replace meat or tofu,"" says Joseph. After Jackfruit365 became a 100% diabetic diet company , they sell only unripe fruit online. ""The dried, sliced jackfruit can also be powdered and the flour added to idli or dosa batter and phulkas,"" says Joseph.Studies have revealed consumption of unripe jackfruit can help fight high blood sugar level. Bajaj stresses that ripe pods are not good for diabetics. ""The ripe fruit has a glycemic index (GI) of 63, while the unripe pod has a GI of only 52,"" she says.""Since it fills you up it helps cut down on rice and wheat."""

A glut of onions in the market has forced the Mahuva Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) to suspend purchasing onions since Friday. Trading will start again from Monday, but the lack of minimum support price (MSP) for onions is also hitting farmers hard.The secretary of Mahuva APMC , Jaydeep Vaja, said, ""Traders had no place to stock the fresh crop purchased and hence we had to stop trading since Friday. We will again begin trading from Monday.""""The APMC on Saturday had a stock of nearly 90 lakh kg.

This year's crop in Nasik is almost double that of last year.Patel further said that demonetization has increased labour cost and pushed up production cost of onions in the state to Rs 7.50 per kg, while good quality onions are not fetching prices higher than Rs 5 per kg. Lower quality onions are going at Rs 3 per kg said Patel.Patel said that he has written to the state agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, and Mansukh Mandaviya the minister of state for chemicals & fertilizers, and even to Parshottam Rupala, the Union minister of state for agriculture, farmer's welfare and have urged them to have support prices also for vegetables. ""We had even demanded a wagon every day and now we have been getting it for the last three days.""He said that for the last three days, Mahuva was getting nearly two lakh 50-kg bags resulting in a glut. The farmers this year may not get more than five to six rupees per kg this year, said Patel.Not just Mahuva, but even Bhavnagar APMC was also getting around 80,000 bags of onions daily and the price hasn't risen more than Rs 6 per kg for the best quality onion. D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar APMC said that red onions are heading to Punjab and Delhi while the white onions are reserved for the dehydration plants. There are several farmers who have gone in for sowing in February, too, and hence the market would be getting fresh crop till May."
