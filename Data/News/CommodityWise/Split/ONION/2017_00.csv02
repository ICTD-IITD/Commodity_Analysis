It takes about Rs 950 to produce a quintal of onions.Lasalgaon, the largest onion market in the country , is witnessing a glut. It is receiving 40,000 quintals of red onions daily against an average 12,000-15,000 quintals every day . The bumper crop has resulted in traders demanding more railway wagons to transport onions to other parts of the state and country.On Monday too, the rate was ranging from Rs 330 to Rs 600, depending on the quality and size of the crop. At the moment, stocks enough for four days' business are piled up at Lasalgaon and will require at least 40 rakes to transport. The traders have got only get 15 wagons so far.""There has been a close to four times jump in the amount of crop that comes to the market yard.But there has not been any increase in the transportation facilities despite writing to the government,"" said Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC. If the traders were to use road transport, they would require 200 trucks per day , as they can carry only 20 tonnes each. They are also more expensive than the railway wagons.The situation outside the farmers bringing truckloads of produce and not finding even a place to park.""The shelf life of these red onions is one month and currently, it is peak harvest season.Farmers are being forced to accept whatever price as the shelf life is so low and they cannot afford storage costs,"" said an APMC official.This year, the onion crop has been unrewarding for farmers because of high production.Huge losses were also reported due to the four-day traders' strike at Lasalgaon in August 2016.The summer onion crop, whose season ended in October, also fetched low prices. Lack of proper storage facilities and a skewed supply-demand ratio meant that farmers recorded a cumulative loss of 20 lakh tonnes of the summer crop.The state decision to give Rs 100 per quintal to farmers hasn't worked out yet since the Centre, supposed to foot half the bill, has not approved the scheme."

Recent government data shows the rot runs deeper: alongside metros, many of India's tier-II cities are among the worst lot on surfing and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).Amritsar, Lucknow, Alappuzha and Thrissur were among the 10 worst cities where CSAM was shared on multiple occasions in the past six months. Amritsar took top place with more than 4.3 lakh ""files of interest"" - code for child porn - shared between July 1, 2016 and January 15, 2017. Delhi was second, followed by Lucknow.""There are cities like Agra, Kanpur, Barrackpore and Dimapur where we had not seen any surfing for CSAM until six months ago. Here too there is significant growth,"" said a government source. The data is limited to IP addresses originating in the country, but there are several instances of surfers using TOR (The Onion Router) to mask or reroute their IP address, making it appear as if they are based in another country, to avoid being tracked. Online child porn is directly linked to offline child abuse. ""For every child porn video, there is a child abuse victim somewhere. Not only are children abused to make the video, but the same material is then used to groom new victims,"" said Vidya Reddy from Tulir Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse (CPHCSA).""The accessibility and affordability of technology has ensured that child sexual abuse material is more easily available than ever before and there is a lot more peer-to peer sharing than before,"" she added. In fact, Jones was also using a peer-to-peer, file-sharing network, GigaTribe, to stay in contact with 490 'like-minded' friends.Despite the large volume of child porn being shared through private social media groups, reporting remains abysmally low. Mumbai-based NGO Aarambh India , which started a hotline for people to report CSAM, received only 211 complaints in the last four months. And the National Crime Records Bureau has registered just about 1,540 cases of online child sexual abuse in 2015-16. If not for an Interpol alert, Jones too would have flown under the radar.In fact, according to cyber-crime law expert Prashant Mali, few people even realize that watching or downloading child porn is a crime, which of course it is. ""Under the present laws watching or sharing such material is a non-bailable offence attracting up to 7 years imprisonment and a Rs 10 lakh penalty,"" says Mali.A major hurdle in the detection of online CSAM is the international nature of the crime.""A person could ostensibly view porn in India, which may have its server in Russia, its pay-site in Scotland and be hosted in Austria,"" says Reddy of Tulir."

The association said that under such circumstances, they are unable to repay loan and manage their homes. The association will decide its further course of action during the two-day meeting.Shetkari Sanghatna's Nashik district president Arjun Borade said, ""Crops were good this year because of good monsoon. But prices crashed. The farmers could not recover their production or transporting cost. How will they survive in the absence of proper prices for their produce? How will farmers repay loan and how will they ensure education of their children? The government needs to ensure immediate waivers of loans to farmers.""He told TOI, ""Before coming to power at the centre, the BJP had promised better prices to the farmers. But this did not happen. On the contrary, prices of onions and vegetables crashed and the farmers incurred heavy losses. Wheat, pulses and even onions were imported by the government in past two years. This led to decline in crop prices.""The farmer leader also blamed the BJP government's export policy for the sufferings in the agricultural sector. Borade said, ""The government needs to ensure minimum support price (MSP) for onions and other crops. But it did not do this. Prices of various crops and vegetables were badly affected after demonetisation. The market is yet to pick up even after three months since the demonetisation drive. The condition of the farmers is pathetic and the government needs to take immediate measures like waiver of loans for the farmers' survival.""In the meantime, the average wholesale onion prices increased marginally after the country's largest wholesale onion market Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) reopened after three-day holiday on Monday.The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon increased marginally by 4% to Rs 520 on Monday, as against Rs 500 a quintal on the last working day on Friday. The markets were closed due to holidays from Friday to Sunday.The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 350 and Rs 620 per quintal, respectively. Around 27,000 quintals of onions were auctioned on Monday.Onion prices in the state recent touched a five-year low. The average price farmers have fetched for a quintal has been Rs450.Officials said the dip in price is due to bumper production in the state. Lack of storage and processing infrastructure to increase the shelf life of the produce has left farmers at the mercy of traders, who are consistently quoting low prices. Some farmers have set their onions on fire, as they were not even getting the basic input cost.Lasalgaon was getting 30,000-35,000 quintals of red onions every day in February, as against the average 12,000. The bumper production resulted in traders demanding more railway wagons to transport onions to other parts of the state and country.""The shelf life of onions is a month; there is so much stock at the market yard, which will take 20 days to clear if we get adequate transport and the stock keeps increasing every day,"" said a market committee official. They want 40 wagons to transport onions, but they are getting 15-18 wagons."

What's more, it may also be sweeter and better than the current crop.The Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a new onion variety called 'multiplier onion variety,' which would make this possible.It is presently undergoing tests at multiple locations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to evaluate its performance in different weather conditions. Scientists said initial findings of the tests are positive and have achieved the desired results so far.They added that the variety is expected to be released nationwide in 2019.Project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of DOGR told TOI, ""There is no special variety of onion for south Indian dishes that has been released at the national level. So far, farmers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are cultivating varieties developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). But the yield of these varieties is limited. Hence, we decided to develop the special variety, which can be recommended at national-level for other states farmers to grow it.""The variety, named DOGR-1549-Agg, is the first multiplier onion genotype registered with the ICAR-NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources) in New Delhi.Commenting on the variety's strength, Gupta said, ""It matures early and is suitable for both Kharif (July-October) and Rabi (October-March) seasons. It has an average yield potential of 22 tonnes to 24 tonnes per hectare."" Gupta added that the variety has six small bulbs per cluster.Presently, farmers in South India are growing TNAU-developed onion variety called CO(On)5, which can grow only in Rabi season and has a yield capacity of 18.9 tonnes per hectare. Each cluster of this variety produces three to five bulbs, Gupta said.TNAU's horticulture department head T Saraswati told TOI, ""This is a positive development for growers as they can get high harvest. Secondly, if this variety is released nationally, states other than the southern ones can also grow it.""When specifically asked about the taste of the newly-developed variety, Gupta said, ""Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is a crucial factor as it defines sugar percentage in the onion. The TSS of CO(On)5 is around 12%, whereas TSS in our variety is between 16% and 22%. Hence, it will be suitable for South Indian dishes."""

The rakes usually carry onion from Niphad, Kherwadi, Manmad, Lasalgaon, Dhule, Chalisgaon, Nandgaon and Nashik.An official of the Bhusawal Division of Central Railways said that it has been decided that the number of rakes to carry onions will only be four from now.""We will have the rakes as ordered by the minister, but it is likely that if the turnaround time takes longer, then the situation will be difficult,"" a railway official said.The onion merchants have welcome the move of the Central Railways.

While turmeric prices are showing signs of falling despite the harvest season setting in, prices of small and big onions have risen by 30% in the last two weeks. Farmers attribute the change in prices to the fall in quality of the turmeric yield and drop in the quantity of the small onion yield.Turmeric farmers in Erode say the acreage under full-fledged cultivation of the spice had fallen from 10,000 hectares in 2015-'16 to less than 7,000 hectares in 2016 because of the complete failure of the southwest and northeast monsoons. The lack of rainfall and moisture led to the yield of the crop falling by almost 50%, says P K Deivasigamani, secretary of the Turmeric Farmers Association of India.The present situation would naturally create a short supply of turmeric in the market thereby fall in price of the spice. In Perundurai wholesale market, the price of turmeric on Tuesday fell from Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,000 per quintal. ""Good quality turmeric coming in from Mysore is still selling at Rs 8,500 and Rs 8,700 a quintal in Erode market,"" says general secretary of the Federation of All Trade and Industries' Association, Erode, V K Rajamanickam.""However, the prices are dropping in most markets because they are being flooded with stored turmeric harvested as long as two years ago. Their quality is not good,"" he said.The turmeric harvest season in the western region, especially in Erode which is considered as one of the largest turmeric producing districts in the country, begins immediately post-Pongal. However, this year due to the drought that prevailed throughout 2016, the harvest was postponed by most farmers.""There are a lot of farmers who despite the drought sowed turmeric in at least half their land. But they are unable to harvest it because the crop has not even matured and has even begun drying up. So they can't cut it,"" says Raja Manickam. ""The yield is very low,"" he adds.Agriculture marketing experts believe that the drop in cultivation and yield of turmeric in Erode will lead to the turmeric yield in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra setting the price trend for the spice.""Usually the yield and prices in Erode set the trend for turmeric pricing across the country, but this year since the rain was better in Maharashtra and central India leading to their yield being better, they would become the bigger market players. Their produce will even start flowing into western region markets,"" says Rajamanickam.On the other hand, shoppers saw the prices of both small and big onions go up by almost 30%. ""The price of small onions, which were around Rs 18 to Rs 20/kg around 10 days ago at Raja Street vegetable market, went up to Rs 30 in Uzhavar Sandhais and all retail shops,"" said a housewife in R S Puram, S Saraswathi. ""The price of big onions too which were around Rs 15/kg went up to Rs 20 last week,"" she said.Onion wholesalers say the prices went up because the supply had begun falling over the past 10 days or so. ""Usually 3,000 sacks of small onion are unloaded at MGR Market every day, but the number has fallen to 2,000 sacks. So farmers have begun charging Rs 15 to Rs 18/ kg as the wholesale rate, so the prices have gone up in the retail market,"" said D Sivaraj, a wholesaler at T K Market."

Onions continue to fetch Rs380-460 per quintal, as against the production cost of Rs 950 per quintal at the Lasalgaon AMPC market , Asia's largest onion market yard. Compared to last year, there has been over-production of 25 lakh metric tonnes of onions.Although only about 10% onions grown in the country have been exported, the figure is important to keep price parity in wholesale markets.Exporters said the central government's decision of giving a 6% export subsidy helped push some of the produce out of India.According to figures from the market committee, a daily supply of 30,000-35,000 tonnes is coming in to the market yard, as against 12,000-15,000 tonnes last year.Due to good rain and increase in area under production, it has been a bumper crop but the prices that slid last December due to demonetisation are struggling to stabilize even now, the fag end of the season.An exporter from Nashik said there was demand for Indian onions abroad and they fetched good prices. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are some buyers.Bumper production in states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka too has been cited as the reason for the glut, which had ensured that prices remain subdued throughout the year. State government officials said there have also been issues with storage in market yards. The entire dip in price and other losses due to rotting and lack of storage capacity is estimated to be close to Rs 800 crore."

Refuting the police version that Angelo died under a train after running away from custody on April 18, 2014, a witness said, ""The entire incident of assault and severe beating took place in front of me. It was not possible for Richie (Agnelo) to run from custody as he was severely beaten. Police are trying to cover up by making a false claim of this train accident.""On Monday the matter came up before the special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court. Three cops accused under the act were represented by advocate Prabhanjay Dave. The case was adjourned to February 23.The witness said Agnelo's name was not written in the case papers drawn up on the night of April 16, 2014. He said when he asked an accused cop, Suresh Mane, why Agnelo was not taken with others for the mandatory medical check up prior to being produced before the magistrate next day, he was told his father had agreed to give them Rs 2 lakh. ""I said it was not possible,"" the witness said. He and another accused said it was on April 19, while they were re-produced before a magistrate, that cops told them about the death.A witness who was allegedly made to perform oral sex on the minor and Agnelo, said another cop, Vikas Suryavanshi, attempted to push a wooden rod up into his private part while he was hung upside down.""When they failed, Mane and Satyajith Kamble said if I didn't reveal who has the stolen chain, they will sprinkle petrol on my private parts,"" he said. The witness stated the torture meted out to Agnelo left him suffering like a ""fish out of water"".Referring to the afternoon of April 17, 2014, he said, ""Richie was screaming for help saying he needs medical attention. Foam started coming out of his mouth.`Pathan' officer threw some water on his face. He gave Richie an onion and chappal and kept it near his nose. Richie regained consciousness only in the evening,"" the witness said. He said when Agnelo repeatedly sought medical help, the woman officer abused him: ""Tu tadap tadap kar mar.."" (Die in pain).Agnelo's brother Reagan told the CBI his brother was picked up in the wee hours of April 16, 2014, from their grandparents' home at Dharavi. He and the brother of another accused said they saw cops beating one of the trio who was forced to lie naked. He stated on the night of April17, 2014, his fat her told him Agnelo was not produced in court with the others. Reagan said at 10.30am on April 18, 2014, he received a call from Agnelo asking him to get him some glucose and clothes at noon.""He said throughout the night he was thrashed very badly by the police and was giddy."" He said his brother was not in the lock up when he reached at 11.45am and cops told him since he was slightly injured, he was taken to Sion Hospital and would return shortly. ""I sat there for nearly one-and-ahalf hour, then I got a call from my father informing me about my brother's death.""The statements are part of a supplementary chargesheet submitted by the CBI last month accusing three of the eight cops from Wadala railway police under the POCSO Act, in addition to assault, wrongful confinement, and negligence in custody . The minor, who was 15 at the time of the incident, alleged Mane, Suryavanshi and Kamble had forced one of the accused to perform oral sex on him and Agnelo. The minor told the investigating agency that he was absolutely ""helpless and felt ashamed and bad when this happened, but blindly obeyed the orders of the accused."" He further said that Mane threatened him and Agnelo and said that if they didn't partake in the act, they would be beaten.The tales of torture described by the witnesses are horrific. If they are found to be reliable by the court, the policemen accused in the case must be held accountable and stringent punishment must be handed out to them to set an example that those in uniform will not be spared."

But, in a bid to remain in power, Akhilesh has joined hands with the party that tried to kill his father,"" Modi said at a rally in Gursaiganj of Chhi bramau assembly segment on Wednesday .On March 4, 1984, Mulayam's car was fired at by some persons while he was on his way from Etawah to Lucknow, and the name of a top Yadav leader of the Congress had figured in the case. Mulayam has mentioned the allegation in the past and repeated it during the recent Yadav family internal feud.""Akhilesh doesn't realise Congress's cunning; Mulayam knew it well,"" Modi said.""Kya rajneeti itni gir gayi hai ki kursi ke moh mein iss prakaar ke kaand kiye jaayein? (Has politics fallen so low that such shenanigans should become the norm)?"" Modi asked. Recalling the incident, Modi said, ""Fed up with Mulayam Singh's attacks when he was leader of the opposition in UP Vidhan Parishad , the Congress got shots fired at him on March 4, 1984, but he escaped. I want to tell Akhilesh that he should have remembered this before sitting in the lap of the Congress.""The PM added, ""A film is being played on the political stage of Uttar Pradesh in which the opponents, who had attacked each other with slogans such as `27 saal UP behal' and taken out `yatras' in the first half, have turned friends. It's copy of a Bollywood masala film in which foes turn friends after interval.""Modi not only kept Akhilesh in his crosshairs, but also asked the Congress to clear its stand on its relation with BSP.Citing the first joint press conference of Akhilesh and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in Lucknow, Modi said, ""When Akhilesh was asked about his stand on the BSP, he clearly mentioned his views. However, by stating that he respected the BSP chief, Rahul made it clear that the Congress is keeping its one leg tied with SP and the other with the BSP in the race for power. But, they should keep in mind that they can't defeat BJP , which is running on two legs.""Reaching out to vot ers in Kannauj which falls in the Lok Sabha constituency repre sented by Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav, Mo di praised the state unit of his party for including a promise to fix minimum support price for potato, onion and garlic in its poll manifesto.""My government had announced 100% FDI in food processing sector as it believes that farmers will start getting better price for their produce only after proper processing,"" said Modi. The Prime Minister mocked Akhilesh for `failing' to fulfil his 2012 promise to bring processing units to Kannauj. He also targeted Rahul, saying ""a leader, who does not know whether potatoes are grown in field or is manufactured in factory , should not talk about the issues of farmers"".Modi alleged that the Samajwadi Party government did not use Central funds for providing cheaper foodgrain to the poor and feed the inmates of orphanages and shelter homes free of cost.""The Congress and Samajwadi Party recall the poor only at the time of elections,"" he charged."
58f5d30e7be9e01a357a7fa9,"Not onion or garlic, politics and logistics deal-breaker: Iskcon",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/not-onion-or-garlic-politics-and-logistics-deal-breaker-iskcon/articleshow/57954293.cms,2017-04-01,"BENGALURU: The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) on Friday dismissed the government's 'no onion, no garlic' justification to scrap the MoU signed with it for supplying food to 198 Indira Canteens in Bengaluru. Iskcon , in fact, hinted at politics behind the issue.According to government and Iskcon sources, pressure from the hoteliers' lobby is said to have led to scrapping the deal, as this section felt any move to centralize the system by getting Ikscon alone to supply food would hurt its business immensely. ""Hoteliers were worried that if Iskcon supplies food across the city, then they'd lose a substantial portion of their business at specific high-volume locations,"" said a senior government official. Result: Indira Canteens will now be decentralised, with the government likely to call for tenders at a more local level and have hoteliers in the vicinity bid to supply subsidized food.""Iskcon is committed to supplying hygienic, quality and tasty food. We are happy the government has taken a decision in this regard by inviting tenders. We will move on,"" said an Iskcon spokesperson. However, sources within the society said they were being forced out simply because of logistical issues and politics and that not using onion and garlic was just an ""excuse"".According to Iskcon, its Akshya Patra Foundation supplies to canteens in five other states apart from Karnataka (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Odisha) and there too the food served doesn't have onion or garlic. However, those governments are happy with the quality and taste, it said.The organization also points to logistical concerns. Considering the mid-day meal scheme is its primary focus, it'd be difficult to supply three meals a day, it said. ""If we were to supply food for three meals, then the focus would shift from our primary goal of mid-day meal for kids. While politics has been a prime factor, the change in plan (earlier the talk was about supplying one meal a day. Later it changed to three) was also a reason,"" said a member of Iskcon.The government also admitted logistics was a deal-breaker, considering Iskcon may not be able to offer variety and would stick to a certain menu with its centralized kitchen.""With hoteliers, not only will food be available faster, there will be also more variety at the canteens,"" said an official.A ccording to government sources, the canteen contracts will now be packaged for 10 or 15 wards and bids will be called for a single hotelier to supply breakfast, lunch and dinner. The government is expected to consider only those hotels which have large chains or networks in the city. This is to maintain uniformity in hygiene and quality of food. Besides, the government may supply the ingredients through its public distribution system to ease burden on the state exchequer."
58f5d4387be9e01a357a80b3,Over 100 farmer suicides this year in drought-prone Marathwada,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/over-100-farmer-suicides-this-year-in-drought-prone-marathwada/articleshow/57546590.cms,2017-03-09,"MUMBAI: Despite claims by CM Devendra Fadnavis that the agrarian crisis was being tackled on war footing, 117 farmers ended their lives in Maharashtra's drought-prone Marathwada region in the first two months of 2017. In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed.Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. ""We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides,"" Tiwari said. ""We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention. A plan needs to be worked out to provide education to farmers' children and financial assistance for healthcare.""In 2016, production of tur, tomato, onion and most vegetables doubled and even tripled but farm gate prices dipped. Onion was sold for Rs 460 per quintal as against the production cost of Rs 950. Tur farmers were paid less than the minimum support price (MSP) in wholesale markets. The MSP for tur was Rs 5,050 and traders were purchasing it at Rs 4200-4400 per quintal.However, a comparison with figures for the previous year show a marginal decline in toll. According to data, 3,052 farmers ended their lives in 2016, of which 1,053 cases were from Aurangabad, which falls in Marathwada region. The 117 cases recorded in 2017, if seen against the average bi-monthly rate for the previous year, indicates a slight downturn. Incidentally, the same trend is visible for 2015 and 2016. Against a total of 3,052 farmers who killed themselves in 2016, the toll was higher at 3,228 in 2015, which was a drought year.Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said over the last two and half years, 9,000 farmers have killed themselves. ""We demand that Fadnavis declare a total loan waiver to protect the farmers' lives."" Patil led an opposition delegation recently which called on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand."
