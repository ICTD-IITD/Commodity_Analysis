In a bid to match the demand and supply, the union government is planning to export most of the onions.The onion export of the country has increased to 16.43 lakh metric tonnes in the first seven months (April-October) of 2016-17 financial year, against 5.07 lakh metric tonnes in the corresponding period last financial year. This has not benefited the farmers as the wholesale onion prices have declined due to a rise in arrival of the produce while they are yet to manage their production cost. Due to this reason, the government has asked NAFED to export onions so that prices will get stabilised.The production of onions this year has been around 25 lakh metric tonnes. The minimum export price (MEP) of onions is zero and the government has introduced 5% subsidy (MEIS) for onion exporters from August 26, which will be in effect up to March 31. The export has not increased though.It costs farmers around Rs 950 per quintal for growing onions and they incur losses if they get a price below that. The average wholesale onion price at the country's largest wholesale market, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), has declined to the range of Rs 500-550 per quintal, putting farmers in huge losses. While the daily arrival of onions is around 15,000 quintals a day at Lasalgaon, it has increased to the range of 30-35,000 quintals a day now.A NAFED source said, ""We have just conducted a survey at the Lasalgaon APMC to check the possibility of onion exports. We are mulling to export 30 metric tonne of onion a day. It is a part of the government policy to export maximum onions and stabilise the wholesale onion prices so that farmers will not incur losses. The money required for the export is to be used under the PSF."""

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 251 and Rs 588 per quintal respectively on Tuesday. Around 25,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon the same day.An APMC official said that the harvest of the highly perishable kharif crop is in full swing and it is highly perishable. ""Summer crop is stored for around six months, but the shelf life or kharif onions are less than one month. Farmers have no option, but to sell the commodity at the prevailing market rates. Currently, there have been huge arrivals in the market and it is almost double in the range from 25,000 to 35,000 quintals a day,"" the official said.Daily arrival is around 15,000 quintal a day and now stands at 25,000 to 35,000 quintal a day. Onion prices have continued to drop even after the government extended 5% Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) subsidy for onion exporters up to March 31 because of the rise in arrival of onions. In the city's retail market, onions are being sold in the range of Rs 10 to Rs 15 a kg.Nanasaheb Patil, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) director, said, ""The production cost to grow onions is around Rs 950 a quintal and farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. The government has extended a 5% subsidy for onion exporters up to March 31, but the average wholesale onion prices have continued to decline. The rise in arrival of the crop as compared to the demand has led to the drop in wholesale onion prices.""He added that though the government has extended subsidy benefits to onion exporters, the export is not taking place as needed. So, wholesale onion prices have continued to decline in the past one month.Patil said that the government needs to make efforts to increase onion exports through central agencies like NAFED and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). ""Such agencies should be given targets of 5 lakh metric tonne each under the Price Stability Funds (PSF) to stabilise onion prices in domestic markets,"" he said."

The strike is set to enter the fourth day on Monday. While prices of some vegetables have crashed, there's glut of others because they aren't being lifted from the city and its neighbouring villages. Also, some vegetables have become dearer as they aren't being ferried to the city, leading to a shortage.""I got my last delivery of onions three days ago. I was supposed to receive another shipment on Monday, but now that doesn't seem likely,"" said Seyid, 21, a vendor in KR Market . While Seyid continued to sell onions at the same price as before, he said he might be forced to jack up the rates if he doesn't get new stock soon.Pushpa and Venkateshappa get their provisions from the Kalasipalya wholesale market. The couple normally trades in cauliflowers, drumsticks and carrots. ""It's very bad. We last got a delivery two days ago. We haven't been getting anything fresh. The cauliflowers have begun to rot. I usually sell each cauliflower head for Rs 25-30. Now, with everything spoiling, I wouldn't even get Rs 10 for a piece,"" said Pushpa, adding normally she would sell carrots and drumsticks for Rs 15-20 per kilo, but the prices have shot up to Rs 35-40 due to the strike.Pyarejaan, 64, who gets onions from the Yeshwanthpur APMC four times a week, said he hasn't faced any problem so far, but might in a couple of days when he'll run out of stock. Ibraz Khan, a wholesaler in Kalasipalya, gets his produce from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. While his prevailing stocks will last for a few days, he says he isn't receiving new shipments.""If there is a shortage of a particular vegetable, the price will rise. But if there is an excess, we'll have to lower the prices substantially,"" he said. ""Since truckers are on strike in south India, I'll have to pay Rs 5,000-15,000 extra to those ferrying potatoes from northern states,"" he added.Ilias, a potato, onion and garlic wholeseller, said that his stock will last only two more days. ""Price per bori (50kg sack) has gone up by Rs 50. Additionally, we were earlier selling onions at Rs 10 per kg; now the price has increased to Rs 15,"" he said.""As of now vans and tempos seem to be doing most of the transporting, something that may not be sustainable in the long run as they aren't equipped for inter-state deliveries,"" he added.Vendors in Russel Market were largely unaware of the ongoing strike and said business is continuing as usual. Aslam Amin, a vendor, said three tempos come from the City Market every day with his stock, and that the strike hasn't disrupted this schedule. ""Our stock will last for another week, so we haven't been affected. However, if the strike continues, we might have a problem,"" said Mushtaq Ahmed, a vendor who gets his vegetables from Yeshwantpur and Kalasipalya markets.Noor, a small-time vendor, gets 10-15 kg of each vegetable every day, but received his last shipment two days ago. ""If this goes on, I won't have anything to sell,"" he said.Truckers are protesting the Centre's move to scrap old vehicles and levy toll on state highways, and are demanding a reduction in third-party premium paid to insurance firms.Not in a mood to relent, truckers intensified their strike on Sunday with nearly 23 lakh vehicles transporting important commodities staying off the roads.G R Shanmugappa, president of the Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association, said they'd continue their protest till they get a response from the central government and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).""Some 23 lakh trucks stayed off the roads on Sunday throughout the south zone. We have also got an assurance from LPG association workers that they'll support us in our protest. There are only three filling stations for the four southern states - in Mangaluru, Vizag and Salem and they have informed us that they'll not go in for filling. We are also in talks with petrol and diesel association workers who have said they will join us from Monday,"" he said.The truckers are protesting high insurance premiums and scrapping of old vehicles. According to Shanmugappa, private insurance companies are hand in glove with central government agencies as well as IRDA to ensure that decisions benefit them alone. ""They do this once a year. Hike the rates and wait for the money to flow in. They earn crores through this. But we'll not give up till we get some respite,"" he said.However, the truckers' leader said they had not interfered with the supply of certain crucial commodities. ""We have not disrupted transportation of some essential commodities like milk, medicines and water because we don't want the public to suffer. However, the supply of wheat flour, corn meal, finger millet and other foodgrains has been affected,"" he said.Commenting on the strike, chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said that he has directed transport minister Ramalinga Reddy to hold meetings with the truckers' association to resolve the issue soon."

Recent government data shows the rot runs deeper: alongside metros, many of India's tier-II cities are among the worst lot on surfing and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Amritsar, Lucknow, Alappuzha and Thrissur were among the 10 worst cities where CSAM was shared on multiple occasions in the past six months. Amritsar took top place with more than 4.3 lakh ""files of interest""  code for child porn  shared between July 1, 2016 and January 15, 2017. Delhi was second, followed by Lucknow.""There are cities like Agra, Kanpur, Barrackpore and Dimapur where we had not seen any surfing for CSAM (child sexual abuse material) until six months ago. Here too there is significant growth,"" said a government source.The data is limited to IP addresses originating in the country, but there are several instances of surfers using TOR (The Onion Router) to mask or reroute their IP address, making it appear as if they are based in another country, to avoid being tracked. Online child porn is directly linked to offline child abuse ""For every child porn video, there is asomewhere,"" said Vidya Reddy from Tulir  Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse. ""The accessibility of technology has ensured that CSAM is more easily available than ever before,"" she added. In fact, Jones was also using a peer-to-peer, filesharing network  Giga-Tribe, to stay in contact with 490 'like-minded' friends.Despite the large volume of child porn being shared through private social media groups, reporting remains abysmally low. The National Crime Records Bureau has registered just about 1,540 cases of online child sexual abuse in 2015-16. If not for an Interpol alert, Jones too would have flown under the radar. In fact, according to cyber crime law expert Prashant Mali, few people even realise that watching or downloading child porn is a crime.""Under the present laws, watching or sharing such material is a non-bailable offence attracting up to 7 years imprisonment and a Rs 10 lakh penalty,"" says Mali. A major hurdle in the detection of online CSAM is the international nature of the crime. ""A person could ostensibly view porn in India, which may have its server in Russia, its pay-site in Scotland and be hosted in Austria,"" says Reddy of Tulir. ""We need a transnational police force with state-ofthe-art forensic laboratories and a cohesive policy ."" A step in the right direction was taken this week by Union minister Maneka Gandhi, who announced the establishment of a national alliance that would coordinate with law enforcement agencies, ministries, information technology experts, Interpol, and NGOs to curb the proliferation of CSAM online. The alliance will achieve its objective by blocking websites that host CSAM, setting up a hotline for complaints and placing restrictions on the travel of known sex offenders into the country. The minister has already written to the MEA asking for such visa restrictions be put in place."

These practices were determined after examining 463 samples of food collected from across the city, and the way they were handled from storage to serving.Accordingly, testing for food-borne pathogens revealed that most of the carrots used in the samples and over three-quarters of onion  two commonly-used vegetables  were contaminated with the bacteria escherichia coli. The bacteria, known to be a part of the human gut flora, are expelled in faecal matter. Though not all, some types of E.coli can cause serious illnesses.The study was published in the British Food Journal.The study is part of the institutes larger efforts to improve food safety standards in the city. Partnering with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and civil society organisations, researchers at the institute have developed a training module based on the findings. A few vendors have also been trained. The training suggestions are low-cost measures to get more vendors to adopt them.Among the common high-risk practices examined in the study, which have been addressed in the training module, researchers found that pani puri vendors, who did not wash their hands with soap, had higher risk of contaminating the delicacy with fecal coliforms like E.coli. In all, about 150 samples of pani puri were analysed.Researchers also estimated that leaving peeled or cut fruits and vegetables uncovered, made them 13 times riskier to consume than ingredients well stored.Besides street food, studies in the past have also assessed quality of ice creams sold by pushcart vendors.A study published last year by food and nutrition researchers of Osmania University found that about a third of samples tested were contaminated due to poor hygienic conditions at point of preparation and subsequent inadequacies in handling."
