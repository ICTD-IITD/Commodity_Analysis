Prices are expected to rise in the coming two months if there is no relief.A kg of beans is presently being sold at Rs. 100 plus in the retail market, while carrots are being sold at around Rs. 80 a kg. Beans are presently being cultivated only in Malur region, where too, the crop has been severely hit.Brinjals are being sold at an unprecedented Rs. 60 plus levels a kg. The prices of greens and cucumber  much in demand during summer have also seen a big jump in their prices. A measure of sabbakki greens is presently sold at a whopping Rs. 105.All the gourds are trading at high rates. Other vegetables like ladys finger, beetroot and radish are also being sold at higher than usual rates at Rs. 38, Rs. 40 and Rs. 32 respectively. Coconut prices have been trading at the higher end of Rs. 30-Rs. 33 for the past two months and has seen no correction.A senior procurement official at a leading retail chain in the city said that the chief problem had been fall in supplies. Some of the vegetables like gourds, cauliflower, beetroot and others are of very poor quality and even if one is ready to pay more, there is no quality product available in the market, he said.S.H. Keshav, manager, procurement and marketing, Hopcoms, said the arrival of most of the vegetables have fallen by over 40% and if the pre-monsoon rain failed in the coming months, the vegetable market would only head further northwards.G. Muniswamy Gowda, a vegetable farmer from Chennarayapatna on the city outskirts said, water scarcity and rising temperature had hit the crops severely. The water levels in the borewells have fallen in the last one month and there isnt enough water available for the crops. It is for the first time in the last many years that we are not cultivating our full 8 acres of land, but only a part of it, he said.The only vegetables to be trading at affordable prices are onions and potatoes which are below Rs. 20 a kg. The climate is now apt for onions and the market is being flooded with a good supply, said a leading onion merchant at the APMC Yard in Yeshwanthpur. Though tomatoes are being sold at Rs. 25-Rs. 27 a kg, they are of a poor quality, said a wholesaler trader."

Within six months, they got the best results by growing a minimum of 3 to 4 quintals of onion seeds in an acre of land. Krishi Vigyan Kendra scientist Sarvagnay Salimath said that amidst severe drought, farmers in the district decided to support the authorities in conducting the systematic experiment and succeeded. Farmers used to depend on dealers from other States to get onion seeds, but their problem would be sorted now as they would get them at low cost in the district itself.At present, the good quality onion seeds cost around Rs. 2,000 per packet and if farmers get yield by cultivating them, they can earn profit, he said.Farmers Revanna, Ravindra and Rajappa, who have grown onion seeds, said that the move would play a crucial role in ensuring good profit to farmers who are in pathetic condition owing to drought. Easy availability of seeds would make farmers take up more cultivation of the onion crop, they said."

KarthikeyanG_KARTHIKEYAN;G_KARTHIKEYAN - G_KARTHIKEYANAcute drought and sharp depletion of groundwater table weighed down horticulturists at several villages in Dindigul union. The worst-affected were drumstick growers.Chettiyapatti, Kalikampatti, Munnilaikottai, Nadupatti and adjacent areas were major drumstick production centres in the union. Drumstick has also been cultivated as intercrop in tomato and onion fields.Several farmers preferred hybrid plant variety of drumstick to traditional variety for better yield and little maintenance.Already, several bore wells and open wells at these villages dried up owing to the acute drought, creating a shortage of water for irrigation. Residents have been running from pillar to post for water for drinking and other purposes.With no sources to maintain regular supply, horticulturists have started purchasing water from Dindigul and nearby areas to protect the standing crops.S. Palani, farmer in Kalikkampatti, said though drumstick crop was drought- tolerant, a minimum quantity of water was required to keep the plant alive.The plants should be irrigated at least once in two or three days. We had to shell out a sizable amount of money for water. Suppliers deliver water in lorries and tractors, he added.Intermittent showers in the past two days brought some relief. But it was only temporary and it would not help the horticulturists in the long run, he added.The farmers in area said already debt burden had been haunting many who had small land holdings.Several fund- starved farmers were in distress as they could not afford to buy water to protect the standing crops. Now their fate was in the hands of rain god, they said."
58fbd25ca3d24b44f321f598,The breakfast story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-breakfast-story/article17660948.ece,2017-03-25,"On some Sundays, my breakfast consists of two fluffy bhatureys with a good helping of chholey, and some onion slices and pickled carrots and chillies on the side. I go to the local sweetshop for this, and I find that their fare is usually good. But the last time I got our breakfast packed from this busy eatery, I was a bit disappointed. The chholey was fine but the bhatureys were a little hard. They reminded me of bedmi, and suddenly I yearned for the bedmi and hot aloo sabzis that Chandni Chowk is known for.Vegetarian sideOnce the stomach demands, the body obeys. So a few days ago, I decided that while the weather was still bearable, I needed to go to Purani Dilli. I had gone there in the evening once and had my fill of kababs. Now I needed to go to the vegetarian part of the Walled City in the daytime for bedmi aloo.Think bedmi, and you think of Shiv Misthan Bhandar. This is an old, old shop on the mouth of Kucha Ghasiram (Shop no. 375, phone no. 23921406). This is near the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, away from the Red Fort end. The shop has just 11 items on the menu.If you are there in the mornings, you can breakfast on nagori halwa (Rs. 60), a delicious dish of small puris which you pierce in the middle (the way golgappas come) and stuff with halwa and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo (Rs. 90), they have chholey bhaturey (Rs. 80), and kachori and samosa (Rs. 50). They sell six kinds of sweets  jalebi and imarti (Rs. 500 a kilo), gulab jamun (Rs. 450), suji halwa (Rs. 400), mung dal halwa (Rs. 450) and malpua (Rs. 400). You can also buy them by plate  two imartis, for instance, are for Rs. 60 and two pieces of jalebi for Rs. 50.When I used to go there earlier, you had to stand and eat. Now the place has expanded at the back and there is seating for at least 30 people. If you are eating there, helpers keep filling your slot for sabzi and chholey if they find it empty. I, of course, took the bedmis home  and had a delicious lunch of two big puris stuffed with a dal paste, a nicely runny potato sabzi and lightly cooked chholey. I had all this with some tart methi chutney and pickles.The best thing about Shiv Misthan Bhandar is that every dish is cooked in desi ghee. I love the flavour and taste of ghee, so bedmi fried in ghee is like ambrosia for me. And because there are only 11 items on the menu (unlike the big vegetarian fast food chains, where you get everything these days from pizzas and pasta to noodles and burgers and bhatureys and chaat), Shiv Misthan keeps a strict check on quality. I have been eating their food for years, and find that it is as good as it was when I first went there long years ago.The place is known for its chholey bhaturey and imartis, too. And I firmly believe that their jalebi is a lot better than the thick ones that you get in Dariba. Shiv Misthans jalebi is juicy, yet crisp. And its delicious when eaten hot, just off the kadai.My craving for bedmi aloo has been met. But its been a while since I had Shiv Misthans nagori halwa. One day soon, I tell myself."

The Interior Ministry had also placed Saeed and 37 other JuD and FIF members on Exit Control List, barring them from leaving Pakistan.At the rallies in several parts of Pakistan today, the participants demanded the immediate release of Saeed.In Lahore, Yakjahtee (solidarity) Kashmir Conference was held at Nasser Bagh in which a large number of activists of JuD and FIF participated. They shouted slogans against Pakistan, Indian and the US governments for detaining Saeed, and said the Nawaz Sharif government was damaging the country's image by maintaining friendship with the Narendra Modi government.""Pakistani nation is united for Hafiz Saeed's release,"" said JuD central leader Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, who is also the brother-in-law of Saeed. He said unfortunately due to Saeed's detention ""our message of solidarity to Kashmiris is not that powerful and encouraging this year"".The Sharif government, he said, should make its stance clear on Kashmir and tell the people of Pakistan that it is loyal to Kashmiris, and not India.Makki said trade of potato and onion with India is not right. ""Treacherous plot of giving India the Most Favoured Nation status will not be successful,"" he said."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

The fishing hamlet instantly switched into a mode of frenzy as people on streets run back their home, shoving their children inside and bolting the doors.The residents peep into the streets from the little windows or holes in their house. It takes a while before they breathe easy again, after being certain it was a false alarm.Nadukuppam, a fishing hamlet on Lloyds Road, was a seemingly innocent victim to the clashes between police and the public. The residents who wanted to go fishing on Monday morning were denied access by the police.People alleged that the police harassed even innocent people because of what people asserted was a personal vendetta. They found the chance when protesters from the Marina, who were being chased found refuge in the slum, claim aggrieved residents.Abirami Raji*, an eight-year-old girl slowly steps out of her with a panic-stricken face after the false alarm. Tears roll down her cheeks. Her father was allegedly beaten up and hauled away by the police from the Light House metro station.1) The Nadukuppam fish market which was burnt down; 2) an inconsolable resident of the slum, who was injured in the violence; 3) charred remains of fish in the Nadukuppam market; 4) a resident of the slum sporting neem-and-tamarind paste on his injured legs; 5) another resident showing welts on his back;6) a resident who was attacked during the scuffle; 7) charred remains of vehicles, near the City Centre Mall in the city on Tuesday | ASHWIN PRASATHShe joins the parade of people who hesitantly walk toward the fish market that was burned down on Monday. The police walked off. Theyre not coming to our kuppam, announces an elderly man standing amid the markets charred debris. He sends a wave of relief across the hamlet with that message.I was standing near the ration shop on 8th Street. I was wearing a black shirt. The shirt was torn like paper and I wasnt treated any better, says Srirajan, a resident. He points to swollen legs and shoulders and back that are marked by blood clots.I was beaten, dragged to the streets end and dumped into a white van in which women police were eating. They beat me more, stamped me with their shoes and dumped me near the lighthouse.Nesam K, a 55-year old woman, lifts her saree to show a swollen leg on which she applied turmeric paste.Among them is a 31-year-old woman who cries for a different reason. Neither I, nor my husband was at home. We came back to find our whole house upside-down, she says.Her husband Kirubakaran walks to his house and carries the wooden door thats completely come off its hinges. Inside their little house, the washing machine has toppled with clothes strewn all around the 8x8 living room, the rice pot had spilt on the floor, their table fan stood broken and almost every object was misplaced. Our house was locked. Why would they break into it? she asked.While house-doors and windows were damaged causing severe loss, the major fire that destroyed their market and vehicles has caused immense loss to the fishing community.Behind Maniamma* (81) is a cart filled with about 50 kgs of burnt onions. The women police used powder, and the gents used diesel and tear-gas shell, she says. The woman police sprayed a white-coloured powder on the floor and the circle immediately caught fire.They threw this powder through the market. Thats how my onion cart caught fire, she wails. White phosphorus, on exposure to air, catches fire immediately. It only requires 30 degrees Centigrade to burn. It produces intense smoke which masks the origin of the fire.Sivagami A* adds, Nearly 200 fish vendors sell in this market. The women police used that powder to burn this and then took this fire and lit that auto. Then they used this fire to burn two more autos, one van and a car. She adds that a cloth dipped in diesel was wrapped around a stick to set their vehicles on fire. Others agreed wholeheartedly.Divya, who also used to sell fish in the burnt market pulls out a gunny bag from behind her and produces four objects. One might tell me that we threw this stone, But did we use this broken lathi? Did we burn these tear-gas shells? Did we use these black rubber bullets? she asks as she produces one object after another.*Names changed"

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T.
