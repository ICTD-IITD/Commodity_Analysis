The chefs special biriyani arrives with a heap of golden onion ringlets on top of it and a tempting aroma starts wafting in the air.Its prepared with an extra hint of nutmeg and special masalas. Hence the unique scent, says chef Micheal of Hotel Keys, Housing Board Junction, where they are having a biriyani promotion till March end.We have introduced a mix of totally authentic biriyanis along with a couple of innovative ones. We use our own recipe for the house specials, he adds.Its one dish that has undergone umpteen makeovers, tasting different from place to place. Chef says its the quality of rice and the perfection in dum that basically defines the biriyani.In Kerala we like kaima rice, but there are people who insist on using basmati. Authentic Malabari biriyani is made with kaima only, but when it comes to North Indian biriyanis we go for the long and slender basmati. In our menu we have tried to focus more on South varieties using fried meat, he says.If you want to experiment with something other than the regular yellow biriyani, opt for the Nilgiri version. This one comes with a green tint, the result of a mint, coriander and palak blend. Its one biriyani totally different from what you have tasted so far. Each leaf used has its own unique flavour and the meat and rice gets covered in that green masala, explains the chef.If you are a seafood lover, give fish a miss this time. No, we are not referring to the yummy prawn biriyani but another signature dish - the spicy squid biriyani.Malayalis like hot and spicy food. Normally, the spice level in biriyani is moderate. But in squid biriyani its on the higher side. You can see how hot and flavourful it is by just looking at it, says the chef pointing to the slightly red dish.The menu has all the regular chicken, beef and veg variants as well and each biriyani is accompanied by a sweet mango-and-pineapple chutney, onion raita and pappad. Sometimes we serve slightly customised biriyanis taking into account what the customer likes, adds the chef. The special items are available only during lunch time, so walk in any time between 1 pm to 3.30 pm.There are discounts for group orders and for more details contact 8086079913."

Hesitantly she picked up, only to be pleasantly surprised by one of her elderly customers.He was a Jain from Chennai and he called me Annapoorna as I was preparing special satvik meals for him without onion and garlic, says the city-based home-cook whose authentic North Indian fare has a huge fan following.Be it lasooni paneer, baigan bharta or green chilli paratha, she ensures a burst of taste and authenticity. Come up with any typical North Indian vegetarian delicacy, and Deepika will deliver it at your doorsteps. I keep adding to the menu and as of now cheesy potato paratha is a hot favourite with my customers, she says. Deepika, who relocated to the city from Kanupur, says she started cooking for her North Indian friends practising in Medical College.They were missing ghar ka khana and asked me to cook for them on a daily basis. That was some two years back and now the number of my customers has grown in leaps and bounds, she smiles.Her facebook page Leelas Kitchen is a talk among the foodie groups in the city as you dont have to order much in advance. All I need is one hour. I have two helpers who do the peeling and chopping. We are always prepared to take the order and finish it in an hour, she says.Deepika says though she is an expert cook now, once she hardly had any idea about what happens inside the kitchen. It was my mother-in-law Leela who taught me the art, with all its nuances and tricks. She had magic in her hands and hence my page is named after her.There are many specialty restaurants in the city dedicated to North Indian cuisine, but Deepika says their preparations lack that authentic taste and flavour. You dont get a paratha with a thick methi filling there. While we use atta they use maida, and there is always the hygiene part. From the flour to garnish, we make sure that everything is 100 per cent North Indian.Then there are customers who want specific food, something in sync with their health or religion. I think there is no other eatery in the city that provides Jain food, she adds.But its not just homesick North Indians who place orders at Leelas Kitchen. I get equal or more orders from Keralites. I think yummy home-cooked food is something that appeals to all, she winds up."

He died on February 28 while undergoing treatment at VIMSAR, she said.Kalabati mentioned that due to frequent power failure the standing paddy and vegetable crop got damaged leaving Khainu worried about repayment of loan and sustenance of the family.She further said as the price offered was not reasonable and there was distress sale following which Khainu distributed cabbage, chili, onion and other cash crops freely among villagers.The affidavits filed before Executive Magistrate Bargarh, will also be submitted to President of India, Supreme Court, Human Rights Commission, Chief Minister and Union and State Agriculture Ministers."

Among the ones served here, the tomato tartare is a better choice than its chicken counterpart. Double cooked with mozarella and served with black olive powder, the tartare is delicate.The Free-range Chicken had a unique combination of bell peppers and pecorino romano cheese ice cream. The lightly sweet ice cream with a cheese-like taste is a suprising twist because you dont expect your dessert to sit on the appetisers. But it goes well together.Shrimp -- oven baked and roasted -- are served with white spring onion cream and black truffle, they are a must try. The baked shrimp has a strong orange flavour and the roasted is crispy. The cream of white onions lends the dish a sweet and sour flavour.After the Antipasti is served the Primi Piatti, which is essentially pasta. The lemon foam adds a tanginess to the Fagottini pasta served with burrata, lobster and green peas.The parmigiano reggiano (a hard, granular cheese) aged 24 months is a perfect match for the ravioli. It looks fancy but tastes familiar, like it is homemade. The tomatoes add a zing to the morel mushrooms, green peas and asparagus.Secondi Piatti, another mains, has chicken breast and thigh, spinach, wild mushrooms and pumpkin with rosemary, sauce saracena moscato looks exciting but falls flat with the meat cooked in mushroom sauce rubbery.The sea bass tastes fresh. The platter also includes potatoes prepared in saffron sauce. All good here.Finally, the desserts, or as Italians call it Dolci, include Tiramasu Parfait and Citrus Tart, Cream and Nuts. The chef special Tiramasu is highly recommended, with its overpowering coffee flavour. As you dig into the Tiramisu, the cream oozes out. There is a hint of chocolate.As the name suggests, the tart has a strong citrusy flavour from the layers of lemon cream. It is topped with fruits and nuts. The strawberry is a great add-on, softening the otherwise acidic and sharp flavour of lemon.The reviewed dishes were part of the Capri to Calabria, Southern Italian food festival, which closed on March 24. But, few of them will be included in the restaurants main menu in the coming weeks."

Petrol and diesel tankers, however, continued to ply although they have supported the strike.The South India Motor Transport Association (SIMTA) has been on strike objecting to the Centres decision to raise third-party insurance premium of vehicles by as much as 50 per cent.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bengaluru Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said, Except onion and potato, supply of all other perishable goods has been hit. There is shortage of essentials like sugar, jaggery and pulses.He added, Transactions have been impacted heavily, especially in Yeshwantpur market. Although the protest has extended to other states in the south, there have been no issues in Chennai and Puducherry.Mysuru and Bengaluru are bearing the brunt.Secretary of Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders Ranjith Hegde said, Petrol pumps across the state are open and tankers are plying. We have extended our support symbolically and we totally disagree with the taxes and hike in insurance premium.However, we have innumerable formalities like writing letters to oil companies to be carried out before we join the protest physically. The decision to formally join them will be taken after discussion, he said.Voicing similar opinion, Bhushan Narang, president of Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said, There is no impact on petrol or diesel. Vehicles are moving as usual.

The video even claims that no tomatoes were used to make tomato ketchup. Ketchup is a popular condiment thats used with everything from French fries to meat loaf.The video explains that tomato ketchup is made from coagulated blood, urine, cocaine, nutmeg and rubbing alcohol. The video conspires that massive quantities of coagulated blood, which is a side product of the meat industry, is brought to the factories that make ketchup.In the next step, the video says that the blood is mixed with a narcotic drug cocaine and urine, where its is supplied directly from the sewer line itself. The video even bears the insignia of Science channel. The creator of the fake video has used the original video of making ketchup and has dubbed a voice-over that changes the description and the name of the ingredients.In reality, tomato ketchup is prepared from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, salt, selected spices, onion powder, and natural flavoring."

I grew up with my mother used to making amazing lachha parathas, smeared with home-made butter. The flavour of fenugreek and dry methi leaves always used to make me smile. She was my first mentor and sole inspiration to get into cooking. From the classic rajma chawal with homemade curd to the simple spice-flavoured raitha, I learnt it all from her. My first every dish was methi chicken and stuffed gobi paratha  one of my favourites!I was born in Dehradun, but spent my whole life in Lucknow  the flavours, currys, biriyani, kebabs, kormas, parathas  being a foodie, it was a great place to live. Following my mothers instructions and watching several TV shows, I began to think about the fast-food culture in the country  most places offer western fast food. I wanted to give delicious and healthy Indian fast-food and started a take-away joint in Lucknow  spinach, ragii rolls with fish, chicken and soya were very famous.I love experimenting with food and thats what keeps me going  golgappas served the molecular way, ulta tawa paratha and galouti kabab, frozen chicken tikka salad are what I love to cook in Modern Indian cuisine.Though I know several cuisines including Japanese and continental, my roots remain in Awadhi cuisine. From cooking Gosht meat with garlic (whole pulp) and onion and transforming it into a flavoursome curry to barsi meat (meat prepared and stored for a day, a Pakistani concept), I enjoy doing it all. Ingredients like javitri, dry rose petals, cardamom and cinnamon are my best friends. Their aromas give new dimension to food and can be used in both sweets and savoury items. Its magic!Speaking of sweets Sohan halwa, a toffee-like sweet made of wheat, water and sugar is famous in Lucknow and Delhi. Its my number one favorite, followed by rasagulla, kala jamun and lucknowi kulfi falooda.I enjoy cooking for my family. My ultimate dream is to visit Japan and learn about their authentic dishes. I already love cooking the sashimi and sushi and I want to learn more! Its a never-ending process.Jayanandhan Baskar will be heading the Awadhi Food Festival in Park Hyatt, Chennai until April 16"

Days after milk and curd prices were hiked, the prices of vegetables and fruits too have increased drastically.Commonly used vegetables like string beans and carrots, which were selling at Rs 20 per kg before the strike are now selling at Rs 70 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. Potatoes, which cost Rs 15 per kg a few days ago, are now sold at Rs 20-24 per kg. The prices of fruits like oranges have doubled from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg now.Theres some consolation, though. The price of tomato has dropped due to a glut caused by fewer exports owing to the strike. From Rs 24 per kg, it has now come down to Rs 16 per kg. The prices of onion have remained largely unaffected as traders had large stocks from before the strike.Russell Market Traders Association general secretary Mohammed Idrees Chaudhary said the prices of vegetables and fruits had started witnessing a rise with the onset of summer as the yield is lesser.The ongoing transporters strike has caused a further spike in prices.A resident of Nagarbhavi said the prices of fruits and vegetables had already been on the rise, and have increased further in the past two-three days. She said that a bunch of coriander leaves, which used to cost Rs 15-20, now cost Rs 30. To ease the woes, KSRTC has started assisting in transportation of essential public utilities. ENS"

The main course has Pike Perch Filet and Endive, Veal Tenderloin and Garden Vegetables, and Guinea Fowl Breast Melba. In all there are seven savouries made using vanilla.The White onion Velout is prepared using white wine. The mild-flavoured white flesh of white onions adds a sweetness and a creamy texture to the soup. It is served in a coupe soup bowl with the white onion cut in a barrel or cylindrical shape, dipped in the soup. It is pleasant and soothing.Topped with bits of cheese, the Goat Cheese and Fig Salad has an overpowering bitterness of fresh greens. The Guinea Fowl Breast Melba was served with turkey, instead of guinea fowl because the other meat is difficult to get in India, informs the chef Gaurav Bathla. The meat is fibrous and tasted like hard chicken. It is served with boiled potatoes.The Pike Perch Filet and Endive is a fish delicacy. The boneless fish is delicate and melts in your mouth. The Sashimi of Tuna tastes better than the one of salmon. The fish, sliced thin, is bland and the sticky rice is a bit too chewy like gum.The Vanille Sale promotion is on till March 21 in all the Movenpick Hotel and Spa outlets.Price for two: `1,300 + taxes"

While around 11 pesticides were found in the spinach samples, around five pesticides were frequently found in all the sample: chlorpyrifos, triazophos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin + triazophos and profenophos.However, it is difficult to declare the pesticide residues as unsafe as there is no Maximum Residue Limit set for spinach by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The FSSAI has set MRL standards for only a handful of vegetables like soyabean, onion, ginger, okra and green chilly that are exported to other countries. But, if the pesticide residue found in spinach is compared to MRL set for other vegetables, it shows that the residues in spinach are much higher. For example, MRL set by FSSAI for chlorpyrifos is 0.5 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) for onion. It was found to be as high as 6.3 mg/kg in spinach. The EU standard for triazophos in onion is 0.2 mg/kg which was found as high as 6.8mg/kg in spinach. The Codex Alimentarius of Food and Agriculture Organisation set cypermethrin standard at 0.1mg/kg for onion which was detected at 3mg/kg for spinach.Dr Shashi Bhushan Vemuri, former head of All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues, said, None of the pesticides found in the spinach samples should have been actually found as their usage on vegetables is not recommended. Spinach is often sprayed with pesticides just before it is brought into markets as the vegetable has big and soft leaves."

They cannot be pardoned.""Kya raajneeti itni gir gayi hai ke kursi ke moh mein iss prakaar ke kaand kiye jaaye (has politics degraded to such an extent that for the love of power such a thing would be done)?""Recalling the incident, Modi said, ""Fed up of attacks by Mulayam Singh as Leader of the Opposition in Vidhan Parishad, Congress got shots fired at him on March 4, 1984 but he scraped through...I want to tell Akhilesh that he should have remembered this incident before sitting in the lap of Congress.""He went on to add, ""Akhileshji ko abhi anubhav kum hain, Congress wale kitne chatur hain inko samajh nahi aata...Mulayam ji ko toh pata tha (Akhilesh has less experience. He does not understand how cunning Congress people are. Mulayam knew about it).""On March 4, 1984, Mulayam Singh's car was fired at by some persons while he was on his way from Etawah to Lucknow and the name of a strong Congress leader had figured in the case.Hitting out at Congress, Modi said the party was running a three-legged race with one leg tied to Bahujan Samaj Party and another to Samajwadi Party.""During the first press conference after the alliance, Akhilesh had attacked Mayawati but when Congress vice president was asked about her, he said he had nothing to say against her,"" the Prime Minister said.Rahul had said, ""I personally respect Mayawati. Though BSP ruled in Uttar Pradesh and made some mistakes, my respect for her is intact"".This had prompted BJP to dub BSP as a hidden partner of Congress-Samajwadi Party.""They cannot win this race as BJP, which is running on two legs, will pip them to the post,"" Modi told the rally today.On the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said the abbreviation of UP may be read as ""up"", but everything is ""down"" in the state.""The only thing up in UP is corruption, law and order, riots, atrocities on women, unemployment, poverty, mortality rate of mother and child, migration...and Akhilesh says 'kaam bolta hai' (work speaks)...it is not kaam but karname (misdeeds) which are speaking for him,"" Modi said.Claiming that the Centre has taken important steps for the welfare of farmers, the Prime Minister said his party has promised in its manifesto that onion and potato will be bought at Minimum Support Price and will not allow the potato growers to die.""BJP manifesto promises loan waiver of small farmers...As an MP from the state, I promise that it will be my responsibility that this promise is fulfilled in the first meeting of the BJP government,"" said Modi, who represents Varanasi constituency in the Lok Sabha.Addressing the gathering in this region having a large number of potato growers, Modi said in the last (Lok Sabha) elections the ""bahu"" (Dimple Yadav) of Samajwadi Party had promised to set up chips-making unit here which did not come through, but she won the poll.""Will you not seek a reply from her or not,"" the Prime Minister asked in his typical question-answer style of establishing direct rapport with the public.""The SP government (in UP) is anti-poor,"" he said, adding that while he himself as no home or vehicle of his own, SP leaders have large fleets of vehicles.""What kind of samajwad (socialism) is this? It is nothing but betrayal of poor. Scams are being reported even in orphanages in UP,"" Modi said.He contended that central assistance for foodgrains was not reaching the poor in UP as the state government was not interested in accepting it.He also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi saying, ""the Congress leader seeking vote from you is not aware that potato is grown in the field and not in factory...He (Rahul) took out a kisan yatra and talked about setting up potato factory.""Claiming that people of the country have hailed note ban, he said this is proved by BJP's victories in Panchayat polls in Odisha, Municipal elections in Chandigarh and Gujarat and Vidhan Parishad poll in UP.Congratulating ISRO scientists, he said they have hit a century by launching a record 104 satellites at one go.Modi also cited the decision of his government to slash prices for coronary stents for heart patients.""The stents will be sold at Rs 8,000 against Rs 45,000 earlier. Congress had failed to revise the prices for years,"" he said.Modi said opposition played all types of games in the last three months raking up issues like demonetisation and surgical strike.Referring to anomalies in recruitments in UP, Modi said police recruitment in Uttar Pradesh is driven by caste-based decisions.""We have removed interview requirement from the recruitment process in Class III and Class IV categories in central government. Around one lakh people were recruited in Railways without an interview,"" he said.There are plans for recruitment in BSF and CISF which will be done in a fair and honest manner to give jobs to the deserving candidates, Modi added.Promising to continue the fight against black money and corruption, he appealed to people of Kannuj to vote for BJP on February 19 in the third phase of polling."

We have the starchier and blander versions but in other countries there are the more pungent recipes from vegetables, beans and greens. They are known to contribute to the gut-health and many people live by them. Hot and biting, these foods can serve well as substitutes for the highly-salted pickles. They can be served as sides or appetisers.Kimchi (Korea)This is mostly made of cabbage, which has to be left to ferment for a week. The chopped leaves are mixed with fish sauce, scallions and garlic and kept in a cool air-tight container. You may need to lose the cap once in a while to let the gases that form escape. Kimchi can be used as a sauce for other veg and seafood preparations. You can get it in Korean and Chinese restaurants such as Hae Kum Gang in Ashok Nagar, Arirang in Kamanahalli and Shiro in UB City.Gundruk (Nepal)Greens such as leaves of either mustard or raddish are shredded and left in earthenware containers. The blackish mushy gundruk is served as a side dish, an appetiser and even mixed with soups. To prepare as soup, the leaves are friend along with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and the usual Indian spices like turmeric. You could try it at Bameys Resto Cafe in Kormangala.Kombucha (Japan)It is a fermented tea drink and made using SCOBY, which is symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast. This is a mildly sweet drink with a bit of fizz. There is a miniscule percentage (single digit) of alcohol and unless you glug down many litres of it, you wont get a high. This drink is credited with curing everything from diabetes and depression to AIDs and cancer, but these claims are unproven. Get it at Adi Naturals in JP Nagar, Era Organics in Sanjaynagar or Green Channel in Ali Asker Road.Sauerkraut (China, Russia)This is a blander form of pickled cabbage made with carroway seeds and salt. Few people put onion too with this mixture, but this depends on how strong you would like the flavour to be. This is recommended for the lactose-intolerant to get their dose of good bacteria for gut health. Served at Soo Ra Sang, behind Leela Palace.Natto (Japan)It is made from soybeans. This is strong smelling and was earlier made by storing the beans in a haystack. The method of preparation has changed and these are now mass-produced, available in tin cans like baked beans. This is said to be high in fiber, Vitamin K and C and minerals. Nato is cooked with soya sauce and served with boiled rice. Available at Harima on Residency Road."

On enquiring with the store owner, he explained how it was used as a dipping sauce with oil and spread on flat bread but also mentioned it pairs well with red meat.This seasoning can be found in several grocery stores and bazaars in the region, it can be made very easily at home as well. Fragrant and tangy, this special ingredient adds that extra dash to any dish, be it meat, fish or vegetables.CaptionArmed with this new discovery, I returned home to Bengaluru and decided to give it a try with red meat. I added it to lamb dishes back at the restaurant and was amazed at the results I got, especially with the Lamb Lasagna where the Zaatar flavour comes out very subtly amongst the strong flavour of the meat and cheese. The dish is a huge hit with the patrons and this is definitely an ingredient that I would like to experiment with, for several other dishes.Ingredients Unsalted Butter - 4 tbsp All-purpose Flour - 3 tbsp Salt Garlic - 4 cloves minced Onion - 2 tbsp chopped Milk - 1 cup Chicken Broth - 1 cup Mozarella Cheese - 1/2 cup grated Sharp Cheddar Cheese - 1/2 cup grated Minced Lamb - 200 g Zaatar - 2 tsp Leeks - 1 stalk chopped fine Celery - 1 stalk chopped fine Ground Black Pepper Parmesan Cheese - 1 tbsp grated Lasagna Sheets - 6 fresh or pre-cooked Olive Oil - 2 tbspMethod: Melt the the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.

The central bank left policy lending rate (repo) unchanged and hiked borrowing rates (reverse repo) at the last policy review on April 7.RBI has already signalled that uncertain monsoon and low statistical base effect will keep CPI inflation at 4.5% in the first half and 5% in the second half of 2017-18. The government may also increase the minimum support prices (MSPs) of crops, which will put an upward pressure on inflation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.A pick up in new currency in circulation helped revive consumer demand after a bout of severe cash crunch during the demonetisation drive of November-December of 2016.The March inflation number was still higher compared with the 0.45% fall in WPI during March 2016, as prices of petrol, diesel and minerals, firmed up due to an upward trend in global prices.Festival demand pushed up prices of vegetables by 5.7% and fruits by 7.6%. However, potato prices fell 17%, onion 10.8% and pulses 6.1% from a year ago.Mineral prices were up 23.5% while fuels were costlier by 18.2% as petrol and diesel prices were revised up.Last week, government data showed a rise in the prices of sugar, confectionary, snacks and fruits during Holi pushed up Indias consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3.81% in March from 3.65% in February.The slowing pace of remonetisation, or pumping new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes into circulation, during March to replace the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, helped inflation to stay within 4% in the financial year ending March 2017.Consumption and investment activity were dampened after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the bold decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.While the demonetisation weeded out Rs 15.44 lakh crore or 86% of currency from circulation, the government and RBI has been able to pump in about Rs 13.35 lakh crore worth of new notes so far."

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver"

Owners have invested money to realise a dreamBorivli is a suburb located along the western suburban line of Mumbai and has several eating joints, including themed restaurants. As one stands in front of the well-known Esspee Tower near the Borivli railway station, an aquarium shop, a rather big one, lit up well and spic and span, stands out.As one approaches the shop, the visitor would see Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd, one of the biggest aquarium shops of Mumbai and Caf Hydro, the first aquarium-themed caf in the country with the biggest fish tunnel.Such aquarium cafs or ocean restaurants are quite common in some of the big tourist destinations in the world. In India it is the first of its kind with a fish tunnel or an aquarium tunnel. In the country, there are several restaurants with an aquarium or a fish tank or an aquarium wall.For 41-year-old Rupesh Sakpal, the director of Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd and Caf Hydro, this was not the first time that he had made an aquarium tunnel. The dream project of Rupesh is at Rajendra Nagar at Dattapada Road at Borivli East. In fact, Borivli is a bustling tourist destination and a happening place in the suburbs. When the Taraporewala Aquarium on Marine Drive was refurbished a few years ago, Sakpals company was tasked to create a 180-degree acrylic glass tunnel of 10x15 sq feet.A restaurant was on the back of my mind. We thought why not to make it more interesting. An aquarium always attracts crowd. In fact, in a restaurant where there is a fish tank, people prefer to sit by its side and dine. I thought of giving a different experience altogether, said Rupesh, explaining his pet project.The 17x15 sq ft fish tunnel is at the level-2 of Caf Hydro. The level-3 has a huge wall aquarium. Setting this up was a challenge and we decided to give it a try, adds Rupeshs uncle Manohar Sakpal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bhagirathi Group.With a variety of colourful, exotic, big and small fish of over a dozen varieties gliding around and excellent lighting, you are in a different world. When you have a meal, there is nothing like it, said Shaibal Gupta, a foodie who had dined at Caf Hydro.Manohar supported Rupesh, who has a Bachelor of Fisheries Science degree, when he started a 100 sq ft aquarium shop on September 9, 1999, near the Borivli railway station. His three-storeyed aquarium shop and caf now are spread over 10,000 sq ft.The ground floor or level one is filled with youngsters and has a feel of Mumbais local trains. It has been constructed using train tracks, train floors, sleepers, racks, ladders and a blue-coloured staircase. The roof has several artwork and bottles.The one-stop pet mall restaurant has been set up at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore. We have made investments to realise the dream. We are very clear that aquarium is our core business and everything will revolve around it, said Rupesh, who is also developing a public aquarium in Ranchi in Jharkhand. We have to look at hygiene and service and nearly 100 people work round the clock in three shifts, he said as he attended phone calls.After Caf Hydro was inaugurated on January 26 this year, the number of calls have increased. Several corporate houses want to visit, do group bookings or have a similar aquarium in their offices and workplaces, he said. Nowadays people are looking for what is known as a stress-buster aquarium.Paste food, which is made of proteins of fish, is the unique concept of this restaurant. There are variety of delicious dishes like fish bao, fish burger, fish hotdog, fish bullets, fish cake roll.I stay in Borivli and came to know about it and decided to visit the place. I found it interesting and it is something new. Visiting this place gives you a different feeling, different excitement and thrill, said Vinod Yadav, a resident of Borivli.We constantly innovate, said Rupesh as he rolls out the extensive menu that looks like a tabloid-sized newspaper.Caf Hydro will soon become happening place for Mumbaikars, said Rupesh. The menu has been designed looking at the taste of patrons and we constantly take their suggestions, he added.Mouth-watering itemsSome of the fast-moving food items include dishes from surimi, a paste made from fish or other seafood meat, which can be used as a primary ingredient for several dishes. Fish onion ring is another interesting mouth-watering item and so is Thai fish cake.The list also includes fried fish balls, cholli garlic fish bullets, crispy chicken pops, seafood har gow, grilled chicken and prawns shanghai, grilled fish cake bao and peri peri chicken roll. Vegetarian items include bao, hand-cut potato batons, herbed potato wedges and cheesy onion rings.Besides Continental and Thai cuisine, the restaurant also offers simple Indian food like rice and chicken curry. There is a big spread of desserts and mocktails as well.As of now it is a no-liquor restaurant. Asked about this, Sakpal said: As of now we are on the launch mode. The aquarium shop is huge. On display are 425 fish tanks and over 325 species of marine and freshwater fish. After a meal at the caf, one can see and buy fish tanks, aquarium lights, tank decoration equipment, artificial waterfall, etc. Spa for pets is the another interesting thing.Asian Arowana is the brand ambassador of Caf Hydro. Arowana basically seen in various Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia. The shop has a wide range here. One can purchase a pair of guppy for around Rs 50. The shop also fish species ranging between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh.Some of the commonest ornamental fishes include guppy (lebistes reticulatus), molly (mollienisia latipinna), sword tail (xiphophorous hellerii), platy (xiphophorus varitus), siamesr fighter (betta splendens), angel (pterophyllum scalare), tiger barb (barbus tetrazona) and widow tetra (gymnocorymbus ternetzi)."

The trick lies in skilfully spreading the batter on the pre-heated pan.Where: Dakshinayan, Near ISKCON in Juhu, and at Malabar HillPrice: Rs 235 (sada)THE GODFATHER BURGERCarl Rebello, chef and co-owner of Howra, says he thought up The Godfather while watching an episode of Man vs Food.
