The show is on and Sherry, a teetotaller himself, is on a high.From laughing all the way to the bank with comedy shows, 53-year-old Sidhu is now tickling the funny bones of Punjabis as Congress star campaigner and candidate. At Tanda in Hoshiarpur on Tuesday, the former Indian opener starts his speech by licking his fingers, like a spin bowler before a cricket match.I used to hit boundaries as a cricketer. Now I will hit Badals for a six. Bhukha teh rajj janda e, bhukkhad nahin rajjda. Bhajj Badala bhajj tere layi main kalla hi kaafi aan (A hungry man gets satiated, not a greedy one. Run, Badal, run; I alone am enough for you), he says. Lest the crowds forget to cheer, he adds, Thoko taali (Come on, clap!).He then belts out funny anecdotes from Punjabi folklore to prick the Jat Sikh pride. Ek billa Jat da duddh pi gaya. Jat ne bille te bhaanda maareya. Naal de bande ne puchheya duddh te pi hi gaya si, mareya kyon? Jatt kehnda billa duddh pi ke muchhan nu tav denda si. Chori, upar se seena-jori (A cat drank milk from a Jats home. He threw the vessel at him. When a neighbour asked him why throw the vessel when the cat had already drunk the milk, he said the cat was stoking his moustache after drinking the milk. First he steals, then shows attitude too).He adds, Pagri sambhaal jatta, pagri sambhaal, Badala ne tera sara lutt leya maal (Save your turban, Jat. The Badals have looted your state). Ki mein jhooth boleya? Nai taan, thoko taali (Have I lied? If not, cheer out loud).AAPS TURNAfter the Badals, he guns for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). More analogies follow. He starts by calling it a baraat without a dulha (marriage party without a groom). He takes a dig at AAP boss and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, calling him, again, a handpump which is four feet above the ground and 120 feet below it. Another round of thoko taali. More cheers.He is not done with Kejriwal yet. Sidhu goes on to shower some more adjectives. This Kejriwal is a very cunning man. Heads he wins, tails you lose! He wants to break the partnership of Sidhu and Maharaja saab (reference to erstwhile Patiala royal and state Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh) by tweeting, Sidhu will be CM.And then mimics Kejriwal in Hindi. CM face announce karna humari policy nahi hai (We dont have the policy to announce a CM face, he told me). Yeh kaale angrez hain. Delhi se Punjab paar raaj karna chahte hain (They are dark-skinned British. They want to rule Punjab from Delhi).With a helicopter waiting to take him to Amritsar, he rushes through the same anecdotes, epithets and analogies at the third rally at Sham Chaurasi on Tuesday. He refuses to talk to the media as he reaches for his Toyota Land Cruiser surrounded by a security ring by staff that follows him in a Toyota Innova.Next day, it starts pouring and we wait for speaking to Sidhu outside his residence in a colony named Holy City, a stretch of luxury within the holy city of Amritsar, lined with palm trees.His best friend Bunny (Rupinder Singh Sandhu) remains noncommittal on an interview. Two hours later, his private security men come out of two cars and we rush back to the gates. Sidhu had to cancel his days roadshow at Tarn Taran and we finally get to sneak in.OF SOCIAL MEDIA, AND A JAINI LUNCHDressed in a khaki Pathani suit and matching sleeveless jacket, Sidhu is sipping tea, Punjabi style, in a glass tumbler. He talks about his resentment over being called a hard bargainer by the media and says he doesnt read newspapers or watch news channels. People are hearing me on social media. My speeches are getting lakhs of views, Sidhu says. Then there is no stopping him.Recalling his first speech as a school captain, he says he had to go on stage and say two words, School dispersed. I fainted after saying those two words. I was a very shy child. When I scored a century, I used to dread the press. But now I dont prepare my speeches. Even if I have not watched cricket for a while, I start the commentary after reaching the ground, he adds. As we talk on Punjab and Congress, Sidhu hands out a file of how Badal businesses have grown over the years at the expense of Punjabs coffers.Over lunch  three sabzis without onion and garlic, and chapatis with no ghee  Sidhu says he is a teetotaller and has Jaini food. He says he follows the early to bed, early to rise regime. I need six hours of sleep. I go to bed by 10 and get up at 4 in the morning. I do meditation for hours after I get up. I go into a trance. I have no internet in my house. I sleep a sound sleep as I am answerable only to my conscience, he says.There is jaggery for dessert and Sidhu cant help throw yet another analogy as he eats it. The Badals hatch conspiracies to finish people politically. Gur de ke maarde ne (They kill you by serving jaggery).ON HOME TURFOn the phone, he tells someone hed welcome anyone from the rival camp to join him willingly. Its time for him to leave for his office to discuss his campaign in Amritsar East, the seat of his wife Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu, which he is contesting this time. As he reaches for the door, his dog, Poochi, a French breed, Petit Basset Griffon, comes running and Sidhu shouts as she pees near a sofa. He fondly says his other dog is named Batman.At one end of Sidhus house is a room where Guru Granth Sahib is placed. On the first floor, there is a rare crystal Shivling. Sidhu calls himself a devotee of Mahadev (Lord Shiva) and also a devout Sikh.And, not just the clock, he goes by the stars too for luck. So much so that Congressmen now joke he leaves home only at a time thats auspicious. He is wearing four rings studded with gemstones -- pukhraj and rubies -and a gold bracelet of rubies. Does he believe in astrology? Sidhu nods a yes. I do.His wife is out campaigning for the seat and, other than the two pets, the palatial house with a swimming pool in the basement seems empty.Ask him if his kids are campaigning, and Sidhu smiles, My daughter Rabia is doing fashion designing in London and my son, Karan, is a lawyer in Delhi. Even when a traffic cop challans him, he does not tell them whose son he is. Modesty may not be one of Sidhus virtues, but the gift of the gab surely is.But, on pride, you cannot blame Amritsaris. The famous restaurant Bharavan da Dhaba in the city tells you why. Namak swaad anusar. Aakad aukaat anusaar (Salt as per taste. Attitude as per your stature), reads a placard there."

We have detected more than dozen fake Facebook accounts in the name of Tej Bahadur Yadav that are now regularly posting content. We will be looking into the origins of these accounts, said a senior BSF official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The officer added that it was highly unusual that a social media post of an unknown (at that point in time) BSF trooper could garner huge amount of eyeballs.It is too early to say whether there was a conspiracy under which these fake accounts were created to take benefit of the videos posted by Yadav but we will certainly be looking into this aspect, said the official.Yadav was deployed at a high-altitude base at the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir in the first of week of January when he posted selfie videos alleging that the ration meant for jawans is being diverted to open market by seniors and jawans are getting inferior quality food.After Yadavs videos went viral, a court of inquiry was instituted by the BSF on the directions of Union home minister Rajnath Singh.The inquiry has gone into the complaints of Yadav in detail and its report is expected soon.Sources privy to the preliminary findings of the inquiry say the Facebook account being operated by Tej Bahadur, which is in the name of his son, has 6,000 friends, which is quite a high number for any trooper or a child (in this case his son) to have.Yadav had complained about lack of tadka in his dal.

The district administration is sending the onions back to the farms, so that they can be used as manure.The district administration had purchased the onions from the farmers at Rs 624 a quintal under the support price scheme. A whopping 3.8 lakh quintals of the vegetable was procured between November 4 and December 7 last year. Of this, 75% has been sold to the APMC traders by the district administration at Rs 175 to Rs 225 a quintal. A portion of the stock was sold through the small retail outlets.What remains are the smaller variety and the sprouted lot (around 70,000 quintals), which are not preferred by the traders. The onions are rotting due to moisture and the rain in December.Fakirappa Hosamani and Kumar Sugganahalli, farmers from Petalur village, said they had taken away 40 tractor loads of rotting onion in the last 15 days for use as natural manure in their fields. They expect a good crop if there are good rains after six or seven months.Gadag tops in onion cultivation, with a 40% increase in area under cultivation (10,562 hectares) in the last decade, from 26,665 hectares. This year has seen a record harvest, despite the drought. The district administration has suffered losses of Rs 7 crore to Rs 8 crore, after buying the produce under the support price scheme."

It reared its ugly head last month in Jalangi of Murshidabad district, before making a worrisome appearance in several blocks of Nadia.If allowed to spread, experts said the fungus could be deadly, devouring standing wheat crop quickly. We are not taking chances whatsoever, said Pranab Kumar Hembram, an assistant director of agriculture, who along with other officials had descended on Sheikhs field to destroy the crop.The officials are in a race to clear the fields and burn the wheat to ensure there are no fungal spores that can travel from Bengal to the wheat bowl of the country in the Hindi heartland.We are felling the crop first and then spraying kerosene and setting the field on fire. We must ensure that all crops and seeds are destroyed. The spores which spread through air has to be contained, said Arun Roy, project co-ordinator and additional director of the state agriculture department. To contain the spread of wheat blast, the state government has deployed men and machines, including combined harvester machines to chop off the crop, and jars of kerosene to set them alight.The outbreak of wheat blast last year took a heavy toll on Bangladesh, where crops of over 20,000 hectares had to be burnt. Both Nadia and Murshidabad border Bangladesh, alarming the government in West Bengal.The anti-fungus drive is said to be for protecting wheat crops. But Dulal Sheikh is desolate watching his crop go up in flames. I had invested Rs 4000 for 12.5 cottah of land in terms of seed and fertilizers. This is apart from the toil my son and I put in. If everything went well I would have got Rs 6,000 for my produce, which means a profit of Rs 2,000. But now I dont know what will I do, he said, watching the thick smoke billowing from his field.The administration is offering Rs 50,375 as compensation for crop destroyed per hectare. The amount is paltry and we are not sure when the money will be disbursed, said Atiur Khan, a farmer of Sonpukur, whose crop was also set alight.Nadia is one of the most fertile tracts of Bengal with Gangetic alluvial soil flowing from rivers Ganga and Padma. Diverse crops from jute, oninon, red chilli to paddy and wheat are grown in abundance in the region.Fortunately, the fungus affects only wheat and, as a result, the adjacent fields laden with red chilli and onion are safe."

However, in a short span of time, it has indulged in corruption like no other party has. The governments principal secretary (Rajendra Kumar) was arrested by the CBI on corruption charges. There was a scam in onion purchase, appointments in Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), water tanker procurement and street lights. One of the AAP ministers was involved in the Hawala case. Another minister is involved in land scam, Shah said while addressing a rally of booth level workers at Ramlila Maidan to motivate them before the civic polls.The rally was attended by six Lok Sabha MPs of Delhi including BJP state unit chief Manoj Tiwari, Union ministers M Venkaiah Naidu, Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh, Sanjeev Balyan and Vijay Goel. Saturdays rally also marked the partys formal launch of campaign for the April 23 municipal elections.Barely a week after a new government being sworn-in in Uttar Pradesh, Kejriwal is seeking its performance report. Dont worry, BJP will fulfil all its promises. And, we will not ask for your performance report because it is expected from responsible people. Thirteen of your MLAs are facing criminal cases. How do you explain that? Before the municipal election campaign, you (Kejriwal) should order a magisterial enquiry to look into corruption charges against your MLAs, the BJP chief said.Shah asked the people to dislodge AAP government in the next (assembly) elections. MCD election will work for laying the foundation for assembly elections. To ensure development, there should be a government, which is not indulged in fighting with the Centre. MCDs should work in coordination with the centre and state government for the growth, he said."

The move is expected to help the state save more than Rs2,000 crore every year.State finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Sunday requested Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, who was in the city to discuss issues related to the Good and Services Tax (GST) with representatives of petroleum and liquor manufacturing industries, to reduce interest rates by 2.75%.We have requested the finance minister to slash the interest rate on the loans provided to us by the centre in the past. The erstwhile Congress-NCP government had taken loans of Rs75,000 crore at the interest rate of 9.5%. We have now asked it to bring down to the prevalent rates  6.75%. If this gets approved, the government will save Rs2,062 crore every year, Mungantiwar told HT.He said that Jaitley has agreed to consider the demand, as it will help improve the financial health of the state.The debt of the state is slated to cross Rs4 lakh crore in this fiscal and the state is likely to pay around Rs31,027 crore as interest for the loans in 2017.Mungantiwar also demanded deadline for onion export to be extended so that its falling prices can be controlled. We have requested to extend the deadline for export of onion by three months. The finance minister has agreed to facilitate us for the same, he said.Prices of onion have dropped substantially, creating more issues for the farmers as they are not getting appropriate price for their produce.Meanwhile, while speaking to the representatives of various manufacturing industries, Jaitely said they need not worry about the GST roll out as tax rates of the commodities have been placed in the slab nearest to the existing tax rates. The GST has five slabs for tax rates starting from 0 to 5, 12, 18 and 28%.He is also learnt to have assured to consider their demand to reconsider inclusion of raw materials required for liquor and petroleum products in the GST when both the above commodities are kept out of the ambit of the GST.Also read: Four bills for GST roll out will be introduced next week"

Besides dip in production of major fruits like mango, guava, litchi and banana, productivity of major crops like wheat, rice and pulse also witnessed downtrend in 2015-16 as compared to 2013-14.Although production of potato witnessed marginal improvement (63.45 lakh tonne in 2015-16 against 60.50 lakh tonne in 2013-14), onion and tomato went down to 12.47 lakh tonne from 13.04 lakh tonne and 10.01 lakh tonne from 10.61 lakh ton in the same corresponding year.Net sown area for sugarcane also came down to 3.46% of net cultivable area in 2015-16 as against 3.66% recorded in 2013-14.

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time.

I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market.

The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

The government has also requested to extend the benefits of the scheme, which is ending on March 31, by three months.Under its Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS), the central government has been providing 5% grant on onion export since September last year . The idea is to encourage onion exporters so that the prices can be arrested from further fall.The state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar wrote this letter to Jaitley hoping to maintain onion prices if the Centre agrees to the demand.The move assumes significance in a scenario, where loan waiver for farmers is already a hot topic in the state with the Opposition beginning the Sangharsh Yatra on Wednesday to take on the government. In the interest of farmers, I request you to kindly consider increasing grant under MEIS up to June 30, 2017, he wrote in the letter dated March 22.If the grant is increased to 15%, the average price per quintal will improve and farmers will get the production cost of their produce, the letter further said.The issue was also discussed when Jaitley was in the city on Sunday to talk on issues related to Good and Services Tax (GST), which will be implemented from July 1. Jaitley assured Mungantiwar that he would consider the demand, sources said.Looking at this as a positive development, Jaydutt Holkar, president, Lasalgaon APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee), largest onion market in Asia, said the situation can improve if the central government approves the demand. The rise in grant will certainly help encourage exporters in exporting more onions and farmers will be benefitted as cascading effect, Holkar told HT.Currently, average price for a quintal is between Rs450-500 which ideally should be around Rs1,500 per quintal as cost of production for a quintal comes around Rs1,000 to a farmer, he said."

On the backdrop is a blaze, smoke and cracking sound of his crop burning with government officials spraying kerosene to stoke the flames. At the other end of the adjacent plot, a harvester machine is busy felling the crop. Just about 24 hours ago, Sheikh was unaware that his crop with be razed to the ground and burned.Safat Ali Sheikh, 52, of Hatkhola village under Chapra Block is facing the same ordeal for his 40 decimal land which the giant harvester cleared in a few minutes. Fending for a family of nine, he and his sons are now at a loss as to how they will manage to run it.The enemy, however, is invisible. The spores cant be seen with the naked eye. If the fungus attacks a wheat spikelet at one point, it travels upwards and the seeds simply wither away. We have been told by agricultural officers, the fungus seems to spread by air, and quickly spreads to the nearby plants, said Sheikh.For the Mamata Banerjee government, it is a race against time. While the farmers stand helplessly ruing the disease that struck them with lightening speed from across the border, for the agriculture department officers it is a race to clear the fields and burn the wheat to ensure there are no fungal spores that can travel from Bengal to the wheat bowl of the country in the Hindi heartland.Read:Deadly wheat blast symptoms enters India through the Bangladesh border, Bengal govt burning crops on war footingI have heard they are cutting off my crop and setting fire.

If everything went well I would have got Rs 6,000 for my produce, which means a profit of Rs 2,000. But now I dont know what will I do, Dulal Sheikh told HT, while the field burnt.Government officer speaking to farmers in Sonpukur village, Nadia. (Subhankar Chakraborty/HT PHOTO)In Nadia five blocked bordering Bangladesh has been severely hit including Chapra, Tehatta I and II, Karimpur I and II.Last year, the fungus entered Asia for the first time, creating havoc in Bangladesh where crops of over 20,000 hectares in six districts had to be burnt. In Bengal it has already spread to Murshidabad and Nadia districts bordering Bangladesh forcing the government to sound a red alert.The HT team visited a number of villages in Chapra I block in Nadia district. The scene was the same at Sonpukur, Hatikhola, Mohotpur, Sikra and other villages near the Indo-Bangladesh border.On Sunday, I visited a field in one of the villages and saw a couple of spikelets and detected symptoms of wheat blast. After two days I visited again and to my dismay found that 30% to 40% of the entire crop in the plot affected. We are not taking any chance whatsoever. We are calling it wheat blast like disease, since confirmation is yet to come, said Pranab Kumar Hembram, assistant director of agriculture (Chapra block), who was seen with a team of panchayat and government officials running around in the villages since 7 am on Saturday.Read: Fungus sees wheat crops in Bengal go up in flames as govt controls its spreadThe state government has deployed men and machines in the villages including combined harvester machines to chop off the crop, jars of kerosene and spray machines.On Sunday a notification was issued by the state government.

The spores which spread through air has to be contained, said Arun Roy, project co-ordinator and additional direct state agriculture department, who have been sent by the state secretariat to oversee the containment initiative.Though no government officer would say it on record, they indicated that the farmers would do well to avoid sowing wheat for the next two-three years.Bengal government has deployed combined harvester machines to clear the fields of the standing crops in Nadia district.

But we were determined since this is serious issue. We convinced them ultimately, said Mrinal Kanti Tarafdar, sabhapati of Chapra panchayat samity.But there are gaps in the crop destruction process. Wherever men and machinery are not available, the government is not able to deploy harvesters. The officers are directing the farmers to destroy the crop themselves. The irony is, most of the farmers are so poor that they are not able to afford the required to fell and burn the crops -- an exercise that will deliver an additional financial burden.The administration is offering Rs 50,375 as compensation for crop destroyed of per hectare. The amount is paltry and we are not sure when the money will be disbursed, said Atiur Khan, a farmer of Sonpukur. He has 17 bigha of land and he has cultivated in 1.5 bigha.Nadia is one of the most fertile tracts of Bengal with Gangetic alluvial soil flowing from both the Ganges and Padma enriching the fertility of the tract. Agriculture officers pointed out that the district displays a remarkable variety of crop diversity with jute to paddy, wheat to onion, oilseeds to vegetable.Fortunately, the fungus affects only wheat and, as a result, the fields next to the wheat that are laden with red chilli and onion are safe."

Ganesh Ram, Ratna Prasad and Paul Pandian inspected the damaged tomato crops at Marakottai village and cow peas at Aranganur village in Salem.At Mettur Dam, the team collected details of storage level, inflow and discharge from the dam on various occasions for farm activities in the Cauvery delta districts.District Collector V. Sampath made a power point presentation to the team members at the Mettur inspection bungalow on the grim situation and the severity of the drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months.The Collector also drew the attention of the Central team to the meagre water storage in the other reservoirs such as Aanaimaduvu, Kariakovil and also in all the major and minor water bodies of the district.

Maheswaran, Commissioner of Social Security Schemes, accompanied the team.The second team comprising Vijay Rajmohan, Director (Trade, Extension and Drought Management), Union Ministry of Agriculture and Santhosh, Assistant Advisor, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which arrived here after completing the visit of Namakkal, inspected the affected maize fields at Rayanpatti.The team members told presspersons at Veerapandi that they would leave for New Delhi after completing the tour of Tamil Nadu on January 25 and will submit its report to the Centre.This team was accompanied by Dheeraj Kumar, Managing Director, TWAD Board, R. Sukumar, District Revenue Officer, P. Soundararajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, and other officials.In Namakkal district, the team visited three villages and assessed the ground reality and interacted with farmers. Mohammad Nasimuddin, Principal Secretary to Government, Welfare of Differently Abled Persons and District Monitoring Officer and Collector M. Asia Mariam also accompanied it.The team visited a farm at Rasampalayam where 168 coconut trees had withered. The team accessed the dried-up cotton plants in Singalandapuram, withered onion crops and tapioca plants at Bodinaickenpatti.In Krishnagiri, the Central team was told that the district had a rainfall shortage of 30 per cent impacting on 50 per cent of crop productivity of millets and pulses.Collector C.Kathiravan accompanied the team that inspected Bargur, Pochampalli and Uthangarai.The administration told the team that about 1,09,065 hectares was brought under rain-fed cultivation. Of these, a total of 27,452 hectares has been severely hit by drought. Over 50 per cent of the affected area was under millets, groundnuts and the productivity was affected.In turn, this had caused 3,000 tonnes fodder shortage for livestock.The district ought to receive an average 830 mm rainfall. However, it received only around 590 mm.The team inspected fields under pulses and groundnut crop in Bargur block. Interacting with individual farmers in Sivampatty village and Nadupatty village in Bargur, the team sought information on the extent of damage to crops and the overall impact of drought on the fields, that were largely under groundnuts and other pulses crops.The team also visited groundnut, pulses and millets fields at Oilapatty village in Pochampalli and Dasampatty village in Uthangarai.In Erode, dried-up crops and parched fields stared at the Central officials. The team first went to Nochipalayam village and found that mulberry, coconut and sugarcane crops had dried up on vast swathes of fields. The farmers could not save the crops in spite of adoption of drip irrigation and other effective water management practices. The impact was indeed severe, Vijayaraj Mohan, senior official representing the Union Agriculture Ministry said, after observing that a cocoon unit had to be closed down due to non-availability of water.District Collector S. Prabakar pointed out the dry sugarcane stalks to the Central team.At Attayampalayam, the officials took stock of the complete damage to papaya, mango and other crops. Farmers here said they had gone ahead with heavy investments for raising the crops in anticipation of rainfall.Implementation of the Pandiyaru-Punnambazha scheme would be the only long-term solution for preventing recurrence of drought in the district, a farmer said, while narrating the inability of agriculturists to find fodder for their livestock due persistent dry conditions. The team finally visited Samigoundanpalayam village to assess the damage to turmeric crop.On Wednesday, the team will visit Surapalayam and Moolakarai in Erode block to estimate damage to tapioca, turmeric and tomato crops, and Thalayampalayam, Karukkupalayam and Bolanaickenpalayam in Perundurai block to analyse drought impact on groundnut, cotton and maize crops.(Reporting by Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The Act makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only to the licensed merchants at the mandis of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) by paying the commission and other charges.Denotification of fruits and vegetables, according to the Centre, will put an end to a chain of commission agents between the farmers and the consumers, creating a win-win situation for both. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a strong pitch for the denotification and promoting contract farming in his 2017-18 Budget presented recently.But the Karnataka government holds a different view. We have no intention to denotify perishables (from the Act). Even now the farmers are free to sell their produce directly to consumers anywhere, including APMC yards. Moreover, the government will not be in a position to intervene and provide justice to the farmers if the traders refuse to pay judicious price, Additional Secretary to Co-operation department (APMC reforms) R Manoj said.As per the Department of Agriculture Marketing, cost to the supply chain due to handling of fruits and vegetables at APMCs is only 6% of the total cost of the produce. Cost of supply chain include 5% commission and 1% hamali and other handling cost. This cost will be significantly higher in unorganised sector due to involvement of middlemen at multiple levels.Interestingly, the ruling Congress has refused to denotify perishables despite directions from the party vice president Rahul Gandhi to all the Congress-ruled state governments in 2014. Instead, the Karnataka government exempted levy of market fee on farmers (1.5% on fruits and 1% on vegetables) and made a provision for retail sales at APMC yards.Chairman of Food Processing Committee of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industries Bharat Shah said APMCs help farmers get competitive price to their produce due to the involvement of large number of traders. Besides, the farmers get necessary logistical support such as storage place at APMCs. As far as consumers are concerned, prices of fruits and vegetables are normally the lowest at APMCs compared to other places, he added, opposing the move to denotify perishables."

Asked to comment, Khader only said the canteens are for poor, labourers, rural students, who like onion and garlic in their food.Khader said the government has told the hoteliers associations and non-governmental organisations to indicate the quantity and ingredients that will be going into the food preparations.While Khader did not specify a time-frame as to when the canteens will be opened, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, at a function later in the day, said it will be launched in about two months.The state government has announced in its budget proposal for 2017-18 its intention to open Indira canteens in each of the 198 wards of the BBMP to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at an affordable price.Khader said the government is looking at possibility of food being prepared in a centralised place in every Assembly constituency and later supply to the canteens in the wards coming under its jurisdiction.The quality of food will be better than that served in Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu, the minister said.Initially, the food supply will be limited.

Picture shows MPCC president Ashok Chavan at a Sangharsh Yatra rally.PTIPTIAmidst demands of farm loan waiver in Maharashtra, the State government has announced Advanced Farming  Enriched Farmer scheme, with an aim to increase farmers income by cutting production cost and increasing the output.The scheme will be launched in the upcoming kharif season. Under the initiative, the government has declared each tehsil in the State as a unit where planning will be done for agri-development. The major tasks that would be undertaken are: raising production of major crops (up to the level of its genetic yield potential), diversification of crops, introducing marketing techniques, uniting farmers through farm producers companies and making them financially stable.According to a government resolution published last week, each tehsil, under the scheme, will be given a production target for crops. The target would be planned keeping in mind that farmers, after selling their produce, receive more money than the loan they have obtained. For farmers who are already receiving more money than the loan obtained, the target is 20% more than their present production.Additionally, the government will also spend 60% of the fund available for mechanisation of farming on tractors, power tillers, transplanters, and machines for polishing, grading, and packing the produce. The grants will be deposited in farmers bank accounts linked to Aadhar.The government has also announced that it would increase grants for construction of green houses, onion shades, and shade nets, among others. A farmer outreach campaign will also be launched from May 25 to June 8, to inform farmers about the techniques to be used in agriculture ahead of the kharif season.The Opposition has been aggressively demanding farm loan waiver since the beginning of the Budget Session of the State Assembly in March. The major Opposition parties  the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)  are presently touring the State under Sangharsh Yatra to press for their demand.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that while his government wants to waive off the loan, a decision effecting the same will be taken only at the right time and not based on the Oppositions demands. He has also said the State government would invest more in agriculture rather than announcing a loan waiver. State Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, in his Budget speech last month, had also said that the government aims to double farmers income by 2022."

However, this year, the taluk received only 631.8 mm rainfall. Of the 29 water bodies, the water-level has reached rock bottom in all the ponds except at that of Doddakere. With the intense heat, the plants are expected to go dry in the month of March and April.Although the farmers had harvested paddy, jowar, maize, ragi and groundnut during monsoon, they could not reap the benefit of the harvest. During the Rabi season, the farmers had sown jowar, chickpea, horse gram on 5,823-hectare land. However, the crops have already been lost on 1,635 hectare. The farmers have lost onion and green chilly crops at Ajjampura and Shivani while in Lingadahalli hobli, the farmers have lost the potato, green peas and vegetable crops owing to the drought.Commercial crops like arecanut have also been damaged at Doranalu and Lingadahalli hobli. An arecanut tree requires 20 litres of water per day. With drought, even after sinking a borewell 800-foot deep, we do not get water. In such a scenario, how do we nurture the plants. By pledging the gold and silver ornaments in the bank, we are hiring water tankers to supply water to the crops, said farmers.Officials said 3,000 farmers have registered their names under the Fasal Bima Yojana for compensation for loss of crops.Tahsildar J P Manje Gowda said, Crops across 15,000 hectares of land crops have been damaged during monsoon. A report on the loss of crops has been submitted to the state government through the deputy commissioner. The loss of crops during the Rabi season is being assessed jointly by the Horticulture, Agriculture and Revenue Department officials."
