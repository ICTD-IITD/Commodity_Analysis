The protesting Sanghatana activists threw onions and tur dal on the road outside Vidhan Bhavan, alleging government apathy towards farmers. A scuffle broke out between Sanghatana leader Raju Shetty and police officers when Shetty was leading a protest demanding fair prices for onions and tur dal in the state.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, one of the most organised and vocal outfits working for farmers, said the state government had promised several initiatives to help farmers get better price for their produce. However, it failed to implement these initiatives, it said. The government has failed to give a better life to our farmers. Our farmers continue to suffer, we cannot tolerate this. Till the Devendra Fadnavis government takes initiatives we will continue with the protest, Shetty said.The state witnessed the highest number of suicides in 2015, with around 4,291 farmers ending their lives. In 2016, around 3,052 farmers in the state committed suicide. The numbers arent any better. We demand justice, we demand a better life for the farmers, added Shetty. Several Sanghatana activists were arrested after they threw a bag full of onions on the car of state Agriculture Minister Sadabhau Khot. The cause for which the Sanghatana is protesting is genuine and we understand. They are demanding better life for farmers and that the farmers can earn some profit, Khot said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

I didn't know what to make of it, my friend shared her thoughts with me the other day. Does that mean we are indifferent or ignorant? she wondered aloud looking at me in confusion. I really couldnt give her any answer.The measure of your real success as a parent can be known by the way your children describe you when talking to their friends, goes a saying. I truly didnt know what her sons statement implied  what could being cool actually mean and how that could be attributed to a dont care attitudeThe current generation of parents are a confused lot. The meanings of words as they perceive them can be very different from what their children imply. It is important for parents to understand what their progeny is talking about. So it is imperative that a lot of time is spent and interaction is sustained to learn and unlock the mysteries of their expressions.When they say, Oh I am doing an onion check on that, you will not scratch your head if you know that onion check means checking of facts. You will not look dazed by the remark that she threw shade at him, if you get the picture of her publicly disrespecting him. If they assure you, we shall T-up surely and if you can gather that they will certainly turn up in the evening for the family get-together, then you will not be caught with an ashen black face. If they come hug you and say You are my bae, you will not go bonkers if you know that it is an acronym for before anyone else.Wow, how exultant will you feel knowing that they place you before anyone else! Studies have demonstrated that if parents showed interest, children were likely to explain their language, however reluctantly. Most of them, though, would be happy if their parents stopped at OMG, BRB, BFN and GBY.Way back in 1675, after labouring for 35 years, Sir Christopher Wren presented his masterpiece for Queen Annes inspection. The monarch readily pronounced them to be awful, artificial and amusing, for in those days awful meant full of awe, artificial meant very artful, and amusing meant amazing! How amazingly, awesomely and amusingly the semantic usage of words changes. Centuries hence, how our childrens lingo would be used remains to be seen.I remember the satirical yet realistic warning given by a new-age guru: Dont be a 21st century parent who cannot correct a child. How pertinent! But before trying to correct them, parents must learn their lingo, guruji."

The Centre should study in detail the supply-demand situation both at national and international levels and discover the future prices of commercial crops well ahead of the cropping season each year for the benefit of farmers who were experiencing fluctuating fortunes year after year switching from one crop to another, said Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch. Ranga Rao.Knee-jerk reaction from the governments to the market downslide be it in the case of redgram or other farm produce like tobacco, onion or chilli witnessed in the last few years, will not be any help to the debt-ridden farmers who are clueless about growing which crop and in what extent, said All India Kisan Sabha district secretary V. Hanuma Reddy.A majority of chilli farmers in the district had not benefited by the Fasal Bima Yojna, thanks to indifferent attitude of officials, said Congress farmers wing district president V. Rajagopala Reddy and demanded a compensation of Rs. 40,000 per acre to each chilli farmer who on an average got only six quintals of produce as against the normal 20 quintals. Prakasam district Rythu Sangam secretary D. Gopinath wanted the State government to start chilli procurement centres at Ongole and Markapur."

Representative imageThe proposed Indira canteens have hit a new hurdle with two major hoteliers associations conveying to the Karnataka government that they cannot supply food for the proposed outlets as it is not feasible for them from the economic point of view.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had set aside Rs 100 crore in the budget for 2017-18 to establish Indira canteens in the 198 wards of Bengaluru. It is almost designed on the lines of Amma canteens of Tamil Nadu. It is supposed to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at an affordable price.Initially, the government had been in talks with Iskcon for supply of food to these canteens. The government wants garlic and onion in the food. But, Iskcon expressed its inability to use both in its preparations. Later, the government approached two major hoteliers associations.The hoteliers associations are not interested in the offer made by the government. For them, it is a conflict of interest. Any involvement in running the canteens including supply of food will mean affecting their own business interest, they say. This despite the government stating that it will reimburse the expenses and also ensure the hoteliers make profit.Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association, with around 2,000 hotels in BBMP region as its members, was approached by the Food and Civil Supplies Department to supply food to the canteens. The 81-year-old association, which is one of the oldest in Karnataka, has outright rejected the proposal.We have our own problems. Catering is not an easy task. There is shortage of manpower. So, we rejected it, Association President B Chandrashekar Hebbar said.Hebbar said the hoteliers were asked to provide details like quantity and ingredients that will be going into the food preparations and also their rate chart. However, the association did not respond.Karnataka Pradesh Hoteliers and Restaurants Association, which is an umbrella organisation comprising hoteliers associations in all districts, too has rejected the government offer. Its president M Rajendra, like Hebbar, has said it is not financially viable to supply prepared food.Besides, he said the concept of providing subsidised food itself is flawed. Any government should help the poor stand up on their own. They should feel proud that they are earning. They should not be made to depend on any freebies, Rajendra said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said the reason his department approached the hoteliers was to utilise their expertise. We had explained to them that their business will not be affected as the canteens are meant not to wean away their regular customers but for the poor, Khader said.He said the government is not banking only on the hoteliers for supplies. Many NGOs, youth associations and even individuals have come forward showing interest in the scheme. We will talk to them soon."
5904677d7be9e04154df66b7,Leafing through a salad book,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/leafing-through-a-salad-book/,2017-02-13,"On a cold blistery day in Delhi, my nieces 2-year-old son is entertaining himself by looking at pictures in my salad book and identifying the vegetables. About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."
590468007be9e04154df6795,"Luv, shuv and bheja fry on Valentine’s Day",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mrsfunnybones/82758/,2017-02-12,"In the next two days, timelines on Facebook and the rocks on Bandstand will be packed with mushy lovers. The effects of demonetisation will vanish temporarily, as money will flow towards weary-looking red roses and wads of chewing gum that may not quite mask the smell of methi theplas or onion uttapams that passionate lovers have consumed for lunch.The tidal wave called Valentines Day is already heralding its arrival in a flurry of red hearts but does love really have anything to do with the heart or is it all just a chemical compulsion driven by the brain?Well, Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, believes love has three chemically driven stages  lust, attraction and attachment which I will attempt to break down with the help of my two slightly stereotypical protagonists  the girl next door and the lungi dancer who will soon fall for each other, hook, line and sinker.1. Hook a Fish: First, lets wave out to testosterone and estrogen. These two hormones are like your interfering buas who just want to make sure you reproduce and carry on the family line. Research states that it does not take more than 4 minutes to decide if you fancy each other. It has only 7% to do with what you say and 55% with body language.Which is why Romeo didnt really need to talk to Juliet, before he began spouting, O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!Or when at her cousin Montys sangeet, our girl next door spots a gentleman doing the lungi dance and yelps, He doth look like a yummy block of Chocolate Cornetto! And begins walking toward him. According to scientists at Trinity College, this is not the heart talking but the paracingulate cortex that has quickly assessed the gentlemans worthiness as a mate.2. Snort a Line: The lungi dancer and the girl next door soon land smack in the middle of evolutions great plan, the survival of the species. Surges of adrenaline have made their hearts race. An MRI would reveal that their brain areas associated with the production of dopamine are in overdrive.Considering dopamine is also what the brain releases when you take a hit of cocaine, our lovers are now literally getting addicted to each other. Love also makes serotonin in the brain dip to levels close to those found in people with obsessive-compulsive disorders, which is probably why the lungi dancer calls the girl next door a hundred times a day while she keeps doodling his initials all over her spreadsheets. The passionate lovers have fervent conversations, like on the sole occasion that our protagonist  who may have forgotten to eat intermittently but has always remembered to match her lingerie  finds she has made a blasphemous error and says, ErrBaby not today, my legs are not shaved. The lungi dancer growls, You are worried about hair? Right now I dont care if you had cactus sprouting on your thighs and Cerberus, the three-headed dog guarding my gateway to heaven.She sighs, You are such a poet but I think Cerberus guards the door to hell.He replies, If that is hell my darling, then like Prince Charles who famously said to Camilla that he wished to be reborn as a tampon, add me to that list so that I can also stay in hell forever!But even with a semi-functioning brain, she realises that it doesnt sound very hygienic so she says, Tampons have to be changed frequently otherwise the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, gets into your bloodstream andHe interrupts, I cant understand anything you are saying but it sounds hot, come here!Now imagine two flowers frantically shaking in the wind like in our good old Hindi movies and you may get a clearer picture.3. Happily tied to the Sinker: If human beings were left in the throes of dopamine thrall then they would be incapable of focusing on anything else. So Mother Nature, who also wants parents to stick together and raise children, ensures that after 18 months to three years, all this hormonal upheaval stabilises and bonding chemicals come into play. Released during hugging as well as sex, oxytocin deepens feelings of attachment and security while vasopressin, also released during sex, is linked to behaviour that produces long-term, monogamous relationships.At this point, the girl next door, dressed in striped pajamas and flannel socks, is cribbing as she climbs into bed, Jeez! The babys projectile vomiting even beats that possessed girl in Exorcist. Once I used to smell of eau de toilette and now I guess I have to settle for eau de puke!The lungi dance champ, with a little more fat and a lot less hair, engrossed in his iPad murmurs, Hmm.. very good.She snaps, You are not listening to me, your iPad is more important than me right?He says Come on, dont be like that, as she continues to moan about how different it all was in the beginning.The lungi dancer attempts to lighten her mood, You know how much I love you baby? More than I love cockroaches, telemarketers and mummys butter chicken! and adds, So are you up for it? She giggles and five minutes later they are lying down together, doing what they both enjoy tremendously, watching the new season of Sherlock on Netflix.The cuddling helps their brains release a little oxytocin and who knows, after their upcoming Valentines dinner they just might add some vasopressin to their piggy bank as well.So now that we have figured out where love stems from, this Valentines Day instead of sending mundane heart-shaped candy boxes emblazoned with I love you, how about celebrating love in its truest sense by presenting your beloved with some bheja fry from Mohammed Ali Road with a note that says, Roses are red, violets are blue, this is the state of my brain because I am chemically addicted to you."
5905a1a27be9e04154e011f8,"Once an elite dish, now a favourite of the masses",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/once-an-elite-dish-now-a-favourite-of-the-masses/articleshow/58202529.cms,2017-04-16,"GOA: W""There are recipes dating back to when the Portuguese arrived in Goa that list small fish like sardines or mackerels, or shrimps as the primary ingredient. But, the vegetarian varieties that using mushroom or pumpkin or okras are also fairly common,"" says executive chef at Cidade de Goa, Sunit Sharma.The light yellowish-green gravy is prepared by grinding together a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, garlic and turmeric with grated coconut. The resultant paste is then strained to obtain what is called the first press coconut milk. The extraction of the second press follows post the addition of a little bit of water, and it is in the second press extract that the dish is prepared.Cooking the caldinho begins with a dash of chopped onions and some tomatoes that are used to give the curry some texture. But, one must keep in mind the acidity factor of the tomatoes during preparation. ""The tomatoes' acidic nature is highly likely to cause the coconut milk to curdle if you are not careful. It's important to use just the optimum amount of tomatoes to prevent the gravy from losing its flavour,"" says Oswin Pinto , owner and chef at Hogworth, Miramar. ""If you aren't sure, the best idea is to avoid the tomatoes entirely,"" he advises.ith its origins hidden in the ubiquitous broth or soup , the caldinho is yet another outcome of the amalgamation of Portuguese and Konkani influences that gives Goan cuisine its unique character Named after the caldo, which means soup in Portuguese, the caldinho is probably one of the most understated yet versatile dishes of the coastal state's culinary offerings.This creamy curry was once served at the dining table of the elite. ""Caldinho was eaten with bread by the rich as the first course of the meal during the Portuguese era. Besides the high-value fish, an entire coconut goes into making one plate of caldinho, which makes its preparation an expensive affair,"" says owner of Viva Panjim, Linda D'Souza.Unlike conventional curries that are heavy on spices and chillies, the caldinho is prepared using a generous amount of coconut milk. In another recipe, grated coconut is cooked till it turns into a paste.The principal ingredientbe it fish, or prawns, or vegetablesare added once the onion turns translucent, and the second press coconut milk extract follows soon after. The stew is then allowed to simmer till the ingredients are properly cooked and topped off with the first press coconut milk.The curry sauce is not spicy in the vegetarian caldinho either, but continues to be flavourful like its seafood counterpart. The caldinho goes well with traditional Goan rice or bread and is best served piping hot.""It is easy to cook and lends itself well to a variety of ingredients,"" says Sharma. ""While it might seem unlikely that a coastal state like Goa would have a vegetarian version of the caldinho, the long periods of abstinence from non-vegetarian food, practised by both Christian and Hindu communities has seen the dish evolve over time,"" he adds."

In the last 15 days, prices of many vegetables have more than doubled barring that of potato and onion.In retail markets and shops in Satellite area, except potatoes and onions, no other vegetable is available at rates below Rs 50 per kg. While in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, (APMC), Ahmedabad, brinjal is selling somewhere between Rs8-Rs16 per kg in wholesale, the same is selling in retail at Rs 60 per kg in city localities.The prices of vegetables at APMC have gone up by around 15%, while in retail the prices have almost doubled. Officials from APMC said that all vegetables, except potatoes and onions, are in short supply.According to Gujarat agriculture department, the sowing of vegetables, which was normally done across 1.24 lakh hectares was done only across 82,000 hectares. The department however claims that the sowing of vegetable was around 9,000 hectares more than that in last year.Prices of several vegetables had crossed the Rs 100 mark in retail market in 2016, but had eased after demonetization.Agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, however, said, ""The shortfall in sowing has no relation with demonetization. The sowing was delayed because there was less rainfall in 2016, and hence farmers moved away from vegetable to crops that needed less water.""""We hope that prices will likely come down within the next fortnight when the summer crop starts to arrive. The prices are generally on the higher side during this period,"" said D M Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad.Patel said, ""During demonetization, bulk buyers were away from the market. As a result, farmers were forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. But now the market has stabilized.""APMC officials said that supply of potato to the APMC each day was 370 kg more than what is normal at this time of the year, and the supply of onion is 415 kg more than expected, daily."

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

If you thought 'classroom chaos', you're off the mark. Now, speaking of mark... it's the evaluation process that seems to be keeping them up all night. Mirror spoke with PU lecturers to know what's going on with the evaluation process. Many of them admitted that going through answer scripts was, too often, a task that required a certain emotional durability Here's an example quoted by a lecturer, who had to evaluate a student on his write-up on the Chipko Movement. Instead of an answer, this is what the lecturer got. ""Sir, please pass me this one time. I honestly tell you that I know everything about Vandana Shiva. But at the moment I can't recall anything about her.""This 'Ghajini' student didn't just stop there. Instead of Chipko Movement, he wrote paras after paras trying to convince the evaluator why he should be passed and how, if done so, he will go on to become a Vandana Shiva himself one day and ""re-start"" a new Chipko movement.While some take the coax-plead-beg route, some are self-confessed hard-workers, calling for their ""efforts"" to be appreciated. For example, this was the note left in Kannada by a student in his English exam answer script: ""Sir, I am a Kannada student and don't know to write in English. I have tried my level best to answer your English exam in Kannada. You need to appreciate my efforts and pass me.""This may bring to mind the recent case of an SSLC student who ""mistakenly"" took his first language test in English instead of Kannada. He then went back home and got his parents to demand a pardon/re-exam from the board.Evaluators say that the 'emotional' card is too frequently played. Take, for example, this one: ""There are valid reasons for you to pass me as I don't have parents and need to take care of my siblings. Know that you're not holding in your hands a pen, but my future.""The lecturer said: ""I recall one more incident where a student had written that his father was a soldier and had died fighting for the country and so he couldn't study for exams."" And another one claimed that if he/she didn't score above 80 per cent, their parents would discontinue their studies. The lecturer said that while they wouldn't pay heed to such pleadings, these do sometimes take a toll on them, emotionally.* DO OR DIE""If the evaluator doesn't pass me, I shall be forced to do black magic on him and his family so that all of them die. I am a good student and have written all other papers well. But Maths is tough. And it's not my fault that it is tough. I dream of going to college like my brothers. If I fail, my family will abuse me and I will be forced to hang myself.""* ALL FOR LOVEOne answer script narrated in detail why the student must be given marks and be passed. Apparently, he was deeply in love with a girl and planned to ask her hand in marriage (ahem... underage?) but the girl refuses to have a loser for a husband. So unless the examiner is gracious enough, he'll lose in the exam, and also the girl.* AND THEN, THIS""On Sunday, I tried making chicken sambar at home. I want to share the recipe with you. First, I bought a kilo of chicken from the market. The chicken was of good quality. To start with, I had to chop it into pieces, then add masala and grind it with onion in a mixer-grinder.

Hence, we want to try this smart and new idea of going on strike to awaken the government, which is not ready to take any farmer centric policy decision , said Yogesh Rayate, a grape farmer from Nashik district.He said he has been waiting for about a decade for the government to allow import of African grape varieties, which could reduce the production cost by half and have better acceptability in the international market.Having spent Rs 70,000 as primary expenses on a two-acre brinjal plot, Rayate has been asking anyone and everyone to take the brinjals for free as the price in the local market has dropped to just about Rs 2.5 per kg. About 40-50 villages from Nifad and Chandvad talukas have contacted me for joining the agitation, said Rayate.Farmers have demanded complete loan waiver, supply of free electricity to farms, implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee Report, full subsidy for micro irrigation systems and a minimum price of Rs 50 per litre for milk.The Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee, the largest in Asia for onions, had organised a meeting to take guidance from Dhanajay Jadhav from Puntamba village of Ahmednagar district, where the first resolution to go on strike was passed on April 3. Since then, the leaderless movement appears to have spread like wildfire, with about 70 villages having passed the resolution to join the strike.The agitating farmers have decided to submit their resolutions en masse to the government on May 1, when it is mandatory for all the village panchayats to organise gram sabhas. Villages in vicinity of Lasalgaon have decided to join the agitation as onion prices have fallen to about half the cost of production. Our teams will spread out from April 22 to different parts of the state to explain the demands to the villagers, said Jadhav.Farmers have decided to involve the cooperative dairies, which they claim have agreed to refuse sale of liquid milk and instead process it into various milk products from June 1."

Much disappointed are 1,500-odd farmers in tribal hamlets in the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve. For the first time in a decade, these farmers were prepared to stop using chemical fertilizers and begin organic farming . But lack of rainfall has forced them to postpone sowing to April or June.NGOs and experts have suggested alternate cropping pattern to tribal farmers living at hamlets in the ATR. ""Due to various factors such as green revolution and migration of people to forest fringes, the traditional farming methods of tribals changed and this affected the entire ecosystem. The farmers in this region traditionally sowed millets, grain amaranthus, black gram and groundnuts. But they slowly shifted to rice and beans due to competition and to increase their revenue. But use of fertilizers was affecting rivers and streams inside the forest, which is a tiger reserve,"" said Peter Prem Chakravathi, a biologist working with the tribal farmers in the ATR for the past three years.""They are beginning to realise that living inside the forest they cannot pollute the environment,"" said a forest official.The major tribal hamlets that are under focus are Kodanthur, Poparai and Thalinji in the Udumalpettai division. Other hamlets that are also getting trained are Kodar, Malasar, Malai Malasar, Maduvar, Pulayur and Eravalar.P Mullai, senior project officer of World Wildlife Fund who is training and orienting the tribals, said, ""Their traditional method is natural farming. But after middlemen increased, they began producing short-term crops using a lot of fertilizers and chemicals. But slowly, we are trying to create awareness and nearly 40% of the farmers have agreed to shift to organic farming. Next week, we are taking them to Udhagamandalam to visit farms that use traditional methods,"" said Mullai.Forest rangers and officials said the only deterrent was marketing their produce. ""We are trying the show them the demand for organic produce and are trying to tie up with organisations to market their products. Once that is finalised, we can create a model and make all tribal communities follow the best practices,"" said a forest ranger.The farmers are slowly realising the multi-cropping system can get more revenue. ""Last year, they suffered huge losses as all the farmers only produced beans. But this year, TNAU has agreed to supply hybrid varieties that will increase their yield. We are hopeful that by June the cultivation would begin and the 958 sqkm area of ATR, which is biologically one of the most important part of the Western Ghats, will be preserved for the future generations,"" said Mullai.G V Rajalingam, assistant professor at TNAU, said the tribal farmers can adopt the latest technologies and grow ladies finger, small onion and cauliflower instead of paddy, lablabs and French beans. Also, crops like beetroot and turnips were suggested for the winter season."

What if this one derails too?The over 1,200-km journey from Indore to his village Bilaujha in Mau district of eastern Uttar Pradesh was a special one for 17-year-old Vishal Gupta. His sister Ruby, 23, was getting married on December 1. The shopping for her trousseau was done, and father Ram Prasad Gupta, 45, a sales assistant at a wine shop in Indore, had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from friends and relatives to provide for the other expenses. Vishal, a Class 10 student, his father, sisters Ruby and 14-year-old Khushi, boarded the Indore-Patna Express from Indore in the afternoon on November 19.A little after 3 am, when most passengers were fast asleep, fourteen coaches of the train derailed at Pukhrayan in Kanpur Dehat district, leaving over 150 dead. Vishal and his family were in the S-1 coach that was one of the worst hit in the accident. A few hours after the accident, Ruby, Khushi and I managed to pull ourselves out of the debris, but we couldnt find our father. We lost all our belongings, including the money that my father had borrowed, recalls Vishal.A student of Little Angels Convent in Indore, he will return to school in February, after his sisters wedding. The thought of that journey is scary, he says. I have not boarded a train since the accident. What if that train derails too? Why cant drivers be more careful? asks Vishal. Its ironic that the government talks of bullet trains when they should be worrying about the safety of passengers. Isnt it more important that passengers reach their destination safe, even if late? he says.

Their father, Paramananda Harijan, 45, squats on the floor as there are no chairs available for attendants. They have been here since the night of December 14 when Rashmita had to be rushed to hospital after being diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia Dr Priyaranjan Bahali, who did the morning rounds at the ward, told them that Rashmitas haemoglobin level was 6 gm/dl, less than half of the ideal count.Kanchan, a Class 12 Arts student of Sai Vinayak College in Majhiguda, admits she is worried about missing school. My final examinations are in March and I dont want to miss classes even for a day, she says The Dalit girl from Pakhanaguda village in Nandahandi block of Nabarangpur is the most educated in her family of five that includes Rashmita, their younger brother Balaram and her parents. Two years ago, after she scored 56 per cent in her Class 10 exams, Kanchans parents enrolled her for Plus 2 in a private college. The monthly fees is Rs 2,200, and Kanchan knows the money is daunting for her father, who works as an MNREGS labourer.What bothers Kanchan more, though, is the lack of buses as she must travel 20 km every day to college. She pays Rs 10 for the 30-minute ride, but rarely gets a seat. Read more here  Debabrata MohantyNishant Khushwaha, Delhi | I want to acquire skills. Can I do that, and not be a labourer like my father?In August, Nishant Khushwaha earned his first salary, at a cardboard factory in northwest Delhis Shalimar Bagh. It was the first time I earned regular money. It was apna paisa (my own money) and I could do anything I wanted with it, says Nishant, a lean teenager with long hair backbrushed into a pompadour. But the stint was shortlived. Nishant caught chikungunya and a bad bout of brain fever, his mother Sunita says. By the time he recovered, demonetisation had been announced, and it was the end of job prospects for the school dropout who has no inclination to study.In the new year, Nishant hopes to get a stable job in a mobile phone manufacturing factory.My friend Sahil works in a unit where mobile phones are assembled. Kaam seekhna hai (I want to acquire skills). Why cant I get a job like that? I dont want to be a labourer like my father, he says.

The money would help, but above all, the job would allow him to get married to the love of his life. They met at a wedding in Kandhla and fell in love instantly, he says. Living in a one-room house with his father, two brothers, two sisters-in-law and their five children, in Kairanas Nahid Colony built for the riot victims of Muzaffarnagar, Loman pines for privacy to even talk to her.He hasnt thought about whether he can legally marry the girl, who is 17 too. When it comes to that, the teenager hopes the fact that he has no document proving his age will help. Since no one in the family, originally belonging to Fugana village  one of the worst hit in the September 2013 violence  remembers his birthday, it is an approximate guess that he is 17.

But can I still?Tabish Rafiq Bhat says he always hoped to do a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) some day. But the pellets that pierced his left eye shattered his retina  and his dreams. Now, he says, he cant look at the printed word without his eyes watering.My future seems dark just like my eye, says the 17-year-old, who wrote his Class 10 examinations in November. Tabish says he asked for a writer during the exams, but the Board of School Education turned down my request. My left eye hurt badly when I wrote my exams, he says, lying under a blanket in his single-room house that is partitioned to make space for the kitchen.The family is preparing for another surgery  the fourth  on Tabishs left eye. Doctors say there are two more pellets inside. They say they can only remove the pellets and that I wont be able to see with my left eye.

Will the curfew end?For the majority of her teenage years, Alice Yumnam was blissfully unaware of what an Inner Line Permit (ILP) meant even though, she admits, peer pressure initially prompted her to take part in the protests on the issue, which first cropped up in 2012.Alices locality, Khurai in Imphal East district in the state capital, has always been the epicentre of Meitei-centric protests in Manipur. And their demand for some form of an Inner Line Permit (ILP), which restricts entry of outsiders into Manipur, has largely been driven by the youth wing of the Joint Committee for Inner Line Permit (JCILP), a group of civic organisations that has been spearheading the movement since 2012.

Then how are we going to ensure this isnt repeated?When news that his uncle had passed away reached him on March 19, Mohammad Shahjad Alam was at his madrasa at Mubarakpur in Uttar Pradeshs Azamgarh district. It was only after he returned home to Jharkhand two days later, he says, that he realised what had happened. His uncle, Mohammad Majloom Ansari, 35, and 12-year-old Imtiyaz Khan were lynched, allegedly by a mob of cow vigilantes, at Jhabar village in Jharkhands Latehar district, and their bodies strung up on a tree. The two cattle traders, herding oxen to a fair in Hazaribagh, were accused of taking the animals for illegal slaughter.When I returned, all I could see was people in tears. The memories just refuse to fade. I dont remember any celebrations at home since, says Alam, sitting in his home at Nawada village, 10 km from Jhabar, where the incident occurred.

Can you ask an East Bengal fan to cheer for a bad pass?Anirbana Dasgupta has an opinion on everything  from the state of education in West Bengal to the recent Supreme Court order on the national anthem  and a football analogy for each.The Class 11 student of Marias Day School in Howrah says he wants to get out of West Bengal in 2017 because the state just doesnt offer the same options anymore. Its like a football team with great forwards, but a bad goalkeeper and even worse defenders.An avid footballer, a voracious reader and a self-confessed science geek, Anirbana says he has avoided films in movie halls since the national anthem order.Of course, I will stand up for the anthem if thats the law. But if I am going to watch a movie for the Sunny Leone item number in it, I am not in a very patriotic mood, am I? Feelings of patriotism should come from within. I mean, you cant ask an East Bengal fan to cheer for a bad pass which costs the team a goal, can you? Read more here  Aniruddha GhosalDivyesh Solanki, Una | Why should I stay a Hindu? Maybe I will convert to Buddhism this yearNo money today either, says Divyesh Solanki as he walks home with his mother and sister after a day spent sorting and packing freshly harvested onion bulbs. They are hired for Rs 160 a day, and for the last three days, havent been paid their money.The farmer has asked me to come back tomorrow, says Divyesh. He doesnt know what else he could do for a living, he says. He knows what he wont do, however. Until a few months ago, almost every male member in our extended family and community skinned cows for a living. I never learnt to do it and even if I did, after what happened to members of our community, I cant imagine doing it either.Divyeshs village Mota Samadhiyala was the epicentre of Dalit unrest in Gujarat after seven men from the village were flogged on July 11 by a group of gau rakshaks for skinning a cow carcass.

He was afraid when the Naxals arrived in his village, Kodapakha in Kanker district, and demanded that he, then 10, do odd jobs for them. He was afraid when he first heard gunshots and saw bodies, when just a child. He was afraid when he left for another village to study, separated from his parents for the first time. Now, the 17-year-old says, fear never leaves him.So if he could, he would ask this question to all those responsible for the play of life and death in the theatre of Bastar: When will you allow us to stop being afraid? I want to ask the government and the Maoists, and everyone else who can do something, when will the fighting end?Naresh clearly remembers the day Naxals picked him up from his house. He was playing with his younger sister and elder brother. A group of four walked up to his father in the fields and demanded that Naresh be handed over.

I dont even speak good EnglishAfter his Class 10, Gramapudi Pavan wanted to join the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Guntur town, but opted for an Intermediate college (Class 10 and 12) because it was less expensive. Pavan, the son of a tenant farmer, and his family  parents and two younger siblings  live on Narsaraopet Road, not far from where Rohith Vemula, the Dalit PhD scholar who committed suicide on January 17 at the University of Hyderabad, grew up.A second-year student of CEC (Civics, Economics, and Commerce) at the S M Intermediate College in Guntur, Pavan hopes to go to S M College near Guntur next year for a graduation degree in commerce. It is a good college and has a big campus, he says. But Pavan has his worries: I have heard a lot of ragging happens in these big colleges. But I am more worried about being identified by my caste.

The young men, from the nearby Sangal Basti, where a majority of the families are below poverty line, are drawn to the tracks by the afternoon sun; the passing trains a minor inconvenience.Among those in one such smoke-filled circle is Charna, 17, a school dropout. His father, he says, died in a road accident when he was just seven. It fell upon his mother, who works as a domestic help, to raise Charna and his elder brother. I didnt find studies interesting so stopped going to school after Class 8. What use is studying? I know many guys who have passed Class 10 but dont have any proper jobs. They all do manual labour. So it is better to start working from now, Charna says.

He says he loves the television serial Tarak Mehta Ka Ulta Chashma while the Salman Khan-superhit Bajrangi Bhaijaan was the last movie he watched. He lives near the only mosque in Ganesh Talai, a locality in Madhya Pradeshs Khandwa town populated by both Hindus and Muslims, but says he visits it only for Friday prayers.The teenagers nervous smile betrays his anxiety. Not keen to speak by himself, Faizan says he has been told by his family and relatives to avoid talking to strangers. The apprehensions are shared by many Muslim youth in the communally sensitive Khandwa town  often in the news for its link to the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI)  who are scared of being called by the police for questioning, particularly in the wake of recent events. Of the eight SIMI undertrials gunned down by police on October 31, hours after they allegedly escaped from Bhopal Central Jail, five were from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh.

Will I be able to speak my mind?In a little over six months from now, Aditya Chanana, a Class 12 science student, will begin college. While his days now are filled with coursework and preparing for engineering entrance exams, he often longs for a break, like the one he took through his school years, to cycle around the lush green Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, a few kilometres from his home in south Delhis Vasant Kunj locality.After a hectic school week, I would go there to unwind. I am also part of a cyclists group, and on a couple of occasions we went to the campus together. The Aravalis, the greenery, the winding roads, all made for a great cycling course, says Aditya, a student of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj. But Aditya no longer makes his weekly trips to the campus. In February this year, while I was cycling around the campus, I came across a protest rally. There was a crowd outside the administrative block, and I saw a couple of television reporters talking to students. I was told that a group of students had raised anti-India slogans, says Aditya, whose father works in a pharmaceutical firm. He has no siblings. Read more here.  Saikat BoseUmarfarukh Mainoddin Patel, Latur | Will there be another drought? Can government tackle it?In March, when the Latur water crisis was at its peak, like scores of others, the family of Umarfarukh Mainoddin Patel wanted desperately to leave the city. It was the worst nightmare of our life. We had to walk kilometres in the blazing summer sun to get a bucket of water, remembers Umarfarukh. Often, it fell upon the 17-year-old to fetch water for the family, which lives in Shahu Chowk area of Latur, as his father would leave for work early in the morning. The nearest water points were Gandhi Chowk and Vivekanand Chowk, both 2 km away, says the Class 12 student. He either carried the pitchers home or rode back with them on a bicycle.It was an exercise that could last up to eight hours a day, says Umarfarukh. By the time he reached the spot, there would already be long queues, of people with two-three pitchers or buckets each, struggling with the trickle being dispensed at the water point. I used to get a fright. In a crucial academic year, his studies suffered too, Umarfarukh says, as standing in the sun for so long often left him ill. His ambition is to become a judge. I want to ensure justice to the poor, especially those wrongly charged In this country, only those who have money get justice, the poor have little recourse to justice, he says.

Ours was the most unlucky batch. We had faced a similar situation in Class 10 in 2014 when our exams had got postponed due to the floods in the city. Instead of 2014, we sat for the exams in 2015, and some months later, appeared for Class 11 exams, says Sama, playing with her two younger brothers, who are in Classes 7 and 8.I thought I would make up for all that this year, but 2016 proved even worse, sighs Sama, who had cleared Class 10 with distinction. After her initial schooling at a private English-medium school in Karan Nagar, Sama now studies in the Kothibagh Higher Secondary School, a reputed government institution. In the five months following Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wanis killing, Sama couldnt move out of her house and due to the Internet and mobile phone blockades, struggled to stay in touch with friends and classmates. I couldnt even concentrate on my studies due to the protests and curfews, Sama adds.

He has been invoking Mahatma Gandhi very often to support the liquor ban, but I would like to ask him if Gandhi was not relevant then.At the same time, clarifies Arya Mohan, a student of Class 12 at DAV, BSEB Colony, Patna, she supports prohibition as well as Nitish Kumar and his development vision. Prohibition is a great tool of women empowerment. In a low-income family, with its head a drinker, education becomes secondary. I am happy that some of these families probably understand the value of education now, she says, adding that she has heard from friends stories of families being destroyed by drinking.

He added that places have been identified in all the wards for these canteens.Each canteen will be roughly 500 sqft and the construction of each canteen will cost a minimum of Rs 7.5 lakh. We will spend Rs 15 crore for this. We have also received 671 responses from the public for the logo design and 177 responses for the building design, he said.A committee has been formed consisting of ministers K J George and U T Khader, BBMP mayor, deputy mayor and the BBMP commissioner among others. This committee will take a final call on the logo and the building design. The panel had also been entrusted with the responsibility of identifying the agencies that will supply food. The entire process is expected to take another three months.Siddaramaiah said there will be multiple agencies to supply food. There will be one kitchen for every assembly ward and there will be multiple agencies. Let there be competition. But we will not compromise on quality, he said.The government will also look at the Tamil Nadu model of Amma Canteens to decide how best to run the canteens and the amount to be paid to the agencies. It will also look at how a similar system for pourakarmikas is being managed and whether the same can be applied to the canteens.One has to pay Rs 5 for breakfast at the canteen while lunch and dinner will cost Rs 10.Siddaramaiah said that a lot of importance will be given to making the food delicious and added that ISKCON had to be ruled out as they do not use onion and garlic.They are doing an excellent job in providing food for other schemes, but we need this (canteen) food to have a little spice. It should not be monotonous, the CM said."
5922beba7be9e01fe6dfa133,Embracing the vegan life,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/apr/29/embracing-the-vegan-life-1598862.html,2017-04-29,"BENGALURU:What do you do on the last Saturday of the month? Vegans in Bengaluru meet up for a potluck and spend hours discussing ideas, political issues, recipes over a hearty vegan lunch at Cubbon Park.They have been meeting up since 2009 and the vegan community in the city has only been increasing. According to the vegans, there are roughly about 400 vegans in the city and majority have turned to veganism for reasons such as animal abuse.Veganism is a practice of abstaining from animal products and is also an underlining philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.Milesh Kumar, a software engineer decided to turn vegan in 2003 and had been living in the city for years. He read up on the plight of dairy industry and decided to make a concrete decision of turning vegan. His friends and family were not able to understand his decision but he was adamant. Realising the importance of keeping oneself driven in the choice made, he decided to look up for other people following the same practice.In 2009 it was easier to connect because of Facebook and soon enough an informal group was formed, ready to meet up and share a vegan lunch. The vegans have now started meeting regularly on the last Saturday of every month between January and November. December is the only month they dont meet because people enjoy vacations then.The upcoming vegan potluck will be held this coming Saturday on April 29 between 2 pm and 5pm. It is not important that only vegans should attend the potluck. Anybody who is curious can. Aakriti Gupta, attended a potluck two years ago when she was not a vegan. It took her almost half a year and a lot of contemplation before she decided to guarantee her path.There are only two criteria on attending the potluck. First of all the person should get his/her own vegan meal which can be shared with at least five people. The second point is that the person should take care of the utensils.Southie Food Can Easily Be Made VeganVegans will agree that most of the time people look at them in awe and question what do they really eat. Milesh Kumar has an answer for that. South India cuisines such as idly, sambar, rice, rasam are almost all vegan, it is just that it has not been identified as one. If you separate the dairy products from the South Indian food, everything is easily vegan, he says.He also argues that being vegan is not being deprived as most people believe it to be. We can enjoy the same food with different ingredients and now there are many options open. We dont drink cows milk but there are options such as soy milk, coconut milk, peanut milk etc. Last potluck I made rosogulla. I also ensure to take curd rice every potluck, the curd is from peanut milk, he adds.What being vegan meansBeing vegan means being compassionately driven to be responsible not just to avoid cruelty, shares Milesh who further adds how the animal industry contributes the most to greenhouse effect.Akriti learned about veganism and explored the subject with her husband. She was not so much of a cook at home but after she turned vegan she started cooking at home and enjoying recipes her friends gave her at potluck. It obviously takes more than one try to nail the dish though, she laughs.One of her favourite dishes is the pasta she makes by using potato, onion and cashews as the sauce. I add a lot of mushrooms because I love it and season it with the usual spices and herbs, she shares. Aakriti became a vegan strictly from the environment point of view. We constantly blame and question what the politicians are doing about the environment but we ourselves dont do anything. I wanted to change that about myself, she adds.As of today, we will find majority of vegans as adults who have made a choice by themselves.A countable number of vegans are children, because of their vegan parents. About one per cent of the vegans choose to the path because of the health benefits veganism is said to have. Personally, when it comes to health benefits, I have only realised that I dont catch cold as much but besides that I havent figured other benefits, shares Milesh, who says he turned vegan for ethical reasons."

The chefs at the roadside joints knew the palate of their customers. They did not have to imagine hard for a hybrid snack, having earlier successfully tried their hands at recreating an aloo-da-paratha or mooli paratha or a gobhi paratha with chicken, mutton or fish stuffing. The plain, innocent pakoda is the worst victim. It had seen lacto-vegetable stuffing earlier, but lately has to bear with the more thriving non-vegetarian filling such as the chicken pakoda or the fish pakoda.Now the saddest part. The ubiquitous golgappa, which also goes by the name pani puri or gup-chup in the West and the East of India respectively, are being sold with chicken stuffing in metros like Mumbai and Calcutta. The mashed potato is the victim again. The days are not far when the same will be sold in your neighbourhood joints. These innovations lack creativity and are simply brazen acts of stealing from the recipes of our great-great-grandparents across India.""If it was not for the chicken stuffing inside it, I would never try it in the first place,"" a friend, relishing chicken samosa at a roadside joint, once confided in me in a whisper. I appreciated his sensibility. He perhaps whispered to avoid offending the simple, authentic samosa on my plate. That's guilty consciousness there. I had to return the gesture. I contained my aversion for the metamorphosed food on his plate and reciprocated with a smile. I said okay. Long live our Indian snacks! Now the days are not far when even our pani puri with chicken stuffing will be available in the Indian restaurants in the West, with happy native takers!Email: gurbirwrites@gmail.com"
