The farmers at the Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard are waiting for buyers keeping their produce in heaps. Buyers are not showing any interest to lift the stocks as farmers are not coming forward for distress sale as yet.Last year, the price offered to farmers was about `13,000 but this year the price has fallen to an all-time low of `1,500 to `2,000 per quintal. The farmers are caught in a bind as they cannot resort to distress sale or they cannot take it back either as they do not know what do with the produce.R Ramakrishna Reddy, a buyer at Kurnool Market Yard said: We would have purchased chilli at a better price but the quality is very poor. He was not sure if the government would pay them subsidy later. We were taken for a ride in the past. The government announced subsidy for onion last year but till date the arrears have not been cleared.Let the government first clear the arrears. Then we will purchase chilli, he added. Farmers at their wits end G Venkateswarlu, a farmer from Remata village said that he had raised chilli in five acres by investing huge amount borrowed from money lenders.After harvesting, he had brought the crop to the market yard but there are no buyers there. He says, To some extent, what the buyers say is true. The quality of chilli we have is poor this time compared to last year as there has been drought in the district for the last three years. There is no groundwater and whatever water we could strike is alkaline and not fit for watering the crop.We are forced to throw away the crop in the garbage as we are not even recovering the money spent on transportation from the farm to the market yard in Kurnool, K Venkataramudu, a farmer from Guduru village stated. He urged the government to help them out by buying their produce or else they are forced to commit suicide.Every day, we are hearing news about farmer suicides from droughthit regions. However, with red chilli prices touching new low, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate, Venkataramudu lamented. Kurnool agriculture market yard secretary A Narayana Murthy said that they will start a special counter to purchase red chilli under subsidy price scheme.Already the government has announced the subsidy scheme and we are waiting for orders. The quality of red chilli is being sold at a minimum rate of `500 per quintal and maximum of `3,000 per quintal, at present, in wholesale market, he added. In Nellore too, problem is same.The mirchi farmers in the district are literally in tears because of the market fluctuations. Though the area of cultivation had increased when compared to the last year, green chillie farmers in upland areas are a distressed lot due to steep fall in prices.On the other hand, red chilli farmers are flooding the Guntur Mirchi Yard to sell their produce at remunerative prices. Farmers buoyed by profits in the previous year, increased area under cultivation in the district. Majority of the farmers in upland mandals such as Vinjamur, Kaligiri, Kondapuram, Jaladanki, Duttalur, Varikuntapadu, Udayagiri and Seetharamapuram had cultivated red chillie. According to sources, 1,150 farmers had cultivated green and red chilli in 3,075 hectares this year.Out of 3,075 hectares, red chilli was raised in 2,104 hectares. Out of 2,104 hectares, red chilli was raised in 329 hectares in Vinjamur, 466 in Kaligiri, 113 in Kondapuram, 84 in Jaladanki, 153 in Duttalur, 21 in Varikuntapadu, 1.2 in Seetharamapuram and 4 hectares in Seetharamapuram mandal. Green chilli growers tense Green chilli, which is chiefly used in curries, is a perishable crop by nature and the growers cannot preserve it in cold storage plants as is the case of red chilli waiting for a favourable market environment. We are issuing cultivation certificates to chilli farmers to sell their produce at remunerative prices under Market Intervention Scheme.The government is initiating steps for price stabilisation by eliminating middlemen in the process of procurement, said Anuradha, a Horticulture official. It may be mentioned here that farmers in Atmakur division had earned `3 lakh to `4 lakh profit per acre last year by selling green chilli in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The farmers invested `1.75 lakh on mirchi cultivation in one hectare this year. According to sources, farmers cultivated green chilli in around 3,200 acres in Anantasagaram, Marripadu and Atmakur mandals this year. In the previous year, green chilli was raised in 2,300 acres of land. I invested `30,000 per acre to harvest the crop. I paid a daily wage of `120 to each labourer"

Together with the Consumer Food Price Index released by the Central Statistics Office, this would help monitor the price situation of food items better,"" a government statement said.As per the numbers, inflation in the fuel and power segment was 18.52 per cent while that of manufactured products was 2.66 per cent in April.Last month, the Reserve Bank had left the key policy rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent for the third review in a row, citing upside risks to inflation. It had, however, increased the reverse repo rate -- which it pays to banks for parking funds with it -- by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent, narrowing the policy rate corridor.As per the new series data, industrial output growth slowed to 2.7 per cent in March as against 5.5 per cent a year ago."

And with two other areas outside, one that is bustling with DJs chartbusters and another quieter space outdoors, where you can enjoy the meal along with the beautiful Bengaluru weather.Their new menu is born out of sustainable living practices. It includes sustainable food that is made out of locally sourced ingredients. They use deep sea fish and their chicken is claimed to be antibiotic and artificial hormone free. While today several restaurants in the city boasts of offering healthy food on their menu, Fava claims to be one of the very few that aims for ethical food.The Polenta Crusted Crispy Goat Cheese and Thyme Roll is crunchy on the outside and its insides melt as soon as you take a bite. It is served with a spiced tomato relish. The Plated Smoked Salmon Labneh is cooked very well and has subtle flavours of capers, dill and paprika ruling the palate. The Grilled Deep Sea Prawn with Black Sesame too is cooked right and has the smoky flavour of the prawn that blends well with chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil seasoning. In the Plated Mezze and Salad category, I absolutely fell in love with Father Michaels Valombrossa Burrata.If there was one word I could use to describe it, then it would be beautiful. The dish is a maple tree farm organic beetroot mezze with dukkah and popped amaranth. The Melon, Watermelon & Feta Salad is what you call basic done right. The dish is simple and lets the fruits and the feta take a centrestage with its natural flavours, which by the way are absolutely fresh tasting. The dish is tempered with pomegranate, mint, arugula, balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. Among pizzas, I tried the multi grain vegetarian Funghi Misti pizza. It tastes fresh out of the oven with toppings of corn, jalapeno, bell pepper, onion and mozzarella.In the main course, I would highly recommend the Mediterranean Style Stir-fry with Millet & Black Rice Risotto. The dish is warm, tastes fresh and healthy thanks to the locally sourced grains that take the stage to recreate an Italian Classic with organic vegetables. Among the non vegetarian dishes, the Signature Pomegranate Chicken is a must have. The chicken is very well cooked with the subtle pomegranate flavour. It is served with chargrilled vegetables and parsley-arugula vichyssoise. At Fava, the kitchen uses Earth Loaf chocolates made from Indian cacao beans. The chocolates are made in Mysuru.If you are in the mood to experiment, try Favas homemade liquid nitrogen infused 100% natural ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt with topping. I had it in caramel popcorn. The ice cream is super smooth and has a strong caramel flavour. It was topped with a few caramel popcorn. My favourite, however, is the Duet of Chocolate Fondant . It has the chocolate crunch, with a gooey foundant that oozes when you dip in your spoon. It is a play on hot and cold chocolate flavours. Do give this one a try.Among cocktails, I tried the liquid nitrogen infused house special Cocktails including Fava Martini, Pink Bramble and Morgan Colada. I particularly enjoyed the Fava Martini that had a good punch of gin that blends well with cranberry juice, gingerm blue curacao, grenadine and fresh lime.Morgan Colada too was an interesting combination, especially for Captain Morgan rum fans. This cocktail has spiced rum mixed with pineapple juice and coconut milk. Other than these, the Tiramisu cocktail too was an interesting spin on the dessert. It has tequila, Baileys mascarpone and espresso. Id say if you are ending your meall with a drink, let it be Tiramisu.Cost for two: `1,900 (approx.)"

At the worst, traders say the prices may continue to soar for at least the next two months when supplies are expected to improve.Prices of vegetables like bean, carrot and brinjal have increased, forcing buyers to be economical with their purchase. While bean is the most expensive, carrot is selling for Rs 60-70 per kg. Even beetroot, which was selling for Rs 20 per kg is now selling at double the rate.Ladies finger, sold at Rs 20 per kg, has also gone up to Rs 30 per kg. Even broad bean (avarakkai in Tamil) is now being sold at Rs 60-70 per kg.The prices may continue to stay this way until July when the yield from the fresh crop is expected to arrive in the market, said S Chandran, president, Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association.Although the prices of tomato and onion are currently low, Chandran feels those could also go up soon. Tomato is selling at Rs 10 per kg while onion costs Rs 15 per kg at the retail market in Koyambedu.Chandran says the supply of vegetables has reduced. On any given day, around 450 to 500 trucks supply vegetables to Koyambedu Market but for the last couple of weeks the supply has reduced to 350 trucks, he said.The demand for vegetables is more as it is an auspicious month. We even expect the prices of tomato to double in the next 10 to 15 days, Abdul Kader, secretary, Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, told Express.Even the price of coriander, which is in huge demand due to rise in temperature, is Rs 15-20 per kg.

5922cdca7be9e01fe6dfb546,No more tears,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/may/17/no-more-tears-1605542.html,2017-05-17,"HYDERABAD: One ingredient that is omnipresent in every kitchen is onions. And fried onions are the sine qua non of Hyderabadi cooking. The process of chopping onions, however, is painstaking and is always followed by shedding of tears.To make everyday cooking a wee bit easier, Everyday Gourmet Kitchen (EGK), a Mumbai based enterprise founded by Satyajit Roy offers a variety of onion products. This food processing firm has a wide range of onion products for domestic and industrial use, like crispy fried onion, wet fried onion and fresh fried onion. These products can be ordered online and arrive in polythene sachets. The price range is Rs 250-300 per kilogram.This innovative idea was not an immediate hit in the market says Satyajit, Initially there was a reluctance from the market to accept the product as the response that we got from commercial kitchens was that they peel cut and fry their own onions as they have been doing for many years.Once we got some of the bigger kitchens to try our product, they realised the multi-pronged benefits of EGK Fresh Fried Onions. Reduction in time, labour and resources at a competitive rate allowed many kitchens to make their operations more efficient.The organisation says they offer onion products that maintain the taste of your food, have minimum preservatives and reduce laborious tasks involved in cooking which require no skill. This type of food processing when done right is also a way to reduce yield wastage on a very large scale.The company has also roped in onion farmers to join their initiative: Since the people most affected by the volatility of the onion market are the farmers, we decided to tie up directly with them to provide a stable and fair buyback arrangement for their produce.This allows them not worry to about selling their produce and concentrate on their core competency which is increasing the quality and yield from their farms, says Satyajit. He was inspired to launch such an initiative as there is an abundance of onion produce every year and he intended to make a dent in thewastage figure which stands at approximately 5 million metric tonnes yearly."

He added that the government had been given ample opportunities to act in this regard. The seers had convened a meeting of all elected representatives of the district more than three times to convince them to take immediate steps for development, but they have not done anything except provide false assurances, he alleged.After holding discussions with seers of different mutts, a delegation was sent to the CM appealing to him to take steps for the development of Chitradurga. The CM had assured the delegation of action but nothing had been done so far. Owing to this, it has become necessary to launch an agitation, he said.He demanded that the State government take immediate steps to clear all major tanks of silt in the district to ensure proper storage, provision of drinking water to people in rural areas of the district, taking up of drought relief works and also finding a permanent solution to the drinking water problem in the district.Raitha Sangha member Buthaiah said that farmers in the district were adversely affected by the consecutive drought over the past few years and though many farmer suicides were being reported, the State government had still not taken any steps to help. He demanded that the government respond to the problems of groundnut, millet and onion growers in the district as they were in deep trouble.Earlier, a padayatra was taken out from Shri Nilkanteshwar Temple, that passed through main streets of the city including Gandhi Circle, Mahaveer Circle, and culminated outside the Deputy Commissioners office. They also submitted a memorandum in this regard to Srirangaiah, Deputy Commissioner. They also staged a dharna outside the DCs office for some time."

They are more in demand over the Bellary onions, say traders.Over the past few days, small onions are being sold Rs. 30 to Rs. 45 a kg depending on quality at the wholesale outlet at Gandhi Market. The price has gone up by Rs. 15 a kg over the past one month. In the retail market, top quality small onions were being sold at Rs. 50 a kg.Arrivals have come down to just 50 tonnes a day. There is no local supply. Normally we get about 200 tonnes of small onions a day, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association. Supplies from Dharapuram and Udumalpet met the local demands in the nearby districts, he said.Perambalur and Tiruchi are the major onion producing districts in the State. The crop is raised on over 8,000 hectares in Perambalur district and on about 4,000 hectares in Tiruchi district. However, stocks with onion growers in Perambalur and Thuraiyur are mostly held back as seeds for the next season.The failure of the monsoon has led to the situation. There has been a severe drop in yield and many farmers had not gone for the crop as there was no rain in Perambalur district. In some places, the crops have withered. Even those who managed to raise the crop have reported sharp drop in yield,said R.Raja Chidambaram, state secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam.Mr.Thangaraj said that the price of small onions is not likely to come down at least for next five to six months as there is no scope for fresh crops in the summer.Meanwhile, the price of Bellary onions, currently ruling at around Rs. 11 a kg at the market, could go up slightly though steadily in the days to come as the short supply of small onions would result in a higher demand for the bigger onion variety, he said."

The department had provided seeds at subsidised rates for 650 ha. In the rest of the areas, farmers bought seeds from the open market.Farmers of the district, who mainly depend on onion cultivation as their main cash crop after paddy and maize, had harvested more than 15,000 tonnes against the local annual consumption of about 6,000 tonnes.In the absence of adequate irrigation facilities, they had sunk water harvesting structures in Bhawanipatna, Kesinga, Narla and Golamunda blocks to water their crops through traditional methods.The farmers, who had eyed good profits, are now forced to sell their produce from the harvesting field at throwaway price. Onion is being sold to traders of other States at around Rs 5 per kg. In the markets of Bhawanipatna, Kesinga and Junagarh retailers are selling onion at Rs 10 per kg.As has been the practice, traders from outside, particularly Chhattisgarh, purchase onion at cheaper prices, hoard it for about three to four months till the demand rises and sell it at higher price. The irony is, even consumers of Kalahandi purchase onion from these sources paying higher price during lean season.Lack of storage facility and absence of controlled market network to check distress sale have been the main reasons behind the current plight of onion growers.Under Horticulture Mission, 20-tonne onion storage capacity is available to farmers at 50 per cent subsidy, but there are few takers. Reason: Each storage facility costs Rs 1.75 lakh.Gopabandhu Sahu, a farmer from Matia village and Kaluram Majhi of Kharsel village said they do not have enough money to use the storage facility. They are forced to sell onion directly to traders after harvesting to avert losses.Deputy Director, Horticulture, Sudhakar Sahu, said of the allotted target of 400-tonne storage of 20-tonne capacity each in 2015-16, only 200 farmers used the facility. In 2016-17, only 100 farmers availed the benefit. Citing the reason behind the decline, Sahu said under the system, farmers have to first invest for availing storage facility and then get subsidy. Under such circumstances, if banks are ready to finance the storages, more farmers can avail the benefit.On marketing, Sahu said Regulated Marketing Committees can lend a helping hand by opening mandies with storage facilities or utilise cotton mandi as onion is grown in areas where cotton is harvested."

With the addition of two kg rice per every individual in the families (of BPL card holders), the government intends to ensure that no one goes down due to hunger, he said.Income certificateOn the other hand, following the governments announcement to revise existing guidelines to avail BPL cards, nine lakh people have applied for income certificates. According to the new guidelines, those with an annual income of Rs 1.2 lakh can go for self-declaration by filling details on the application, to avail the benefit. They have to provide income certificates as proof.To ensure a hassle-free process, the department is also in talks with both revenue department and National Informatics Commission (that deals with government websites irrespective of department) to directly download the income certificates and provide the same to applicants, he added.Vigilance committeeThat apart, to ensure timely services, a three-member vigilance committee will be constituted in each fair price shop. The three members will be randomly selected among the card holders. If elderly persons are selected, they will be replaced by others. They will be tasked with the supervision of the system related to distribution of essential commodities. In case of malpractices, they are vested with powers to recommend for cancellation of licence of such shops, he said.Indira canteensOn the ambitious programme of the state Government to open canteens in the name of Indira Gandhi, Khader said that the government has invited expression of interest in this regard. The canteens wil be set up in each ward of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagarapalike (BBMP) and a centralised kitchen will be set up for every eight wards. While the proposal of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) is in abeyance for not using onion and garlic in preparing food items, many hotel groups, including Balaji Hotel Association, has come forward, Khader said."

However, it has skyrocketed to Rs 68 to Rs 70 in the city in the past one week, forcing people to restrict their usage of small onion.""The cost of onion is as scorching as the summer heat. At the present price it is not affordable in a middle class family. So, I have limited the usage,"" said a house maker Y Bhuvana in Shanmuganagar.Terming as unprecedented, onion traders said they expected a further hike in prices if the drought situation remains unchanged in Tamil Nadu . Perambalur district, Namakkal, Thuraiyur in Trichy district are the major suppliers of small onion to Trichy and several other places in Tamil Nadu. Traders said that the severe drought has affected production and eventually escalated the price of the small onion.The fall in supply is visible at Gandhi Market , the wholesale vegetable market in Trichy.

""Those who stored them in the cold storage are supplying to the market,"" he said.""Rain alone can be the saviour of farmers including those cultivating onion. A heavy rain will boost the water storage and ground water level so that they can be utilised for onion irrigation which requires as much quantity of water as paddy. Otherwise, the farmers will be at stake and the price will be high,"" said an onion farmer and Perambalur district secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam V Neelakantan.Traders said that the supply of Bellary onion from Pune in Maharashtra has helped them meet the demand to some extent. The traders sell the onion for Rs 10 per kg to vendors who price it at Rs 15 per kg."

How can a person who works for such long hours be weak,"" the chief minister asked. His comment, in the backdrop of ban on slaughterhouses and a related argument that the resultant scarcity of meat was depriving people of cheap, healthy food, went viral on social media.Yogi, on the occasion, also announced that Rs 4,000 crore had been sanctioned by the Centre under Namami Gange project. With this, pilgrims visiting Ardh Kumbh in Allahabad in 2019 would be able to see a cleaner Ganga, he said.Recounting the second important achievement of the new government, the chief minister said the BJP government ensured anti-Romeo squads were formed and began working effectively within 24 hours of the government formation.Beginning his speech on a lighter note, Yogi said there was curiosity around the world over what 'namoona' (character) Modi had appointed UP chief minister. Reminding the party workers that they had more responsibility than before since the BJP was in power now, he said it was the moral responsibility of party workers to ensure that people's trust in the government remained intact. He asked them to be cautious and not to take law in their hands.Only those who would tread the path of development and patriotism would survive, said Yogi, adding that the government was making every effort to bring holistic changes in the work culture of the government. Emphasising on cleanliness, the chief minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's focus on 'swacchhata abhiyan' was meant to make people healthier and stronger.Urging party workers to change the tradition of giving flowers and bouquets to the leaders, the chief minister said soon all ministers in charge would begin visiting the districts they have been given responsibility of. The party workers instead of welcoming them with flowers should clean one locality or village and take the visiting minister along to show it.After putting in efforts, they can also ask the minister in charge to do the needful in their area, Yogi said and added that soon he would also begin touring divisions and review the progress of development works.The four-time MP from the Gorakhpur said his government was determined to end ""mafia raj"". Similarly, UP government is focussing on transparency and for this, every tender, even if it is of Rs 1 lakh would be issued through e-tendering.Elaborating on various policies, Yogi said a new mining, excise and industrial policy would soon be announced. Stressing the mining policy, he said the UP government has decided to link mining with satellite imaging in a bid to ensure transparency.Hitting out at previous governments in the state, Yogi said the state of affairs in mining department has been such that a minister used to earn more than the total revenue of the government.""Government will take tough action against anybody who tries to meddle with law and order in the state,"" he said."

We are looking to develop machines or mechanisms that can help perform various farming tasks efficiently.""Most of the students' prototypes were developed to be affordable, and decrease the amount of labour for farmers while addressing agronomical issues.A member of the student team that developed the milking machine, Subodh Kumar, said, ""The most common issues faced by farmers are knee joint and spine troubles, from carrying heavy loads and bending for long hours. This is why we developed this affordable device to milk cows without having to bend."" The onion harvester was another device which did not require the farmers to bend.A pesticide and fertilizer sprayer was also developed, which sprays automatically as the machine is pushed through the field. A lever connected to the wheels of the cart moves the pump of the spray gun.Karan Gohil, one of the students from the team who developed the sprayer, said, ""Carrying tanks of fertilizer or pesticides on the back over a long period can hurt the spine. Our prototype tries to reduce this carrying of loads on the back through an affordable device."" The display also had a device called ""PlowBot"", which is a three-in-one machine to plough, sow seeds and harrow the soil in one go. Vinod Ramakrishnan , who was part of a team that developed the device, said, ""These processes are usually done with tractors. But all farmers cannot afford tractors. However, these manually operated devices could cost as little as Rs 2,000 when mass produced."""

Farmers were not even able to recover even the cost of production in the last season.""According to agriculture experts, acreage under onions in the region is likely to drop by about 10 per cent this kharif or summer season.The horticulture department estimated that farmers in Indore district is expected to cultivate onion on 450 hectares this season.Jatav said, ""As per the initial estimates collected from rural belts after seed distribution and enquires by farmers, over 400 hectares will be covered under onions.""Horticulture department estimated that acreage under cabbage will remain higher this season in about 500 hectares.Narendra Kewat, an onion farmer said, ""I am apprehensive about growing onions this season because prices were very poor last season. I have planned to expand the area under cabbage and other vegetables this kharif."""

The sowing of summer crop, which has ended, shows onions have been sown over an area of 14,300 hectares. Usually sowing of onion is carried out over 10,300 hectares in the state.Officials said that not only had more onion been sown than usual, but that 31% more onions have been sown compared to last year.""Farmers usually decide on sowing of a crop looking at availability of water and prices fetched by the crop last year,"" said an agriculture official.Ghanshyam Patel, a farmer of Mahuva, said that the summer onion crop fetches better prices than that of other seasons. While one bigha land sown with onions produces about 200 metric tonnes of the crop, Patel said costs of cultivation per bigha was about Rs 30,000. A bigha's yield can fetch anywhere between Rs 60,000 and Rs 70,000 in summer, Patel added.Karanbhai Kashibhai, a resident of Mahuva, said, ""Last year, onions fetched prices between Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg, which was a good price. So this year, I have decided to go in for onion farming."" He said that in Mahuva, a majority of the farmers have gone in for onion farming, and the area is considered the onion belt of Gujarat According data available of the 14,300 hectares cultivated for onions, 11,700 hectares were in Bhavnagar alone. In the past couple of years, retail prices of onions have touched Rs 100 per kg many times. The gap between wholesale and retail prices is huge, and at a time when the wholesale rates of onions were between Rs 3 and Rs 6.50 per kg, the vegetable retailed at Rs 25 per kg or higher in city areas like Satellite and Navrangpura.The overall sowing area for summer crops in the state is usually 9.83 lakh hectares. However, this year there has been a decline in overall sowing of summer crops and only 84% of usual area, or 8.27 lakh hectares have been cultivated. Agriculture officials, however, maintained that the scenario was better than last year, and 68,800 more hectares have been cultivated for summer crops.Officials said sowing and cultivation was poor last year as the government had to reserve water for drinking purposes and didn't release irrigation water for summer crops."

They also blocked the state highway for several hours.Angry farmers from different villages brought about 5 tonne onion loaded in tractors from their farms to the roads on Wednesday morning. They shouted slogans against the state government and demanded better price for their produce. Police said that over 200 farmers joined the protests from various villages of Mahuva in Bhavnagar and Savarkundla in Amreli.Farmers dumped loads of onions on the state highway to show that they were not earning profit by producing onion. This is happening for the second successive year, farmers said.""For the second year in a row, onion growers are not getting decent prices for their produce. They are suffering heavy losses as they are finding it difficult to recover even the input cost. Farmers are getting Rs 20 per 20kg (about Re 1 per kg), which is peanuts,"" said farmer leader Deepak Malani from Ambardi village of Savarkundla.""Farmers are left with no option but to destroy their farm produce as they can't even afford to take their harvested onion to marketing yard as transportation would prove costly for them,"" he added.Farmers also threatened to boycott the state government's Krishi Mahotsav over the low prices of onions. Malani also demanded that government declare minimum support price (MSP) for onions.Recently, a study by the Department of Agricultural Economics at Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU) had found that cultivators of tur, isabgul, fennel, potato, garlic, coriander and tobacco received highest return for their investment, while onion producers got the least return in 2015-16.While, a farmer who invests Re 1 for cultivating tur, receives Rs 2.32 in return, an onion cultivator got just return Rs 1.05 as against the same investment.Various factors including area of production of particular crop, monsoon and market price played important role in farm produce returns."
5922e2a17be9e01fc006fc9a,"Jalyukt Shivar Yojana unsustainable, says study",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jalyukt-shivar-yojana-unsustainable-says-study/article17415107.ece,2017-03-06,"The Maharashtra governments flagship Jalyukt Shivar Yojana has been touted as a drought-proofing scheme, but a field study conducted by South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) gives a different picture.The organisation carried out the study at Hiwargaon-Pawasa, a backwater village with a population of 1,500, in Ahmadnagar districts Sangamner Taluk. The research presents a microcosmic example of how indiscriminate digging of farm ponds has accelerated the rate of groundwater extraction.The scheme was launched in December 2014 by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis-led State government with an objective to harvest rainwater and enhance groundwater levels. However, the project has run into stormy weather for its haphazard and unscientific implementation, undue reliance on machinery, lack of transparency and public participation.Amruta Pradhan, a researcher with the SANDRP, said, While the government is taking credit for providing a small scale irrigation facility at the farmers doorstep, it is reluctant to take the responsibility of their unsustainable use. Majority of the scheme work has been implemented unscientifically. While one can see water as of now, it does not mean groundwater recharge has taken place.Ms. Pradhan dismissed the usefulness of plastic-lined farm ponds, remarking they were just another layer of exploitative unsustainable infrastructure, which would only help accelerate the process of groundwater depletion.Besides borewells, Pravara river (a tributary of Godavari river) is a major water source to the Hiwargaon village. Almost 80% of its ponds are dependent on groundwater, with most of them dug between 2012 and 2015 with the help of subsidies offered under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM).The 300-odd ponds in the village are the main source of sustenance for the pomegranate-dependent agro economy. The arrival of ponds has led many farmers to shift to horticulture, with pomegranate cash-crop rapidly supplanting the traditional horsegram (bajra), wheat, pulses and onion crops.Issues with the schemeMost farmers in the village, as in Westerns Maharashtra's horticultural belt, swear by the farm ponds, unmindful, however, of the consequences of groundwater depletion owing to their unregulated construction and digging.The SANDRP study revealed that none of the farm ponds in Hiwargaon had inlets and outlets or any other arrangement for excess rainwater inflow that was envisioned in the scheme. Instead of digging the ponds in a low-lying area, many of them are dug on the highest points of the farms.It further noted that soil conservation is the key to groundwater recharge, but it has been omitted in the scheme.Water conservationist Vijay Anna Borade said, Any programme claiming to deal with recharging groundwater has to pay attention to the soil. If soil is conserved, groundwater is automatically recharged. In the Jalyukt Shivar works, soil, fine sand and all the medium which hold the water and percolate it have been scrapped. If the rocks are exposed, then how is the recharge supposed to take place?He added that the works under the scheme appeared to hold water, but would not recharge it.Another problem with the farm ponds is that they expose the groundwater to losses through evaporation, something that may not become immediately apparent.Ponds for allAccording to data, around 13,950 ponds were dug between 2014 and 2016 under the NHM, the JSY and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, while nearly 24,700 more were under construction under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in 2016-17.Till date, a staggering 1.6 lakh-odd applications have been received by local authorities under the Magel Tyala Shet Tale (Farm Pond on Demand scheme) ever since Mr. Fadnavis launched it in February 2016.Ms. Pradhan said, The Jalyukt Shivar programme and its ancillaries are a quick fix that have failed. The government has not taken into account the massive amount of work that goes into involving people in carrying out watershed works. The Fadnavis government has also paid [little consideration] to the educative process regarding judicious use of water.While local authorities said they are aware of the concerns engendered by the indiscriminate digging of farm ponds, they find regulation impossible.The sub-divisional officer of Sangamner said, Once the farmer constructs the pond, it is impossible for us to tell him not to use it for groundwater storage. Authorities said they were attempting to initiate dialogue with farmers in a bid to impress on them the judicious use of farm ponds."

Highly placed government sources told TOI that the Union ministry of agriculture and the ministry of consumers conducted a survey to check the possibility of the scarcity of the produce in coming few months.""The government has been creating buffer stock of onions under its PCF for the past two year through central agencies like NAFED and SFAC. But there is no such plan for this year as there has been bumper production of onions and there is no possibility of scarcity of onions in the coming future.""In April and May 2015, the government had procured 12,000 tonne of onions through central agencies like National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the PSF to supply onions to consumers at moderate rates during scarcity.Of the 12,000 tonne, NAFED had procured 5,000 tonne, while SFAC had procured 8,000 tonne.Last year, in April and May, the government procured 17,000 tonne through Central agencies. Of which, SFAC procured 12,000 tonne, while NAFED had procured the remaining 5,000 tonne.When contacted NAFED director Nanasaheb Patil said, ""We have no communication from the government to procure onions under PSF. We are yet to receive demand from the government."" However, he refused to divulge any more details on the issue.In 2015, onion prices had skyrocketed to all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to scarcity of onions and the government had to import onions to meet the demand despite the buffer stock of around 12,000 tonne that was created through central agencies like NAFED and SFAC.The retail prices of onions had touched to Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market and Rs 100 per kg in metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi.While the kharif and late kharif crops are highly perishable with a shelf life of less than 25 days, the summer crop has a shelf life of six to seven months. The farmers also prefer storing onions with a hope of getting better prices.The summer crop is harvested in April and May, and caters to the market for the next five-six months until arrival of fresh kharif crop by October end. The kharif crop is harvested in October-November, while late kharif crops are harvested in December and January.The scarcity of onions is created if the supply of summer stock is affected during the period from June to October. Hence, government had decided to create buffer stock of summer onions in April and May to deal with the scarcity during these five months."

Now that we are familiar with the process, we will go ahead ahead with the other four products.""""The process is likely to take about one year as sufficient time has to be given to the public to raise objections if any. Besides, other formalities need to be completed,"" he added.Obtaining the tag will boost exports, he said. ""We are developing marketing linkages and also going to provide publicity so that farmers can make the most of it. We have a lot of work to do as these are the special products of AP. Our aim is to provide value to the products by getting them the tag which helps in branding and value addition,"" Chowdhary said.As per the application made to the GI Registry, Banaganapalle mangoes also known as Beneshan, Baneshan, Benishan, Chappatai, Safeda, Banaganapalli, or Banginapalli are popular and extensively used fruit all over the world. The agro-climatic and geographical conditions prevailing in Banaganapalle in Kurnool district and adjoining areas has given the unique characteristic to the mangoes for more than 100 years."
