Though contamination of food served in hotels, restaurants and street corner joints is common, what's more worrying is the fact that an unusually very high percentage of food stuff including salads, fruits and juices are laced with a cocktail of deadly bacteria.A first of its kind study on the food samples collected from a number of hotels, restaurants and street-side eateries in Hyderabad published in the recent issue of the British Food Journal (BFJ) reveals the major health hazard lurking around those aroma-filled and tasty food served in the city.Hold your breath, 98.1% of carrot and 75.5% onion samples analysed for bacterial colonies are unfit for human consumption. They contain E coli, the harmful bacteria that is present in human digestive system and causes gastroentec ritis.

The market is the hub for Bellary and small onions trade in the region and caters to retail traders from Tiruchi and several other nearby districts.It largely functions on Sub-Jail Road outside Gandhi Market and many traders process the onion on roadsides. Over 75 shops line up the narrow Sub Jail Road so much so that the road remained closed for traffic for several decades before the former City Police Commissioner Karuna Sagar took steps to reopen it for traffic in August 2009.Yet, most of the traders continue to operate on the roadsides and sacks of onion could be seen lined up along the road.Loading and unloading of onions take place right on the road. Traffic congestion is perennial on Sub-jail Road, Thanjavur Road and Vellamandi Road intersections near the market. Traffic hold-ups occur at these intersections often bringing the traffic to a standstill around the market.Meanwhile, the Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association has taken up the initiative to build their own market complex at Ariyamangalam off Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road.The complex is being built at a site purchased by the association in the early 90s. One hundred shops with spacious access to roads for lorries are being built.According to A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association, nearly 75 per cent of the work has been completed. We took up the project at an estimate of about Rs. 7 crore but we are facing a funds crunch so that the work has slowed down. Once we mobilise the required funds, the project will be completed soon, he said.The shops would be owned by about 78 traders who are members of the association. The association has taken up the construction on their behalf. The complex has been named Commercial Complex for All Perishable Vegetables and Fruits. As there are 100 shops at the complex, we will allot some of the shops to traders of other vegetables or perishable products, he said.The complex would have all necessary amenities and infrastructure for traders, public and farmers visiting the market. The market includes rest rooms for traders and farmers. We have provided a spacious two-wheeler parking lot, toilets and a lorry weighing machine inside the complex, he said.Once the complex is ready, onion wholesale traders would go there. The market is close to Gandhi Market and right on the highway for easy accessibility, he said. Once the market is ready, the need for onion traders to move to Kallikudi, about 15 km away from the city, would be averted."

Farmers have suffered the most because of demonetisation. They will teach the party [BJP] a fitting lesson this time, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Districts where elections will be held on Thursday include Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, Beed, Nanded, Osmanabad, Latur, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli. Counting is on February 23.Both Opposition parties and their top leaders have been campaigning in Marathwada and Vidarbha. For Congress heavyweights like State party chief Ashok Chavan, former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs son Amit Deshmukh and Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil hope to maintain their dominance in their respective districts of Nanded, Latur and Ahmednagar. NCP leaders like Dhananjay Munde and Supriya Sule have been campaigning in Beed and Marathwada respectively, where ZP elections will be held.For the BJP, which stands fourth in terms of its presence in ZPs, the elections are of major importance to achieve its dream if a Congress-free State. The party had allotted districts to a State minister for managing the campaign, and has presented Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis as its star campaigner with development as its agenda. The civic polls are important to leaders like Pankaja Munde and State party chief Raosaheb Danve in their home districts of Beed and Jalna respectively.The Shiv Sena, meanwhile, has focussed on Mumbai and Thane, leaving rest of the State to local leaders.The NCPs Nawab Malik said the party is aiming at big wins in the first phase, and continue the trend in the remaining phases. We are confident due to the tremendous response we have received. We can surely claim that the party will emerge victorious.Demonetisation, falling prices of onion and tur daal and the governments inability to offer minimum support price to farmers were highlighted by the Opposition during the camapign.On election eve, a group claiming to be organisers of the silent Maratha rallies held a press conference asking people to boycott the BJP. Rajendra Kondhare, a key organiser of the silent rallies, said some people had indulged in a publicity stunt. The BJP released a statement saying it stands firmly with the Maratha community in its demand for reservation.BJP spokesperson Shweta Shalini on Wednesday wrote to the State Election Commission (SEC) asking for a ban on the Saamana . SEC bans newspapers from publishing material that will influence voters 48 hours prior to an election. While all parties have adhered to the stricture, the Saamana, which is the mouthpiece of the Sena, has violated it. We have requested a ban on its printing on February 16, 20 and 21, she said.Elections will be held for 2,567 seats and 11,989 candidates will be contesting. Of the total, 855 seats are in 15 ZPs and will be contested by 4,289 candidates. In panchayat samitis, 7,700 candidates will be contesting 1,712 seats. In all, 2.04 crore voters will be eligible to exercise their franchise, of which 1.07 crore are male, 96 lakh are women and 95 fall in the others category."

5923077f7be9e01fc00712f2,Wholesale inflation decelerates to 5.7%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wholesale-inflation-decelerates-to-57/article18089491.ece,2017-04-18,"A decline in the prices of fuel and manufactured products helped inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), to moderate to 5.7% (provisional) for March 2017 despite hardening of food prices, data released by the government on Monday showed.The WPI inflation had touched a 39-month high of 6.55% (provisional) in February while it was -0.45% in March 2016.Compared to last month (February), WPI Inflation declined by 85 basis points (bps) to 5.70% in March17 due to sharp decrease in prices of items like potato (-17.07%), onion (-10.78%), non-food articles (4.91%), oil seeds (-0.9%), said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, Economic Research Department, SBI.Earlier, the largest decline in month-on-month inflation was in August 15, Mr. Ghosh added. The decline was accentuated by decline in fuel and power inflation and manufactured products.... Fuel prices were significantly cut on March 31 while rupee has been on an appreciating trend since February 2017.These two factors have pushed down fuel and manufactured product prices, he said.Primary food inflation trended higher as vegetable inflation emerged after six months of deflation although food price pressures are not yet a concern, as prices of cereals, pulses and spices have fallen sequentially in the last two to three months, said an analysis by Nomura.Fuel price inflation moderated on favourable base effects and a fall in most market-linked fuels. Furthermore, manufactured inflation moderated sharply to 3% in March from 3.7% in February as prices for manufactured food, non-metallic minerals and machine tools declined sequentially while other categories experienced muted increases, it said.Food inflation has increased a bit and this would require greater monitoring in light of the evolving weather conditions, said Pankaj Patel, president of the industry body FICCI.The government is keeping a close tab on the progress made on irrigation projects, cold chain projects etc. and improvement in these areas is likely to yield positive results.The focus on drip irrigation and micro-irrigation along with improvement in the efficiency of cropping patterns and water use mechanisms will strengthen agri-production and productivity, he said. Commodity prices  crude as well as metal prices  had been edging up putting pressure on wholesale prices over the past few months. However, the WPI based inflation announced today shows a decline from the previous month and this can be attributed to softening of inflation in fuel and power and manufactured goods segments. Further, the recent strengthening of rupee vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar will also contribute towards limiting imported inflation, he said.Output pricesThe analysis done by Nomura research analysts Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf said: Despite the surge in input cost inflation since January, firms have been reluctant to raise output prices, likely reflecting uncertainty over the demand outlook after demonetisation.As demand recovers, we expect firms to start passing on past input cost increases to consumers and the sharp drop in perishable food inflation to reverse. Yet, we believe February marked the peak in year-on-year WPI inflation and it should gradually taper off over 2017 on base effects, they added.Considering the higher-than-expected WPI inflation in Q1, we are raising our 2017 forecast to 4.7% (from 4%) they said."

The construction of the Super Expressway will make the farmers lose their irrigated land in the area. Hearing the farmers grievance, MSRDC MD R Mopalwar promised to look at other alternatives to save their land.Our discussion with them has yielded a positive response. We have suggested them an alternative alignment that will go over mountains and forest land. This will not only save our land but will also save them a lot of money. With our homes and wells, the cost of our land will be much higher. There will be no loss of tree cover as there arent many trees there; it is mainly exposed rock. We are not against the construction of the highway, but we will not let them take away our irrigated land, said Kokate. The alternative alignment suggested by the farmers goes very close to the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary and thus declared unfeasible by MSRDC.If we are to change our route, we will be entering the buffer zone of the sanctuary and we will not get the permissions for that. Today, we are outside Kalsubai by exactly 100 metres. We instead suggested that we will make an elevated road on that stretch. This will reduce our footprints to the least possible and we will require only half the land. They have 60 wells in these lands and elevated road will protect the wells also. We will continue our discussions with them and examine what best we can do for them, said Mopalwar.Of the 21,000 hectares required to build the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, 399 hectares is forest land, 17,499 hectares is agricultural land and 2,922 hectares is unused land. In the 710-km stretch around eight kilometres will pass through irrigated land. The Sinnar-Igatpuri farmers will together be losing around 46 hectares of land together. On this land, farmers grow grapes, pomegranates and vegetables like onion and potatoes among other crops. Their lives and family depend on this land.The construction of this highway has wreaked havoc in our lives. We constantly live in the fear of losing our land and our familys peace is lost. It is a mental torture. Farmers have begun carrying poison in their pockets now, says Shantaram Dhokne, a grape farmer from the area. Like other farmers, they too complain of pressure from officials to surrender their land. The measurement surveys are conducted with intense police presence and on our slightest protest we are lathicharged. Cases have been filed against 42 people in our villages to prevent them from protesting, says Namdeo Arote.There are many dams in our area. Only when the water from these dams reach all the fields will there be true development and not by constructing these highways, said Kero Pawar. The Rs 30,000-crore project will pass through Nagpur, Buldhana, Amravati, Wardha, Washim, Thane, Aurangabad, Akola, Bhiwandi and Nashik districts and will cut down the travel time between Nagpur and Mumbai by half.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
