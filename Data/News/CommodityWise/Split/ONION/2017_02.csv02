He had barely gone 200 metres away when the assailants accosted him from behind and fired at his head from the right side from point-blank range. He died instantly while the killer duo sped away.Fatuha police station SHO Sujeet Kumar said only one shot was fired. ""Police did not recover any empty cartridge from the spot,"" he said.""A big onion businessman with supply network in neighbouring districts, Pappu has a multi-storey house at Fatuha Bazaar where he lived with his wife and mother. His two children are studying outside Bihar,"" the SHO said.Pappu's body was handed over to his family after postmortem at the Nalanda Medical College & Hospital in Patna. His supporters later blocked the Patna-Bakhtiarpur four-lane road with the body and also pelted police personnel with stones.Police said pictures of the two criminals fleeing on the bike were captured in a CCTV installed nearby. ""Raids are on to nab the killers. We have got clues which suggest the killing was a result of a property dispute,"" Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said, adding the SHO was suspended following complaints by locals about inadequate police patrolling in the area."

With the harvest of shallots , like that of other vegetables, hit by the drought , the price of the vegetable has shot up by almost 150% in the past two months. With a kilo of shallots now costing almost Rs 100 per kg, households which used the vegetable generously are forced to rework their food budgets.Ironically, the price of big onions has been slowly but constantly dropping. Vegetable vendors attribute it to the arrival of excess stocks from Pune.Shallots, that is an essential part of many south Indian dishes like sambar, poriyal, bhajjis and other non-vegetarian dishes, used to cost as less as Rs 25 per kg three months ago; it now costs Rs 100 per kg. ""The price went up to Rs 40 in March. From then, it increased to Rs 70 by mid-April and Rs 90 in the beginning of May,"" said G A Wahab, secretary of the traders association and president of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Vendors Association. ""The wholesale rate for the vegetable itself is Rs 90 per kg,"" he said. ""This is mainly due to a shortfall in supply of the vegetable. We don't know if farmers are hoarding it, or if there genuinely is such a big drop in harvest,"" he added.Shallot farmers admit there is a shortfall in the supply cycle, but attribute it to a combination of factors, including the drought and very low prices for the vegetable last year. ""Last year, shallots fetched hardly Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg, and even that did not find buyers,"" said a farmer, T Kadhiresan. ""So, almost two-thirds of the shallot farmers opted to cultivate other vegetables like beans, spinach and tomato,"" he said. ""While that itself reduced the price, the drought like conditions and the climate reduced the yield by less than half,"" he said. ""Shallots need a lot of mist and no heat during its growing stages, but without that last year the yield dropped from the usual five tonnes an acre to two tonnes an acre,"" he added.With the prices likely to remain high, many housewives have begun reworking their budgets. ""I used to spend Rs 500 a week for vegetables, but now it has gone upto Rs 650,"" complained Aashrita Kanwal, a resident of Saibaba Colony. ""Besides this, I have also begun reducing my usage of shallots and am using onions instead,"" she said.That seems to be the way forward because onion prices have begun dropping. While the vegetable costs Rs 9 in the wholesale market, it costs Rs 12 to Rs 20 in the retail market. ""It has dropped by 0.50 p to Rs 2 per kg, because stocks from Pune have begun pouring in,"" said Wahab."

The order issued on Thursday comes after two years of delay. Farmers are gearing up for kharif operations this year in three weeks.The purpose of input subsidy is to provide relief to farmers who have lost their crops due to drought or floods or any other reason by releasing subsidy on the expenditure incurred during the immediate agricultural season. More than 200 mandals in seven districts of Andhra Pradesh were hit by drought during Kharif in 2015, triggering migrations and suicides. Along with paddy, cotton, chillies, onion and other cash crops, horticulture crops such as mango and acid lime were also affected.""The government seems to have woken up from a long slumber and released funds for crops damaged in 2015. It is not showing interest in handing out assistance to farmers, but is all too willing to release funds to clear the bills of contractors. This shows the government's priorities,"" said MVS Nagi Reddy , former member of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.While the Centre releases 50% of the funds, the state government is required to release the remaining. The Union government had released drought relief funds in 2016 itself. Sources in the horticulture department said that the state government had failed to release its share and hence the input subsidy was put on hold. ""As the state has to utilise its finances judiciously, it used the available funds according to its priorities. Hence, there was a delay of almost two years,"" admitted a top official."

(File Photo) As against the 3 lakh odd hectares which was sown for Rabi onions this year Maharashtra has seen only about 2.2 lakh hectares of onion plantation for the current year. (File Photo)As onion exports from India clocks an all time high, the central government has decided to extend the 5 per cent subsidy on the produce till end of August. This would be the second time that the central government has increased the window of the subsidy to stabilise onion prices in the last six months in the wholesale markets.With a glut in onions due to increased acreage, the central government had reduced the minimum export price (MEP) to zero in December 2015. However, as prices failed to recover last year the government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS).Initially, the subsidy was supposed to be till March end but has been extended to August end of this year.Onion exports from India witnessed a steady rise with the year 2016 clocking the highest ever exports in the last 10 years. Total of 23,99,822.48 metric tonnes (MT) of the bulb was exported last year as against 11,14,418.13 mt of exports recorded in the year 2015. Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Sri Lanka and Philippines have emerged as major export destinations for Indian onions. Khariff, late Khariff and now Rabi onions are going off shore.However, the steady export has not done much good to the wholesale price of onions. Prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik district continued to hover between Rs 5-6 per kg much to the distress of the farmers.The state government had announced a special scheme to compensate for losses encountered by growers at the rate of Rs 1 per kg. In view of the low prices the crucial Rabi area has seen an alarming decrease.As against the 3 lakh odd hectares which was sown for Rabi onions this year Maharashtra has seen only about 2.2 lakh hectares of onion plantation for the current year. Rabi onion feeds the market between March to October and is the only produce which can be stored.Jagdish Apshunde, an onion exporter from Nashik wholesale market, reasoned that the glut due to bumper production of the last two years has not led to price rise. However now that people will be storing their onions, there are chances of a slight price hike in the near future, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Although it was ready for commissioning by the end of 2014, absence of power connection delayed the process. Installation of a 750-kv transformer besides electricity supply at a cost of `20 lakh were necessary to make the pack house operational.Though the pack house was commissioned on May 15 this year, the onion growers had to sustain loss for distress sale of their produce.Under Titlagarh sub-division, known as Nashik of Odisha, the onion is grown on 20,000 hectares in Titlagarh, Muribahal and Bongomunda blocks. While distress sale of onion is not a new phenomenon in the region and the Horticulture department is well aware of the plight of the farmers, the authorities were in no hurry to commission the pack house.In the absence of a storage facility, the farmers were forced to sell onion as well as paddy at distress prices for fear of their stock getting damaged in the pre-monsoon showers. Taking advantage of the situation, the traders purchase onion at as low as `3 per kg and hoard it till prices soar so that they can rake profits. The retail price is around `14 per kg.Deputy Director, Horticulture, PK Swain said already 100 tonnes of onion have been stocked against the 900 tonnes capacity of the facility."

If required, we will write to the Centre to procure onions from farmers through Nafed, Patro said.Politics over onion took centre-stage after BJP took up the issue with Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh seeking his intervention.Singh had advised the State Government to take recourse to market intervention scheme (MIS) to provide remunerative prices to farmers. As implementation of the scheme needs approval of the Centre, which shares 50 per cent of the burden, the State Government has to make specific request for market intervention.Since there was no proposal from Odisha Government for market intervention to check distress sale of onion, Singh told a BJP delegation that the State may not be keen to take the financial burden to protect the farmers.Accusing the Centre of maintaining double standards, BJD spokesperson Pratap Dev told reporters that on the one hand, it said there is bumper harvest of onion while on the other, it advised the State to maintain buffer stock to meet possible crisis of the edible bulb during monsoon season.Even if distress of sale of onion in the State is true, this is not Odisha specific. Even farmers in BJP-ruled States like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are selling onions at much lower price, Deb added."

The rains, however, will prove to be a blessing for farmers intent on sowing a BT cotton crop V P Chovatiya, research director, Junagadh Agricultural University said, ""The majority of summer crops have been harvested and farmers are waiting for the next sowing, around the first week of June. The mango crop still on the trees will be affected as the hailstorms and rain were accompanied by strong winds.""So far there have been no reports of rain in the coastal areas and the summer sesame crop has thus been saved. Rain and strong winds could completely destroy or badly affect the sesame crop in he coastal areas.Former agriculture officer B M Vaghela said the summer groundnut and bajra crops will be in the fields in areas where the sowing was relatively late. These unseasonal rains will affect the crop quality as the water will adversely affect the flowering of these crops. He further said that the farmers who want to sow BT cotton will do it early, as there will be some moisture in the upper soil layer. However, not many farmers will go in for early sowing. Vaghela said that the onion crop, which has been harvested in most places and may be lying in the fields, would be adversely affected as well.N C Patel, vice-chancellor of Anand Agricultural University said, ""Standing crops may be affected. However, barring mango, there should be no great impact.""Similar unseasonal rains earlier, coupled with heavy winds in parts of Amreli and Saurashtra have affected 15-20% of the mango crop. The heavy winds brought down fruit from the tree and the crop was damaged.Research scientist at Junagadh Agricultural University K Varu said that about 30% of the mango crop has alreadly been harvested and harvesting is in full swing. There were reports of heavy rain accompanied with strong winds in parts of Amreli. This rain and wind will definitely affect the crop. He said the market will also see a downward trend as far as quality mangoes is concerned. Varu further said the fruit will be blown off the trees and the crop would be affected."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 20: The state's favourite dish was omnipresent - from the dining table to a top trending topic on social media - as resident and not-resident Odias celebrated Pakhala Divas today. Thousands of people took to various social networking sites to share stories of their attachment with pakhala, while many others shared pictures of feasts over the dish at their homes and outside. The dish was also among the top trending topics on micro-blogging site Twitter throughout the day with a number of well-known personalities talking about it. Popular television personality and chef Sanjeev Kapoor tweeted: ""I am sure if today I go to any house in Odisha (or an Odia living in any part of the world), I would get freshly made Pakhala."" Writer Ravinder Singh wrote on Twitter: ""Fermented rice to beat the heat. The haves would eat it with fried fish & veges. The have nots with onion & green-chillies."" Artist Sudarshan Patnaik created a sand art on the theme with a bowl of fermented rice in the middle and a number of popular side-dishes alongside. He posted a picture of his creation on Twitter that was shared by international chefs such as Vikas Khanna and Ranveer Brar and hundreds of people from around the world. Pakhala is an Odia term for cooked rice washed or fermented in water. Depending on the palette, a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian accompaniments are served with it to spice up the taste. It was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath in the Puri temple since it was built in the 12th century. The dish has a number of variations, including jeera pakhala, dahi pakhala, basi pakhala, sajja pakhala and chaiin pakhala. Rourkela resident Monalisa Routray added a twist to her pakhala. She said: ""Instead of rice, I tried rice-stuffed dumplings immersed in curd. As side dishes, I had potato patties and fried drumstick. My family members all appreciated my unique spin to the dish."" Odia film-maker Biswananth Rath, who lives in Chennai, said: ""The day is an attempt to preserve the tradition of this Odia cuisine. The Odia association here got together and had a hearty pakhala meal. We also invited a number of non-Odia people."" Akshaya Mohanty, who lives in Rhode Island, US, said: ""I have invited my non-Odia friends here so that they can get a taste of the popular dish."" Lately, a number of hotels and restaurants have included pakhala in their menus. A vegetarian pakhala meal is available at Rs 350 and a non-vegetarian one comes for a princely Rs 400. There are budget eateries as well, which are offering the dish at Rs 70. ""A dish that hydrates the body is advised as a remedy against sunstroke. We have pakhala at home almost daily during the summer. But today, my friends and I wanted to celebrate the occasion in a special manner,"" said Manisha Dash, who visited the Dalma restaurant here."

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.

Experts say crop failure rate in the rain-fed regions is high.The state governments zero percent interest loan benefitted some farmers. But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan. This, local government officials say, pushed farmers to local money-lenders, a reason for farmers to demand loan waiver.The governments bid to improve horticulture and food processing is mainly confined to paper, leading to farmers not getting benefits, much like farm owners in Punjab and Haryana."
