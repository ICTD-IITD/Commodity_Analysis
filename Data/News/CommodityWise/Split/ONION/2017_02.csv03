It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later. Most of the onion growers do not have the financial capability to spend such a huge amount, official sources said."

Besides, this will encourage farmers to take up other crops.The BJP in the run up to 2014 Lok Sabha elections had promised to ensure 50 per cent profit to farmers on their input costs. While the Centre has failed keep its promise to the farmers, the State Government has passed a unanimous resolution during the Budget session of the Assembly urging the Centre to fix MSP at `2,930 per quintal of paddy.Responding to Deb, State BJP vice-president Samir Mohanty said this is one of many suggestions NITI Aayog has given to the Centre which is yet to take a call on the issue.Mohanty advised the State Government to follow the Chhattisgarh Government which has been providing a bonus of `300 per quintal of paddy to its farmers over and above the MSP.Dubbing this as an attempt to deflect the attention of people from the real issue, Mohanty said the State Government should take concrete measures to protect farmers from selling onion at distress price.The BJP leader advised the State Government to seek assistance of the Centre under the market intervention scheme (MIS) to save farmers from resorting to distress sale."

The Minister said Odisha has received the Krishi Karmana Samman four times during the last five years because of spectacular increase in foodgrains production.Agriculture cabinet has been constituted to decide on policy and programmes for the sector. The State Government has also renamed the department as agriculture and farmers empowerment, Rout said.For the first time, paddy production has crossed one crore tonnes. Paddy productivity has also increased to 2,438 kg per hectare which is more than the national average of 2,404 kg. Irrigation potential for 54.74 lakh hectares has been created (for both rabi and kharif cultivation) in 2015-16, Rout said and added that agriculture budget has also increased to Rs 14,930 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 13,182 in 2016-17.Farmers, who repay loans of Rs 50,000 regularly, are getting the benefit of one per cent interest rate from 2015-16. Five members of a farmers family are also eligible for health insurance of Rs one lakh. So far, health insurance of Rs 195.45 crore has been provided to 3,91,838 farmers, he said.There has also been a three-fold increase in fish production from 2.6 lakh tonnes in 2000-2001 to 6.08 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. Besides, 2711 pucca houses have been provided to fishermen during the last three years, Rout said and added that rest of the beneficiaries will be covered in phases.While milk production has increased to 20.02 lakh tonnes, export of prawn has reached 35,612 tonnes amounting to Rs 1792 crore in 2016-17, Rout added.Congress seeks waiver of loansBhubaneswar: Alleging that both the Centre and State Government have neglected the agriculture sector and farmers, Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) on Tuesday demanded waiver of loans of small farmers. The BJP had come to power by promising to implement the recommendation of Swaminathan Committee report for fixing minimum support price (MSP) of paddy. But why has the promise not been kept? asked OPCC general secretary and spokesperson Sulochana Das.Das alleged that both BJP and BJD are responsible for the current plight of farmers in the State as both the parties were in power in Odisha for nine years as alliance partners.Criticising the Government for its failure to open a model mandi in the State even after 17 years, she sought to know what steps have been taken to stop distress sale of onion and other vegetables. She demanded that the State Government should admit that loan burden and crop loss are the causes behind suicides by farmers and give compensation to their families.Criticising the Government for not acting on the announcement to create additional irrigation potential for 10 lakh hectares of agriculture land, Das wanted to know what steps have been taken to identify sharecroppers."

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is likely to visit the spot on Wednesday. Curfew is clamped across the district.Angry farmers have said they will not cremate the five bodies unless chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited the district, and have called for a strike supported by the opposition Congress. Many farmers have blocked the Neemuch-Mahu highway with the body of one deceased farmer.Last night police caned farmers who gathered at the mortuary. However, they allowed the bodies to be taken away in the wee hours. But we continue to stick to our demand that until and unless the CM visits the district, the cremation will not take place, said Patidar Samaj, Neemuch president Mahesh Patidar.

They dumped onions on roads as prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss."

In a reply to a question in the Assembly on May 9 2016, the CM had informed that 11.09 lakh hectares were covered under assured irrigation in 2015-16 kharif season. This is only 18 per cent of the total agricultural land of the State, BJP MLA Pradip Purohit told reporters here.Though many farmers in the State committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden, the Government refused to accept the fact to cover up its failure. Nothing could be more unfortunate than to claim that farmers of Odisha do not commit suicide. This shows the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the BJD Government, Purohit said.What happened to the State Potato Mission after three years of its launching? the BJP legislator sought to know from the Government.As per the Mission target, the State was supposed to be self sufficient in potato production. With its annual requirement of about 12 lakh tonnes of potato, Odisha had produced 2.68 lakh tonnes last year. Purohit attributed the failure to lack of storage capacity in the State.Quoting a reply of Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout in the Assembly, Purohit said only five cold stores of the Cooperation Department are functional while 13 have remained defunct. The Government has failed to revive a single cold store during the last 17 years.Even as the State has achieved self sufficiency in onion production, the farmers are selling their produce at throw away price due to lack of institutional support from the Government, he rued.Similarly, the State is way behind the national average in egg and milk production, Purohit added."

The MP government is pro-farmer and will continue to work for their welfare.The farmers called off their stir after Chouhan assured them that onion will be purchased at Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg.Chouhan tweeted that the procurement of onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg would start within 3-4 days and would continue till the month-end.In summer, the government would purchase the Moong dal at its Minimum Support Price (MSP), Chouhan said in an another tweet.He also announced withdrawal of cases filed against the farmers in course of the agitation.The CM also agreed to other demands of the farmers, particularly satisfactory prices for their produce.Earlier in the day, fresh violence were reported from Sehore and Ratlam, the fourth day of the stir.In Sehore district, nine policemen including City Superintendent of Police (CSP) SR Dadotia and tehsildar Santosh Mudgal were injured when protesting farmers allegedly pelted stones at them at Sonda village on the Indore-Bhopal road.Police were attacked when they went to disperse farmers who had stopped a banana-laden truck and were throwing the fruit on the road, Sehore ASP AP Singh, said adding the policemen used tear gas shells to disperse the farmers.Farmers emptied 5,000 liters of milk from a tanker at Raipuria in Jhabua district.Police registered a case against unidentified persons, said Raipuria Police Station in-charge ML Bhawan.In Delanpur village of Ratlam district, police sub-inspector Motiram Choudhary and his deputy Pawan Yadav suffered injuries in stone-pelting. Three four-wheelers were also torched, allegedly by the protesting farmers.The trouble started this evening when farmers stopped vendors and threw milk on the street. On getting the information, police reached the spot and tried to disperse the protesters but the farmers threw stones at them injuring two policemen, said Ratlam Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Neha Bhartiya.Both the injured policemen were admitted to a hospital, she added.Also on Sunday, vegetables and fruits market remained closed at some places in the state, especially in the Western region.The strike, which was mostly confined to western Madhya Pradesh had impacted the supply of milk, vegetable, fruits and other essentials at Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Mandsaur, Dhar, Shajapur, Khandwa, Neemuch and Ratlam."

It succeeds fairly well.Canto replaces Karma The Liquid Lounge, popular in the early 2000s for filling a gap between nightclub and fine-dining restaurant. In its new avatar, it has a chilled-out, easy vibe. In the midst of families out for a mid-week lunch and noisy kitty-partying women, one does spy the odd office-goer at a quick, solo lunch.Divided up into a voluminous main area on the ground floor and a tiny mezzanine level, the sense of space was apparent the moment we walked in. Comfortable tufted couches and wrought-iron-legged tables sit atop black-and-white tiles. Adding a touch of whimsy, two giant paintings of dancers in voluminous skirts dominate one wall. There are pendant lights and wall sconces; and plenty of natural light streaming in from the large windows.The Thai curry bao was disappointing.

Our next drink, the sour Melodies, was too high on lime juice and too low on gin.

593ae62d7be9e00e1ecd3ee0,Virulent vegetarians,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170403/jsp/opinion/story_144086.jsp,2017-04-03,"First they went after slaughterhouses. Then they turned to meat shops. Next they will invade our kitchens. That is not all. Yesterday beef was taboo. Today it is mutton. Tomorrow it will be fish and fowl, and eggs too. Let us be warned. The vigilantes are on the rampage and Uttar Pradesh is only their latest stomping ground. Within 24 hours of being sworn in as chief minister of India's most populous state, Yogi Adityanath ordered a state-wide crackdown on slaughterhouses. Officially, the drive is targeting ""illegal"" abattoirs and meat shops, but hundreds of legal slaughterhouses too have been sealed by the administration for violating some rule or other. Since slaughterhouses have to comply with a complex maze of over two dozen rules, it is easy to find some minor infraction to justify a shut down. As for the plethora of unlicensed operations, ground reports from UP indicate that one key reason for these is that no new licences were issued for the last 15 years, thanks largely to the aggressive movement launched by Adityanath and his Hindu Yuva Vahini musclemen. Afraid to frontally take on the Hindutva brigades, and yet mindful that a significant section of the state's Muslim populace was directly dependent on the meat trade, the previous state governments allowed the businesses to continue without any official licence. In any case, abattoirs and meat shops are certainly not the only businesses that operate without a licence. Thousands of small and micro enterprises in India's teeming informal sector - from vegetable vendors to pan sellers, barber shops to roadside dhabas - thrive in a grey zone that is not strictly legal but far from being criminal. But then the Adityanath government's drive has little to do with what is legal or illegal. It stems, on the surface, from a deep-seated hatred towards the Muslim minority and is aimed at crippling them both economically and culturally. In this, Adityanath is not alone. In state after Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state, the drive against meat shops and abattoirs is gaining ground: authorities in Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh have also been instructed to 'lay down the law' and shut down enterprises that have been quietly doing business for years. And where the law is not on their side, 'persuasion' in the name of 'sentiment' is the new tactic. Last week, for instance, a vigilante outfit by the name of Shiv Sena (which Uddhav Thackeray has since disowned) went around shutting hundreds of meat and chicken shops in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital since ""Navratri"" was on. The group issued notices warning the owners not to open their shops on Tuesdays and during the nine-day festival. A spokesman of the outfit told reporters, ""A number of Hindus keep fast during Navratri and every Tuesday. It does not feel good to see meat being sold and served on this day..."" Most of the shopkeepers - belonging largely to the minority community - complied with the 'request', he added. Hindu Yuva Vahini, Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena, Bharatiya Gau Raksha Dal - these groups go by many names, their activities seemingly uncoordinated, their organizations apparently autonomous. That is just a faade. In truth, they have all been spawned and nurtured by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's ideology that its practitioners proudly label ""cultural nationalism"". The goal of ""cultural nationalism"" is the creation of a Hindu rashtra whose primary enemies, on the face of it, are the beef-eating Muslims and Christians. But the real intent of cultural nationalism goes much deeper: it aims at creating a monolithic ""Hindu"" identity and abhors the bewildering diversity of cultural practices that make up the tapestry of Hinduism. Food is central to culture, to identity, to community and is not just something we put into our mouths for bodily sustenance. Whether consciously or subliminally, the Hindu Right is deeply aware of this subversive power of taste and tradition and that explains its obsession with the eating habits of people, its aggressive efforts to impose a 'Hindu' diet that goes well beyond the taboo against cow meat - which itself is far from universal even among practising Hindus in India. Although individuals in the BJP or even the RSS may be non-vegetarian, the dominant impulse of the sangh parivar is a virulent vegetarianism - signs of which have become much more evident in recent years. BJP-ruled states such as Madhya Pradesh have doggedly refused to supply eggs under the school mid-day meal scheme in spite of its proven nutritional value for growing children; vegetarian fare - particularly Gujarati snacks - has become de rigueur at official functions in Delhi; and bans on the selling of mutton, chicken, eggs and fish on Hindu festival days is becoming more frequent. While vegetarianism is a growing fad in the West too, in India it has a much longer and complex history - deeply entwined with the notions of 'purity' and 'pollution' that underlie the caste system. Ages before the famous French anthropologist, Claude Lvi-Strauss, produced his path-breaking work, The Raw and the Cooked, to explore culture in culinary terms and offered the raw-cooked-rotten food triad, ayurveda divided foods as tamasic (stale or rotten), rajasic (stimulating) and sattvic (pure and calming). Tamasic foods that include all meats were regarded the most inferior and fostered tamas (darkness, sloth, lethargy) while rajasic evoked excitement and passion. A sattvic diet - strictly vegetarian that eschews garlic, onion and spices too - was considered the best, and said to promote calmness and equanimity, the prescribed diet of sages and priests. Over the centuries, the subtler essence of this classification got vulgarized and food rigidities came to mirror social inequities. The upper castes, in particular the Brahmins, used their vegetarian diet to buttress claims of sattvic superiority over flesh-eating lower castes. Movements like the Arya Samaj also added to the cult of vegetarianism. With Nagpur Brahmins dominating the RSS leadership, the orthodox upper caste Hindu's visceral revulsion to meat - coupled with fear and loathing for the meat-eating Muslim - became embedded in the sangh's psyche; as did the myth of the spiritually elevated vegetarian Hindu. Never mind that serenity and equanimity are the last qualities that come to mind when we witness the vitriolic outpourings of the saffron-robed political "" yogis"" and ""sadhvis"" in our midst. What the RSS-inspired vigilantes deliberately overlook is that a vast majority of Hindus are non-vegetarian. According to the Baseline Survey of 2014 by the Census of India, 71.6 per cent of Indian males and 70.6 per cent of Indian females are non-vegetarian. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bengal, the figure crosses 98 per cent. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Odisha closely follow, with over 97 per cent non-vegetarians, while the figure is 93 per cent in Bihar. And, as is well known, Brahmins, too, are traditionally and determinedly non-vegetarian in states such as Kashmir, Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and along the western coast. Yet, there is a concerted effort to push vegetarianism as quintessentially Hindu - and imposing this stealthily through a combination of coercion and persuasion, fear and shaming. Non-vegetarians, rarely, if ever, force anyone to eat meat - respecting the tenets of dietary freedom that militant vegetarians increasingly refuse to reciprocate. Sadly, meat-eating Hindus have not come out in protest against ""Navratri"" fiats that are slowly becoming the norm. Nor have they shown any solidarity so far with the hapless butchers and cooks who dish out delicious kababs and biryanis that millions of Hindus consume with gusto. The saffron mobs, backed by State power, may be targeting the visible ""Other"" today. Tomorrow it will be the rest of us, our choice of cuisine, our way of life..."

He was immediately taken to the nearby government hospital where doctors pronounced him brought dead, the rural SP said, adding that police had not received any complaints regarding threat to the life of Yadav.Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manu Maharaaj said an FIR under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code had been registered with Fatuha police station. The incident seemed to be a case of personal rivalry, Mahraaj said and added that police had gathered some vital clues against the assailants. He, however, declined to elaborate.Maharaaj said Fatuha police station SHO Sujit Kumar had been suspended. There were complaints that early morning patrolling was not being done in the area, the SSP added.Another police officer said some historysheeters of the area were being questioned in connection with the murder. The body of the deceased had been sent to Nalanda Medical College Hospital in Patna for post mortem examination, the officer said.Meanwhile, local people and RJD supporters later blocked the Patna-Bakhtiarpur four-lane road and disrupted vehicular traffic for more than two hours. The agitators placed the body on the road and pelted stones on the police personnel. They also chased away Fatuha DSP Anoj Kumar from the spot alleging that the police were hand in gloves with criminals.Family members claimed that Yadav had been killed by his business rivals. Apart from being an onion trader, he was also a successful property dealer, said Ranbir Singh, a relative of the deceased.GRUESOME Criminals fired three shots into Pappu Yadavs head and fled from the spot"

We have called for a shut-down of entire Maharashtra on June 5, except Mumbai. On June 6, we will lock down all government offices and on June 7, we will lock down offices of MPs and MLAs, members of Kisan Kranti Core Committee told media representatives in Ahmednagar.Leaders of the farmers agitation reached Mumbai in the evening and are expected to hold another round of talks with the Chief Minister late in the night. Activist Anna Hazare is mediating the talks, sources said.The situation in Nashik district remained peaceful on Friday, the second day of the farmers strike, but all agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) remained shut. Nashik district is the biggest producer of onion in the country. Most of the onion trade takes place through APMCs.Until farmers get a complete loan waiver and the government agrees to all their demands, farmers should ensure their unity and continue with their agitation, Pawar said here after the steering committee of the farmers agitation decided to continue with its protest during their meeting at Puntambe in Ahmednagar district. Instead of wasting vegetables and milk, farmers should rather distribute all of it to poor people in villages and thereby strengthen their agitation, he added. (With PTI inputs)Nashik city faces shortageNashik city on Friday faced shortage of veggies and milk. Many milk vendors in the city joined the protest called by farmers. Agitators stopped vehicles carrying vegetables, fruits and milk at many places. They stopped milk-tankers heading for Hyderabad from Gujarat at the Sonagir toll-gate in neighbouring Dhule district. Protesters also staged road-roko on the Nashik-Pune highway at Sinnar. In a poignant sight, poor people were seen picking food grains and veggies thrown on roads by agitators at Siddhi Pimpri in Nashik district."

With no storage facility, farmers often leave the crop standing in the field. However, with heat likely to spoil the standing crop, the farmers have been forced to harvest the produce.This year, farmers in Jodhpur sowed onions in record 24,000 hectares. They harvested more than 3.60 lakh tonnes onions. This bumper harvest has now become a bane for the farmers.Shyamlal, an onion farmer from Rampura village, is unsure how he will clear the loan he had taken. Many other farmers are now neck deep in debt, because they cannot even get the production cost. Some farmers are selling onions by the roadside at 2 per kg fearing that the produce may get rotten in this heat.Gordhan Siyag, another farmer, said there was an immediate need for creating storage facility for the produce.The farmers are now demanding that their produce be bought by the government at the minimum support price. The state government, however, has yet to take a decision.Contacted, Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said he recently raised the issue in the Lok Sabha. The biggest challenge is to keep the onions safe. Efforts will be made to provide relief to farmers, including creating sheds to store onions, he said.According to agro trader Daulal Boob, in the past, the government had taken action against traders who stock the onions beyond limit. This time, the stockists are going slow in procuring the produce, he said, adding that since there was no facility to store onions in the district, it has to be sold off quickly.Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot termed the situation as unprecedented where onions are left to rot in open, while farmers who produced them face penury.State government must shun its indifferent attitude and immediately announce MSP for onions for the entire state and start procuring, he said in a tweet."

Sources said that senior ministers discussed the issue of farmers agitations in MP and Maharashtra. The BJP chief Amit Shah was also learnt to have spoken to the MP chief minister over phone.Concerns in the government and the party appear to be more for the reason that the farmers agitation has come at a time when the NDA is in the midst of a campaign to drum up support for achievements of three years of the Modi government. Incidentally, MP along with Rajsthan and Chattisgarh will to the Assembly elections in the later parts of the next year.The MP government had already accepted most of the demands of farmers on June 4. Farmers in the state have never resorted to violence. There are reports that criminal gangs and anti-social elements got involved in the agitation with the support of local Congress leader. What we are witnessing in parts of the state is nothing but the criminal-political motive of the Congress getting exposed, said BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao.With the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi heading to Mandsaur on Thursday, a long drawn political slugfest over the status of farmers in the state seems to be on the card. Incidentally, officials in the Central government had been noting for a while that the farmers were not able to sell the crops of pulses at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), besides the bumper onion crop having led the cultivators to resort to distress sale.But BJP leaders cannot agree that the situations of farmers are distressing. MP has been registering 20 per cent plus agricultural growth, while the state has emerged as number two in wheat productions. The state has also been the best performer in spreading irrigation facilities. The state government had ensured farm loan at one per cent interest, added Rao."

(File Photo) NCP MP Supriya Sule. (File Photo)NCP MP Supriya Sule has alleged that Maharashtra governments anti-farmer policies and failure to provide adequate remunerative prices for agricultural produce have broken the backbone of farmers. Because of the anti-farmer policies of the government and not providing adequate remunerative prices for their agricultural produce like onion, soyabean and pulses, the backbone of the farmers has been broken, Sule said.Watch What Else Is Making NewsShe was addressing public meetings at Yeola and Atgaon here yesterday ahead of the elections to Nashik Municipal Corporation, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad.Criticising the demonetisation move, the NCP leader said that, The Modi government at the Centre took votes in 2014 and notes in 2017.The farmers were destroyed, she said while alleging that the government has also forgotten its assurance of giving adequate support prices for their agricultural produce.Earlier, we welcomed Prime Minister Modis demonetisation move, but in an attempt to pull out blackmoney (from the system), the government caused hardships to the common man, Sule said.The government even kept an eye on gold ornaments of women, she said.During her visit to Yeola, Sule met farmer Krishna Dongare, who had set ablaze the onion crop on 2.5 acres of his land on Tuesday out of frustration, after the prices crashed.I have spent Rs three lakh on the onion crop in my field, but traders have stopped buying the produce in auctions.

593ba70f7be9e0066b6f5d0e,Bihar wish-list for Mr Jaitley,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170201/jsp/bihar/story_133304.jsp,2017-02-01,"What does Bihar expect for itself when Arun Jaitley rises to present the budget on Wednesday? Before every budget, there is hope in states that specific doles would be offered to them. But the Union budget is not for any particular state. Its for all the states. However, if funds are increased for departments, Bihar will also benefit, remarked former state finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi even as the current finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui expressed the hope that Bihar would be given major concessions. The Telegraph finds out what the wish-list of some key sectors is. ROADPromises and more promises but precious little has been done. The Centre has failed to fulfil the promises made to the state regarding the road sector despite repeated meetings. Union minister in charge of roads, Nitin Gadkari, had promised that Bihar would get Rs 50,000 crore for road projects, which did not take off. The state sent a proposal of upgrading 3,600km of roads to national highways; in response, the union ministry agreed to upgrade just 13 state highways covering a total of 910km. Promises made by the Centre to construct 53 road over bridges too have not been fulfilled. Several national highways are in need of urgent repair. All that the Centre has approved is a new link between Sahibganj bypass in Jharkhand to Manihari bypass in Bihar, including four-lane bridges over the Ganga, and Rs 1,742.01 crore for the rehabilitation of Patnas Gandhi Setu. Bihar road construction minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said: The promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on spending Rs 55000 crore on roads in Bihar are yet to be met. I hope that in this budget, the state gets the funds to repair the national highways and the amount he had promised. RAILWAYThe state expects funds for ongoing projects and betterment in passenger services. Money is required for ongoing projects which include an electric loco manufacturing unit at Madehpura, a wagon workshop at Garhara in Begusarai, a workshop at Jamalpur, and a rail bogie factory at Dalmianagar. ECR officials said a request for capacity augmentation has been sent to the railways for a coach maintenance workshop at Harnaut. Bihar Daily Passengers Association secretary Shoaib Quraishi said: The railways need to work on issues like safety of passengers, punctuality of trains, confirmed berths, improvement in on-board services and emphasis on the cleanliness inside trains and station premises. We are expecting that the railway will also work on improving the quality of food. HEALTHHealth experts are hoping that the total expenditure on the healthcare sector will increase. As per the last budget, the total expenditure for health was only 1.62 per cent of the whole budget out of which the National Health Mission had a share of less than one per cent. We are expecting an increase in the total expenditure on the healthcare sector this time. Increasing the budgetary allocation of the National Health Mission would give a boost to healthcare. The finance ministry should also focus on human resource. In 2015, the National Rural Health Mission had recommended formation of a special empowerment recruitment cell in states where there has been a delay in the recruitment of manpower in hospitals. There is a huge scarcity of doctors in state-run hospitals because the Bihar government had failed to fill vacancies in government hospitals, said Dr Ranjit Kumar, general secretary of Bihar Health Services Association. Sunil Kumar Singh, a member of the governing body of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, said the government should waive customs duty on high-end instruments that are being imported. This will ensure availability of high-end equipment in all hospitals. Besides, subsidies and incentives should be provided to the pharma industries for initiating research work. This will help in creation of new medicines of the same molecule and will ultimately bring down prices of medicines, said Singh. INDUSTRYThe focus of the government is on sectors like leather, textile, food processing to expedite industrial development and job creation. Industrialist Satyajit Singh said the finance minister should focus on increasing domestic consumption, public and private investment, exports and job creation. We feel the Union government should bring down corporate tax to a maximum 25 per cent from the current levels. The rebate on interest paid on housing loan should be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh, as it would boost the demand in the real estate sector and make a positive impact on fiscal sentiments. The GST peak rate should be limited to 20% and the focus should be on developing micro, small and medium enterprises, Singh said. AGRICULTUREAround 80% of Bihars population depends on agriculture and allied activities for a living, but the sector contributes only 25% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). Progressive farmer and chairman of the marketing wing of Nalanda Organic Vegetable Grower Federation, Rakesh Kumar, said it was time agriculture and horticulture were made profitable ventures, else people would be forced to leave farming. A minimum support price (MSP) should be declared for potato and onion to provide fiscal protection to farmers. Data show that the price of potato and onion has been almost static over the last 20 years, while cost of inputs like fertiliser and pesticide has multiplied several times. The Union budget should declare MSP for potato and onion and provision free electricity for farmers, Rakesh said. TOURISMBihar lacks basic infrastructure in attracting more tourists despite having the potential. Though the flow of tourists to Bihar has increased manifold but soon after their arrival, tourists start thinking about their return. It is due to the lack of proper communication linkage and infrastructure, said an official of the tourism department. Bihar is well known for its heritage sites like Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali, besides, historical sites linked with Jainism. But sadly these sites are just that  well known. We hope the budget provides some budgetary incentives to bring these tourist sites on a par with other popular tourist destinations of the country. Again, with certain other measures like converting Bodh Gaya into an international religious city with access without visa (based on passport of respective country) would go a long way in making it an international spiritual destination, the official said. There is still a shortage of budget hotel rooms. The government should make one, two, and three star hotels a priority, because hotel owners do not patronise building budget hotels as they think they wont make any money. The government should come forward and take initiative, the official said. REAL ESTATEThe realty sector has pinned high hopes on the budget with experts hoping to get industry status for housing sector. Sachin Chandra, honorary secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI)Bihar, said: The housing sector has not yet been given the status of industry because of which finance from banks is costlier right now. Once it gets the industry status, loans would become cheaper as well as it will be easily available giving a boost to the realty sector. Also, he added, the government should increase the interest limit on housing loan exemption from the current Rs 2 lakh to either Rs 2.5 lakh or Rs 3 lakh. CIVIL AVIATIONBihar hopes the budget will allocate funds for the modernisation of Patna airport, which has seen a surge in air traffic over the past few years. Passenger flow at the city airport increased from 14.5% in 2014-15 to 32.4% in 2015-16 necessitating the much needed expansion of the airport. We are expecting the budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore to be used for the first phase of expansion work to be carried out with regard to the construction of the terminal building along with other operational requirements, said Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria."

593baa047be9e0066b6f6230,Onion trader shot dead,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170517/jsp/bihar/story_151931.jsp,2017-05-17,"Pappu Gope Criminals gunned down onion trader and full-time RJD worker Pappu Yadav alias Pappu Gope at Fatuha in Patna rural on Tuesday morning, sparking major protests in the area. The incident occurred around 5.15am on Fatuha railway station road where Pappu (42) had gone for a morning stroll. Two motorbike-borne criminals followed him near the railway crossing and opened fire from close range, causing serious injuries. Relatives of the trader took a profusely bleeding Pappu, whose house is at a stone's throw distance from the site, to Fatuha primary health centre. He was later shifted to a private hospital in Patna where he succumbed to his injuries. Agitated over the incident, the slain RJD leader's supporters blocked the Patna-Bakhtiyarpur road that goes through the area and paralysed traffic for nearly two hours. The police had to face the ire of the local residents who pelted stones at them and also indulged in arson. Taking note of the lapses on the part of the police, Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manu Maharaaj shifted the station house officer (SHO) of Fatuha, Sujeet Kumar, and posted Avinash Kumar as the new SHO. The SSP had earlier received complaints from local residents about lack of patrolling in the sub-divisional town, around 20km east of the capital. Three incidents of murder and loot were reported from the area in the past two weeks. Fatuha deputy superintendent of police Anoj Kumar said the reason behind the murder of the trader was yet to be ascertained. The deceased's relatives denied enmity with anyone. Six years ago, Pappu had lobbied for being elected as a Member of Legislative Council (MLC). An investigating officer said the incident has been captured on a closed-circuit television camera installed at a shop on the station road. The two assailants fled towards the house of Nawal Yadav, who, sources said was a rival of Pappu. The officer said Nawal's nephew Chhotu had allegedly threatened Pappu with dire consequences following a dispute over a trust land. ""We are probing the case from this angle too,"" the officer said. A resident of the area, Ghanshyam Prasad, said a quack was killed in Khirodharpur village under the jurisdiction of Fatuha police station last week. Earlier, a mob had lynched an engineer.

Dilip Kagda A day after her visit to Nashik, Sule tweeted about the destruction of standing crop of onions by farmers due to low prices. Dilip KagdaOnion prices have become a political issue in the wake of Nashik local body elections. A day after NCP MP Supriya Sule raked up the issue of low onion prices, the Shiv Sena also has followed suit. Hovering between Rs 4 and 5 per kg, onion growers in Nashik have been complaining of losses over the last two years. Despite a steady increase in export, onion prices have remained low. With the late Kharif onion peaking in the markets, chances of any price correction appear dim in the days to come. In view of the low prices, the Central government has also increased the window to avail export subsidy. In view of the bumper arrival of onions, there has been no price corrections till date.Watch what else is making news:A day after her visit to Nashik, Sule tweeted about the destruction of standing crop of onions by farmers due to low prices. Sules tweet comes at a time when NCP is trying to keep control of the Nashik Zilla Parishad. The long incarceration of the former leader Chhagan Bhujbal over alleged charges of corruption has weakened the party in Nashik. Both Shiv Sena and BJP are trying hard to wrestle the local body from NCP.Nashiks rural areas have been worst hit due to demonetisation with onion sowing taking a dip in need for cash. Onion being a cash and labour intensive crop, sowing for the all-important Rabi onion has been lesser than expected. Low price realisation has weaned off some of the farmers away from onion to crops like corn. Unrest among its members had also resulted in Swabhimani Shetkari leader MP Raju Shetti to announce support for Shiv Sena in the local body elections. Santosh Gorade district youth president of the outfit said that a large number of party functionaries were on the verge of resigning in March. The state government has not done anything to help us. As onion growers we could not be blind to the pains of the growers and yet remain mute, he said. Shettis announcement of support toShiv Sena, Gorade said helped them change their mind. The BJP will not be able to make any effect in the rural areas, people are against them, he said. Jaydutt Holkar, the chairman of Lasalgaon market committee has recently joined Shiv Sena, while Nanasaheb Patil a director of the committee had joined BJP. Holkars wife is fighting elections from Shiv Sena while Patils wife is contesting from the BJP. Holkar said demonetisation and low prices of onions has been one of the major issues the party has raised during its campaign.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
