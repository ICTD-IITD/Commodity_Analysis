The price had gone up gradually since then. It was Rs. 120 a kg in grocery shops on Tuesday. The price was same in vegetable chain stores in the city. In Uzhavar Sandhai, it wasRs. 84 a kg. In Gandhi market, which has a number of whole trading houses for onion, the price of onion (first quality) was hovering between Rs. 80 and Rs. 94. Second quality was sold between Rs. 60 and Rs. 70. The price of one bag of small onion (50 kg) was quoted between Rs. 4000 and Rs. 4700 on Tuesday.The prices of onion are shooting up. It had never reached Rs. 100 a kg in wholesale market in Tiruchi. I expect that it will definitely breach Rs. 100 mark this year, said R. Naresh of Rajaganapathy traders in Gandhi market. Tiruchi market receives onion loads from Thuraiyur, Perambalur, Mysuru, Sathiyamangalam, Samjarnagar, Kollegal and Pollachi. On an average, it gets 15 to 20 loads (12 tonnes each load). However, market source said that arrival had come down to just four loads a day.There has been a severe drought in most of the onion growing areas in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Crop failure had been reported in several areas. The prices are likely to shoot up further in the next few weeks, Mr. Naresh added."

A Horticorp stall in-charge said the prices were in the Rs. 28-Rs. 30 range even a month ago. With no ready stock available, prices were on the way up. However, these will come down in another 15-20 days, he said.The Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralams daily market prices at Chala was Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 90 a kg for retail as per its website.A vegetable seller in Karamana said shallots were available for Rs. 110 a kg, but the good quality ones were priced at Rs. 120. Shallot prices had crossed Rs. 100 a kg three or four years ago too, but largely went unnoticed because of a simultaneous climb in onion prices.Shallots are mostly cultivated in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The current price rise is attributed to a fall in production. A friend of mine who exports vegetables said shallots were coming from the fields at Rs. 120 a kg.A vegetable commission agent at Chala said small onion was priced in the Rs. 70-Rs. 105 range depending on quality, though it had touched Rs. 115 some days ago. The current hike in prices was owing to a fall in production, leading to fewer truckloads arriving in the city markets.These are also exported in substantal quantities, he said.Small onion prices would come down in a month, he said, warning that in another month or two onion prices were likely to shoot up."

Uttam Kumar Reddy said the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has sensed the rising anti-incumbency wave in the State and the public meeting at Warangal was another attempt to hoodwink people with false promises.The CM is in fear, seeing the rising dissent and now wants to dilute it by making another round of false promises, he said while addressing a meeting organised by farmers of Mattampalli mandal on successful completion of several developmental schemes including Lift Irrigation Projects.Mr. Reddy ridiculed KCRs revived love for farmers and said agriculture sector remained neglected during the last three years. Farmers lost four consecutive crops and failed to get better prices for their produce during this Rabi season. Over 3,000 farmers committed suicide during the TRS regime and not a single family got the compensation of Rs. 6 lakh under GO 421.Moreover, no TRS leader visited the family of distressed farmers who committed suicide. He said Rs. 4,000 per acre fertilizer subsidy promised by the CM from next year was just an election gimmick and wanted Mr. Rao to prove his seriousness by paying the subsidy from the Khariff season.Taking a jibe at Gulabi Coolie, he said when IT Minister KT Rama Rao could raise Rs. 7 lakh by selling ice-cream, he should have sold chilli, turmeric and onion to help the farmers who are in deep distress for not getting remunerative prices for their produce.Mr. Reddy said the fear of students prevented KCR from addressing the centenary celebrations of Osmania University and it reflected how he has cheated the students and now fears them. As against the promise of giving one job in each household, he has failed to give even one job in all villages. Only KCR's family got four jobs after formation of Telangana,he said.Exuding confidence that Congress party was all set to come to power in 2019 elections, he announced that if voted to power, Congress Government would waive crop loans up to Rs. 2 lakh in one shot.He said the Government would create lakhs of jobs and all unemployed youth would be paid a monthly stipend until they get a job. All Indiramma houses would be upgraded to double bedroom.Earlier, the TPCC chief was felicitated by the local farmers on successful completion of Lift Irrigation schemes of Choutapally, Erragattu, Mattampalli, Amaravaram and Vemuluru which benefitted thousands of farmers."

I know your (farmers) problems,"" he said addressing a gathering, including cultivators, here.""The state government stands firm with the farmers. We are going to buy the farm produce and give profitable prices for it,"" he assured.The farmers are, among other things, demanding satisfactory prices for their farm produce. Their stir turned violent when five persons died in police firing, while six others were injured on Tuesday in Mandsaur district.""We have already bought huge quantity of onions at Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg. Each onion of farmers will be bought.""Your labour won't go waste,"" he promised.""We are going to buy different varieties of pulses at MSP,"" the chief minister said.Chouhan said his government was pro-farmer and recalled efforts underway to make farming a profitable business in MP.He said the irrigation facility has increased manifold and due to abundant water, farmers were reaping rich harvest.The BJP leader also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trying hard to make agriculture a profitable venture.Chouhan said the government had extended Rs 4,800 crore as relief amount to farmers when their soyabean crop was destroyed last year. Similarly, Rs 4,400 crore went as crop insurance compensation sum last year.Earlier, the chief minister, clad in a kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket, with wife Sadhana on his side, commenced his indefinite fast around 11 AM at a 'pandal' erected in the BHEL Dusshera Maidan after former chief minister Kailash Joshi put a 'tilak' on his forehead.As the CM entered the venue, his supporters shouted ""Kisan ka Samman hai, Shivraj Singh Chouhan hai, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Bharat Mata ki Jai"".The Opposition Congress dubbed Chouhan's fast as a ""nautanki"" (drama or empty theatrics).""Chouhan should tell people whether his so called fast was a 'nautanki' or an act of repentance for his misdeeds that set the state on fire,"" state Congress chief spokesman K K Mishra told PTI today.""Though he is trying to send a message that he is doing 'Gandhigiri' (Gandhian way of protest), it is not so. He neither sat beneath the statue of 'Bapu' nor garlanded Mahatma's statue before launching his 'nautanki'.""After all, against whom has he started his fast at Dussehra Maidan? He should remember that (demon king) Ravana is burnt every year at the Dussehra Maidan. His Nautankibaji won't work as he has done such drama in the past against the UPA-2 government,"" he said.Under fire over the farmers' unrest spiralling out of control, the chief minister had last evening announced to go on a fast for ""restoration for peace"" in the state.He had also said that the agitation had turned ""anarchic"", and appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.""I won't sit in my office at Mantralaya (Secretariat)... (but sit at) Dussehra Maidan and do all work from there,"" he had said, adding that those instigating the violence would not be spared."
593c71f57be9e00ed19a34eb,Opinion| Farmer protests:&thinsp;Rewrite the rules to stop this cycle of agrarian dist...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farmer-protests-rewrite-the-rules-to-stop-this-cycle-of-agrarian-distress/story-ahjhxzLpA2CtCSRTOjVUHM.html,2017-06-08,"The farm protests in Madhya Pradesh that left five people dead this week is symbolic of a wider agrarian distress engulfing India. Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."

He announced his decision at a press conference on Friday evening.Chouhan was flanked by his ministerial colleagues and BJP leaders. Many party workers too gathered to listen to the chief minister on the occasion. A number of farmers were brought by the party for interacting with the chief minister. Government officials were also present on the occasion.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ajay Singh termed the fast as a Kejriwal drama, which, he alleged, would involve an expenditure of crores of rupees.He was referring to Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal who had gone on an indefinite fast, promising 24-hour power at half the existing rate and up to 20 kilolitres of free water for all when his party comes to power in the national capital.Congress workers in Indore sat on a dharna and prayed for wisdom for the chief minister.Without taking the name of the Congress, Chouhan said he was pained when he heard words like Thaane me aag laga do (Set the police station on fire) or Patthar maro (Pelt stones).The Mandsaur incident is the most unfortunate. I was deeply pained. I will get this inquired into as to who were behind the violence and what was their motive. Those who spread violence during the agitation will not be spared, he warned.Chouhan said it was unfortunate that children are being given stones in their hands. This is painful. Where do they want to the push the state? Where will the state go with such attitude of people? he asked.He said that during the violence, more than 100 police personnel sustained injuries. Of them, six were seriously injured. As many as 197 buses and 127 government vehicles were damaged.Chouhan said that since he assumed his office 11 and a half years back, his first and foremost priority has been welfare of farmers.The irrigation area has been increased from 7.5 lakh hectares in 2003 to 40 lakh hectares now, he said.The rate of interest on loan to farmers has been reduced from 18% to zero percent. Further, it was minus 10% because if a farmer took a loan of Rs 1 lakh, he was supposed to return Rs 90,000 only.Chouhan said if facilities to farmers had grown manifold, the bumper crop led to sharp fall in prices. That was why a Rs 1,000-crore price stabilisation fund was created to allow farmers to get adequate return on their produce.Thousands of tonners of onion has been purchased at Rs 8 per kg by the government. From June 10, tur daal would be purchased at Rs 5,500 per quintal whereas the market rate was Rs 3,400-3,500 per quintal. Similarly, moong and urad would be purchased at Rs 5,225 per quintal across the state, he said."
593c72507be9e00ed19a35ba,Why a bountiful harvest drove farmers to despair and anger,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-a-bountiful-harvest-drove-farmers-to-despair-and-anger/story-Z4Tv0RSb49s9ANWv2OIP7L.html,2017-06-08,"A plentiful harvest in 2016 and imports drive some prices down 63%. A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

The party has not taken any such decision. But any spontaneous reaction from the public cannot be ruled out, said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb.While the BJP is tom-tomming its achievement in farm sector, two of the BJP-ruled States, including Maharashtra, are facing serious agitation from farmers which speaks volumes, Deb said, making a veiled attack on the BJP.The BJP is making wild allegations against our Government over distress sale of onion. Why is distress sale of onion there in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh? Deb wondered.The agriculture sector is still limping with just 1.7 per cent average annual growth during the last three years of Modi Government and most of the farmers are struggling for survival.The 1.7 per cent agricultural growth in the last three years (2014-2017) of the NDA Government is much lower than the 3.6 per cent in the last three years of Manmohan Singh Government, Deb said.Besides, the BJP owes an explanation to the people about the Prime Ministers promise to double the income of farmers which is still a distant dream, he added."

While the rigorous training at culinary school lays the basic foundation for our profession, it is our expeditions through the country and across continents that leads our discovery of new cultures, foods, ingredients, techniques and much more. My travels have been no different!Sojourns across South-east Asia have left an indelible impression, influencing both, my style of cooking and menu planning. Interestingly, South-east Asian cuisine comes with a whole lot of unsuals. Consider the concept of serving in bowls, whereby the bowl serves as a complete meal in itself!By virtue of expediency and exquisiteness, the Vietnamese Pho, Burmese Khowsuey and Singaporean Laksa, all bowl meals, have reached tables of leading restaurants across the globe.Another lasting gastronomic influence in my life came from my five year stint in the beautiful Maldivian islands, where I picked up the art of contrasting flavours, textures and temperatures. I had the pleasure of tasting a local specialty - a yellow fish curry served with rice and crisp drumstick leaves. The taste and texture of the meal linger on, and have, in fact, become the basis for a whole lot of innovations.One such dish on our menu, which, in the true sense is a culmination of these learnings, is the Hu-Tieu-Sai-Gon!Hu tieu (spiced noodle soup) is a traditional Vietnamese dish specific to southern Vietnam. This bowl meal is a perfect balance of spiciness from chilies, sweetness from jaggery, sourness from tamarind and the crunch from fried peanuts! To prepare Hu-Tieu- Sai-Gon, make a stock of fresh veggies along with spices such as garlic, star anise, ginger, cinnamon and chopped lemongrass and bring to a boil. Strain the broth and put back on the boil. Add a homogenous mix of coconut milk, peanut butter, mushroom oyster sauce, light soy to the broth.For the toppings, use blanched vegetables and cooked rice vermicelli in boiling water for not more than a minute. To assemble, add boiled rice vermicelli in a soup bowl. Top it up with the blanched vegetables, crispy onion and garlic slices. Pour the boiling broth over this and serve alongside shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sprouts, basil leaves, chilli and lime wedges.Like all my journeys, thus far, I wish to continue the exploration of the myriad nooks in this world that lead me to less travelled culinary havens and ultimately to the discovery of life itself.

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg. Carrots and beans are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg, respectively.I buy minimum of all vegetables as the prices are high. My budget for vegetables for a week is Rs 100, says Allabakash."

Not just that. A big fish market at Rs. 3 crore is planned near Virattipathu with financial support from the Government of India. And, lastly, lorries coming to the city shall be parked near Kochadai, where a big space is being readied at around Rs. 2.70 crore with amenities like rest room and restaurants for drivers/conductors.Presently, the fruit market (wholesale and retail vendors) has its business along Vakkil New Street, East Masi Street and parts of Yanaikkal, very close to the Meenakshi temple, which is being given a facelift under the Swachh Bharat Mission.All the 240 outlets have been built on a sprawling 4.86 acre land near Mattuthavani integrated bus stand. The building has been raised with a contribution of Rs. 12 crore from the fruit vendors associations.The Corporation had planned to get the infrastructure done at Rs. 3 crore, which included construction of a compound wall, UGD system and water facilities, said Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri.Almost 80% of the work is over. When the market becomes operational, not only the city would be decongested in select areas, but the Corporation would also start getting revenue of Rs. 3 crore every year. A fruit vendor, Ganesan, on Vakkil New Street said that they would be too glad to move out of the city to Mattuthavani. Only the Corporation is delaying the shifting. If they hand over the keys today, we will start operations there from tomorrow was his reply.Under the Government of India project, the Corporation had planned to construct a fish market near Virattipathu at Rs. 3 crore, with funds (Rs. 1.50 crore) coming in from National Fisheries Development Corporation, grant of Rs. 1.20 crore from Tamil Nadu government and Rs. 30 lakh from TUFIDCO as loan. Corporation officials said that with Madurai entering the top 100 list in Swachh Survekshan ranking, the Centre was giving funds with a commitment from the local body to take up works that would help the city remain clean. Only when the users cooperated, the projects would become a success. In some cases, business model had to be adopted. Thus, for using a facility, the users had to pay a sum for the upkeep of the infrastructure, they said. The Swachh Bharat initiative provided funds for building infrastructure. Thus, for the maintenance of these facilities, the users had to contribute to the local body, they added.When asked about the plan to shift the onion market from East Marret Street, Mr. Nanduri said that talks were on with the association office-bearers and a plan would be drawn up soon. A senior police officer said that with 13 major intersections and over a million vehicles using the roads within the city and on the peripheries, shifting of markets would be a relief to motorists.The number of accidents, which were reported due to the collision between two-wheelers and trucks/tempos, too might fall, the officer opined."

Police also arrested Nitish Kumar (22) and Lokesh Kumar (23), who were allegedly paid for shooting Pappu.""We are at work to catch the main shooter, identified as Manish Kumar (24),"" Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj told newsmen on Saturday.Pappu was shot dead by two mobike-borne criminals near Fatuha Bazaar around 5.15am on May 16 soon after he left home for morning walk.""Nitish was driving the bike while Manish was riding the pillion. Manish fired the bullet which hit Pappu on the right side of the neck and exited from the left side of his skull. A country pistol was used in the crime, which is yet to be recovered,"" the SSP said and added it was Lokesh who tipped the shooters about Pappu exiting from his home for his walk.Police said Bachu and Dhananjay had struck a Rs 2-lakh deal with the killers. ""A sum of Rs 25,000 had been paid in advance; the remaining amount was yet to be paid,"" Maharaaj said, quoting the arrested accused.Property dispute was the reason. ""Also, Pappu spent money during Dhananjay's marriage ten months back and, in return, kept an SUV gifted to Dhananjay in dowry. Pappu would ask Dhananjay to pay the Rs 11 lakh he had spent on his marriage to get back the SUV,"" the SSP said and added the two brothers had their head shaved as they attended Pappu's funeral and other rituals.The duo tried their best to prevent police from suspecting their role. ""They led the agitation and the road blockade after the murder,"" the SSP said.Pappu's brother-in-law Sanjay Gope said Pappu had alone spent more than Rs 1.5 crore on the treatment of his father Hari Kishun Yadav for spinal ailment. ""He left everything in Fatuha and had almost settled in New Delhi for nearly two years to save his father, but he died. Pappu returned to Patna a year back,"" he said, adding Pappu had three brothers."

(Source: ANI_News/Twitter) Shivraj Chouhan said his government was pro-farmer and recalled efforts underway to make farming a profitable business in MP. (Source: ANI_News/Twitter)As the violent agrarian unrest entered its tenth day in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday began his indefinite fast at the Dusshera Maidan in Bhopal for the restoration of peace and promised profitable prices to farmers for their produce.I know of the bumper crop production that has sent the prices crashing down in the state. I know your (farmers) problems, he said addressing a gathering, including cultivators, here. The state government stands firm with the farmers. We are going to buy the farm produce and give profitable prices for it, he assured.The farmers are, among other things, demanding satisfactory prices for their farm produce. Their stir turned violent when five persons died in police firing, while six others were injured on Tuesday in Mandsaur district. We have already bought huge quantity of onions at Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg. Each onion of farmers will be bought.Your labour wont go waste, he promised. We are going to buy different varieties of pulses at MSP, the chief minister said. Chouhan said his government was pro-farmer and recalled efforts underway to make farming a profitable business in MP. He said the irrigation facility has increased manifold and due to abundant water, farmers were reaping rich harvest. The BJP leader also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trying hard to make agriculture a profitable venture.Chouhan said the government had extended Rs 4,800 crore as relief amount to farmers when their soyabean crop was destroyed last year. Similarly, Rs 4,400 crore went as crop insurance compensation sum last year.Earlier, the chief minister, clad in a kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket, with wife Sadhana on his side, commenced his indefinite fast around 11 AM at a pandal erected in the BHEL Dusshera Maidan after former chief minister Kailash Joshi put a tilak on his forehead.As the CM entered the venue, his supporters shouted Kisan ka Samman hai, Shivraj Singh Chouhan hai, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Bharat Mata ki Jai. The Opposition Congress dubbed Chouhans fast as a nautanki (drama or empty theatrics). Chouhan should tell people whether his so called fast was a nautanki or an act of repentance for his misdeeds that set the state on fire, state Congress chief spokesman K K Mishra told PTI today.Though he is trying to send a message that he is doing Gandhigiri (Gandhian way of protest), it is not so. He neither sat beneath the statue of Bapu nor garlanded Mahatmas statue before launching his nautanki.After all, against whom has he started his fast at Dussehra Maidan? He should remember that (demon king) Ravana is burnt every year at the Dussehra Maidan. His Nautankibaji wont work as he has done such drama in the past against the UPA-2 government, he said.Under fire over the farmers unrest spiralling out of control, the chief minister had last evening announced to go on a fast for restoration for peace in the state. He had also said that the agitation had turned anarchic, and appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.I wont sit in my office at Mantralaya (Secretariat) (but sit at) Dussehra Maidan and do all work from there, he had said, adding that those instigating the violence would not be spared.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

On screen were reports of doctors striking work across the state in protest against the growing violence against them. Patil, upset by the dip in onion prices, threw an idea at his friends that evening, one that would take Maharashtra by storm. Why cant we strike work like the doctors have? By then, Dr Sanjay Dhanvate, managing director of Puntambas Asha Kiran Paraplegic Center, was already thinking along the same lines. The states farmers had tried everything from fasts to railway blockades  with little success. A strike would be the ultimate weapon  farmers would not grow or trade in agri commodities, he says.On April 3, the Puntamba Gram Sabha unanimously passed an eight-point charter of demands threatening a strike from June 1 if they were not met. A single village on strike would hardly be news, so over the next few days we asked almost 200 villages to pass similar resolutions, says Dhorde Patil, who was once associated with Anna Hazares India Against Corruption movement. With Nashik and Ahmednagar villages leading the way, over 2,000 gram panchayats passed resolutions of a Shetkari Sampa or farmers strike on May 1, Maharashtra Day. Incidentally, it was local BJP leader Dhananjay Jadhav who took the lead in Puntamba. A meeting was held in Pune on May 11 to form a core committee to spearhead the movement. Some villagers had reservations about the speed at which things were moving, but we followed Jadhavs lead anyway, says Suhas Wadane, a villager.At the Pune meeting, additional power centres emerged. There was the Karad-based event manager Sandeep Gidde, Kamal Sawant of the Bhumata Sanghatana and Shantaram Kunjir of the Maratha Seva Sangh. This core committee then began to travel across the state to spread the word of the plans for June 1, Dhanvate says. Simultaneously, Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana party, an ally of the ruling BJP, had begun to openly express his unhappiness with the Maharashtra governments intransigence on a farm loan waiver. By mid-May, even as Dhanvate and 20 villagers prepared to meet Fadnavis, Shetti was planning a padyatra from Pune to Mumbai. At their meeting with the CM, Dhanvate and team were willing to reverse the strike call. But new leaders had emerged and several organisations decided to continue, admits Dhanvate.Days later, Shettis padyatra began, more or less independent of the other organisations. But the thousands of farmers who attended Shettis rallies along his route didnt really see the two struggles as separate. The demands were the same. Shettis yatra, which he labelled as his Atmaklesh Yatra  a self-professed repentance for supporting the BJP  should have set off alarm bells, but senior government sources say the administration failed to recognise its seriousness as for one, Shettis own party colleague, Maharashtra minister of state for agriculture Sadashiv Khot, had conspicuously stayed away.Once the strike kicked in and the urban centres began to feel the pinch, with supplies squeezed, the core committee was called for a marathon discussion with Fadnavis in Mumbai on June 2. The committee and the CM announced the withdrawal of the strike before dawn on June 3, with the government agreeing to the Rs 30,000 crore loan waiver. But by then the movement had acquired a life of its own. Those in Nashik and elsewhere too refused to call off the strike  the assurances were not in line with their demands.The core committee became the target of farmers ire. Giddes proximity to Khot, and the fact that top negotiator Jayajirao Suryavanshi had stayed back at Khots bungalow, incensed farmers who saw it as a betrayal. In Puntamba, where it all began, Jadhavs ties with the BJP led villagers to declare that the government was trying to sabotage the movement. While Suryavanshi eventually had to apologise, Jadhav is still to return to Puntamba even though the strike was called off on June 8.There was also a new core committee, with major political players in lead roles. Apart from Shetti, independent MLA Bacchu Kadu, president of the Kisan Sabha, Ajit Newale, veteran Shetkari Sanghatana leader Ragunath Patil and others were now picked to head the movement. It was this committees first meeting on Thursday that ended the strike, but with the new ultimatum that the state should hold talks by Monday, June 12. A strikingly similar chain of events unfolded in Madhya Pradesh. When Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) for talks four days after the farmers stir began on June 1, he was confident. The BKS, the largest farmers organisation in the state, is allied to the RSS and has in the past helped the Shivraj regime. In 2012, when angry farmers engaged in arson and beat up government and police officials in Bareli in Raisen district, the RSS simply sacked then BKS chief Shivkumar Sharma. The government slapped a slew of cases against Sharma while the RSS installed new leaders.This time, seated next to the CM at the Ujjain Circuit House on June 5, BKS general secretary Shivkant Dixit announced that the strike had been called off, and that the state government had agreed to buy onions at Rs 8 a kg. But the gamble backfired. Farmers felt betrayed  the BKS wasnt originally in the picture and appeared to have jumped on to the bandwagon only to derail the strike. As farmers bodies continued their protests, the government detained two office-bearers of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that claimed to have started the protests. Officials believed the situation had been tackled effectively. But here too, the agitation had acquired a life of its own. When the five farmers were killed in Mandsaur on Tuesday, June 6, Chouhan, despite his pro-farmer image, studiously avoided the historical town in the Malwa region even three days after the incident.The situation was bad due to low prices, and got worse after demonetisation, concedes BJP MLA from Mandsaur Yashpal Singh Sisodiya. He says the violence was a fallout of a combination of factors  falling prices, demonetisation, difficulty in getting loans form cooperatives, anger against local policemen, involvement of anti-social elements and even liquor mafia and infiltration of the movement by criminals. According to Sisodiya, the police took on the liquor mafia after a local journalist was shot dead near Pipliya Mandi last month. Police had rounded up nearly 50 people, angering them, the MLA says.Mandsaurs Lok Sabha MP, Sudhir Gupta of the BJP, terms the violence as a conspiracy hatched by the Congress. While admitting there are issues with bank transactions and poor prices for produce, the escalation of violence, he says, was politically motivated. Some BJP leaders say the government failed to anticipate the scale of the protest, as was the case, they say, when Hardik Patels Patidar movement hit Gujarat. Hardik, however, has limited support in MP, where his community already enjoys OBC status.He is desperate to come to Mandsaur but I have persuaded him against doing so. Im not sure if his presence will help or aggravate the situation, claims the state chief of the Patidar Samaj, Mahendra Patidar, who was among the very few people allowed access to one or two families of the victims of Tuesdays firing. Meanwhile, in both states, the farmers demands include a total farm loan waiver and adherence to the MSP regime. Neither government has so far come out with final announcements.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. (Representational Image)Prices of vegetables in both wholesale and retail markets in urban areas such as Pune and Mumbai have seen large scale correction, bringing much-needed relief to consumers. Prices of almost all other fresh vegetables, barring garlic, have come down by almost 30-40 per cent, as the markets reported increased arrival.Earlier, the week-long farmers strike had crippled the supply of vegetables across major wholesale markets in the state. Farmers had refused to trade their produce at the markets and had also taken to the streets to stop the supply of such commodities to urban centres. The price of fresh commodities, including vegetables and milk, had gone up by a whopping 40-50 per cent between June 1-8 across the state. While the supply had improved towards the last few days of the strike, most of the supply of fresh produce was from outside the state.The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. As against the traded price of Rs 4,000 per quintal of June 2, tomatoes traded at Rs 600 per quintal on June 9. Similarly, for okra, prices have dropped from Rs 6,000 per quintal to Rs 3,000 per quintal. Onion prices have also seen a slight dip, from Rs 1000 to Rs 850 per quintal. Supplies have improved in Vashis wholesale market, with more than 600 trucks of vegetables arriving in the market on Saturday.Suresh Pingle, president of the Vegetables Traders Union of the market, said prices of almost all vegetables ranged between Rs 10-20 per kg. The drop in prices at the wholesale markets have resulted in a similar trend in retail markets. Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri retail market, said prices of most commodities had dipped by 50 per cent. However, garlic prices remained high, as supplies were hampered due to the ongoing crisis in Madhya Pradesh.  Until supplies resume from Madhya Pradesh, the trend will remain the same, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday warned that he would take the fight on behalf of farmers to the doorstep of the Assembly unless Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu takes concrete steps to mitigate their plight.Making an emotional speech to mark the conclusion of his two-day Rythu Deeksha here, Mr. Reddy said his party would raise issues concerning farmers during the short Assembly session to be held during the second week of this month.He said the prices of edible and commercial crops had touched a record low and cited chilli as an example.Mr. Jagan alleged that Mr. Naidu had broken his own record of inflicting misery on farmers for the third consecutive year. Mr. Naidu has always supported contractors. He never hesitates to highlight the costs involved in the construction of the Pattiseema project, Handri-Neeva, Galeru, and the Secretariat citing inflation but has never bothered to raise burning issues such as support price for farm produce and mess charges to students studying in welfare hostels, Mr. Reddy said.The State governments apathy in dealing with issues concerning farmers was evident as banks failed to meet the targets in both the kharif and rabi seasons.Out of the 1.4 lakh accounts of farmers, 40 lakh accounts have become either overdue or non-performing assets (NPA) accounts, said Mr. Reddy.Mass migrationThe YSRC leader said mass migration of farm labour had become a regular phenomenon. The lack of water and scarcity of fodder had forced many farmers to migrate to neighbouring States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.In Kurnool, farmers cultivating onion in nearly 29,000 hectares are forced to sell it at just Rs. 1.50 per kg. Those protesting against the fall in prices are being threatened with police cases, he said.Party leaders Ummareddy Venkateswarlu, Marri Rajasekhar, Ambati Rambabu, Lavu Krishnadevarayulu, MLAs Kodali Nani, Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy, and Lella Appireddy were present."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Red Fort in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)A new study of global pollution shows that Indias air is the worst in the world (www.stateofglobalair. org/data). Masked Delhiites, caught in a relentless shroud of smog, have no choice but to inhale copious amounts of particulate matter. Somewhere, a quiet realisation has sunk in that the way we live is not safe. This awareness has led to a shift, with the thinking urban citizen attempting to make substantial changes to his own environment.Since 2015, we have planned over 250 balconies, terraces and small garden patches in the NCR, says Kapil Mandavewala, 36, proprietor of Edible Routes, a specialised garden solution company. They offer quite a range  from vegetables to oxygen-generating plants, and creepers. Based on a large patch of land in Ghitorni, originally an artists collective where Vivan Sundaram has his studio and Bharti Kher is a co-owner, a walk through the garden is full of revelations on design and natural ecosystems: cabbages and broccoli grow together in chaos while tomatoes are surrounded by fragrant basil.This is called companion gardening. The basil repels insects naturally and increases the tomato yield, explains Mandavewala. While his clients in highrises prefer to grow herbs, he has encouraged some of them to try growing patches of cabbage, onion and garlic as well. There are interesting looking flower pots that one is unlikely to spot elsewhere, with white pipes embedded in the mud. Mandavewala explains that the biggest quandary of the apartment dweller, who works and travels, is not being around enough to water the plants.Once you top these pipes with water, the pot can go for a month without watering as the moisture releases into the soil slowly, he says. Edible Routes has pots with a nutritive mix of mud and manure made with a machine bought from a design student in Ahmedabad.After returning with a science degree from the US in 2008, Mandavewala began tilling his familys 22-acre farm in Gujarat and supplying vegetables to a few families in Jamnagar. A chance invitation from an NGO, Manzil, for a workshop on urban gardening led him to set up shop in Delhi in 2014. He took a 14-day course on permaculture, a system of agricultural and social design principles implemented by learning from nature. Applying it to an urban context came with its own challenges: the way light falls in a highrise, in a vertical slant, may not be conducive to all vegetables and oxygen-generating plants.A special focus needs to be given to seepage and drainage of water. It took me a while to understand urban spaces and explain to the clients as well that every space is capable of cultivating something, says Mandavewala. For one home, he introduced Malabar spinach called poe saag as a vine, a popular variation of spinach down south but rarely grown in Delhi. In another, a family grew tori along their border walls.The clients, meanwhile, are mostly enchanted by their gardens. The joy of growing and cultivating your own food, knowing what youre consuming, is something else, says Mandavewala, adding that many of them begin with being terrified at the idea of taking care of several plants. One of the ironies of urban India is that farm land is acquired by people who dont know how to farm; the ones who know want a job in the city, in an office.A consultation with Edible Routes can cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the material cost, area and charges for executing the project.

VENKATACHALAPATHYC_VENKATACHALAPATHYBuying vegetables may no longer be easy on the pocket, at least for the next two months, say traders. The rates of many vegetables have skyrocketed over the last few weeks in town.According to traders, the prices of many vegetables steadily increased during April.While the prices of onion and tomato continue to be low comparatively, the cost of brinjal, beans and carrot have shot up. The rates have peaked as there is no yield resulting in poor supply to markets in Vellore, A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The cost of the local variety of brinjal, thorny ones, has been rising in the last one month, he said. It was priced Rs. 15 a kg earlier. The rates steadily increased during April and are now priced Rs. 80 a kg. The regular variety of brinjal costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg.As for beans the price went up from Rs. 15-Rs. 20 two months ago to Rs. 80 now. The price of carrot rose from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50, Mr. Balu said.Ladys finger is selling at Rs. 15-Rs. 30. Beetroot too has become costlier  from Rs. 10Rs. 15 it has gone up to Rs. 40.Onion and tomato offer some solace to consumers. Onion sells at between Rs. five and Rs. 12 a kg, and tomato at Rs. 10.The rate of tomato continues to be low when compared to other vegetables, as there is yield during summer in parts of Andhra Pradesh, he added.Potato costs between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20; small onion between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40; drumstick Rs. 20; green chillies Rs. 20; snake gourd between Rs. 25 and Rs. 30; bitter gourd between Rs. 20 and Rs. 30; and ginger between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40.Cost cuttingMr. Balu said, Already, people have started cutting down the purchase of vegetables due to the spiralling cost.Those buying a kg earlier are now purchasing  of a kg.Those who buy four kinds of vegetables prefer to purchase just one or two varieties, he said."
593da1577be9e00dabcc2aab,Mission Chholey Bhaturey!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mission-chholey-bhaturey/article18396845.ece,2017-05-06,"In reckoningThe chholey bhaturey of Odeon Sweets rate as one among the best in the CapitalAs Delhi expands and shrinks, I find that I am losing touch with some of my favourite haunts of old times. Driving past Gole Market the other day, I recalled how often I used to go there, and how many of those eateries are not there anymore.Once upon a time, kababs meant Galinas, which sold juicy seekh kababs and roomali rotis. If we wanted Kerala mutton fry, we went to Shridharans. Bengali food meant the Basu Lodge, where you got home-style dal and veggies, and a small sweet shop called Bengal Sweet Home, which sold delicious Bengali samosas. And when we wanted fish, we went to Gujarat Fisheries.The shops have all downed their shutters, and I seldom find myself in Gole Market any more. But a thread on Facebook pushed me into making a trip to this little market area in central Delhi a few days ago.The FB conversation  on this popular site called Delhi Food Walks  was on chholey bhaturey.Everybody had an opinion on where the fare was the best. I think the best chholey bhaturey are still to be found at Chachas in Kamla Nagar, Nagpals in Amar Colony, Nand in Sadar Bazar and Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar. But a few diehard foodies  including old friend Tulu Patnaik  swore by Odeon Sweets on Bhagat Singh Market in Gole Market.Always happy to try out something new, I landed up there. The name was familiar and I realised that I had actually eaten their chholey bhaturey long years ago when the sweet shop was on the middle lane in Connaught Place, near the Odeon theatre. This is now on the Bhagat Singh Market Road which is the main road that leads you to Gole Market from CP. The address is 22, Bhagat Singh Market, and the phone numbers are 64656470 and 9716345474.The place is known for its sweets, too, so I tried out a bit of the moong dal ki halwa (Rs. 600 a kilo), which I thought was good, well roasted and deliciously rich. But I was on Mission Chholey Bhaturey, so I packed some for lunch (Rs. 70 a plate) and went right back home.And it was quite an enjoyable lunch, too. The chholey bhaturey had come with some green chutney, thin strips of pickled raw mango, pickled green chillies and onion slices. I laid them out on my steel ki thali, tore off a bit of the fluffy bhatura, dipped it into a mound of chholey, lightly topped it with the green chutney and popped it into the mouth. Then I bit into a green chilli, had some of the mango pickle and the onion slices and burped elegantly.In the final analysis, I think my four favourites still get the tiara. This was nice, but the chholey would have tasted better had it been less oily and just a wee bit more moist. I found it a little too dry. The bhaturey was excellent, fluffy and light (well, they are not light, I know, but a good bhatura should always appear light). Overall it was a good lunch. Not quite healthy, I agree, but satisfying nevertheless.The Odeon sojourn makes me want to go back to some of my old favourites. I think its time I did a comparative study of chholey bhaturey shops in Delhi, and like the Miss India pageant (which, I may as well confess, we disrupted at a function in Delhi many, many years ago), give away crowns. Those who wish to join the panel of judges may please send in their applications."

RAJUV_RAJU.The 12-day junior chef programme organised by Westin College of Hotel Management brought out a startling fact here on Friday.Many children, who took up the training programme, highlighted the reluctance of their mothers letting them enter the kitchen to learn the culinary basics, says college director K. Durga Prasad.Most of them did not even know how to cut an onion when they joined the camp, he said.The two-week stint saw a dozen kids in the age group of eight to 14 learning preparations of several snacks from the three-member chefs. Our aim is inculcate good and safe practices of cooking which will help them in the long run.They learnt the art of making healthy and nutritious recipes in a hygiene ambiance. They also tried their hands in various country foods, says chef Teja.Indian Oil Corporation Area Manager Meera Nair, who handed over the certificates to the participants, appreciated the efforts of the college in teaching the art of cooking to youngsters.Mr. Prasad said preparation of pizzas, cakes, pastries, pancakes, Swiss rolls, muffins, waffles, home-made chocolates and milk shakes were taught to them.He said all the necessary ingredients were given by the college. Our aim is make children grow independently and confidently. With the modern world throwing up so many challenges it is imperative that the children, both girls and boys, should know the art of cooking.He said next year the college will take up a similar programme for municipal corporation schools in the city."

A visit to Irur, Karai, Kolakanatham, Varagupadi and Ayyalur in the tri-junction of Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur disitricts on Tuesday brought to light different stages of farming activity by onion growers.In Irur, onion cultivators were seen trying hard to plough their fields using a tractor making maximum use of the summer rain realised in the area about a week ago. A farmer, Selvam, said he would raise onion in the fields in course of time.T. Kaliyamurthy of Irur said that he had raised the chinna vengayam the seeds of which he had preserved since last season. The rain though not sufficient, has considerably made the fields wet. Utilising the bore well, I have decided to raise chinna vengayam on 40 cents of my land, he said. He was confident of harvesting 35 bags of onion each of 75 kg.Weeds posed a serious problem to the growth of the crop. In the first phase, the growth of weeds will be controlled. However, it has to be manually cleared during the successive phases, says Tiruvonam, another farmer.At interior villages in Karai and Kolakanatham, farmers were seen clearing weeds, indicating that the 60-day crop had registered adequate growth in about 20 days."

As a result, the State is witnessing a bumper crop which in turn led to a crash in prices.More than 500 farmers of 10 village of my area threw their entire produce on the roads because of low prices. To produce 20 kg onion, a farmer invests more than Rs. 75-85 that includes inputs like fertilisers, water, seed and labour costs. Now, he gets only Rs. 25-30 per 20 kg, Paresh Dhanani, the Congress MLA of Amreli told The Hindu .According to him, more than 1.5 lakh farmers in Amreli and Bhavnagar districts have been affected by the fall in prices. I had planted onion on eight acres. This year, we have bumper yield but no price. I will not recover even a third of my investment. Same is the situation of thousands of farmers across this onion-growing belt of Bhavnagar, said Punjabhai Ahir, a farmer.He added that the government must fix a remunerative price of onion at Rs. 100 per 20 kg. Mr. Dhanani agreed and said, Neither the State nor the Central government has done anything to help the farmers in distress."
