(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5981a5579855b768c1b03a49,Farmer anger rocks Chouhan chair,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170608/jsp/nation/story_155771.jsp,2017-06-08,"Shivraj Singh Chouhan Bhopal, June 7: Shivraj Singh Chouhan appears vulnerable for the first time since becoming Madhya Pradesh chief minister in 2005, and it's his core constituency of farmers that is threatening to become his nemesis. A farmers' agitation that led to six protesters being shot dead by the security forces in the state yesterday seems to have done what the Vyapam scam, involving bribery charges relating to the state exam for professional college courses and government recruitment, failed to do. Many in the state BJP believe that now is the time to push for a change of leadership if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah wish to retain Madhya Pradesh, which goes to the polls in November 2018. Chouhan has survived many crises, including the sinister deaths of many Vyapam witnesses and huge corruption scandals. But anger among farmers is not easy to wish away even for a chief minister who has been winning the top agriculture prize in the country for the past five years. The current agrarian crisis owes not to any natural causes but to bad political and administrative management. This is the second year running that the state has had a bumper onion crop. Throughout May, many farmers were forced to sell their produce at Rs 2 to Rs 3 a kg as the Chouhan government delayed announcing the procurement price, of Rs 8 a kg, till June 5. In Indore, farmers had left truckloads of onions on the streets in protest. According to one estimate, one-third of the state's onion crop has rotted away because of inadequate storage facilities. The otherwise prosperous farmers from the Malwa and Nimar regions went on the rampage five days after launching their protest on June 1, demanding a minimum support price and loan waivers. The demand for loan relief has spread across several north Indian states after the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh fulfilled the BJP's poll promise by announcing a Rs 36,359-crore waiver. Chouhan, confident of his farmer-friendly image, appeared to be taking matters lightly. He avoided the farmers' main demand - a waiver of their Rs 39,000 crore worth of loans. Around the same time, his cabinet cleared the 7th Pay Commission's suggested pay scales for state government employees, putting the exchequer under an additional burden of Rs 4,500 crore. Once the new pay scales are implemented with effect from January 1, 2016, the burden would zoom to Rs 8,000 crore. Some farmer leaders like Shiv Kumar Sharma of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh have been openly asking how the son of a farmer (Chouhan) could be more concerned about government employees than the far larger number of survival-threatened farmers. At a political level, Chouhan went on holding secret negotiations with the Sangh-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh. Two days ago, state BJP chief Nand Kumar Chouhan had announced a felicitation for the leaders of the Kisan Sangh for ""successfully calling off the farmers' agitation"". But other farmer organisations stepped up their agitation. Shiv Kumar Sharma, for instance, was deeply upset that Chouhan had not invited him and other farmer leaders for talks although his organisation has the largest following among the state's farmers.The prices of pulses too have fallen sharply in Madhya Pradesh. While the central government has raised the minimum support price of tur dal from Rs 4,500 to a little over Rs 5,000 a quintal, the state's agencies have failed to procure any significant amount of the produce at the assured price. Many farmers in Madhya Pradesh have sold their tur dal at less than Rs 3,000 a quintal. On Monday, Chouhan had tried to provide succour to onion farmers, offering to procure the crop at Rs 8 a kg till June 30, and announced a farm price stabilisation fund with a Rs 1,000-crore corpus. Chouhan also acknowledged that the state had witnessed a bumper production of tur dal and promised to buy the produce for the minimum support price. He further promised to allow 50 per cent of the transactions at the state's 750 mandis to be carried out through cash and the rest through bank operations. Since the demonetisation last November 8, cash transactions had fallen by 70 per cent at the mandis because of the liquidity crunch, causing hardship to the farmers. But Tuesday's conflagration, which led to the deaths, showed what the farmers thought of the sops."

The BJP general secretary gets points for resilience, considering how badly his recent defence of the ban went. He posted on Facebook a cropped image of cattle slaughtered elsewhere, to condemn Keralas beef festival protests.Soon, the original, uncropped photograph was unearthed, with Bangla script on shops in the background. While some websites reported that it was clicked in Uttar Pradesh, Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac identified the image as part of a 2015 series of photographs from Pakistan.Beef, incidentally, has been Surendrans scourge in the past as well. In 2015, he was cornered over a photograph of him supposedly having parottas and beef. He responded that the controversial side-dish was onion curry. No, the trolls havent stopped.R Krishnakumar,ThiruvananthapuramLast judgementRajasthan High Court judge Mahesh Chandra Sharma grabbed nationwide attention last week after he came up with the unique theory that the peacock should be the national bird as it is celibate. Within an hour of passing an order suggesting the Central and state governments to ensure that the cow be declared Indias national animal, he said at a media interaction, Peahens become pregnant by swallowing the tears of the peacock. His comments became viral with Facebook and Twitter users putting up jokes and songs on peacock.There were, however, more interesting statements that were part of his 139 page judgement: 33 crore gods and goddesses reside inside the cow and the animal appeared along with goddess Lakshmi during the churning of the ocean in Hindu mythology; Cow is the only living being which intakes oxygen and emits oxygen and the animal is a hospital in itself. Not surprisingly, this memorable viral order was his last judgement, as Sharma retired last Wednesday.Tabeenah Anjum, JaipurRaiding the richThe recent NIA raids, probing suspected funding of separatist leaders in the Valley, carried out at the residences of some high-profile Kashmiri businessmen in Srinagar created a flutter among the Kashmir Inc. The list of those raided included the whos who of the Valleys rich and famous. The Kashmir Inc said this witch hunting campaign is being launched to hurt our economic interests.As if that was not enough, a business tycoon-turned-PDP minister took a dig at the channels for portraying Kashmir in a negative way; he, however, remains out of danger because of his close proximity to Delhis power corridors. Once upon a time, the J&K Police had raided this business magnates residence on charges of channelling hawala funds to militant organisations through the cover of legitimate businesses.Zulfikar Majid, SrinagarBirthday giftThe BJP has taken strong objection to the Nitish regimes plan to inaugurate the two bridges over Ganga on June 11 as a birthday gift to Lalu Prasad. Lalus son Tejaswi Yadav, who is the Road Construction Minister in Bihar, besides the Deputy CM, had announced that the bridges will be a gift to his father. It will be very unfair to people of Bihar if it so happens. If Tejaswi wants to gift something to his father, he should do so from the property acquired by him, said senior BJP leader Sushil Modi.Arguing that the bridges should be named after Jaya Prakash Narayan (JP), he said, The two bridges (one connecting Ara with Chapra, another connecting Patna with Chapra) should be inaugurated on June 5, instead of on Lalus birthday. He reasoned that it was on June 5, 1975 that JP launched Sampoorna Kranti (total revolution) against the Indira Gandhi regime, and hence it has a historical significance. Nitish has, meanwhile, maintained a studied silence on the issue.Abhay Kumar, PatnaUnhappy RahulThe controversy over suspected impropriety and benami transactions in sand mining action by a powerful Punjab cabinet minister has left Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi miffed, it is learnt. In a meeting in New Delhi last week, Rahul is learnt to have conveyed to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder that the image of the party was being dented by the raging buzz surrounding power minister Rana Gurjit Singh.Singhs former employees, including his cook, with meager salaries, bid and bagged sand mines in Punjab worth nearly Rs 50 crore. Though Capt is under pressure to act against his cabinet colleague, he has managed to put off the issue, at least for now, saying he will wait until the outcome of the judicial probe ordered against Rana Gurjit.Gautam Dheer, Chandigarh"

These directives were issued today by Chief Minister while interacting with the district collectors through video-conferencing,"" a public relations department officer said.CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan also told the district collectors to increase the purchase centres according to requirement and based on the arrival of onion.Chouhan also made it clear that there is no limit to the purchase of onions or other produce.""Chouhan told collectors to procure the entire onion stock being brought by farmers,"" the official said. Earlier, in a bid to mollify agitating farmers, the state government had started procuring the onion at Rs eight per kilogram last week.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had made announcements about onion procurement on June 4 following his meeting with representatives of agitating farmers at Ujjain.The Chief Minister, who went on an indefinite fast to calm frayed tempers of the farmers demanding a loan waiver and remunerative prices for their produce, had also announced a slew of schemes for their benefit.Before ending his 28-hour-long fast yesterday, Chouhan announced a series of measures for farmers including that purchase of farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP) was a criminal act.Chouhan had also announced to seek prior consent of farmers before acquisition of agricultural land, establishing 'Kisan Bazaar' (farmers' market) in all municipal bodies, adopting system of Amul Dairy Cooperatives to purchase milk, setting up a Rs 1,000-crore price stabilisation fund to purchase the farm produce at the MSP besides establishing a Agricultural Costs Marketing Commission to ensure better prices of the farm produce compared to the cost of crops.The farmers' protest, which began on June 1, took a violent turn on June 6, when five persons were killed in police firing at Mandsaur.The farmers' protest witnessed bandh and arson as the agitation spread in other districts of Madhya Pradesh."
5a00cc4d9855b76bf13a48ee,Address it fast,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/626785/address-fast.html,2017-08-06,"Address it fastSudhirendar Sharma, Aug 8 2017, 9:26 ISTFrom being thrown on the streets in Mandsaur to being protected by the police in Mumbai in the past few weeks, tomato has turned out to be the truly red-faced farm commodity in last few weeks.Tomato has joined onion and pulses as the latest victim of price fluctuations that has left farmers and consumers fuming. While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

But after the centre banned the sale of poppy husk from April 2016, the entire licensing process was scrapped.But since the demand for poppy husk is still there the smugglers make small packets, which is easier to conceal and are transporting it and selling it all over the state, said Neemuch SP Tusharkant Vidyarthi.This trend came to light when Neemuch police caught two persons from Punjab who were carrying 3.15 quintal of poppy husk in a truck, packed in sacks containing onions. We have arrested Baldev Singh (43) resident of Bandiya Banur, district Banur and Ved Prakash (35) resident of Surajgarh, Patiala, Punjab, and seized the truck (PB11-BU-8315) in which they were carrying the product, the SP said, adding that the poppy husk would be worth around Rs 10 lakh in the open market.The poppy husk was concealed in onion sacks to camouflage its smell. Also since Madhya Pradesh is a major onion producer and exporter, it is quite normal for trucks carrying onion going to Punjab.Police sources said that they had received information that a consignment of poppy husk was being smuggled from Madhya Pradesh via Rajasthan to Punjab and so they kept tabs on the vehicular movement and started checking vehicles at the Nayagaon border checkpost and found the truck filled with doda chura.During questioning the two accused told police that Amzad (29) son of Noor Mohammad Mev resident of Fathegarh police station had supplied the poppy husk to them, which he had brought in his car. Amzad has also been made an accused in the case, police said."

People did not prefer to buy it even at `22 a kg. Traders also suffered loss as around 30 per cent of the stock got damaged, he said.A couple of days ago Food Supply and Consumer Welfare Minister Surya Narayan Patro had expected a fall in price owing to arrival of at least 25 truckloads of onions from both AP and Maharashtra.As AP onions have no demand in the State, Nashik is the only choice from where we can procure the commodity. We are procuring two sizes of onion - small and big which are pegged at `1800 and `2200 per quintal respectively.

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem. It has been the Senas long-standing demand that there should be complete loan waiver for farmers, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0116579855b76bf13a6c53,KKM faces ire of farmers for not taking them into confidence,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/kkm-faces-ire-of-farmers-for-not-taking-them-into-confidence-4687814/,2017-06-03,"ALTHOUGH Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday morning announced that the farmers strike has been called off, it seemed to have little effect on the striking farmers in Maharashtra, who later in the day declared their intention to continue with the strike.Saturday proved to be a day of intense politicking, which saw the core committee members of Kisan Kranti Morcha, the umbrella organisation that spearheaded the movement, being ousted for not taking farmers into confidence before calling off the strike.Post-Saturday, the nerve centre of the movement seem to have moved from Puntambe in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar to the neighbouring Nashik district.Loan waivers, implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about prices of agri-commodities and increase in the procurement price of milk have been some of the main demands which sparked the farmers strike.Since June 1, farmers have stopped movement of vegetables and milk which has squeezed supplies to the wholesale markets across the state. Dhananjay Jadhav, Dhananjay Dhorde, Sandeep Gidde, Kamal Sawant and Shantaram Kunjir formed the core committee of Kisan Kranti who were empowered to talk with the state government on behalf of the farmers.Since the last few months, villages across Maharashtra had seen Gram Sabhas passing resolutions to participate in the strike which would also translate into farmers refraining from agriculture. The movement had also called for a Maharashtra wide bandh barring Mumbai on Monday. Due to the strike, prices of vegetables spiralled and milk procurement has been hit.R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCCMMF) which markets dairy and dairy products under the brand Amul, said procurement in Maharashtra has been severely hit.Milk carrying vehicles to Mumbai are being transported under police protection from Gujarat. As the strike entered its second day, the core committee had left for Mumbai late Friday night to meet the chief minister. After a marathon meeting, Fadnavis along with the core committee members except Dhorde had called off the strike early on Saturday morning. Gidde who spoke to The Indian Express early on Saturday morning said around 70 per cent of their demands including loan waivers to marginal farmers, passing of a legislation to penalise traders trading under Minimum Support Price (MSP) were agreed upon by the government. In view of this, we decided to the call off the strike, he said.However, the decision did not go down well with farmers who claimed they were not consulted by the core committee before taking the decision. As the day progressed, the core committee members started becoming the target of attack by farmers at various districts who were clearly not happy with the decision. By evening, committees in various districts announced that the strike would continue with farmers in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Western Maharashtra, Vidarbha joining in. As the anger among farmers spread, the core committee members came under increasing fire and soon all of them were unreachable for comments.Minister of State for Agriculture Sadabhau Khot, who has been the governments face for negotiation, came under severe criticism with farmers burning his effigy in Nashik. Reports have also come in of lathicharge on farmers in parts of Nashik and Ahmednagar.Amruta Pawar, member of the state committee, said the core committee had erred in taking the decision without consulting anyone. Pawar, who hails from Nashik, said that the protesting farmers in Puntambe had decided to oust the core committee and continue with the strike. In Nashik we decided to continue the strike, she said.Pawar said they had contacted leaders of organisations that have supported the strike in Nashik on Sunday to discuss the course of action. This is going to be an open air meeting so everyone can see what is happening, she said.Meanwhile, on Saturday, Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti and farmer leader Raghunath Patil who have considerable clout in Western Maharashtra announced the continuation of the strike. Shetti and Patil have decided to call a meeting on June 8 to discuss the matter.The apparent leaderless farmers strike has come at the back of the Maratha Morcha which saw lakhs thronging the streets. Puntambe, which is in the heart of onion and grapes belt, is just about two hours from Satana where the farmer leader Sharad Joshi had started his public movement for better onion prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Narendra Vaskar Navi Mumbai was among a handful of APMCs where the strike had little impact on Thursday. Narendra VaskarMAJOR Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) shut operations on Thursday after farmers decided to stop supplying their produce as a mark of protest against the government for not acceding to their demand for a crop loan waiver. On the first day of the strike, there were reports of farmers turning violent and clashing with police while trying to stop vegetable-laden vehicles from entering local markets.In Yeola, Nashik district, the state police launched tear gas and fired rubber bullets to disperse a stone-pelting mob. One person and five policemen were injured.The incident took place near Jalal toll booth where protesting farmers reportedly stopped over 100 vehicles carrying vegetables and threw the produce on the road.The mob allegedly first burned down a vehicle over rumours that it was carrying beef. After that, the protesters started searching each vehicle that passed through the stretch and threw items found in those on the road. Some of the protesters also looted vehicles that were carrying oil and ghee, after which the State Reserve Police Force was called in. The mob then pelted the police with stones and five policemen were injured.The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the mob. One youth, 35-year-old Yashwant Jadhav, was injured in police action and five of our men were injured due to stone-pelting by the locals, Nashik S P Ankush Shinde said.Incidents of violence also took place in areas like Niphad in Nashik district and Kopargaon, in Ahmednagar district. In several other incidents across Maharashtra, farmers blocked roads and vandalised vehicles ferrying vegetables.In places like Satara and Shirdi, farmers demanding a Minimum Support Price of Rs 50 per litre of milk threw milk on the streets as a mark of protest.The state-wide protest, however, did not have an immediate impact on major cities like Mumbai, where major APMCs like Vashi operated as usual. But local traders said that the situation is likely to deteriorate from tomorrow as the intensity of the protest increases.We received close to 550-600 vegetable-laden vehicles in the market on Thursday that is close to the normal inflow of produce. However, we are apprehending that things will go bad from Friday as the agitation picks up. The market usually remains closed on Sundays and the city may end up feeling the pinch of the strike from the beginning of the new week, Ashok Shinde, a trader at the Vashi APMC, said.Vegetable vendors at Borivali and Ville Parle (East) markets are worried fearing a rise in supply prices from Friday. Although the supply prices have not increased yet, we apprehend the trouble to start tomorrow with a shortage in supply and rise in prices of vegetables, said Ashok Kumar, a vendor at Borivali market.The Vile Parle (East) market seemed more affected, with supply prices already having increased by Rs 10-15 on Thursday, according to vegetable vendor Ram Vinay. Although the prices have not increased, less vegetables were supplied to us.On Friday, the supply will be even less, said Ghanshyam Kandu, another vendor.In Nashik district, all 12 APMCs remained empty with farmers refraining from bringing their produce to the market. Nashik supplies a bulk of the fresh vegetables that come to Mumbai. The total turnover of these 12 APMCs is around Rs 23 crore per day, which came to a grinding halt. The APMC remained open but hardly any farmer came in with their produce, said Vilas Shinde, a trader from Nashik APMC.In Ahmednagar district, there were reports of milk and vegetables being thrown on the streets by farmers. In Pune APMC, too, supply of vegetables was affected. We generally get 1,100 vehicles in the market every day. On Thursday, we received only 725. The number will go down. Prices shot up by 10-20 per cent in the market and it will go on if the condition prevails, Vilas Bhujbal, a trader in Pune APMC, said.Farmers have stopped sending their produce to markets across the state as part of a protest to seek loan waiver from the state government.Some of the major demands of the farmers are that the state should clear the 7/12 extracts that are property documents of farmers from all liabilities.The farmers are seeking interest-free loans, a pension scheme for farmers over 60 years, uninterrupted power supply and a minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre of milk.Nearly 99 per cent of the farmers from our village did not send their produce to the markets. This is a do-or-die situation for us. We do not get proper price for our produce. We have a situation where onion gets sold at Rs 2 per kg. How can the farmers afford to sell at this price? Going on strike hurts us financially but we hope that this temporary hardship will provide us long term relief, Zakir Mulani, a farmer from Akluj in Solapur district, said.As tonnes of perishable goods like vegetables and milk were on the line, some farmers found ingenious ways of preserving their produce to use them once the strike ends. Some farmers in Ahmednagar turned their milk into khoya and basundi for future use. Big land owners in Nashik district opened up their cold storage units for stocking up the produce of local farmers.Although there was solidarity amongst the farmers and traders, instances of protesting farmers been beaten up by the public were reported.In Aurangabad, APMC farmers who were trying to implement the strike were assaulted by local traders opposed to the move. Around 20 per cent farmers did not take part in the strike and brought their produce to the market. We were requesting them not to do so when we were assaulted by local traders, Jayaji Suryavanshi, an activist from Aurangabad said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI Photo) Ahmednagar: Farmers spilling milk on the road during their state-wide strike over various demands at a village in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra on Thursday. (Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution.

A few months back, the state government had formed a special committee to study possible electoral reforms in wholesale markets.In what is seen as the phase two of market reforms, the state government has decided to from a special committee to give suggestions for the formation of a new board of directors of Mumbai wholesale market. The committee, headed by marketing director Sunil Pawar, has been asked to submit its report in a months time.The trade in agricultural commodities in the terminal wholesale market of Vashi in Navi Mumbai is carried out mostly between traders. With an annual turnover of around Rs 18-20,000 crore, the market sees the arrival of agricultural commodities from across the state as well from other parts of the country. Vashi market is one of the few markets whose catchment area has little or no agricultural activities.Subhash Mane, the then marketing director, had suspended the board of director of Vashi market on charges of corruption in 2014. At present, a board of administrator is running the market and talks are on for appointing an IAS officer as the chairman of the market. Other than Pawar, the new committee has representatives from Solapur and the deputy secretary of the Mumbai market.Wholesale markets, which have been traditionally controlled by either the NCP or the Congress, has been on the radar of the Devendra Fadnavis government. Delisting of fruits and vegetables and changing the manner of election of directors for the market committees have been two major reforms carried out by the present government. Traders in the Mumbai market were at the forefront of the protest against delisting of fruits and vegetables last year.Earlier this year, the state government had given in-principle nod to allow for elections of directors from gram panchyats in the catchment areas of the wholesale markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the onion and potato traders and commission agents union, said the new body should ensure the directors should know about the functioning of the markets. The committee should be balanced and work without political interference, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

The figure was 3.85 per cent in April.The prices of potato, onion and pulses fell for the third consecutive month due to supply glut, according to wholesale price index (WPI) data released by the commerce ministry on Wednesday.The fall in prices of basic vegetables and pulses was reflected in primary articles, which accounts for a fifth of the entire WPI to -1.79 per cent in May against 4.38 per cent last year.It needs to be mentioned that the weightage of primary articles has been increased to 22.6 per cent with the new base year (2011-12 instead of 2004-05), against 20.12 per cent earlier.The change was done to capture structural changes in the economy and improve the quality, coverage and representatives of indices. Since August 2015, both consumer price index and WPI are converging towards each other.SBI Research in its earlier reports had mentioned that in the coming months, both CPI and WPI would perfectly converge. This has become true as the difference between CPI and WPI plunged to zero in May 2017, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI said in a statement.According to FICCI president Pankaj Patel, there is a case for supporting growth. We hope RBI will take a relook into its monetary policy stance in the light of these new numbers.Potato prices fell by minus 44.36 per cent in May against 83.98 per cent jump last year. Pulses were down 19.73 per cent against a growth of 31.23 per cent last year.Some abatement in the prices of pulses, vegetables, potato, and onion through policy measures is appreciated. Policy makers should check and address the prices of products, which are still at higher levels and are of national importance including cereals, paddy and milk, said Sandeep Jajodia, president of Assocham."
