(Express photo) Farmers from Haryana protesting at the NH 1. (Express photo)Demanding waiver of farm loans, farmers from Haryana have blocked the Delhi-Chandigarh highway (NH1) near Ambala. All routes to and from the blockade have been diverted. The farmers also demand implementation of the Swaminathan report.The 2006 M S Swaminathan Commission report had suggested detailed, sweeping reforms to address agrarian distress: from ensuring better credit and insurance to marketing to better access to technology; steps to promote land reforms and productivity to food security and employment.The protest in Haryana comes days after Madhya Pradesh saw similar agitations demanding better prices for farm produce and waiver of farm loans. On June 6, however, violence broke out in the state following clashes between farmers and the police following the latter firing rounds on demonstrating farmers.Paramilitary forces were called in to quell the aggravating situation. Six farmers were killed in the district following police firing in a span of just three days. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced a slew of schemes aimed to benefit farmers. We are going to buy farm produce and give profitable prices for it. We have already bought a huge quantity of onions at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg. Each onion of farmers will be bought We are going to buy different varieties of pulses at MSP, Chouhan was quoted as saying by PTI.Chouhan also went on a fast in June 10 in Bhopals Dussehra Maidan to appeal for peace.On June 16, Chouhan visited Mandsaur district and met the families of the deceased farmers. Chouhan, who visited Badwan village along with his wife Sadhna, met Ghanshyam Dhakads family and handed them a cheque of Rs 1 crore, as he had promised. He also that action will be taken against the quilty.On Thursday, news reports had surfaced saying farmers in eight cities of Rajasthan began a sit-in protest demanding farm loan waivers. Farmers had also demanded an increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP), special sessions be held in the state assembly for their plight to be addressed, agrarian policies focussing on farmers interests to be brought about and pending irrigation projects to be cleared, news agency IANS reported.Farmers in hundreds are sitting across the state at divisional headquarters in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Ajmer, Kota, Bikaner, Bharatpur and Sikar. We want the government to listen and do something for welfare of farmers, BN Chaudhary, a Bhartiya Kisan Sangh functionary, was quoted by IANS as saying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

And this time, it is from farmers of a body backed by the RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh on Thursday started indefinite protests across the state including a sit-in right in the heart of the capital Jaipur with a long list of demands including a loan waiver.The move was triggered by the Vasundhara Raje Scindia government's refusal to buy mustard at a minimum support price (MSP), or a floor price. Prices of mustard in Rajasthan, the country's largest producer of mustard, plunged after a bumper crop.This forced farmers to sell their harvest cheap to private players. It is estimated that the farmers would have got around Rs 37 for every kg if the government had procured mustard. Instead, farmers are forced to sell the oilseeds about 30 per cent cheaper, for about Rs 26 to 28 a kg.Kailash Gandoliya of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh insists that their protests had nothing to do with politics, the Congress or the ruling BJP.""For two years, we have been facing drought. Now that we have a good mustard crop, the rates went below the minimum support price. We asked the government to buy at the support price but they did not pick up a single quintal,"" he said.The RSS' farmers' body also wants a special session of the assembly to discuss the agricultural distress and implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report set up by the Centre that said farmers should get a return of at least 1.5 times over their investment.But farmers say they weren't even able to recover their investments.Phool Chand Verma is one of them; he has an outstanding farm loan of Rs 1.2 lakh that he had taken for his 3-hectare plot of land. For every kilogramme of onion that he produced this season, Mr Verma told NDTV, he had invested Rs 6. ""But in the mandi (farm produce markets), I am getting Rs 2 a kilo,"" says Phool Chand.The farmers are demanding a loan waiver but insist that the government should take long-term measures to pull them out of agricultural distress for good. It is estimated that the number of people engaged in farming in Rajasthan has shrunk by 30 per cent over the last two decades.""Loan waivers are not a solution. For how many years will the government waive loans? Actually the government should assure a good rate for farm produce so that we can make a profit. That is the only way to stop farmers from getting poorer each year,"" said Kamli Khan, a farmer from Sikar 100 km from the state capital said.With the Sangh affiliate joining the protests, the state government is worried.Agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the government would look into the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh's demands. ""They are part of our family... Whatever can be resolved at the level of the state government, we will address,"" he said.But it isn't going to be easy. In the last four years, the government says it given 53,000 crores in interest free loans. If it were to buy mustard at the floor price, it would have needed 500 crores more."

Farmers are worried about their onion as well as for cultivating new crop. As of now, we have just stored onion at Jan Shiksha Kendras.

The tradition dates back to 349 AD.Shweta Pai, a professional textile designer says, The shibori art follows the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi. The beauty of shibori is to experiment with colours and its effect on fabric .Various colour extracts can be obtained from natural sources such as onion peels, used coffee, tea powder and flowers such as marigold and hibiscus. These materials are soaked in boiling water from which the colour is extracted. The fabric (silk, cotton, hemp or similar fabrics) is dipped in the extracted colour and various techniques are applied to obtain naturally occurring and unexpected patterns. Various techniques such as binding, stitching, pole wrapping, clamping and folding are used to obtain patterns on the fabric.The traditional textile art of Shibori dyeing is simple to learn and the materials required are easily available and inexpensive.At a workshop held at the Go Native caf in Jayanagar, members experimented with colour extract from the marigold flower on cotton fabric. Simran Monga, a graphic designer says, Everyone here shares a common appreciation towards art of all forms. Such a workshop held on a weekend helps us get away from our daily routine.The workshop was conducted by Shweta Pai who said that people today are increasingly getting disenchanted from traditional art and nature and buying products manufactured in masses. Such a workshop which explores traditional art throws a question at our consumption habits.Go Native is a caf, retail store and a work space for handicrafts located in Jayanagar 5th block.

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He has been standing here for the past three days and he is nowhere near the mandi gates. He is apprehensive that once his onions become soggy and start rotting, the authorities wont buy it. I am hoping to sell the onions at around Rs 50,000; it will help me just pay off my loans, with enough left for by kids school and college fees.With monsoon likely to hit the state within the next two days according to the meteorology department, Sawalias predicament captures the hope and fear that thousands of farmers are facing as they are anxiously waiting their turn in the 65 purchasing centres throughout the state.Some farmers like Naushad Khan (53) from a village in Berasia road got so fed up with the unending wait outside the mandi that he decided to sell his onions directly to the consumers in Gyaraso quarters  which is illegal  at Rs 8 per kg. However, he is being harassed by BMC who often shoo him away and also ask for bribes. I am desperate. I have to sell the onions and go back home. I cannot wait this long as I have to prepare my fields for the Kharif crop.Read more: MP farmer protest: Death toll goes up to 17 after 2 more commit suicideThe lifeline given to farmers of Madhya Pradesh by the governments decision to procure onions at the rate of 8 per kilogram might have given it a breather from the ongoing farmers agitation, but the actual relief to farmers still remains to be seen.Though officials are not saying it loud but rotten onion wont be purchased. Says P C Meena, agriculture production commissioner, This is for you to understand. Who will buy rotten onions? But the onions we have purchased are our responsibility.But one thing is certain - the government is staring at an estimated loss of between Rs 500- 600 crores, according to those familiar with the development in the onion front, thanks to the lack of expertise by the procuring, storing and distributing agencies.An official who did not want to be quoted said if we add the transportation cost of Rs 8 to 10 per kg, the cost of per kg of onion comes at Rs 18, and we are going to sell it at Rs 2, a clear loss of Rs 16 per kg.Markfed, the onion procuring agency, managing director Dnyaneshwar Patil said that so far they have procured 3.6 lakh metric tonne, but they estimate that this figure will go up to at least 5 or even 6 lakh metric tonne. But that is still only 15 to 20% of the estimated bumper production of 34 lakh metric tonne this year in Madhya Pradesh.Patil agrees that his agency and neither the State Civil Supplies department which has been given the task of storing, distributing and selling the onions has the expertise either to store or sell a perishable commodity like onion. And distributing it to all corners of the state to be sold through PDS shops at Rs 2 per kg will be a major challenge, he admits.Hitesh Bajpai the chairman of the state civil supplies corporation knows that the government is staring at a huge loss.It would be wrong to say that we are fully prepared. We do not have enough capacity to store the onions which we are purchasing so we are trying to sell them though auction. This year our loss due to wastage might be more than last year when the government purchased onion worth Rs 62.8 crores. Our aim is to minimize this loss, he candidly admits."

The farmers, who were hopeful of reaping profits from surplus production, have been left high and dry in the absence of poor marketing and storage facilities.In Kalahandi district, onion is grown in Bhawanipatna, Kesinga, Narla and Golamunda blocks where farmers sink small chahalas and irrigate the fields through traditional means.According to farmers, the soil here is suitable for growing onion during both rabi and kharif seasons, but due to lack of storage and marketing facilities, the area under coverage is not increasing. The Horticulture department, which plays a major role in introduction of monsoon onion in more areas of the district, it is yet to take any steps in this direction, the farmers alleged. At present, the department is providing demonstration kits to a few farmers and monsoon onion is grown on about 100 acres only.The farmers said opening of bulk storage facilities by the Government and bank patronage can help farmers in saving the crop, besides ensuring profits. Under Horticulture Mission, 20-tonne onion storage facility is available at 50 per cent subsidy. There are, however, few takers for the facility as each storage unit costs `1.75 lakh. The farmers are reluctant to go for it due to poor financial background.Under such circumstances, the farmers are forced to sell most of the products from the farm land itself soon after harvest at throwaway prices.Usually, harvesting is undertaken in April and traders from outside the State procure the produce through their agents at `400 or `500 per quintal. Agents of the traders, particularly from Chhattisgarh, Berhampur, Kolkata as well as Bhubaneswar camp during the harvesting season, procure the stock and sell it later at a higher price.With the local produce already procured, the districts consumers depend on Nashik onion. Wholesalers Tahalram Makhija and Sanjiv Swain said, local onion is available from April till mid June after which Nashik onion is imported through agents at Raipur. Three qualities of onion are sold to retailers at `575, `550 and `475 per 50 kg. The same is sold in Bhawanipatna at around `15 per kg, Swain said."

Now you have to choose the nicer among all the nice shaped, clean, fresh-smelling onions and that is SO DIFFICULT.

BioWares Anthem showcased their pre-alpha gameplay for the new Xbox. Set in a post-apocalyptic world with a jungle-like environment, there are giant monsters with steely exoskeletons, and built-in weather-dynamic events in the high-res game (many are less impressed, calling it a new Destiny game).Another important onion was the Assassins Creed Origins gameplay trailer, which has taken a completely different leap of faith this time round  one that could possibly involve sliding down a pyramid. In Origins, the game seems to have returned to its roots, unadulterated and completely stealth based like it was with Altair. Eagle vision here, is quite literal  the lead character has a pet eagle that does the necessary scouting needed to plan and execute the stealthiest assassinating strategy. Integrating close combat in an open-world with scenic accuracy, AC might just release another great hit without diluting its story.Spider-man is soon to be out for the PS4. Despite it being a mainstream franchise, its hard to look away from the awesome of the Spider-man gameplay  and his superpower seems so conducive for the perfect stealth game! Its easy to forget the various atypical uses of a strong spider web  destroying helicopters and gliding between buildings.Nintendos Metroid game announcement may be important to a few, but then Id miss out on picking the final onion that has zombies in it  Days Gone. After months of speculation, we get a taste of the open-world shooter with a lot of motorbike riding on apocalyptic dirt roads. The game is survival, stealth, close combat zombie killing and evil-human bashing, and bike racing in one.There were many more exciting announcements doubtless, but somewhere at the bottom of the onion pile. Lets hope the announcements have as many layers of depth as the onions."

He stressed upon the need to buy pulses, onion and coarse cereals before the rainy season and assured farmers that their crops will be bought by the Centre and the state government. Paswan assured that the Centre will provide all support to the state government.The western Madhya Pradesh recently witnessed a major farmers agitation for loan waiver and remunerative prices. The protest intensified after the death of five persons in police firing in Mandsaur district on June 6.Besides, the number of debt-ridden farmers who have ended their lives in the state in the last fortnight has reached 22 as yet another debt-burdened peasant has allegedly committed suicide in Chhatarpur.In MP, there is a bumper crop production. The growth of agriculture sector is more than 20 per cent. Whether its fruits and vegetables or foodgrains, there has been a bumper production in the state. This is a reason for happiness for us. But at the same time prices have fallen due to bumper harvest which is a problem for farmers, Chouhan told reporters.The Chief Minister said he has requested the Union food minister to buy pulses through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the state at MSP so that procurement of all crops arriving in the mandies could be procured before rainy season. Chouhan also demanded that the Centre should buy coarse cereals at MSP.Responding to these demands, Paswan said: MP is a state which is producing bumper crop. The state government faces problem because of this as sometimes prices goes below MSP. I have discussed this issue with Agriculture Minister. We are taking steps and will take more to solve this problem.Chouhan said the state government is also procuring onion and pulses. The state has procured 3.2 lakh tonnes of onion out of 32 lakh tonnes production. The Chief Minister complemented the Centre for Aadhaar-seeding of ration cards to eliminate bogus cards.However, he demanded that distribution of foodgrains should be permitted in some genuine cases where there is a problem in verification of beneficiary because of poor internet connectivity or biometrics.The Food Minister has assured me that he will provide all support to the state, Chouhan said. Madhya Pradesh produces about 26-28 lakh tonnes onions annually. It is the second largest producer after Maharashtra.Wholesale prices of onion have fallen sharply below Rs 6 per kg in the state as the crop production during late kharif season of the 2016-17 crop year (July-June) was higher.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(PTI) During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI)How money reached themWhen five protesters died on June 6 in alleged police firing near Mandsaur, the epicentre of the farmers unrest, the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and later doubled it to Rs 10 lakh. But with anger spreading to other parts of the state and the import of its political damage sinking in, by the end of the day, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan announced an unprecedented compensation  Rs 1 crore and a job to a family member of each of the victims.Opposition parties accused the BJP government of bidding over dead bodies and the district collector, since transferred and later suspended, publicly expressed his inability to pay the compensation, saying anything more than Rs 4 lakh was beyond his mandate.A week later, as Chouhan travelled to meet the family members, his secretariat ensured that the money was electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the families. Citing exceptional circumstances, the secretariat sent a note-sheet with the CMs signature to the General Administration Department (GAD) to clear the money. The GAD, in turn, sent a formal sanction letter to the collector, who later transferred the money from the local treasury.Officials in the CMs secretariat said there was no limit to the amount that can be sanctioned under the CMs discretionary fund. By its very definition, its the CMs discretion and the process is not bound by rules. The amount can be Rs 10,000 or Rs 1 crore, a top officer in the secretariat told The Sunday Express.In normal circumstances, the process is rigorous and requires verification.The CM had doled out huge amounts in the past, but that was restricted to players such as P V Sindhu, who got Rs 50 lakh from the discretionary fund after she won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics. Soldiers from the state who die in the line of duty usually get Rs 10 lakh.The BJP high command was reportedly unhappy with the hefty compensation, fearing it could set a precedent. When the sixth death, allegedly in police custody, took place in Mandsaur a few days later, family members and relatives of Ghanshyam Dhakad said they would not cremate his body until they were compensated with Rs 1 crore and a job. Since then, the Congress has demanded that every suicide by farmers be compensated with Rs 1 crore.To put things in perspective, a look at compensation packages announced in the past: On September 13, 2015, the day after an explosion left 80 people dead in Petlawad town, Chief Minister Chouhan announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and a job to a family member. A farmer who was killed in police firing in Bareli, Raisen district, in 2012 got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. The farmers were protesting against the delay in procurement of wheat caused by a shortage of gunny bags. In 1998, when the Congress was in power in the state, more than 19 farmers were killed in police firing in Multai town of Betul district. The victims families got Rs 2 lakh in compensation from the state government and Rs 50,000 from the Prime Ministers fund. The compensation for those who died in the 1984 gas tragedy was hiked to Rs 10 lakh in 2010.Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment. (Photo: Oinam Anand) Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment. (Photo: Oinam Anand)Satyanarayan Dhangar, 30,Lodh villageSurvived by:Parents Mangilal Dhangar and Bhanwari Bai, brothers Kanhaiyalal and Raju, and their wives Nirmala and Manju Bai.Debt: Approximately Rs 4.5 lakh, of which Rs 3 lakh is against a tractor Satyanarayan bought  he paid instalments of about Rs 60,000 every six months; a bank loan of Rs 50,000 under the Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojana to build their house; and Rs 60,000 for the purchase of manure and seed. The family owns five bighas, of which two bighas stand mortgaged for Rs 40,000 (the land deed is shared by the extended family), along with about 300 grams of silver and a gold-plated necklace for Rs 7,000.The Family: Having studied till Class 10, Satyanarayan was the most educated in the family; Kanhaiyalal studied till Class 2 and Raju till Class 5.Satyanarayan used to take care of all the household finances, says Kanhaiyalal, He was charming so he would convince people that he would pay off his debts later. Satyanarayan never married.The brothers, their wives, and the parents occupy a room each. The family grows wheat and alsi (flax) on their land. Last season, they also grew potatoes and peas. When not in the fields, the brothers work as labourers and are said to be good at reinforcing wells.Satyanarayans father, Mangilal Dhangar, prefers to sleep outside. The day The Sunday Express met the family, he was on a cot in the open, crying out in pain. He finally slips off the cot onto the mud floor. As he keeps groaning, the brothers call an ambulance and he is taken away. He was fine until now, says his wife Bhanwari.Whats in the house: Three cots, a ceiling fan, a table fan, lots of utensils and a tractor.That day: He had joined the protests because he was frustrated with falling prices, says brother Raju. Our debts kept rising and the returns from farm kept declining.Rs 1 crore: We will pay off our debt, though the Chief Minister told us he will get it all waived, says Raju. Some money might also be used for their fathers treatment. With the rest, they plan to buy some land.Its worth: Over 22 times their total debt.He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand) He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand)Kanhaiyalal Patidar, 44,Chillod Piplya villageSurvided by: Wife Sumitra, daughter Puja and son Jitendra.Debt: None, says wife Sumitra. He bought seeds and manure with help from the cooperative society. The interest on the societys loan is zero per cent for the first year and seven per cent from then on, so he avoided the interest, says wife Sumitra.The Family: Kanhaiyalal lived with his wife and children in a small, two-storey unplastered and unfurnished house, next to the homes of his two brothers, Jagdish and Ganpat, and other relatives.Like each of his brothers, Kanhaiyalal owned six bighas, on which he grew wheat, soybean and garlic. With the rate of wheat hovering between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 a quintal, and that of garlic between Rs 800 and Rs 2,000 a quintal, each of us made only around Rs 30,000 last year, says Jagdish. Kanhaiyalal also had a cow and a buffalo and sold some of the milk. Milk sells for Rs 20-22 a litre, the price of water, says his mother, Debu Bai. The brothers also worked as daily-wage labourers.Whats in the house: Of the two rooms in the house, one is on the ground floor, and the other on the roof, which doubles up as a kitchen. There is a storehouse which has a few sacks of produce, an agricultural weighing machine and Kanhaiyalals motorcycle.That day: Kharcha nahi baith raha tha (Expenses exceeded our earnings), says Sumitra. Isiliye andolan mein gaye thhe (Thats why he joined the protest).The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the bank accounts of Sumitra and the children. Bank officials have told us that we cannot withdraw money from the childrens accounts yet and need permission from the bade sahab (big boss), says Laxmi Narayan, Sumitras father. The children say they are inspired by a relative, a doctor uncle in Ratlam, and want to be doctors too. While daughter Puja managed 50 per cent in Class 10, son Jitendra scored 70 per cent in Class 7.Sumitra says the childrens share of money will be saved as fixed deposits. Kanhaiyalals brothers also indicate they will be given some money to continue farming on his land. We will hire labourers to till his fields. All of us will also move to a better place within this village, says Jagdish. Then there are the villagers who have donated to set up a bust of martyr Kanhaiyalal in the middle of the village.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore is 625 times Pujas annual school fee of Rs 16,000, which Kanhaiyalal could not afford; his father-in-law, Laxmi Narayan, would pay the childs fee. Kanhaiyalal took care of his sons education, which cost him Rs 12,000 a year. Masterji in school told me I wont be allowed to take my exams if I didnt pay the fee. My father always somehow paid, says son Jitendra.The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand) The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand)Ghanshyam Salitra, 30,Badwan villageSurvived by: Wife Rekha Bai, four-year-old son Rudra, month-old daughter Himanshi, father Durgalal Dhakad, sister Shamu BaiDebt: The family owes Rs 3 lakh to two banks and another Rs 2 lakh to a cooperative society. The loan goes back years. Almost all of it was to buy seeds, manure, pay for labour, hire machines, says father Durgalal.The Family: Ghanshyam never saw his daughter Himanshi. He was at the protest site on June 8, when his wife, Rekha, returned from her maternal home, where she had delivered her daughter. He left hours before I arrived, she says. His four-year-old son Rudra jumps around the house before coming back to play with his sister.Ghanshyam had enrolled Rudra in a private English-medium school, where the annual fee is Rs 10,000, says Ghanshyams wife Rekha.The family owns four bighas on which they grow wheat, garlic and fenugreek. Soon after Ghanshyams Class 12, he started working in their fields. The chief minister came and assured me Rs 1 crore. I told him to bring back my husband. I asked him who will take care of my children. He said the government would bear all their education expenses and give me a job, says Rekha.They killed my only son, says Durgalal.Whats in the house: A bedroom, another for the produce, and a third that doubles up as a kitchen and temple. Two cows, two buffaloes, a bull and a calf, and a dog, Kalu, in a fenced enclosure. Also, three fans and a television.That day: He and other men from the village were protesting and chanting Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! when police caned them. He tried to run but got stuck in the fence. Police took him to the station. I later came to know they hit him on his head and throat till he fell down, Durgalal says. They came home around 3.30 that night and claimed he was injured. They told us to reach the police station at 9 am, but by then they had taken him to a hospital in Indore. By the time my father-in-law got there, he was dead, Rekha says.The Rs 1 crore: Our father went to Mandsaur to open accounts in the name of the children, says Ghanshyams sister Shamu. Some money has been transferred into the accounts but we dont know how much.Its worth: Zero. This crore is not worth my husband, says Rekha.Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand) Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand)Abhishek Dinesh, 18Barkheda Panth villageSurvived by: Parents Dinesh and Alka Bai, brothers Madhusudan and Sandeep, grandparents Bhanwar Lal and Lakshmi BaiDebt: None. But this January, the family sold off 6 of their 29.5 bighas to cushion their expenses.The Family: Most mornings, Abhishek would assist in the fields before leaving for school around 11 am. He would then return to the farm by 5 pm, finally getting home late in the evening. He would also skip schools when there was a lot of work at the farm, says brother Madhusudan.In the just declared results of Class 11, Abhishek had scored 47.2 per cent. He wanted to do an agriculture course once he was done with school, says Sandeep, who is enrolled in a BBA course.The family grows soybean, wheat, bajra, corn, lentils. Over the past four to five years, the price of soybean has halved from around Rs 5,000 a quintal to around Rs 2,500 now. We also sold 52 quintals of onion for Rs 6,500 at Rs 1.25 per kg. How can a household run like this? asks father Dinesh.Whats in the house: There are logs of sal, about 1.5 feet in width, overhead, going across the roof of the rooms. Above them are bamboo poles, which hold a bamboo mat and the mud roof. Thats how the roof has been in this house since 1957, when we built it, says Abhisheks grandfather Bhanwar Lal, in his early 90s. The house has four rooms and a large hall which was renovated about three years ago, apart from a kitchen.That day: He had gone to the protests as he was curious others from the village were also going, says mother Alka Bai. Everyone goes to protest if the cause is genuine, adds grandfather Bhanwar Lal.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the accounts of Abhisheks parents. They first plan to buy back the land they sold earlier this year. They also want to buy more property and reinforce their well. Brother Sandeep will get the government job. Relatives have also been turning up frequently. I learnt of Abhisheks death today (a week after the incident) and came running, says Ramesh Chand Patidar, a relative.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore can cultivate their 23 bighas nearly 72 times over. It takes Rs 6,000 roughly to cultivate a bigha of land, says Dinesh.Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand) Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand)Poonamchand Patidar alias Babloo, 23Takrawad villageSurvived by: Wife Anita, mother Durga Bai and sister GirijaDebt: Rs 4 lakh in unpaid home loans and about a couple of lakh more in agricultural dues for labour, seed and manure purchase, and tractor rent, among others. The family also paid Rs 50,000 for a hysterectomy operation that Babloos mother had over a month ago.The Family: With their savings and some loans, Babloos father Jagdish Ram and uncle Bala Ram built the two-storey house that Babloo lived in with wife Anita, mother Durga Bai, uncle Bala Ram and cousin Dasrath. His father had passed away in January last year, after which he dropped out of college and married Anita. The house, with eight rooms, was built two years ago, when the family enjoyed better times.Babloo inherited his fathers eight bigha on which he grew wheat, coriander, garlic and chickpeas. He also helped out on his uncles farm. We sold a quintal each of wheat for Rs 1,100, coriander for Rs 4,000, fenugreek for Rs 1,500 and garlic for Rs 3,000. Over a year ago, the rates were Rs 2,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000, says Bala Ram, who too owns eight bighas. So while he spent Rs 96,000 on the farm, he made only about Rs 60,000 last year, he adds. Moreover, the cheques against payments take over a month to be cleared, says cousin Dasrath. When not in the fields, Babloo used to repair vehicles, especially vans, to make ends meet.Whats in the house: The house is mostly empty. A crib dangles in the middle of one of the rooms.That day: Around 150 youth from our village went to protest. Police shot at a few of them from close range. He was among those hit. Villagers told us police shot him on the road. The villagers rushed him to a hospital in Mandsaur on a motorcycle but he died on the way, says Babloos uncle Bala Ram.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred to a joint account opened in the names of Babloos mother and wife. The heavy dose of drugs after her operation has left Babloos mother with mental troubles, says Bala Ram. Babloos wife Anita has left for her maternal home and will return soon, he says. Sister Girija Bai too shows little interest in money matters and so, it for Bala Ram and his son Dasrath to decide. We still get notices from the bank. So we will pay that off first, says Dasrath, who dropped out of school after Class X and will get the government job.Then there are the relatives, who have not left the home since Babloos death. Will we get money? And when? Everyone only comes and takes down our names, says Babloos aunt Lakshmi. His mother Durga Bai sits expressionless.Its worth: The compensation money is 200 times the cost of his mothers operation.He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand) He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand)Chainaram Patidar, 23Nayakheda villageSurvived by: Wife Pushpa, parents Ganpat Lal and Manju Bai, younger brother Govind, sister PavitraDebt: Only Chainaram kept a record of the expenses, so the family has little idea if they had any loans, though they say he used to borrow from the cooperative society. If there is any debt, they dont know about it as no one has approached them yet.The Family: Chainarams two-room house is one of about a dozen small houses  mostly of his uncles and cousins  that lie on either side of a narrow lane within Nayakheda village.The family owns two bighas on which they grow wheat and soybean. When not on the fields, Chainaram would, like his daily-wager father, go looking for work.Keen on joining the Army, as a couple of village youths are in the forces, Chainaram began applying around five years ago, after he turned 18. He had good height and could run quite a bit. He cleared the physical test thrice but would always be ruled out in the medical tests; his left eye was weak, says father Ganpat, 43. On April 29 this year, Chainaram married Pushpa. She is still dazed and barely speaks.Whats in the house: A cooking stove and gas cylinder, an earthen pot and utensils. The family sleeps on the floor under the only ceiling fan in the house, which has to be prodded with a stick for it to start rotating.That day: The family says he had gone to the protest, but just to look. Villagers said he had been hit on his leg. It was only the next day that we were told he was hit on his head, says sister Pavitra.The Rs 1 crore: The money will be divided among 4-5 people, says Ganpat. There are Ganpats brothers  Rameshwar, Balu Ram, Paras Ram  and his cousins, all of whom, he says, will receive a share of the crore. Also, neighbours Mangilal, 61, and Phool Chand, 72, who have lent a shoulder. But Ganpat doesnt know how it will be divided. I am uneducated. Chainarams uncle Bharat does all the work, he has all the documents. We will all sit and divide the money soon, he says.Its worth: The compensation is 376 times the value of his familys wheat production. Last year, they produced 19 quintals of wheat and sold half of it for Rs 1,400 a quintal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

There are a few unresolved issues, which will be discussed and sorted later. Also, the government must address the others demands made by the farmers without wasting time, Pawar.The NCP chief insisted that the BJP government must implement recommendations of Swaminathan Commission to rid farmers across India of their financial woes.The BJP had promised this in its election manifesto, while Narendra Modi had assured it in all his election rallies, Pawar said.Pointing out that it has been two years since the state formed an Agriculture Price Commission, Pawar said the commission will ensure implementation of minimum support price to farmers.He also drew attention to the plight of onion and tur farmers across Maharashtra. Pawar said onion farmers were facing hardships as the price bottomed because of a bumper crop, while the government had stopped purchasing tur.We need to export both the items and farmers needed financial assistance to do so. The decision to waive farm loan will backfire if the state fails to address this issue in time, he said.BOXSymbolic electionSharad Pawar described the upcoming election between NDA nominee Ramnath Kovind and Opposition nominee Meira Kumar as symbolic. He said the electoral arithmetic was in favour of the NDA candidate and the outcome was a forgone conclusion. But it is democracy and we need to fight the election, he added. Pawar also clarified that he was never interested in the post."
5a03e5d29855b76bf13baf32,Five hundred greens to comfort her after a tiring day,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jun/28/five-hundred-greens-to-comfort-her-after-a-tiring-day-1621517.html,2017-06-28,"CHENNAI: When her son Teja was ten, Yashoda Prasad had to make a tough choice  give space for him to play on the terrace or grow more plants. But luckily she had passed on her green genes and he happily gave up his play area for more plants. ""In fact, he was the one who tended to the plants,"" recalls Yashoda.Yashodas grandparents are into agriculture, so it wasn't too surprising that this Higher Grade Assistant in Life Insurance Corporation of India at Hyderabad took to gardening like a fish takes to water. Her favourite colour is green and her special hangout spot is her garden in her two-storeyed home at ECIL crossroads.Although as a child she kept moving towns and shifting homes owing to her dad's transferable job, her bond with plants remained unchanged.It has been five years since they moved to ECIL, and she is happy that she has her own independent home where she can plant all that she wants. Her teenage kids Navya and Teja and her husband Prasad also lend a helping hand.She credits her family and the Facebook group called Intipanta for helping her stay green. The Facebook group, she says, is a support group that suggests techniques for house gardening, watering and maintenance.Her terrace is a verdant space, with a wooden plank that supports climbing creepers and hanging pots. Softdrink bottles and plastic takeaway containers that typically end up as garbage in most houses get a dash of paint and become little homes for plants. The sweet smell of flowers mingles with the fragrance from a lighted agarbathi after the morning puja, instantly transporting you into a different natural world.The terrace hosts various plants such as crotons, cactii, vegetables and leafy vegetables.Through Intipanta, an initiative of the horticulture society, Yashoda has received seeds from gardeners in other states. Rita Borgali from Ludhiana sent me the seeds of pink lillies, Preethi from Bengaluru sent cactus varieties and Shridhar Thillai Rajan sent jasmine from Kerala, says Yashoda.She has over 500 plants in her garden. Roses, hibiscus and chrysanthemums in multiple colours take your breath away. Her garden also boasts of bittergourd, cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, cabbage, cauliflower, ginger, onion plants and almost all the leafy vegetables, so that she does not have to visit the grocery store often. Every alternate day, her family members take turns to water the plants. Sundays are all about cleaning it inside out and easily consumes half a day.With the whole garden spread across the penthouse and roof, it is tough to maintain it especially when it rains heavily through the monsoon. However, I collect water and protect them from the insects I never use artificial pesticides. Instead I use kitchen waste, butter milk, neem oil, wood ash and so on, which works as a great natural manure, she says. When she comes back home after work and puts her feet up with a cup of coffee, all the effort seems totally worth it, she says."
5a03e8659855b76bf13bb040,Farm loan waiver:&thinsp;Arun Jaitley offers Maharashtra no immediate financial relief,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farm-loan-waiver-arun-jaitley-offers-maharashtra-no-immediate-financial-relief/story-H2UkTzT5bwwWxYz8BGQHdM.html,2017-06-28,"Even as the state government began the procedure to write off loans of 40 lakh farmers by issuing a government resolution (GR) on Wednesday, how it will generate Rs34,022 crore for it remains a question mark. On Wednesday, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley gave no immediate assurance to state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who called on him on this issue in New Delhi.Mungantiwar sought Jaitleys intervention to direct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow nationalised banks to lend the state government Rs34,000 crore with a staggered repayment schedule over four years so that it can repay farmers loans. He also requested Jaitley to increase the cap on the states open market borrowing by Rs15,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of Rs35,000 crore, putting the state government in a position to raise funds for the waiver.According to information, Jaitley asked Mungantiwar to deal with the RBI for the loans and staggered repayment.The state government will have to deal with the RBI for the loans at a lower rate and their deferred schedule of the repayment. With permission to borrow and additional Rs15,000 crore, we can manage to raise Rs34,000 crore, Mungantiwar told HT.The state plans to shift the old loans that have been borrowed at a high rate of interest of about 10.5% to 7.5% to save about Rs40,000 crore on its outstanding loan of Rs75,000 crore from open market borrowings. The state has also requested the Centre for the waiver of the pre-clousure charges on the payment of the outstanding loans.Mungantiwar also requested Jaitley to extend the permission to export onions by three months to ensure rates in the domestic market do not fall on the backdrop of the bumper crop. Maharashtra farmers have produced 2.05 lakh metric tonnes of onion and the production is 25% more than the average. Similar rise in the production in other parts of the country has resulted in the fall in procurement rate of onion. The extension to the export permission by three months will prove beneficial to farmers in getting good procurement rate. Jaitley has assured us to positively consider the demand, Muntantiwar said.Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday began the procedure to waive off loans by issuing government resolution (GR) notifying the eligibility of the loan waiver. The notification stated farmers who have restructured their loans between April 1, 2012 and 2015-16 and have become defaulters till June 30, 2016 will be eligible for the waiver of up to Rs1.50 lakh per farmer. It has also clarified farmers seeking the benefit of a one-time settlement of their outstanding more than the waiver limit of Rs1.50 lakh, will have to first pay of the remaining amount to seek the benefit.It has reiterated that except Class-IV employees, the families of the government servants, legislators, ex legislators, corporators and the members of cooperative sugar factories, district cooperative banks, cooperative milk unions will not be eligible for the loan waiver. The government has defined the family of farmers as husband, wife and children below 18 years. This means the nuclear families of the farmers will be separately entitled for the waiver.Read more:Farm loan waiver: Maharashtra to seek Centres help to raise 34,022 crore from banksMaharashtra readies game plan for farm loan waiver"

The decision was taken after Union minister Subhash Bhamre, along with state Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, met Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely in Delhi on Wednesday.Onion growers in the state have been witnessing a free fall in prices since the last 15 months.The situation has not improved much, even though the area under rabi onion cultivation has gone down in 2016-17. Compared to the over 3 lakh hectares of farm land during rabi season in 2015-16, the state has seen only 2.5 lakh hectares of rabi onions in 2016-17. But the glut in onion trade has refused to ease out. To help farmers, the state had announced 5 per cent export subsidy. The subsidy was supposed to expire by the end of June. Bhamre, the MP from Dhule Malegaon, a major onion-growing area, had met Jaitely to ask for an increase in export subsidy. Onion growers are hopeful that the extension will help firm up prices.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) Grape farmer Santosh Gorade at his vineyard in Niphad near Nashik, Maharashtra. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)Last kharif, the Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) disbursed Rs 1,608.55 crore of crop loans during April-June, exceeding its target of Rs 1,257.18 crore. This season, however, it has given out a mere Rs 61.41 crore as on June 27, way below even a lower target of Rs 1,101.05 crore.NDCCB could be an extreme case of a beleaguered cooperative bank. But across Maharashtra, total kharif crop loan disbursements by DCCBs have been just Rs 5,707.42 crore from April to June 27 this year. That is barely 55 per cent of the Rs 10,451.77 crore lent out during April-June 2016.The above collapse of cooperative credit is an ongoing story of Maharashtras agriculture, at a time when waiver of past loans is whats grabbing the headlines. And its effects are being felt right now in the fields, as kharif agricultural operations gather pace with the state receiving 13 per cent above-normal monsoon rains so far.For Santosh Garade, between May and the month almost ending, there should have been at least four rounds of pruning (removal of thread-like tendrils growing from the main branches) at his four-acre vineyard. But this grape farmer from Takli village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka hasnt managed to do a single pruning  necessary for the crops proper flowering from September-October, followed by fruit development and harvesting towards February-March.The beleaguered Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) The beleaguered Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)My total investment requirement during May-July, for six rounds of pruning along with application of fertiliser, fungicide and micronutrients, is about Rs 50,000 per acre. I am unable to raise that working capital today from either NDCCB or Bank of Maharashtra. And I have no money of my own left, says Gorade.The 34-year-old suffered huge losses from his 2016-17 grape and onion crops grown on four acres and two acres, respectively. The 70-quintals average yield from onions, which fetched Rs 300 per quintal, did not cover his cultivation cost of Rs 35,000 per acre. Gorades vineyard, likewise, yielded 60 quintals of grapes per acre. At Rs 15/kg, there was no way his investment of Rs 2 lakh per acre could even be recovered, leave alone generate a return.The credit crunch that farmers like Gorade are experiencing  that too, in what looks to be a good monsoon year  comes even as the Maharashtra government has come out with a Rs 34,022-crore loan waiver scheme. The Devendra Fadnavis administrations decision to waive individual farm loans of up to Rs 1.5 lakh taken from cooperative and commercial banks  plus the direction given to extend Rs 10,000 in cash as an immediate advance  does not radically alter the picture.The loan waiver is of no use to me, as I have outstanding dues of Rs 4 lakh with the Bank of Maharashtra, notes Gorade. Nor does a Rs 10,000 cash loan help somebody growing a crop entailing much more investment than bajra (pearl millet) or soyabean. Gorade is, moreover, not eligible to receive this special loan, since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is yet to give the nod for extending it to defaulting farmers.Gorade is planning to mortgage his tractor to obtain credit from private moneylenders. If I am a defaulter with Bank of Maharashtra and the NDCCB has no money to lend, what option does a farmer like me have? My immediate priority is to somehow ensure a decent grape crop and hope for better prices. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, I realised Rs 60-70 per kg, but both were drought years. Last years crop was good, but prices crashed, he adds.In the neighbouring village of Kotamgaon in Niphad, Sanjay More has mortgaged his wifes jewellery to borrow money for sowing soyabean and maize on his two acres. More has an outstanding loan of Rs 70,000 from the NDCCB. The Rs 1.5 lakh waiver should technically make him free from institutional debts. But the problem is that the NDCCB itself has no money to lend now. In the last two years, I have taken loans totalling Rs 1 lakh from moneylenders. I have had to knock at their doors this time as well. The loan waiver has no meaning for me, he points out. Like Gorade, Mores hopes are pinned on a good crop  and better prices.For most Maharashtra farmers, drying up of institutional finance for kharif farming operations is whats really hurting, even while political and media attention is on loan waivers. At the start of every crop season, farmers avail of short-term crop loans from commercial and cooperative banks. These are extended at a subsidised interest rate of 7 per cent interest, and go towards purchase of seed fertiliser and pesticides, and also paying for labour.For the current kharif season, Maharashtra has set a crop loan target of Rs 40,547.20 crore, of which Rs 24,985.01 crore is to come from commercial banks, Rs 13,108.38 crore from DCCBs and the balance Rs 2,453.82 crore from regional rural banks. The cooperatives are the ones that reach out to small and marginal farmers, with their average loan size being much less compared to that of scheduled commercial banks.The current credit crunch is largely about DCCBs  their inability to lend, particularly after demonetisation. Just three days after the November 8 decision to withdraw all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination currency, these banks were barred by the RBI from both accepting and exchanging the outlawed notes. The official reason given was that they did not have fool-proof KYC (know-your-customer) verification systems in place, making them potential avenues for illicit cash deposits.As a result, the DCCBs in Maharashtra alone were saddled with Rs 4,311.79 crore of old notes deposited during the three days, which they couldnt exchange for new re-monetised currency. The NDCCB alone had Rs 342.60 crore of such notes. If we could neither exchange the old notes nor earn interest on those deposits, from where was the money to come for disbursal of fresh crop loans?, asks Narendra Darade, chairman of the bank. The DCCBs were further hit because of farmers not being able to repay loans following the price crash across crops  for which, too, Darade laid the blame on demonetisation. On June 20, the Union government finally announced that cooperative banks would be allowed to exchange the demonetised notes with the RBI. But the latter is yet to issue directions to DCCBs on the modalities of such exchange.The ultimate loser from all this has been the farmer, who suffered from low prices following demonetisation. Now, he is suffering from an unprecedented credit crunch even in a normal monsoon year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

After remaining stable till a few weeks ago, tomato prices rapidly increased at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale markets. Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg. But Rs 80 is too expensive, says Arjun.V, a wholesaler."

When I am not reading my favourite thrillers, I read railway timetables. And since train journeys dont happen as often as they used to, I look forward to my Metro rides.So when I read that the new Heritage Line  to Kashmiri Gate, going through Dilli Gate, Lal Qila and Jama Masjid  had been inaugurated, I decided that I would take the Metro and go visit an old haunt. My destination was Jeha Caterers in Ansari Road, better known as Sardar Ji Puri Wale.I enjoyed the journey, but not the walk it entailed. I had thought the Metro would take me somewhere close to Ansari Road. Instead it went to Asaf Ali Road. I got down there, walked in this terrible heat for what seemed like ages, and then hailed a rickshaw. And then I finally found myself at the old shop which last gave me aloo puri  and immense pleasure  some three or four years ago.The shop is on the main Ansari Road (Address: Shop No G 4 EMCA House, phone no: 9717031008 and 9971808875). There is no sign there, but if you ask around, you will be directed to it. It is a small shop, with an area outside where the puris are prepared and fried in a huge kadhai. You can stand there eat, or have it packed which is what I did.The shop has been there for 66 years, though earlier it was a smaller shack on the other side of the road. When I used to go there, old Sardarji  Nand Singh  was there, supervising the making of the puris and serving the chholey. He is no more, and his son, Harbhajan Singh Kukoo is now in charge.A dash of hingThe place is known for its poori aloo-chholey. I asked for a few plates (Rs. 30 a plate) and for some kadhi chawal (Rs. 30). I enjoyed both immensely. The pakori was soft, had bits of spinach in it and had been tempered with whole coriander and cumin seeds and a few other masalas. A dash of hing added to the taste. The gravy was runny, and not very sour. And what I liked was the fact that it wasnt spicy hot.The aloo-chholey was the way I remembered it  light and tasty. The gravy had small cubes of potatoes in it, and some little urad dal-and-besan strips, which gave a surprising flavour burst. This came with a tangy pumpkin pickle and some onion slices. The puris were delicious, prepared with a mix of atta and maida, and a thin urad-dal paste in it. This is pure Punjabi puri, Kukoo told me.Puris are sold till 12.30 or 1 pm on weekdays, and till 2 pm on Sundays. After that, you can get kachoris or samosas filled with potatoes and peas. They also sell aloo bread pakoras and paneer bread pakoras in the evenings, along with thin, crispy jalebis. In the day time, they have laddoos and gulab jamun.I am sorry to find that many of the old culinary masters  who wielded such a deft karchhi  are not there any more. But what is heartening to know is that the next generation is taking over, expanding while ensuring that the old taste is not tinkered with. Old is gold, but new can be whew!"

While only eight to 10 items could reach the APMC against the regular 94 kitchen staples. Even the quantum of produce halved on Friday , compared to Thursday and Wednesday .Atotal of 43,827 quintals of fruits and vegetables arrived on Friday as against 70,246 quintals on Thursday and 78,272 quintals on Wednesday , shows data from the state's marketing department.Overnight, retail prices of vegetables and fruits doubled in certain localities, partly because wholesale rates rose and retailers chose to take advantage of the situation. Coriander was a stinging Rs 150-200 for a big bunch, prompting several vendors not to stock it.Andheri resident Shyam More said, ""There was no spike in vegetable prices which normally occurs between March to May . But this two-day strike has turned the situation upside down. The fear is milk supplies could be affected in the days to come, which will worsen our predicament."" The Andheri municipal market wore a forlorn look. Greengrocer Iqbal said, ""I sourced merely a few items like cauliflower, cabbage, spinach and green chillies for the day . I did not stock tomato or brinjal as wholesale prices were high and I would suffer losses if there are no customers."" By Friday evening, Iqbal sold cauliflower at his cost price of Rs 50, only to clear his stock.In Matunga, one of the most expensive markets in the city , seller Bhavesh Baarve chose to shut shop for a day .

As per reports, there are a few people, including some former members of kisan sangh who are misguiding farmers to continue their agitation,"" said BJP state chief Nandkumar Singh Chauhan while talking to reporters on Friday. The BJP chief also appealed to the farmers' union and kisan sangh to withdraw their agitation and provide an unhindered supply of essentials.Chauhan without taking name of any leader, said the Congress was taking undue advantage of situation. ""Congress leaders at some places forced farmers to dump their crop and milk on roads,"" he said.""Congress leaders in Indore and Bhopal forced farmers to dump their produce and milk on the road. Farmers were unwilling to waste their crop, but they were not allowed to take their produce to mandis or distribute it to poor families,"" said the BJP head.Farmers in several parts of Madhya Pradesh launched a 10-day-long agitation from Thursday, stopping supply of milk, food grains and vegetables to protest lack of good prices for their farm produce. Protesters had stopped vehicles carrying fruits, vegetables, food grains and emptied milk containers on roads triggering a crisis-like situation for essential commodities.Stressing that BJP-led Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the state left no stone unturned to give farmers their due share, Nandkumar said apart from relief during calamities, the government also provided farmers a justified procurement price and ensured availability of market.""The government distributed more than Rs 4,000 crore as a relief to farmers, provided interest-free loan, subsidised seeds and machinery. They should have at least discussed with the government before taking a drastic step,"" Chauhan said.He said the government last year purchased onion and other perishable produce from farmers to help them financially. The government also announced to build warehouses for storage and establishing food processing units to provide a direct market to farmers, which is under consideration in the government policy to double farmers' income, he said."

As many as 42 cases of looting and violence were registered against the protesters. A group of over 500 stopped a truck carrying onions near Kotru phata at Niphad tehsil on the Nashik-Aurangabad highway on Friday morning and emptied half of the consignment on the road. Milk cans were being spilled on many highways. The local police and the quick response team (QRT) commandos were forced to conduct a lathi charge, following which the farmers dispersed and the road was cleared for the vehicles. Reports have also emerged of instances of violence resulting in the imposition of section 144 in Nashik.Among the cities where APMCs have been forced to shut as farmers continue their strike are Pune, Nashik, Mumbai and Thane. Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest onion supplier in the country has been shut for the last two days. Over 25,000 quintals of onions had arrived in the market yard on May 31.Because there was no transaction in the Lasalgaon market yard on Thursday and Friday , not a single truck of onion was received by the Mumbai APMC.The data provided by Ma harashtra State Market Committee Cooperative Federation (MSMCCF) showed that markets were closed largely in Nashik, Pune and Latur divisions with full support from farmers. President of MSMCCF Dilip Mohite told TOI that the arrivals were just 10-15 per cent and there was a 90 per cent shortage overall. ""The overall shortfall will increase further as the strike intensifies,'said Mohite.

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

Lady finger and cauliflower remained high at Rs 80 while cabbage dropped to Rs 50-60. Cluster beans and french beans were still out of reach at Rs100-120 per kg.Potato and onion remained stable at Rs 16-18 per kg. In Andheri (W) alone, rates varied between Rs 50-120 per kg.

5a0439229855b76bf13bcf9d,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."

Most of these farmers claimed to be followers of Brahmeshwar Singh or Mukhiya, who headed the banned, upper caste militia Ranvir Sena in the state.""The condition of farmers in Bihar is quite bad and soon there would be cases of farmers' suicide in Bihar as well, if the government won't act.

Both are thugs,"" said Vivek Sharma, state convenor of the farmers' body staging the dharna.The agitating farmers also took a dig at Nitish for organising Kisan Samagam programme at S K Memorial by ignoring their plight. ""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme. Such programmes are just aimed at deceiving the common people and ignoring serious issues,"" said Awadhesh Nandan Sharma , district president of the farmers' outfit.Earlier this week, Nitish had slammed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to resolve the nationwide farmers' protest. ""Farmers are in a bad condition, but the central government is indifferent to them. The government's failure to enforce MSP for farm produces has forced the farmers to protest. The country has been facing an agrarian crisis due to the low price of farm produces,"" Nitish had said on the sidelines of his Lok Samvad programme on Monday.In Friday's protest, the farmers demanded minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre for milk, Rs 100 per kilogram for pulses, Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy and Rs 4,000 per quintal for wheat.""RJD chief Lalu Prasad never fails to term himself garibo ka neta, but he never supports milkmen, his traditional vote base,"" said Vivek."

They are seeking higher support price for their produce and waiver of loans.Onion output from the crop sown during late kharif (summer) season of the 2016-17 crop year has been higher which led to huge arrivals in mandis and fall in prices.The official said the price drop was because the onion coming into the mandis was of 'table' variety and not stored due to low shelf life.Excess supply amid low demand led to crash in prices, which has hit farmers revenues. Also, the scale of arrival is so much that farmers are not able to grade the crop on the basis of size, traders said.Grading of onions would have helped MP farmers fetch better prices in Delhi and other markets, a trader said, adding that better support to growers is the need of the hour to handle problem of plenty in the state.Madhya Pradesh produces about 26-28 LT onions annually.

While a kilogram of shallots or small onions sold for about Rs 28 in April in the wholesale market, it has now risen to Rs 100 for the same amount.President of Madurai district wholesale onion market association C Mohamed Ismail said that Madurai used to receive 4,000 bags of shallots, with each bag weighing between 50 to 60 kilograms, but it has dropped to only 1000 bags, which are divided equally between the Madurai Central market and the Paravai market.The situation is similar at the Oddanchathiram vegetable market in Dindigul, one of the biggest markets in the region. The market deals with 300 tonnes of onions on normal days when there is a good supply from the farms, but now, traders said, they are getting only 100 tonnes daily.P Sakthivel, member of the Oddanchathiram shop owners association, said that the supply from Dindigul and Theni has dropped drastically since May 1. At Oddanchathiram, the best quality shallots sold for Rs 95 a kilogram on Friday, while the smaller ones went for Rs 70. However, at the Madurai onion wholesale market the price rose to Rs 110 per kilogram.Traders attributed the steep hike to the prevailing drought conditions in the state which has affected the last harvest in April.S Periyasamy, a farmer from Dindigul, said, ""Onions are water intensive crops. If we water the crop once a week we get a good yield, but this year we were not able to do even that.''Meanwhile, many retail shops in residential areas have stopped selling shallots, as people are not ready to buy it for such a high price. Thangaraj, who runs a shop in Gomathypuram, said that people don't want to buy more than 100 grams which is not profitable. ""I can earn profit only if I can sell quarter kilogram for Rs 25. I have not sold shallots for the past one week as a result of the price hike,'' he said.A P Mahendar, a farmer and onion commission agent, said that the lack of rainfall leading to drop in produce was the sole reason behind the rise in shallot prices. ""I don't think the prices will come down in the next three months as this 60-day-crop cultivated in the end of March this year failed to produce sufficient quantities,'' he said.If there is enough rain, and the conditions are conducive there would be yield of not less than five tonnes of quality shallots per acre, but this season the shallots are small in size and the yield is about three tonnes or less per acre, according to him. ""At present about three lorry loads of shallots are being brought to the Oddanchathiram market from Mysore, the reason why it is selling for Rs 100. Otherwise, it would have been much more,'' he added."

""The farmers threw milk and other produce on the road, instead of taking them to the markets at the taluka place, situated about 15 km away.

Shrikant Umrikar , a Shetkari Sanghatana leader, said they are neither in favour of nor against the strike. ""We did not want to send a message that the farmers are divided, due to which we supported the strike. We don't generally approve of any strike in June as it is the beginning of the kharif sowing season,"" he added."

""Police have denied opening fire to disperse the mob of agitated farmers. Even the CRPF force stationed on the spot also says they didn't fire,"" Singh told reporters on Tuesday .Chouhan said the government is taking steps to address farmers' issues. ""The incident of firing on farmers in Mandsaur is unfortunate. I have ordered a judicial inquiry. The government will bear the medical expenses of the injured farmers,"" he tweeted.The home minister ordered strict action against those ""misleading or provoking farmers for violent protests"". Soon after the shooting, the CM called an emergency meeting with cabinet colleagues and officials of police and administration.Chief secretary B P Singh also denied that Mandsaur police or CRPF jawans were involved in the firing. Major factions of farmer unions were satisfied after the CM announced that the government will procure onions and pulses at minimum support price, Singh said. An official said that the government had bought 3,995 quintal onion on Tuesday, following the CM's promise.The Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh has called a day's shutdown in MP in protest against the firing.CPM slams firing on protestersThe CPM on Tuesday condemned the death of five farmers in police firing in Mandsaur during a protest demonstration. In a statement, the CPM politburo said the ""unprovoked"" firing on farmers who had been protesting peacefully exposed the ""anti-farmer character"" of BJP and the Madhya Pradesh government. The politburo said, ""The culprits responsible for ordering this unprovoked police firing must be suspended immediately, pending a proper inquiry.""

""With the holy month of fasting falling in the summer heat, everyone prefers a vegetarian diet. But due to the disruption in supply of fruits and vegetables, sourcing preferred items for all has become a challenge,"" said Ghazala Khan, a homemaker.Satisfying everyone to serve their choicest meals begins early. The best suited spot in the city to purchase fruits and vegetables is Chowk Bazaar. Much before the commercial markets open, the humble thela-wallahs sell the best grade vegetables in the city, hollering out the prices of choice veggies. The carts that roll into the narrow lanes of the walled city have been silent and dry in the last couple of days.""Vegetable sellers ar few and far in between these days. Prices of lauki, palak, bhindi, turai and pattagobi and basic items like green chilli and coriander leaves have skyrocketed,"" said Sadia Aleem, a homemaker. It has not deterred consumption but the quality of items available is not satisfactory either, she added.Shortage of milk has also caught many families off-guard. Supply of unpasteurised milk by private vendors has been worst hit. ""Supply has been erratic in the last two days. Homogenised full cream milk has disappeared from all major shops,"" said Sameer, a resident of the posh Koh-e-Fiza area.While, vegetables have hit kitchen budgets the hardest, there is a flipside to the scenario. Price of watermelon have dropped due to excess supply. A large number of trucks meant for other wholesale markets, have been diverted to places like Bhopal Mandi, which are largely unaffected by the strike.""Prices of some fruits have dropped sharply. However, vegetable supply has been adversely impacted. Our business is hit,"" said a wholesaler in Bhopal.***Onion likely to be sold at Rs 3 per/kg in ration shopsGoing by indications from district administration officials, procurement of onion will soon be resumed. The purchase price has been pegged at Rs 8 per/kg but it will be sold at Rs 3 per/kg through public distribution shops (PDS) across the state capital, say sources."

Long queues were also seen outside petrol pumps.However, the agitation reached the doorsteps of Bhopal as incidents of arson and stone-pelting were witnessed in Fanda area, about 20 kms from the state capital.Police baton-charged the protesters and arrested at least 27 of them in the area.""Some unidentified persons set a truck on fire near a spot where Congress workers were protesting. Then some men hurled stones at the policemen present there,"" Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Raman Singh Sikarwar told PTI.The SP said the police will not let their guard down and strict action will be taken against those who try to violate prohibitory orders under CrPC 144 which bans assembly of more than four persons. Special permission will be required for weddings or other functions .At least 156 people have been arrested and 40 cases registered in connection with violence during the farmers agitation here.The SP said police is trying to identify the culprits by going through the video clips of the incidents of violence.The Centre had rushed 1,100 personnel of the RAF to the violence-hit state.Two companies of the RAF, each comprising 100 personnel, were deployed in Pipliamandi in Mandsaur, where five farmers were killed in police firing on Tuesday. Two RAF companies were deployed along the highway. Contingents of the CRPF have also been deployed.In Bhopal, a visibly-upset chief minister told a hurriedly-convened press conference this evening that ensuring people's safety was his 'Rajdharma' and that he was not flint-hearted.He said the agitation has gone ""anarchic"" and appealed to the farmers to come to the negotiating table.""I will sit on indefinite fast from 11 am tomorrow at Dussehra Maidan for restoration of peace,"" he said on Friday.""I will be available at the Dussehra Maidan. I welcome all farmers to come there for resolving the impasse peacefully through an amicable dialogue with me. I won't sit in my office at Mantralaya (secretariat)...(but sit at) Dussehra Maiden and do all work from there,"" he added.Chouhan said anyone trying to ignite the flames of violence would not be spared.""I am deeply saddened that stones are being placed in the hands of young people aged 18, 21 and 22 by some persons during attempts to stage road blockades. It is painful that these young people are our own and the elements leading them are also our own,"" he said.Chouhan, who has been the chief minister for the last 11 -and-a-half years, said that whenever farmers were in distress due to loss of crops following a natural calamity, he had rushed to them and comforted and helped them.The state government has started buying onion for Rs 8 per kg from the farmers, while Moong and Urad pulses too will be bought at Minimum Support Price (MSP), the CM said.A commission will be set up to work out the cost of production of farm produce and a Rs 1,000 crore fund will be created to help farmers when prices crash, the CM reiterated."

A cooperative bank in the state has sent notices to nearly 3,000 farmers, threatening legal action if they don't clear loan dues.The notices have been sent by the district cooperative bank Hoshangabad to farmers in Hoshangabad and Harda districts, triggering kisan unions to warn of fresh agitation. Sources say bank officials started sending the notices, via the district administration, in March and the process is still on.While insiders say that the bank has warned of legal action against 15,000 farmers over loan defaults worth Rs 500 crore, the general manager of the cooperative bank says the real number is a fifth of that. ""Notices have been given to 3,000 farmers and we have full hope that will get the due payments,"" general manager R B Thakur, told TOI, adding that the bank's demand was around Rs 300 crore and some of it has been recovered from their accounts through money deposited for crop insurance and proceeds from wheat procurement.Thakur said that there are around 1.61 kisan credit card (KCC) holders in the region and the total 'chronic default' is around Rs 80 crore. ""Of the other defaults, we recovered Rs 77 crore from crop insurance and Rs 88.5 crore from wheat procurement,"" said the officer.Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has raised strong objection to the loan recovery proceedings. ""This is not the way to recover loan. Farmers are the sufferers. We will protest strongly,"" said Shiv Mohan Singh, BKS spokesperson, urging the government to chalk out a strategy for easy repayment of loans rather than ""threatening that their farmland would be attached"". Adding to their woes, the electricity department has snapped the power connections of more than 1,000 farmers in the same region due to non-payment of dues.National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) has recorded 11,000 farmer suicides in MP since 2008, many of them in Hoshangabad district. One of the recent ones was that of 45-year-old Laxman Mehra, who killed himself in his farmland after a cash-starved bank was unable to honour his withdrawal slip in the aftermath of demonetisation.As of March 31, 2017, around Rs 13,000 crore had been loaned to 26 lakh farmers by cooperative banks in MP at 0% interest. The interest is subsidized partially by NABARD and partially by state government. Official say that such a huge amount cannot be waived as it would cripple the finances of the cash-strapped government. The state has recently started procuring onions from farmers at Rs 8/kg despite suffering a loss of more than Rs 100 crore last year by buying onion at Rs 6/kg under pressure from farmers. The state government has promised to procure pulses, too, at MSP. Madhya Pradesh claims agriculture growth above 20%, which happens to be a world record. Ironically, it is a glut in production that has led prices to crash."

It has also taken up with the Union government to increase procurement of sunflower seeds from 25% to 50% of the state's produce.The information was shared by Haryana agriculture minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Thursday while adding that the state government was implementing Swaminathan commission's recommendations in a step-wise manner by making agriculture risk free for farmers, with zero-interest loans and crop diversification.Replying to a question that Haryana farmers are forced to sell potatoes for even 20 paisa per kg, Dhankar said market forces cause drastic changes in the selling price of farmers' produce. On efforts to stabilise vegetable prices, Dhankar informed, ""There are plans to levy more taxes when prices improve, and use the funds collected for farmers' welfare when the prices drop.""The minister said that the state government has already requested the Centre to procure 50% to states' sunflower seeds produce at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,950 per quintal.To a question on farm debt waiver, Dhankar replied that the state government's main focus is to make farmers self-sufficient instead. He said that a target has been fixed to increase farmers' income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. But he also said that farmers across the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agricultural sector does not yield earnings as high as that of the service sector. ""Therefore, the state government offered subsidies to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore per year,"" he said.He informed that during his tour to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, the delegation studied techniques adopted for horticulture, floriculture, dairying, animal husbandry, storage and transportation of wheat, which would be replicated in Haryana.Taking a dig at the protesting Congress leaders in the state, Dhankar said that the Swaminathan commission's report was submitted to the government in 2006 but the previous Congress government failed to implement its recommendations. ""In fact, the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had formed a committee which further delayed the implementation of the recommendations,"" he said.The minister told that against the commission's recommendation of compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers, the Congress government paid them only Rs 6,000 per acre whereas the BJP government gave compensation to the tune of Rs 12,000 per acre to farmers."

Farmers in Thirumangalam, Usilampatti, Chellampatti, Vadipatti blocks cultivate onion and shallots and Sedapatti T Kallupatti stretch is known as the `onion belt' of the district.During last grievance redressal meeting, farmers' leader M Pandian placed the appeal to the horticulture department to promote onion cultivation. He stated that onion has turned a very remunerative crop this season but the benefits could not be enjoyed much in the region due to the ongoing drought conditions.Onion prices, especially of shallots, sky-rocketed this year with one kg priced at `125. The reduced supply due to drought is said to be major reason for price rise.Deputy director of horticulture, G O Poopathy told the farmers at the meeting that Madurai has received funds for 30 hectares under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM). Onions could also be cultivated profitably using drip irrigation, he said, assuring farmers that all help will be rendered by the department to increase onion cultivation."
