This is the second type of assistance announced by the state government. The government had earlier announced a transport subsidy for potato farmers Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, while speaking to reporters, said that the state government has implemented a new scheme and has allocated Rs 100 crore to provide assistance of Rs 1 per kg and Rs 50 per 50-kg gunny bag to farmers growing potatoes or onions.In Gujarat, the total potato produce is about 39 lakh metric tons and that of onions is about 10 lakh metric tons. Patel said that a committee headed by him had been formed to assist farmers growing potato and onion. The committee also has the agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya, health minister Shankar Chaudhary, minister of state for agriculture Vallabh Vaghasiya and irrigation minister Nanu Vanani.Patel said the committee decided that the government should also provide assistance to farmers who have restored their potato and onion produce in cold storages. Apart from this, the farmer will get Rs 1 per kg for exporting the produce from the state.Officials said that if a farmer sells 300 quintals of the crop in Gujarat he will get Rs 30,000 as subsidy. If he sells the same amount outside Gujarat, he will get an additional export subsidy of Rs 30,000.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association, said, ""This subsidy will be come as a major relief for farmers who decided to stock their crop for lack of a good price. This subsidy will help farmers to at least make good their storage cost.Sources said that the subside was announced keeping in view the election scheduled for later this year. Many farmers who had failed to get remunerative prices for their crops had earlier this month thrown their produce on the streets."

The social media was taken by storm on Sunday with food aficionados posting pictures of varieties of Biryani and Pulao on their social media handles across India. Amongst cities like Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore etc. Indoreans too observed the day by coming together for a potluck supper. Amit Pamnani, a city based Chef who had invited foodies over for a potluck at his residence shares, ""The idea behind the event was to showcase Indian food to the world. Internationally, people celebrate food days like World Cheesecake Day, World French Fries day, World Nutella Day, Cheeseburger Day etc. Similarly, Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal thought of marking Indian food days to pay tribute to foods, dishes and ingredients that are Indian. Following the suit we are trying to elevate Indian food to the same level. We already had a few food days in the past recently like Pickle Masala Day, where people came together and made pickles together. On Biryani day, we made biryani as per our styles, some were signature recipes of grandmothers and some tasted authentically like Mughlai Biryani.""It was double the celebration as the day was observed on the onset of Eid and Biryani is synonymous to the festival. Food reviewer Belly Kanungo feels, ""The day gave us a chance to soak-in the Eid spirit. Initially, we had thought of having a potluck but eventually it turned out to be an elaborate Eid celebration as we had mutton Biryanis, chicken Biryanis, egg and cheese Pulao, different types of Raitas - veg, cucumber and plain authentic Raita along with some onion salad from eight different kitchens. Each Biryani tasted different from one another. There was dum Biryani which had layers of rice, Masala chicken and toppings of Kesar rice and caramelised onions that tasted absolutely like an authentic Biryani of a Mughlai restaurant. There was mutton and chicken masala pulao-biryani that tasted perfectly like how we Indoris like to eat - full of spices and Masala.""Food aficionado, Rakesh Dawani adds, ""Though, there have been debates on the difference between Biryani and Pulao but one thing is common between both these irresistible dishes that they bind foodies together. The celebration was given a pause with a dollop of Sheer-Khurma.""Indore has been seeing a lot of youngsters choosing to organise potluck dinners on occasions like Easters and even for Iftar. Shivam Anand, a 20 year old engineering student who replicated his grandma's recipe to make egg-pulao for the day is of the opinion, ""It is only because of potluck that we got to savour eight different kinds of Biryanis in a single day. Potlucks are fun and gives us ideas to experiment with different dishes in our kitchens. Indore is known for its food and such sessions are only taking the city forward as like-minded people get to meet under one roof and talk about food.""For Satyajeet David, a city based chef, Biryani means ""Celebrating - The Royal Way"". He shares, ""A day dedicated and celebrated as #PulaoBiryaniDay in India is indeed very inspiring not only for Chefs but all foodies. I appreciate the thought to embark an occasion like this once in a year. It was a memorable experience being a part of this celebration in Indore where we relished different flavours of Biryanis and Pulao. I am looking forward to celebrating this day every year henceforth. We (food Connoisseurs of Indore) are in talking to come up with more such days to celebrate the essence of Indian food."""
5a0510f79855b76bf13bf739,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadership",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/618481/agri-sector-seeking-vigour-fresh.html,2017-06-21,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadershipDH News Service Jun 21 2017, 2:14 ISTIn January-February, as the election campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were picking up steam, Home Minister Rajnath Singh first broached the topic of farm loan waiver if the BJP came to power. Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

Potato prices slipped more than 44% and onion too went down close to 13%.Protein items such as eggs, meat and fish also declined over 1% year-on-year in May. Only cereals in the food basket saw an uptick in prices. Pulses got cheaper.The new figures are based on the base year 2011-12. The base year was revised last month in order to reflect numbers more accurately.There was deflation in the fruit basket to the tune (-)0.73%.Commenting on the WPI based inflation numbers industry body Ficci said, the trend in inflation is in line with the broad expectations - both wholesale and retail prices remain benign. Food inflation has softened considerably over the past couple of months. Further, with global commodity prices remaining subdued and the monsoon this year expected to be normal, inflation should continue to be within RBIs comfort zone.The central bank has revised downwards its own projection for inflation in the months ahead. I think the case for supporting growth is getting stronger and we hope that RBI will take a relook into its monetary policy stance in the light of these new numbers. We need to boost investments and growth, which is so essential for employment generation across the economy."

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

As the agitation continued in Nashik district, police have prohibited assembly of people in public places under CrPC section 144 till June 19.All 17 agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and 20 sub-APMCs in the district remained closed today too, and onion auctions couldn't take place, said Jaidutta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC. Yesterday, another farmer, Gorakh Savaliram Kokane, resident of Waki Budruk in Chandvad tehsil of Nashik district, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself at his house.The agitation continued in the district with several vehicles carrying vegetables to Mumbai stopped by protesters. Protesting farmers also locked down the office of talathi (village revenue officer) at Naitale in Nifad tehsil.Vegetable-carrying trucks heading for Mumbai faced protesters in the neighbouring Ahmednagar district too. A couple of trucks carrying vegetables and flowers were stopped late night. Protesters punctured wheels of a milk tanker and in some places police used lathi-charge to disperse the mobs, said an officer.Farmers' groups tried to lock down government offices in Manvat (Parbhani district), Satara, Nanded, Kolhapur and Sangli districts.Major dairies such as Gokul and Warna in Kolhapur district continued milk collection. These two dairies are major supplier of packaged milk to Mumbai."

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

5a05ded99855b76bf13c17f3,Gaggan Anand’s retirement plan,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/gaggan-anands-retirement-plan/article18954001.ece,2017-06-10,"Gaggan Anand says what he thinks and does what he wants. When he won his 50 Best Restaurants award this year, he promptly announced his intention to close his eponymous restaurant in 2020. It made the headlines and went viral. Why would the Indian chef, whose Bangkok restaurant topped Asias 50 Best list for three consecutive years and is now at No 7 on the Worlds 50 Best ranking, not want to set up a global Gaggan empire? Especially, when many celebrity chefs are cashing in on their bestsellers. Because I dont want to just become a brand. I have 67 employees to motivate, I make it a point to talk to everyone who comes to dine, and still am criticised that I am not at my restaurant every day, admits AnandThere is also his love for all things Japanese and his decision to open a new restaurant with friend and collaborator, Chef Takeshi Fukuyama. At 39, his move to dodge burnout could also be influenced by mentor Ferran Adria of El Bulli; the ground-breaking Spanish chef closed shop when his Michelin three-star restaurant in Catalonia was still enormously successful. Anand, who interned with him in 2010, has often named Adria (besides his own mother) as his inspiration.1080 days to rememberWith 36 months to go before he shuts his progressive Indian restaurant  about four menus a year, and 25 courses in each menu  he exhorts his team on WhatsApp to create 300 memorable dishes. The former drummer runs a tight ship of chefs from 18 countries, including Serbia, Spain and India. In their glass-walled kitchen that overlooks a private dining room, they work with the synchronised precision of musicians, but with enough back-slapping. It is back-breaking work: the tiny eggplant cookie which is Gaggans take on baingan ka bharta served as the fourth course, sees the vegetable mashed and charred in the tandoor , before being freeze-dried and compressed into cookies, then sandwiched with onion chutney. Coriander Nest and Green Apple involves several hours of shaving both coriander root and apple. Each course is a work of art.Alternative realityWhen I visit, the wait staff announces each course with a flourish  one has mustard wrapped sea bass cooked in cedar wood and charred on the table (Anands take on the Bengali fish paturi ); another is a spicy Chettinad quail served in a cage. It is a heady journey, where culinary and performance art unite, and where the menu (only emoji-filled, the key to what you have eaten comes after you have dined) throws up surprises like goat brain in a waffle or scallop curry cooked and broken down to a cold form. There is beetroot meringue with gooseberry and blue cheese and also mushroom that sits pretty like a bonsai and mango wasabi ice cream with sea urchin. The German couple seated at the next table is full of praise, and I have to agree with them, Anands wizardry with molecular gastronomy, authentic Indian flavours and the Japanese pursuit of perfection makes him deserving of his many awards. The first Michelin guide in Bangkok is due in December, and not surprisingly, he will earn a spot there too.Reinvention is keyAnand is dismissive of the adulation. What you are eating will be stale in five days, when I launch my new menu, he pronounces. Just back from a working holiday in Switzerland and Rome, he is in his trademark black jacket, with its strip of blue. He is bleary-eyed behind his Gentle Monster frames, but has his hair in a Samurai topknot and is ready to brainstorm with his team. The stories about 500 booking requests a day and the three-month waiting list at Gaggan are true, he confirms, which is why he now has a five-person team to handle reservations. Yet, social media is also abuzz over his new projects: Gaa, Raa, Sol, GohGan and a second branch of Meatlicious.Made in BangkokThe last, a steakhouse in partnership with his wife, is a runaway hit. On his Instagram account, there is a bubbling pan of yellow: fish curry at Meatlicious, sold out days in advance, with 12,000 likes and counting. Suhring, another investment, and headed by German twins, Thomas and Mathiass Suhring, has also won its share of awards. The only dark cloud, it appears, is Gaa, a brand new project helmed by his former sous chef, Garima Arora. Initially supposed to be a curry house, Anand says it is now Thai, confusion and neo-Nordic. Clearly, things have soured between the two, and he adds, Every dish at Gaa was a Noma copy. I told them that and it was not taken well. I put my money and name on new talent, but then they think they are rebels.Rockstar chefs from his team will be heading projects such as Wet, a Japanese gastropub, and Sol, a dessert address. With his Serbian sommelier Vladimir Kojic calling the shots, Wet will have at least 30,000 bottles of wine and fried chicken. Yakitori, or Japanese-style grilled skewered chicken, to be specific. A collaboration with Mihara tofu ten, from Fukuoka, will see a Japanese fine-dining restaurant, where tofu is the subject. These projects will bring him the funds to experiment with GohGan, his project with long-time friend Fukuyama (of La Maison de la Nature Goh). Gaggan will reopen in a different format, as Raa, to be run by his current staff. Everybody on the team gets an opportunity. I give them my money, fame, and infrastructure. But they are warned that with fame comes criticism, he concludes.The new menu, 25 courses,is 5,000 baht ++, 2 1/2 hours.6 p.m. to 12 a.m. Reservations on thewebsite.The problem with many Indian restaurants is that there is no innovation. Rich billionaires who want to make money, want to introduce molecular gastronomy in every mall! And if I dont watch it, I will be dancing on reality shows and selling coconut oil. I wont discredit those who do it, but its not for me. That is why I have project JapanThe other sideGaggan wears Onitsuka Tiger shoes, and has 97 pairs already; Zita eyewear; and clothes by Yohji Yamamoto, Sacai, Junya Watanabe and Commes des Garcons.The fan of progressive rock says Gimme Shelter (The Rolling Stones) is his current anthem, then generously offers to buy tickets to a Foo Fighters concert in Bangkok later this month.His T-shirt, Hug me I smell like curry has achieved cult status. Coming up: Dont fork with my curry.He prefers to post selfies with the global community of chefs, rather than the many celebrities who stream into his restaurant, and enjoys cooking for sushi and ramen masters.His year-old daughter Tara has taught him to be more approachable, as many of my chefs are nervous in my presence. She has inspired a childrens menu at Gaggan, to be launched in August.Pop ups include one in Tokyo this week, followed by Singapore and Switzerland. London and New York might have them early next year. And India? Thats always a surprise.After Gaggan"

Another reason, said farmers, was the fear that their produce would go waste as a State-wide bandh has been called on Monday.On Sundays, APMCs see only around 120 trucks arriving, and no business is conducted. The ongoing agitation by farmers, however, ensured that most traders chose to work on Sunday and received nearly 313 trucks of vegetables. Of these, around 180 were from the State, and close to 302 trucks left the market after unloading.Though wholesale prices were not fixed on Sunday, an increase in supply sent retail prices down, much to the relief of the common man. The fruit, grain market and onion-potato market remained closed. In all, 259 vehicles arrived at the fruit market, 29 at the grain market, one truck each of onion and garlic and 12 bearing potatoes."

The department has ample stock of seeds and fertilizers for distribution to farmers, depending on their requirement, through Raitha Samparka Kendras, officials said.Since groundnut is a major commercial crop in Challakere, Hiriyur and Molkalmuru taluks of the district, the target for sowing groundnut in these taluks is 1,42,620 hectares. The jowar target is 88,000 hectares, while for maize it is 23,900 hectares.Sowing onionSo far, the farmers have not shown keenness in sowing onion, a major commercial crop in the district, as they incurred heavy losses in the past two years owing to drought and sudden collapse in prices, a source said. Farmers in the district used to complete sowing of onion on 2,000 hectares by the second week of June, but this time sowing has not been completed even on 20 ha. Once the district starts receiving good rain, the farmers may begin sowing onion.Officials in the Agriculture Department have advised farmers to take suggestions from Raitha Samparka Kendras before purchasing seeds and fertilizers, so they dont incur losses by purchasing outdated fertilizers and duplicate seeds.

5a05e6e49855b76bf13c1c20,Fault lines in the fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fault-lines-in-the-fields/article18952749.ece,2017-06-10,"Abhishek Patidar, 19, had just passed his Class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started."

Since 2014, prices of soybean, methi, onion and pulses have plummeted by hardly any intervention by the government, said 55-year-old Kachrulal Chadavat, a farmer from Barkheda Panth village, 20 km north of Mandsaur.Having voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in the parliamentary elections in 2014, the farmers of these districts have become bitter and vocal critics of the Centre, accusing it of adopting anti-farmers policies.According to Mr. Chadavat, farming alone can no longer sustain a family."

Velankanni RajB_VELANKANNI RAJAmid a spurt in overseas freight traffic growth, the prospects of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) facility aimed at speedy customs clearance and documentation have brightened at the Tiruchi international airport.A thrust has now been accorded for putting in place the EDI facility at the non-metro Tiruchi airport coinciding with the Central governments decision to roll out the new nation-wide Goods and Service Tax (GST) from July 1.Necessary infrastructure required for implementation of EDI has been provided at the airport which has witnessed an upswing in overseas freight traffic since the commissioning of a dedicated export cargo terminal in 2011.The Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Customs authorities are jointly involved in establishing the facility  a long pending demand of the shippers.Being the custodian of the international airport, the AAI has provided space, computer hardware, connectivity and other basic infrastructure required for putting in place the facility, airport sources told The Hindu .The Customs Department would have to hook up to their central server at New Delhi so as to put the e-facility in place.A senior Customs official here said the process of putting in place EDI facility at Tiruchi airport was on, adding that it was expected to go online soon.All required infrastructure was ready at the airport and tests would be conducted prior to launching the facility, the official said.Stakeholders said the commissioning of the facility would immensely benefit shippers exporting freight to various foreign destinations from Tiruchi airport every day.One of the greatest advantages of conversion to EDI was that it would eventually eliminate manual operations.Speedy clearanceIt would also lead to speedy customs clearance and documentation with respect to freight leading to paperless transactions, said a senior official.The other major advantage is that export incentives offered by the government to shippers would be credited into their respective account instantly once the cargo was cleared for export, said stakeholders.Although Tiruchi airport had got the international tag years ago and a dedicated export cargo terminal having been established six years ago, it had been lacking the EDI facility.A thrust has now been accorded to the EDI facility with technical infrastructure in a state of readiness, said an official.Stakeholders also feel that once Electronic Data Interchange was in place the profile of export commodities would also undergo a change.Possibility of general cargo being exported from Tiruchi airport would increase, they feel.Presently, perishables such as vegetables, fruits and flowers account for bulk of freight exported to various overseas destinations from Tiruchi.Notwithstanding various factors including offloading, overseas freight volume handled at the Tiruchi airport was over 6,600 metric tonnes during the 2016-17 financial year, the sources added."

JamesS_JamesA section of farmers attending the monthly grievance meeting at Collectorate here on Friday blamed the private companies approved by the government for exorbitant pricing of drip irrigation equipment supplied through the subsidy scheme coordinated by Horticulture department.K. Thanikodi, a farmer from Usilampatti, alleged that the private companies were charging more than double the market price for certain components for setting up drip irrigation. However, the government insists that we buy only from them, he said.When officials from Horticulture department pointed out that the farmers could choose from a list of 24 companies, Mr. Thanikodi and a few other farmers who supported his allegation said that the companies had formed a cartel and were charging roughly around the same amount. The farmers demanded that they should instead be allowed to choose from any vendor in the market, provided procurement bills were submitted properly to the government for reimbursement.Highlighting that farmers were asked to take care of transportation and installation, they also insisted that the entire cost be covered in the subsidy.Pointing out that the scheme subsidised only the materials and not installation or transportation, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, who presided over the meeting, said that the list of companies and other provisions of the scheme could not be changed at the district level. However, I will forward your concerns to the government, he said.Other issuesDelay in payment of procurement price to farmers by sugar mills, extension of drip irrigation subsidy for onion cultivation and de-silting of Vaigai dam were other issues that dominated the meeting.With several farmers raising the demand for de-silting of Vaigai dam, officials from Public Works Department (PWD) responded that a detailed project report for the same had been submitted to the government, which had to decide on the sanctioning of funds.Protest in ChennaiN. Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, pointed out that the private and government-run sugar mills together owed roughly Rs. 2,000 crore to farmers across the State, of which the National Cooperative Sugar Mill in Alanganallur owed Rs. 11 crore. We are planning a protest in Chennai on Thursday if the government does not initiate measures to settle the dues, he said.Farmers also demanded that drip irrigation subsidy be extended for onion cultivation, for which Horticulture department officials said that a proposal had already been sent to the government.Pointing out that a majority of issues raised at the meeting related to PWD, Collector Rao instructed PWD officials in the rank of Assistant Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer from every division to be present to properly respond to farmers queries.Similarly, registering his disappointment over the absence of Forest department officials at the meeting despite many issues raised in relation to them, Mr. Rao called the District Forest Officer over phone during the meeting and asked him to ensure that the department was properly represented."

It is a hit with the Hindus too, who collect it from the mosques near their locality here.Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque at Suramangalam, at the heart of Salem city, serves the gruel to about 2,000 fasting Muslim families in and around this area. This gruelling task begins at the crack of dawn.Over the past three days, sixty nine year-old S. Sadaqatullah Sait, a native of Keeranur near Palani, has been heading a team of half a dozen persons in preparing the gruel at the mosque. He has been doing this for the last three decades ever since the residents of Keeranur, all businessmen who settled down in Suramangalam, introduced him to the jamath leaders of the mosque in the 1980s.Every day, it takes 150 kg of rice, seven kg of garlic, five kg of ginger and onion to make the gruel. Though the gruel is served only in the evening, the preparation commences at daybreak, says Sait.The gruel is ready by 1 p.m. and the serving commences at 3 p.m. After the gruel is served, he begins preparing the sahri (pre-dawn meal) also for about 200 fasting Muslims who are living away from their families and students put up in the hostels. This is served between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. at the mosque. This leaves Sait and his team working day and night during the month of Ramzan. No doubt, it is tiresome.

One of the DFCs will have connectivity to the south aiding freight movement from southern States and two of the three DFCs will be completed in the next three years.The southern States will significantly benefit from the DFC. In a way, DFCs will completely criss-cross the country boosting freight movement. If Make in India has to succeed, we will have to develop a huge backbone of infrastructure for the logistics, said Mr. Prabhu at the launch of various passenger amenities for Coimbatore, Thudiyalur, Periyanaickenpalayam and Tirupur railway stations.Once DFC is a reality, it would reduce traffic on passenger train networks, increasing speed and inclusion of new services.Stating that income from freight was on a declining trend in the last two years, Mr. Prabhu said that freight rates will be reduced soon. Of the 10 products that are the mainstay of Railways income, two-third comes from the freight.According to the Minister, the Railways also plans to introduce services to benefit farmers. The Railways, with the support of Container Corporation of India, helped farmers transport onion from Maharashtra. He hinted Railways plans to start cold storage chains in stations to support farmers for transporting agriculture produces.Mr. Prabhu said that increasing the speed of trains will be a priority. As part of this, Rs. 18,000 core will be spent to increase speed of trains to 200 kmph on important lines such as Bombay-Delhi and Delhi-Kolkata. Increasing speed of services between Bengaluru and Chennai is also under consideration.Only 42 % of railway lines are currently electrified which will be doubled in the next five years. All meter gauges will be converted into broad gauges. Increasing speed, augmenting capacity and bringing in new avenues of growth are areas Railways currently working on, said Mr. Prabhu.The budget allocation for Tamil Nadu increased in the last three years. Now, Tamil Nadu is getting a share of 170 % more than what the State was getting three years ago. While the share was only Rs. 878 crore from 2009-10 to 2013-14, it has gone up to Rs. . 2,300 crore now.

Dr. Ajit Navale, member of the committee, said, The scheme has an upper limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh. So if a farmer has an outstanding loan above it, he would not benefit from it. It is not in line with our demand of blanket loan waiver. A meeting will be held in Nashik on July 9 and the committee will launch a Sangharsh Yatra (protest campaign) against the government, which will end on July 23. Dr. Navale said, We will hold a State-wide agitation on July 26 as our demands have not been addressed by the government.Meanwhile, National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Sunday that the farm loan waiver announced by the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party government was not wholly satisfactory.

The scheme is expected to benefit 89 lakh farmers: 40 lakh will become debt-free; the remaining 49 lakh will be provided relief. Mr. Pawar said, This is the governments first step towards alleviating debt-ridden farmers. It is too soon for us [the NCP] to say whether it is effective or not but the ground reality is that a section of farmer leaders are already dissatisfied with the governments proposals.The NCP chief said that the government had written off-debts up to Rs. 1.5 lakh for the period between April 1, 2012 and June 2016. It ought to have done so till June 2017, Mr. Pawar said.He said that the partys second and long-term demand would be to seek the implementation of the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee to make agriculture viable and stable. Mr. Pawar said, It is high time the Centre seriously considers implementing it. The government was aware that there would be a record production of tur dal this year, yet it did not lift the ban on the export of pulses.Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray during his tour in Nashik district said the loan waiver put forward by its coalition ally was unsatisfactory. He said, The farm loan waiver is historic, but it is not satisfactory.
