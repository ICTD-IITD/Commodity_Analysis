In the first phase MahaFPC, the consortium of FPCs in Maharashtra, are planning to venture in the Azadpur mandi in Delhi to sell onions.The FPC movement in Maharashtra has seen much action over the last year or so. Working under the banner of MahaFPC, the FPCs had purchased more than 25,000 MT of tur last year. The FPCs had opened village-level purchase centres and had purchased the produce on behalf of the Small Farmers Agri business Consortium (SFAC).Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MahaFPC, had said that purchases by the MahaFPC had helped stabilise tur prices in the local wholesale markets.MahaFPCs move to enter traditional markets comes at a time when the state government is encouraging farmer and FPCs to explore alternate markets or to go for retail markets. Asked about their decision to go for the traditional wholesale markets, Thorat said it would be easier to be part of the wholesale chain rather than the retail markets. Onion, Thorat said, was a classic example of a produce from Maharashtra which fetches better returns in Delhi market than the local markets. We aim to directly sell the onions from Maharashtra in Delhis markets, bypassing the various intermediaries, he said.In the first phase, Thorat said, MahaFPC will be concentrating on onions and slowly venture into other fresh fruits and vegetables. On an average, the Azadpur market sees the arrival of around 100-115 trucks of onions and in the next two years, we aim to corner at least 20 per cent of the arrival, he said. The wholesale trade in Azadpur and other places is mostly controlled by traders who purchase produce mostly in Maharashtra.The ground level procurement, sorting and grading will be done by the FPCs, while MahaFPC will act as facility coordinator. A Nashik-based FPC will be venturing into the trade of onion with Thorat hoping to start the process by the end of this month. We are hopeful that we will get the grant from the state government for the same, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

He writes about chunks of meat prepared in roast form on fire spits. Henceforth, the juicy, succulent and spicy has travelled from a soldiers fire pit finding its place on Turkish tables, Iranian gatherings and in courtyards of Indian households.And what better way to celebrate this wonder food than to savour it at the select restaurants of the city while cool raindrops sluice their way through frosty windowpane. Select your choice from our listing below:Chicken Tangdi KebabThe leg-pieces of the chicken are well-marinated with curd and condiments overnight that make the fibres juicy when you pick a bite with fresh, warm qaboos. Your gastronomic joy doubles up when you dip your morsel into a bowlful of green chutney and tuck rings of an onion and there you go with the blast of flavours in your mouth. We recommend Deccan Restaurant, Somajiguda. The price is also cool, I220 for four pieces. What more can you ask for.Mutton ShikampuriShikam means womb in Persian, and true to its name this delicate kebab offers you a treasure as you scoop its belly with your spoon. What you taste is a wonderful blend of spices, mint leaves, dry fruits and hung curd tucked inside minced mutton roundlets which are cooked over a skillet. Served with dahi chutney, its taste is just heavenly. Try it at Chichas, Lakdi Ka Pul. Price: I199Chicken Peshawari KebabIt comes both in bone and boneless form and has an interesting piece of history attached to it. In earlier ages, Persian and Turk soldiers used to roast meat on fire that hung from their swords. It had to be eaten immediately as the troops kept moving. In our times, the restaurants have been doing a good job. At the newly opened restaurant Mashaal, these are prepared with cheese, herbs and cream. The spices dont go to the bone, but nonetheless make the fibres delicious. Price: I280Murgh Banno KebabSavour it at Kebab Stories, the rooftop restaurant of Zaiqa-e-Hyderabad. Its a boneless chicken delicacy prepared with yellow chilies, curd, roasted gram powder, and slow cooked in tandoor. And no thats not the end, it goes for another round of cooking i.e., the pieces are coated with beaten eggs and roasted on hot charcoals. No wonder, it lives up to its royal Nawabi name. Price: I345"

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

The teachers and principal are trying to get the onion removed, Class 4 student Bharti told Hindustan Times.Teachers in the school allege that the district administration authorities got the entire produce of onions dumped at the school ground.I asked the officials to at least cover the mound with gravel or sand but they did not listen to us. They told us that government had issued the order to dump it in open, said school teacher Naval Kishore Pateriya.The problem of rotting onions has swept Madhya Pradesh that is battling a farm crisis. More than 40 farmers have killed themselves since five died in police firing in Mandsaur a month ago while protesting for better crop prices and a loan waiver.local residents complained that rotten onion had been dumped near a residential colony. (HT PHOTO)A supply glut  the yield of onions this year is 30% more than that of the previous year  has sent prices crashing. The government has decided to buy onions from farmers at higher-than-market prices but an absence of storage facilities has seen many tonnes of produce rotting in the rain.In the nearby Harpalpur town, local residents complained that rotten onion had been dumped near a residential colony.The bad and pungent smell is causing irritation in our eyes. Most of the residents have locked themselves in their houses due to the smell, said local resident Pushpendra Payak.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) BB Gangele said there must have be a miscommunication as there was no order to dump the rotten onion near a residential area or a school. We will take steps to cover rotten onion with sand. he added."

I started my career in Bengaluru, where my brother also worked as a chef. He taught me all about food. After having spent five years in Bengaluru, I moved to Chennai. I have been working at Chap Chay, The Raintree Hotel, for about six months now.I have been exposed to different varieties of food since my childhood. I have always understood and loved different cuisines and flavours. My brother and the chefs I have worked with in the last 12 years have inspired me. Every place that I have been trained in, I have learned and mastered a different cuisine under some of the best chefs. From Mumbai I learnt Japanese cuisine, a couple of Thai dishes from Bengaluru, from Chennai I learnt a lot of Chinese dishes and from Kolkata I picked up a couple of Cantonese dishes. So every place has made me a better chef and has taught me a lot. My specialities however are my Japanese, Chinese and Thai food.Each cuisine stands apart in terms of authentic flavouring. For example, we use a lot of tangy flavours in Shanghai food and in Cantonese and Chinese dishes we use very little spice. But we adjust the flavours as per the taste of the customers. In Chennai, people prefer more spices and tanginess, so even the authentic Chinese flavours have to be changed.I think my best and also my favourite dishes are dimsums. I also did a dimsum festival at the hotel recently. I love experimenting with dimsums and create new flavours. Broccoli and cheese dimsums, scallop and prawn dimsums, pork bun dimsum, beef dimsums are some of my most favourite varieties. I try out different varieties because nowadays people look for new and unique flavours.I have received a lot of appreciation for my broccoli and cheese dimsums. Mostly people prefer their dimsums with a dip, so I tried a couple of varieties with the kind of dips too. I tried four kinds of dips keeping in mind the kind of flavours and taste that guests want  spring onion and garlic, tangy chilli sauce, roasted sesame sauce and tomato and onion cold sauce."

Now, a month and half after commissioning of the pack house, it has gone haywire damaging thousands of bags of onion which were stored in it.Sources said a high-level meeting is scheduled to be held in Bhubaneswar among officials of Agriculture department, Apicol and district administration on the fate of onion growers whose crop has been damaged. The snag has exposed the apathy of the State Government towards providing infrastructure and promoting onion cultivation.Under Titilagarh sub-division, known as Nashik of Odisha, onion is grown on 20,000 hectares (ha) in Titilagarh, Muribahal and Bangomunda blocks. In the absence of infrastructure to conserve the produce, the crop is getting badly affected resulting in distress sell year after year. The pack house was expected to change the scenario.The pack house was constructed at an estimated cost of `5 crore. Although it was ready for commissioning by 2014-end, the only hurdle was that there was no proper electricity connection as transfer of land and financial sanction were mired in red tape. The unit has capacity to store 900 tonnes of onion and the facility was finally commissioned on May 15.The onion stored in the unit was supposed to be kept under controlled temperature, before it developed technical snag. The 100-odd tonnes initially stored in the pack house germinated exposing the fact that temperature was not being controlled. To add to the woes, there is no power back-up and long hours of power cut were inevitable. Farmers alleged that they were informed at the last moment to shift their stored produce but there was hardly anything left to shift. They said the crop was not insured and there was little hope of getting any returns affecting them further.Sources said it is being planned to compensate the farmers at `4 per kg for damaged onion. About 3,350 bags of onion have been damaged. Contacted, Deputy Director, Horticulture, Balangir P K Swain admitted that there was technical snag and hoped that the problem in the Integrated Pack House would be resolved soon.Sub-collector Girish Chandra Singh said the grievances of the farmers would be looked into."

With shops and markets closed since last Sunday and supply chains cut off, people are being forced to choose between hunger and an artificial inflation.Supplies are dwindling and prices of vegetable, chicken, egg, fish, mutton and other perishable items are heading north.While fish, chicken and mutton have almost vanished from some of the markets, certain vegetables and eggs are still available but their prices however have touched a point that not many can afford for long.With prohibitory orders in the entire area and vehicles staying off the roads, supply of essential commodities in the area was badly hit. (Samir Jana)Ruma Mandal, a homemaker from the Chapapara area near Basirhat town is serving only potato curries to her family for the last few days. It is the only vegetable available in the local markets ever since tension gripped this area on Monday, she said. But potato is selling at a premium. Last week I paid Rs 8 for a kilo and today I bought two kilos for Rs 24, she complained.Price of onion is skyrocketing as well. Srinath Ghosh, a resident of the Bhyabla area, said onion used to sell for Rs 20 a kilo before a Facebook post he didnt even see changed his life. Now we are paying anything between Rs 30 and 32. Most of the shops are closed and there is an acute shortage of supply. Whatever little is coming to the markets is flying off the shelves before you can bat your eyelids. Most of the shopkeepers are taking the advantage of the situation, said Ghosh.A Trinamool Congress party office that was ransacked by locals at Mailakhola in Basirhat on Thursday. (Samir Jana)The humble egg is not far behind in the race. Price of a pair of poultry chicken eggs has increased from Rs 10 to Rs 16, said Rintu Sahana, a resident of Mailakhali area.Not willing to be quoted, a district administration official explained the real reason behind the shortage in food at Basirhat. The difference in the demographic character of Basirhat town and that of the adjoining villages is responsible for this inflation, he said.The town population comprises mostly Hindus while most of the villagers are Muslims. Markets in and around the town are heavily dependent on these villages for their daily supply of vegetable, mutton, fish, chicken and eggs. Ever since the violence started, the villagers have stopped supplying farm and animal products to the town people, he said."

We are here to ensure that it doesnt happen anymore, read a message from HariPotter.Similarly, another drug vendor Madlyfooted announced Lets make Indian DNM scene bright again, and Flipkart, another vendor, announced Namaste and welcome to our humble abode. We are The Majestic Garden rising star rated vendor.Although it has been known for a long time that drugs are sold on darknet websites, Indian drug vendors are also taking to this platform to sell drugs without much worry of law enforcement authorities, thanks to anonymity provided by the software The Onion Router (TOR), reveals an investigation by Express.The Majestic Garden to which Flipkart refers to is a DNM. There are others like Dream Market, Valhalla, Alpha Bay and Hansa. The announcement by Madlyfooted was underneath a listing for clean and uncut Bolivian cocaine along with review of quality of the cocaine with a picture of it. The vendors also provide escrow services where one can track the consignment. DNMs are like any other e-commerce portals where payment has to be made in Bitcoins.DNMs have various filters include rating of a vendor and also from which country the drugs will be shipped and to where. DNMs sell a wide range of drugs like psychedelics, opioids, dissociatives, ecstacy, steroids, cannabis, benzos, barbiturates and prescription drugs.Indian drug vendors sell a wide range of prescription drugs like Benzodiazepines (antidepressants) like Xanax, Barbiturates (central nervous system depressants), pain killers like Tramadol and erectile dysfunction medicines like Tadalafil which are misused by drug addicts. While school students might not be able to buy these drugs online, drug peddlers and addicts having basic knowledge of computer, can easily buy drugs from darknet.Indian drug peddlers are using even India Post services for delivering the drugs, as claimed by an Indian drug vendor on Dream Market. Some vendors also send through their personal courier networks.When contacted, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Cyber Crime), Hyderabad police, KCS Raghuveer said, Till now there has been no case reported to us involving drugs bought or sold on darknet. If there is a case, it is not impossible to catch hold of the drug peddlers since drugs have to be delivered physically. Moreover, we also have very good infrastructure in place which can help tracing these drug peddlers.Cops upset over political interference?HYDERABAD: The crackdown on drug racket in city seems to have created a divide between the police officials and politicians. A day after a cabinet minister reportedly expressed unhappiness over the excise and prohibition department exposing educational institutes from where students got addicted to drugs, senior police officers are understood to have been upset over political interference in the case. Police officials are of the opinion that there is nothing wrong in cracking the whip on drug peddling.When school management notices a student doing wrong, it will bring the matter to the notice of his/her parents in an attempt to mend ways of student. In the same manner, the excise enforcement officials wrote letters to schools/college managements asking them to take measures to sensitise their students on effects of drug abuse after a few students were found purchasing drugs from peddlers. Government must appreciate the police for cracking whip on drug peddlers, a senior police officer felt. It is also said that upset over the political interference, a senior officer involved in drug bust kept himself away from media glare citing fever. Meanwhile, DGP Anurag Sharma on Friday held meet with police commissioners and SPs asking them to be vigilant against drug peddlers."

There has been no permanent mechanism of MSP in the state.Apart from loan waiver, farmers organisations have been demanding passage of a farmers security Act and implementation of the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission.People who are supporting farmers demands will gather at Gandhi Circle in Jaipur on Sunday and observe a one-day fast, Jat said. Farmers will wear black bands to show solidarity.RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) had started a mahapadao (sit-in) on June 15, but called off the agitation on June 19 after holding talks with the state government.That government assured BKS that a law would be brought in to make buying of farmers produce below MSP a punishable offence. A committee will study the laws in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Electronic weighing machines, the government said, will be installed in all mandis in six months.The government did not give any assurance on farm loan waiver. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab have waived farmers loans.Holding talks with BKS representatives and assurances given to them was an eyewash, Jat said, adding that 26 associations would support the July 9 protest.Last month, farmers restricted milk, grain and vegetable supply in several districts of Rajasthan after the Kisan Mahapanchayat called a bandh to support the farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh.

In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.The parallels are obvious. The show at Laahar will be Madhavraos son, Jyotiradityas, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singhs constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.Loud and VisibleThe preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindias rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.Tapping into Farmers AngerWith the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. It started with Scindiajis satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singhs constituency.BJP puts up brave frontThe BJP too realises the Congresss game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers anger through a slew of measures  visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers, he said."

Apparently, the prices of veggies from Tamil Nadu go on an upward spiral once they cross the border at Kumily.As per the price list on Tuesday, the difference in the cost of vegetables in the markets of Kumily and Cumbum - the nearest town in Tamil Nadu - ranges from zero to 350 per cent. Authorities are struggling to find a reason for the difference even after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system removing separate taxes at the frontiers.In fact, the vegetable suppliers incur only transportation cost, said Joseph Sebastian, a vegetable vendor. Yet, they are charging an unfair price. We cant understand the reason for such a huge difference as Cumbum is only 23 km away from Kumily.The biggest difference is in the price of cucumber. While it costs Rs 15 per kg in Tamil Nadu, it is sold at Rs 50 per kg in Kerala. There is a difference of up to 50 per cent in the price of other vegetables. However, the price of a few other items are a notch higher in Tamil Nadu.Oops! They go through the roofThe prices of vegetables soared in the retail market in Palakkad district sharing its border with Tamil Nadu. The price of cowpea is Rs 60 per kg, while ladies finger is Rs 70 per kg. The price of tomato was Rs 50 per kg and onion touched Rs 110 per kg. Madhu, a vegetable merchant from Koduvayur, said as it was not seasonal, the prices were on the higher side. Ramesh, a consumer, said the budget was going haywire even for a small family. It costs Rs 300 to Rs 500 to purchase vegetables for a week.Salad days are here again Residents of the district can now dig into their favourite vegetarian dishes without feeling the pinch. The retail markets in Kozhikode witnessed a considerable decrease in the price of vegetables after the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)."

A large number of people mainly the poor rush to the railway station and dumping grounds to pick onion for use. If they consume rotten onion, it could affect their heath.Hence, Chandra said, they have decided to dump the rotten onion at the power plant that faces shortage of solid waste needed to run the plant efficiently. The cost of generating power from onion would be Rs 6 per unit, almost double from polluting coal and about 50 paisa higher than solar.In addition, the government has also decided to convert onion into manure.Jabalpur administration has taken a good step and nearby district can dump their onion at the power plant, Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation, managing director, Dnyaneshwar Patil said. But it is not possible to send the onion from other districts for power generation as transportation cost will add to the losses. We have asked them to dump the onion to produce manure.New and renewable energy department principal Secretary Manu Srivastava, said, It is a very good decision. Due to shortage of waste products, the water based power plant is not being utilised properly. Extra transportation cost is an issue. Otherwise, onion from distant places could have brought to the plant too.ends"

Poor supply from neighbouring States like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as well as drought in Tamil Nadu has pushed the prices up and, recently, many retail shops simply dont have any.Small onions, also known as sambhar vengayam in trade lingo, is an inevitable ingredient of Tamil cuisine. S Chandran, the president of the Koyambedu Wholesale Merchants Association, said: The market used to get Rs 40-50 tonnes of small onions per day from Karnataka, but it is now reduced to half. For example, today we received only 20 tonnes which has triggered the rise in price.At the Koyambedu wholesale market, the lowest quality of small onions is sold at Rs 80-90. The price goes up to Rs 100 for a better lot. In Koyambedus retail market, the minimum price is Rs 100 per kg. The price in the T Nagar retail market is between Rs 100-120.The Koyambedu market procures small onions from the Trichy markets which actually gets its supply from Mysore in Karnataka, Thuraiyur and Perambalur in Tamil Nadu.Lack of rainfall has affected the small onion yield in our State forcing us to depend on neighbouring states for supply, said R Jayakumar, a wholesale trader at Koyambedu market. Small onions being our major product of trade, we usually tend to buy at least 5 tonnes per day. But we now limit ourselves to 2 tonnes due to inadequacy in supply and hence the price hike. At normal times, the price of small onions would be as low as Rs 20-30 per kg, he added.We usually get at least 3-4 kg of small onions but with this price, we just have to cut down its usage. If we spend Rs 400 on small onions alone, it will really hit our budget, said a couple who were purchasing at a semi-wholesale small onion shop at Koyambedu market.I just have to replace it with big onions wherever possible, said B Ambika, at the vegetable market in T Nagar, lamenting that sambhar wont be the same without small onions.In contrast to small onions, big onions were available at just Rs 15 per kg at the retail markets of the city."

The page has been shared by a large number of people and is viral in WhatsApp as well. This would be detrimental to the health care system in particular and, in general, encourage such people who cheat the gullible public, he said.Further, Nayak said, Earlier, Shalini Rajneesh had posted about mid-brain activation, a fraud in which children are expected to read with blindfold. One of her posts had even advocated auto urine therapy for HIV, cancer and a number of such diseases. This sort of a thing is going to be detrimental to the promotion of public health when a top bureaucrat promotes such absurdities on social media, he said and appealed to minister to take action on this matter to stop posting of such fraudulent method of health care."

However, the press statement has not convinced the doctors.The statement says, In an attempt to spread information about the utility of simple add-on therapies like decoction of amruta balli, papaya leaves and onion, material pertaining to prevention and adjuvant therapy is being circulated. The ingredients are commonly available, cost effective and generally, would not cause an untoward reaction in the body.The classical texts of Ayurveda (Sushruta Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Dhanvantri Nighantu and a textbook on Dravyaguna) mention the use of onion as a haemostatic agent in bleeding disorders. To check bleeding, platelets are inevitable, and the combination of palm jaggery and onion would usher in that effect, the statement reads.People may contact AYUSH doctors working across the state in various dispensaries and seek more information regarding preventive and adjuvant therapy for dengue. There are 1,400 AYUSH doctors working in various government hospitals, it says.Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, consultant physician, Spandana Centre for Metabolic Medicine, Mangaluru, said, Dengue is not a bleeding disorder. Reduction of platelets is not the primary problem in dengue. It is one of the complications. There may be inflammation of blood capillaries and thereafter leakage, resulting in reduction of platelet count. By recommending something that is used for blood disorders for dengue as a remedy, the officials are further misleading the laymen.There is no mention of the word virus in Charaka Samhita. When something does not even recognise the infection, how can they recommend remedy? The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme and WHO have a standard protocol for clinical management of dengue and it only mentions modern medicine, not AYUSH. When infectious diseases are not even mentioned in Ayurveda, how can they prescribe treatment, primary or adjuvant or otherwise? he questioned.Shalini Rajneesh was unavailable for comment. Dr Anant Desai, Associate Professor, Government Ayurveda College, said, We are merely saying it helps in controlling bleeding and can be used as a home remedy, not as a cure. During fever-like conditions, jaggery helps and onion has haemostatic agents."

There were seven people in the room but no one is sure as to when Rehnumas hair was chopped off.Meri bitiya subah-subah apne baal dekh ke rone lagi. Kisi cheez ne uske baal kaat diye (My granddaughter started crying after seeing her chopped hair. Something cut her hair), said Kaisar Jahan, 62, grandmother of Rehnuma.The incident that took place on August 3 was the first case of mysterious hair-chopping in Braj and Rohilkhand region. Five other cases came to light on the same day.People have applied turmeric and henna on their gates to avoid attacks. (Sachin Saini/HT Photo)In all the cases, women found their braids chopped off mysteriously and some of them also fell ill.In Mojampur village of Badaun, about 80 kilometres from Bareilly, a woman, Somwati, 32, had to be hospitalised after her braid was cut mysteriously.The incident took place at around 11 am on Thursday. After finding her hair chopped off, Somwati fainted and was rushed to the community health centre.In another case, Tabassum, 22, a resident of Bisauli town area in Badaun district, was sitting alone in a room at around 4 pm on Thursday (????) when she realised that a part of her braid has been chopped off by someone.When I turned around I saw a cat sitting near my hair. She disappeared as soon as my mother entered the room, Tabassum murmured from behind her red veil as her mother caressed her.She complained of uneasiness and nausea after the incident and was admitted to a private hospital.Initially, the local police did not play attention to these incidents but when the news reached Lucknow, teams rushed to the affected areas to take stock of the situation and collect evidence. The mass hysteria soon grabbed media attention.After the incident in our village, we didnt sleep all night. Everyone prayed to Allah for the safety of women and children, said Mohd Munaf Raza Khan, a resident of Mojampur village.Apart from prayers, villagers have started using others means to protect themselves. They are dipping their palms in turmeric and leaving its impression at the entrance of their houses to ward off evil.In the absence of turmeric, people are using henna, black paint or soil. Some people have fixed twigs of neem on the doors while others are putting green chillies, lemon, garlic and onion in their houses.The more cautious ones are applying mahawar or aalta (red dye) on their hands and feet. Women have started tying their hair in tight buns and covering it with dupattas.Residents of Banna Devi area of Aligarh, 132 km from Bisauli in Badaun, have also adopted various means to save themselves after a teenage girls hair was chopped off on Thursday evening.Reena Kumar, 16, a resident of Illiaspur locality near Aligarh, was alone at her house when she found a bunch of hair near her feet.I dont remember much as I was terrified, she said when asked how she could identify her hair in the dark.She is just a child, how much can she remember, her elder brother chipped in before she could finish. He added people were terrified after the incident.Ironically, mass hysteria rules the roost in the region where the incidents have done maximum damage.Barely 110 km away from Aligarh, an elderly woman was lynched by a group which branded her a witch on the suspicion that she was involved in hair chopping incidents.Police said Maan Devi, 60, a resident of Mutani in Agra, lost her way and reached another part of the village. Her son claimed she had weak eyesight and was returning home after attending the call of the nature.Some people claimed she was a witch behind chopping of womens hair and beat her up. She was taken to the hospital where she succumbed to injuries.The post-mortem report mentioned myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to physical shock as cause of her death. Police have charged two men with murder and have arrested one of them.She (Maan Devi) belonged to Jatav community and her attackers were Baghels. Her death has pitched the people of one community against the other, said Sumesh Singh, a member of the village panchyat.Bhoot ke chakkar main gaon main ek ko bhoot bana diya.

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs Neemuch-Mandsaur belt are feeling cheated as well. Just two months ago they were facing police bullets for demanding better prices for their bumper crop of onions, which they had to dump by the truckloads on the streets.In January-February, the same region had seen protests over a tomato glut, with prices crashing to as low as Rs 2 per kg. The subsequent onion bumper crop dragged its price to Rs 2 a kilogram, forcing many farmers to let their produce rot in the fields.We have noticed that whenever farmers have perishable items with them, the prices are in the dumps, and the moment it goes into the hands of traders, there is a massive price spike, says Bhupendra Patidar, a farmer from Barbariya village in Neemuch district.Six farmers were killed in clashes with police in the Neemuch-Mandsaur region in the first week of June, leading to protests across the state and a demand for government assured minimum price at local markets. The protests forced the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to procure onions at Rs 8 per kg.Two months down the line, when the farmers have nothing to sell and are busy sowing for the next season, the prices of most agriculture products have shot up.In May, the average price of tomatoes in Mandsaurs wholesale market was Rs 500-700 per quintal. In August first week, it touched Rs 4,500. Similarly, the price of onions almost doubled from Rs 400 to Rs 800 per quintal during the same period.Skyrocketing prices Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few months Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few monthsWith local traders adding their profit margin, tomatoes are retailing at Rs 100 or more per kg in most parts of the country. The retail price of onion has crossed Rs 30 per kg, with a further spike expected till the fresh produce lands in September.Small and marginal farmers who constitute 85% of the farming community rarely get the benefit of high prices. The reason being they dont have storage facilities to take benefit of the price fluctuation, says Patidar, who witnessed the dumping of unsold onions and tomatoes by the roadside this year.After last years losses, like most farmers, we did not grow tomatoes this season. But now the prices are sky high and only the traders have it, says Jaswant Carpenter of Pipliyamandi, the epicentre of the farmers protest in Mandsaur.Traders, however, blame low production for tomato prices sky-rocketing.There is less production this year and therefore low supply. Most of it is in the hands of the big traders who are releasing it slowly from the cold storage so that the prices do not come down, says a government official in Indore, not wanting to be named.Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma blames the government for the price fluctuations. In the last 14 years, the government has failed to increase storage capacity for onions or tomatoes as a result of which vegetables rot during bumper production and only traders benefit by hoarding it.Given the current spate of rains and floods, traders see no relief in sight due to supply disruption which is likely to continue till August-end. In fact, prices of other vegetables such as brinjal and cabbage will also rise due to reduced supply as the summer vegetable season comes to an end.(With inputs from Mustafa Hussain)"

Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

Traders attribute it to shortage of supply within the state due to excess rain, coinciding with cut down in regular supply by other states.In the retail market, the price of the bell-weather vegetable  tomato  has increased from Rs 20-30/kg to Rs 80/kg. Prices of almost all fresh vegetables, barring onion and potato, have increased by over 100%.Sameer Singh, a software profession, was surprised when confronted by the hike in vegetable prices. ""I had last purchased vegetables last Sunday (June 25), when prices were stable. But today, I was taken aback by vegetable prices, which have shot up by over 100%. In particular, prices of tomatoes, cucumbers and coriander have skyrocketed,"" said Singh, resident of Sector 15, adding he hopes prices will settle down in a few weeks.Amrita Yadav, a resident of Sector 10A, has cut down on her family's vegetable consumption in the wake of the price rise. ""We were eating lots of salad for the past few months. But with prices of cucumber, tomato and coriander rising significantly, we had to remove salad from our menu,"" said homemaker Yadav.According to traders, prices rose mainly due to contraction in supply of vegetables after the rains. Inderjeet Thakran, president of Khandsa Market Association, said, ""Supply has reduced by 40% in a week, leading to increase in prices.""""Across north India, most agricultural fields are submerged,"" said Thakran, adding prices rise every year after rains, and are expected to settle down in 2-3 weeks. ""Prices are expected to fall by this month-end. You will see correction in prices of some of the vegetables later this week itself,"" he said.He added that tomato, which had remained relatively cheap so far due to local supply, will remain costly for some time, even as prices of other vegetables come down.""Local tomato supply has ended. Currently, we're getting tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh, and supply is low. But, this happens during monsoons every year"" said Thakran, adding that from next month, tomatoes from Bengaluru and Nasik will arrive to bring down price."

Also, there are three railway port centres at Gede, Radhikapur and Singabad. Over Rs 25 crore worth of goods are transported through these ports daily. Bulk of the export to Bangladesh comprises stone chips, boulders, fly ash, onion, fruits and spices.Movement of trucks have been severely affected with exporters unable to furnish their GST registration. In addition, land port stations are yet to be equipped with basic infrastructure like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system.Though the GST regime began on Saturday, problems surfaced on Sunday when trucks started plying after the Eid holiday in Bangladesh. Uzzwal Saha, secretary of West Bengal Exporters' Coordination Committee, said many exporters were unable to provide the GST registration number because they had not received it yet.Also, apart from Petrapole, none of the land port centres has EDI. As a result, Customs is refusing to pass the goods. ""We had repeatedly requested the Centre to improve the infrastructure before introducing GST. But no one paid heed,"" Saha said.Samir Ghosh, an exporter at Mahadipur, said most of the goods that are currently in transit had been booked before GST was rolled out. ""Customs is refusing to clear the items without GST. At Mahdipur alone, 2,000 trucks are stranded,"" he said.Exporters fear losses to mount as some of the goods are perishables like onion and fruits that will rot if the delay is long.At the Hili border, over 1,000 trucks are held up. Ashok Mandal, an exporter in Hili, said there was no clarity on when the situation would improve. ""All are confused. We are yet to get a notification from Customs. They too are in the dark about how much tax will be levied on our items,"" he said.Though Hili has been declared an EDI port, it does not have the requisite infrastructure to transact electronically. ""We used to submit the purchase bill to the Customs after the transit. But now they are demanding it before we send the items. It really poses a major problem for us,"" said Mandal. Frustrated with the situation, a section of exporters are contemplating a strike at the ports."

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

About 300 acres are under onion cultivation alone in these villages and the farmers raised the crop twice a year.The severe drought conditions affected the onion crop too in a big way across the district. The harvesting of onion in the last season took place in the Tamil month of Maasi about five months ago. The farmers in the last season could get only 25 % of the regular produce due to the drought.The failure of monsoon forced the onion farmers to wait for the last few months. The widespread rainfall experienced in the district for a few consecutive days last month revived the hopes of the farmers. The crop required sufficient soil moisture during its growing period and the rainfall paved way for the same.The farmers have already completed sorting and segregating the seedlings raised in their fields and also procured from Perundurai, another famous onion centre in Erode district. They will be sowing the medium sized bulbs soon.According to V. Thangamani, a farmer of Alathur village, the district did not have any rainfall for months together. The rainfall received a month ago prompted the farmers to sow the bulbs now.She admitted that they were sowing the seed onion in the hope that it would rain in a month of two and thus save them from disaster. Even 3 to 5 cm of rainfall would be of immense support to the standing crop, she said. The harvesting is expected by September end.She laments that the groundwater level had plummeted in various villages. Even if we have to sink borewells, we have to go a depth of 1,000 feet. For sinking new borewells, farmers have to spend a minimum of Rs. 2 lakh. If we dont get adequate water, it will prove a disaster for us. We have to spend much even for the renovation of the existing borewells, Mrs. Thangamani said.The villagers usually market the onion crop in Erode and Komarapalayam, major markets of the western belt. However, the poor price offered by traders and middlemen is always a matter of great concern for them.R. Sathish Kumar, another farmer, says that the onion farmers will be able to fetch reasonable profit if they market the produce themselves in the local markets and weekly santhais. But with limited resources, they cannot do much and have to be at the mercy of the traders and middlemen in fixing the rate.A cross section of the farmers of the district have pleaded with the State Government to set up modern onion godowns, as done in Perambalur district."

The farmers have been seeking loan waiver and better prices for their crops.""The MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) benefit for export of onions, fresh or chilled, is extended up to September 30 this year,"" the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said in a notification.Wholesale prices fell by an average of Rs 5.50 per kg at Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) in June, Asia's biggest onion market, during last month from an average of Rs 8.50 per kg in the year-ago period.Maharashtra is the top onion producer in the country.At present, the arrival of 2017-18 kharif (summer) onion is in full swing, not only in Maharashtra but also in other states like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat.It may be noted that 20 per cent of the country's total onion output is grown during the kharif season.Since the kharif onion cannot be stored, farmers sell off the produce in domestic as well as overseas markets.The arrival of quality onions has boosted exports in the last few weeks.

Prices may increase as demand rises.Prices of several other vegetables have touched Rs 100 per kg or are nearing that mark.Brinjal's price has crossed Rs 50 per kg. Prices of ladyfingers, cluster beans, and green beans have gone past the Rs 50 per kg threshold in the retail market.""Prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of heavy rains in the city,"" said Deepak Patel, the secretary of the APMC. ""Whenever there is a long spell of rain in the state, prices increase.""He said that prices usually stabilize when water recedes from fields.He said that the state was banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and the south because rain has washed away around 25% of crops. But steady demand was increasing prices, he said.Sources in the APMC said that the demand for the tomatoes will increase as the shravan month begins in a week for North Indians, and by the end of the month for Gujaratis and Maharashtrians. During shravan, people avoid onion and garlic and hence the demand for tomatoes and other vegetables shoots up.It is worth recalling that farmers in the state did not receive good prices for their produce earlier this year; they were forced to throw away the produce on the roads. However, Radheshyam Marwadi, a trader in Memnagar , said that prices are likely to dip later this month. But they will increase again in August and September."
