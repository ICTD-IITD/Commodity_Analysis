Chief minister's announcement for door-to-door collection of toys for poor kids could not take off after the famers' protest and killings in Mandsaur.The agitation was followed by a problem of plenty with bumper yield of onions, which forced government to announce its procurement at Rs 8 per kg. Sources close to the CM said atmosphere was not favourable in state for going ahead with the move. Besides, the administration was also busy over sapling plantation drive on July 2 that is aimed to create a world record.Taking the concept of 'Deewar-e-Mehrbani' or Neki ki Deewar' (wall of kindness), a step further, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced to go door-to-door and to ask for used clothes and toys for the poor kids. Not only CM, the ministers were also supposed to visit cities which they are in-charge of, and collect clothes and toys from the houses.CM expressed the willingness to do so two months ago after which the officials swung into action. ""It was aimed to motivate people to donate, but the 'more serious' issues that cropped up after the announcement did not give time to plan the project"", said a senior official.However, to compensate it, the state's happiness department has now written letters to all district collectors to motivate people for donating used toys at the Anand Sthals- the name given by state government to Neki ki Deewar in MP.There are 172 Anand Sthals across 51 districts of the state. In Bhopal, there are six Anand Sthals including those at TT Nagar Stadium, Concept English Medium School TT Nagar, Swarna Jayanti Park on Kolar Road, near Daulat Ram Dharmshala in Bairagarh, Govindpura industrial association building and Sanjay swimming pool in Koh-e-Fiza.Principal secretary to CM, SK Mishra said the programme is in the pipeline. CM had expressed willingness to take the project forward and things would be finalised soon.Wall of kindness was a citizen-driven initiative that was first started in Mashhad, a north-eastern city of Iran with installation of few hooks and hangers on a wall called 'Deewar-e-Mehrbani' with words 'If you don't need it, leave it. If you need it, take it,' written next to it. The initiative soon became a viral movement and spread like wildfire across the globe with people painting walls and joining this humanitarian initiative."

Despite huge production of onion in the state, consumers continue to get it at a rate of Rs 10 to 20 per kg in the market.Owing to big mismanagement in storage of onions, several hundred tonnes of bulbs has already been buried across the state after it started making lives of people miserable due to its bad smell. Dumping the rotten onions itself requires huge efforts on the part of the government. Black decomposed onion bulbs could be seen littered along 6 kms stretch of a highway on Chattarpur-Jhansi road.Officials requisitioned trucks to remove them from the roadside. This year 32 lakh metric tonnes of onion production took place in the state. With just about 10% capacity to store the produce in the state, the government spent more than Rs 600 crore in purchasing the onion from farmers.Government sources said there is no estimate of how much onion purchased from farmers has been destroyed.Amidst all this, a 50-kg sack of onion was sold in Bhopal mandi on Monday at a price of Rs 300 to Rs 400, depending upon the quality. The bigger bulbs and those pink in colour fetch a better price. Abdool Raqib, president of the wholesalers association of onion and potatoes, said: "" After flooding the mandis a few days back, onions have disappeared now as major quantity of the commodity has been exhausted from the local markets and has been transported outside the state. Those who have the capacity to hold it back, are likely to sell it at premium rates in the coming months. The effect will be felt by the month-end"".Wholesalers from Maharashtra Delhi and even from Kolkatta purchased onions from Madhya Pradesh at a rate of Rs 2 a kg and transported it to bigger cities. Besides, the government started diverting the onion to district headquarters by trains and trucksto be sold at fair price shops. In the meantime, onions began to rot at two places  mandis where the farmers unloaded them for a price of Rs 8 a kg and then at railway stations where it was dumped due to lack of proper transportion, government sources said.In Manasa village of Dhar district, mountains of onion were formed when hundreds of dumpers started bringing the produce, only to be destroyed for want of storage. Additional district magistrate of Dhar DK Nagendra told TOI,""We have buried 15,000 to 18,000 metric tonnes of onion. About 100 metric tonne is still stored and some of it may also be destroyed. The district administration has a target of selling 1200 metric tonnes from fair price shops"", he said. More than 600 kms away from Dhar, mounds of onion could be seen littered all along the stretch of highways. Before dumping more than 18,000 quintal of onion in trenches created by digging of murram (red clay) on Naugaon-Harpalpur road, the onion was littered on the roadside, Mangailal Yadav , a resident of Kukrel village said. After the villagers complained of foul smell, it was buried. For some days, students of Khushipura primary school stopped attending classes because of the stench of decaying onion bulbs. Latto Prasad Shriwas, headmaster of a primary school, had complained after which the onion was removed. BB Gangale, sub divisional magistrate at Naugaon, said: "" About 18000 quintal was dumped in the mine area. This was the same onion that was lying at Harpalpur railway station creating trouble to passengers. Five special trains loaded with onion had dumped the produce at Chhatrpur's Harpalpur railway station""."

Until last week, onion was selling at Rs 15-18 per kg but this week it has reached Rs 25-30 per kg. As they are used in almost all dishes, rise in prices of tomato and onions always disrupts the household budget.Wholesale price of onion has gone up from Rs 6-8 per kg to Rs 15-18 per kg. As per traders, the hike is because of incessant rains in Maharashtra , from where the state and city gets maximum supply.Another major reason is GST (Goods and Services Tax). ""Most of the transport companies have not revised their systems under GST so very few trucks are plying. Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance. ""Shopping from mandi costs a little less than from street vendors, so I go to Dubagga mandi and buy whatever I want all at once,"" she said.Though the cost of tomato has dropped in wholesale markets in the past few days, it continues to sell at Rs 100-120 per kg in the city. ""For the past three days, tomatoes are selling at Rs 60-65 per kg in the wholesale market. Price dropped because supply is getting back to normal,"" said Rizwan, wholesale trader."

The protest is against the government's decision to reallocate tomato sheds with a section of traders blaming another group of illegal occupation of these facilities.""About 85-90% of the mandi is likely to be shut. Some commission agents may continue to operate but almost everyone has promised to join in. We informed growers about Monday's strike last week. Trucks that were due to arrive at the mandi on Sunday night or early Monday won't come,"" said Metha Ram Kriplani, a vegetable trader.Last week, after meeting both groups that have been blaming each other of encroachment, development minister Gopal Rai had announced that the reallocation would be done based on the market fees submitted by traders over the past three years.""There is a cartel that needs to be broken. The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,"" said a senior official. As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon."

Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying ""it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from APMC Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association"". The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds. We stand by our decision to go on a strike from Monday because we believe that vested interests have prevailed upon the government to take this decision,"" said Metharam Kriplani , a trader.The notice issued by the government, after meetings with both sets of traders on Tuesday, says that fresh allotments of tomato sheds will be made on the basis of the market fee received from individual commission agents in the past three financial years  2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. ""This will be done on the pattern of allotment made for potato and onion trade,"" said a senior government official."

The programme is run to ensure that students in these government primary schools (1 yr to 5 years) and upper primary schools (6 to 8 years) get to study on a full stomach.""We have been told by teachers and principals that the attendance in schools has improved, and the students are able to concentrate better after the meal,"" says Prashant Bhagat, head of operations here.An initiative of ISKCON temple in Bengaluru, the NGO runs 30 kitchens, which provide meals to 1.6 million students in 13,800 schools across 12 states. ""Our motto is unlimited food for education, and we try to ensure that no child goes without food and education,"" says Bhagat. All the food is called prasadam, as it is first offered to god, Bhagat adds.The kitchen in Nagpur, which was inaugurated by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, is the first such initiative in the state. It was fully sponsored by Vandana Datar Tilak, an NRI residing at Los Angeles in the USA, and operates the Akshaya Patra chapter there. The second unit in the state has recently come up at Thane.

""For a month, when we started, we were serving vegetable khichadi and most of it would come back unconsumed. Then we discovered that in Maharashtra spicy food is eaten, and we started serving daal tadka, masala bhaat and spicy curry,"" informs Bhagat.The kitchen maintains standards set by FSSAI and HACCP, and utmost care is taken to ensure that no contamination or foreign material gets into the food. ""We use bio-degradable liquids to clean vegetables, vessels, and the kitchen floor and walls,"" says Roopanshi Kamal, in-charge of quality control.Akshaya Patra runs totally on donations.

Not a single rupee has come to us from the city,"" says Bhagat and adds that donations can be made by corporates or individuals here. ""We can even send our cashier to collect the amount and give a receipt, but we would like the donors to visit us so they can see the kitchen too,"" he adds."

To add to this, the state government spent Rs 2.88 crore to destroy these rotten onions This shocker was revealed in a written reply by the government to Congress MLA Shailendra Patel 's question in assembly. If that was last year's experience, it puts a question mark on onion procurement this year, where pictures of mounds of rotting onions being shoved into trenches by earth-moving machines or dumped by highways have gone viral.Patel, the MLA from Icchawar, said: ""I wanted to know the truth behind onion procurement and was shocked by the reply. It clearly reflects that the entire exercise of onion procurement. was to benefit traders and middlemen in the name of farmers,"" he said.With onion prices crashing to Re 1/kg last year, farmers were left with no option but to sell their produce at throwaway prices. When farmer resentment grew, the government stepped in and amid media glare announced in June that it would buy onions from farmers at Rs 6/kg. The initiative got overwhelming response from farmers, who queued up at the 64 procurement centres across MP.The government bought 10.4 lakh quintal onion for Rs 109 crore but three quarters of it got spoiled, says co-operatives minister Vishwas Sarang's reply. Giving a break-up of the expenses, he said Rs 62 crore was spent on payments to farmers, and Rs 47 crore on ""other expenses"", which included maintenance of rotten onions (Rs 2.88 crore) and payment of interest against the amount used for onion procurement (Rs 40 lakh). ""It would have been better if farmers were provided monetary assistance instead. Only 42 per cent of the Rs 109 crore was payment to farmers.

However, prices are high compared to previous Aadi seasons.Farmers say it is in the Tamil month of Aadi they start harvesting the summer crop. As the harvest has commenced and inflow of vegetables to markets has resumed, the prices have dropped.Tomato prices, which hovered around Rs 90-Rs 95 per kg last week, have dropped to Rs 80 on Tuesday morning. The price of small onions too has come down to Rs 85 per kg from Rs 95-Rs 100 in the past one month. Garlic, which cost Rs 200 per kg two months ago, is now priced at Rs 100 per kg.""Vegetables such as onions, chillies, tomatoes, and brinjal, among others, are ususally harvested this time of the year. And prices drop as they are easily availabile in markets,"" said Diriviyam, a farmer who comes to Uzhavar Sandhai in R S Puram. Since farmers anticipate a shortage of labour in the coming days, they have started harvesting whatever is grown. ""Several labourers will go on a pilgrimage in Aadi month. The crops, meanwhile, will start rotting after the onset of rain. So, we want to finish harvest as soon as possible,'' said a farmer.The prices are, however, still high compared to the previous Aadi months. Farmers say Rs 80 per kg for tomato is very high for this period of the year. Usually, vegetables such as tomato would be sold at throwaway prices during Aadi. This year, the cultivated area was less compared to previous years, due to water shortage. Also, the yield per acre has come down. ""On a normal year, the summer harvest will yield 10-20 tonnes of tomato per acre. Because of water shortage and extreme heat, the yield has dropped by 60% this year,"" said Senthil Kumar , a tomato farmer from Madhampatti.Farmers said they didn't expect the prices to drop further, a phenomenon usually witnessed as Aadi progresses. ""We have postponed harvest of onion to September after the rains,'' said Vijaykumar, a farmer, hinting that if at all there was a further price fall it would be after September. However, the cost of green chillies has been steadily increasing over the past one week, from Rs 30-Rs 40 per kg to Rs 88 on Tuesday. ""This is because chillies are coming from Mysuru. We are yet to get local stock from Erode, Chettipalayam and Thalavadi,'' said R Satheesh, a vegetable vendor at MGR Market."

BJP veteran and former chief minister Babulal Gaur is going to make the monsoon session a prickly one with a long list of questions  from the killing of farmers in police firing in Mandsaur and farmer suicide to illegal sand mining, Narmada Seva Yatra and onion purchase.The 87-year-old, who was dropped from the Cabinet on the 75-plus age criteria, has often embarrassed the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government by raising uncomfortable questions in the assembly and even in public. For instance, during the violent farmer agitation in June, he had rejected the government allegation that Congress was responsible for fomenting tension, pointing out that the Opposition didn't have the strength for it. This time, he has filed 16 questions, including many that the government is wary of discussing in the house.Congress is already going hammer and tongs at BJP on sensitive matters like disqualification of minister Narottam Mishra by EC and the farmers' unrest across the state. ""Now, Gaur is all set to make things worse by raising sensitive issues that suits the opposition,"" said a senior BJP leader.""I have raised about 16 queries in the house to know the status and government stand on schemes. I was assured about Metro Rail and Smart City projects, I also wanted to know about government's action after farmers' unrest and the firing in Mandsaur. More important is the issue of onion procurement, problems like malnutrition, Narmada Seva, Gau Raksha and funds for cow shelters,"" Gaur told TOI.Earlier, Gaur had embarrassed urban development minister Maya Singh by raising queries related to delays in Metro Rail and Smart City projects. The state leadership had to intervene to convince Gaur that work was being sped up on these projects. ""I'm an MLA and I will raise questions pertaining to development. I don't intend to embarrass the government, but I can't shun my responsibility of taking up issues of development in the assembly,"" Gaur reiterated.Gaur, perhaps the oldest politician in BJP in the state, recently announced that he will contest the assembly polls for the 11th time in 2018 from Govindpura seat of Bhopal where he is undefeated since 1980."

There has been no MEP for the past 19 months. ""The Centre is keeping a close watch on onion prices in wholesale markets,"" a government source told TOI.Members of the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) have attributed the price spurt to short supply on account of a lull in harvest.

Lasalgaon in Nashik is the country's biggest wholesale onion market.The official said the district's farmers, who are in financial trouble, preferred to store onions in the hope of getting better prices. He said that, in June, Lasalgaon received between 22,000 and 30,000 quintals of onions per day.Over the past two weeks, the supply is 12,000-20,000 quintals. ""This indicates that farmers have already sold the onions they had stored and they may have limited stocks now. Hence, the rise in price,"" a source added.Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The Madhya Pradesh government recently bought 80 lakh quintals following a rise in demand in the state.

Tomatoes are sold at Rs 55 per kg at wholesale outlets, while horticulture outlets are selling it at Rs 45 per kg.""The tomato production in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the tomatoes are sourced from, is slowly normalizing. As the supply is flowing in there, the stocks coming to Goa are also increasing leading to the drop in rates,"" said vendor Mohammad Rafiq.""New crop harvest is also awaited which will further increase the supply of tomatoes to the state,"" said vendor, Mehboob Niralgi.Horticulture officials remained optimistic that both tomato and onion rates will drop post-Ganesh Chaturthi season in Goa.The average wholesale onion price has shot up once again with 81% rise in just 24 hours at the country's largest wholesale onion market at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, due to rise in demand as compared to supply.The average wholesale onion prices increased by Rs 1,030 per quintal in just a day from Rs 1,270 per quintal on Wednesday to Rs 2,300 per quintal on Thursday (August 3). Agricultural produced market committee (APMC) sources claimed that the price will soar further and could touch Rs 3,000 per quintal within the next fortnight."

The retail price of onions in Nashik is expected to go up to Rs 30 per kg from the present Rs 20. The prices of the kitchen staple have already doubled from Rs 10 per kg to Rs 20 per kg in the last couple of weeks.The wholesale onion price had earlier touched a high of Rs 2,400 per quintal at Lasalgaon in November 19, 2015.Interestingly, the wholesale price has increased by over four times in just one month  from Rs 550 per quintal on July 3 to Rs 2,300 per quintal on Thursday. APMC sources said the price may rise further and touch Rs 3,000 per quintal within the next fortnight.Giving reasons for the spike in price, APMC sources said, ""The Madhya Pradesh government recently procured 80 lakh quintals of onions and has already disposed of the stock. Moreover, the flood-like situation in Gujarat Bihar and Rajasthan has damaged the onion crops there."" Sources said that the area under onion cultivation in the country has reduced leading to a rise in its demand from Maharashtra.Manoj Jain, a trader, said farmers who have stored onions are not ready to sell their stock at this juncture. ""Onions from the fresh kharif crop have arrived from some pockets, but in a very low quantity. With the flood-like situation damaging the crop in Gujarat and Rajasthan, the demand for onions from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have gone up, which has spiked onion prices,"" he said."

The rates were Rs 35 per kg two days ago. The supply has increased from 6,900 to 19,900 sacks.The authorities of agriculture produce market committee (APMC) believe that traders may be hoarding onion owing to which supply to APMC is not entering local retail market.The onion is supplied from areas such as Ahmednagar, Nashik, some parts of Pune and Satara. In other markets located at major places, the farmers fetched Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,600 per quintal for onion. Artificial shortage may further increase the price.An official of Kolhapur APMC, requesting anonymity, said, ""The difference between the price and the actual supply shows that the traders are stocking up the produce which may lead to increase in prices. The supply has increased and to reduce the price all the supplied onions should be brought into the retail market. The prices have tripled in last ten days and the initial reason for the increase was the shortage, caused due to increased demand from other places.""In the coming week fluctuations in onion prices will be observed owing to hoarding. The authorities claim that once prices reach the highest level there is a tendency of consumers to buy less. In such a situation the trader cannot hoard for a long time. The supply of onion is expected to increase in the next couple of weeks, after supply from regions of Solapur, Belgaum and some parts of northern Karnataka starts.Consumer activists have made an appeal to the district authorities to scrutinise the stock of traders. According to district officials surprise inspection will be carried out in the next few days, if onion prices do not come down as estimated."
5a0b2b129855b76bf13cd08a,"Fruit for thought: To pay less for tomatoes, can prejudice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/fruit-for-thought-to-pay-less-for-tomatoes-can-prejudice/,2017-07-16,"Whether you pronounce it to-may-to or to-maa-to (or tamaatar), there is nothing very Indian about the tomate, as Spanish Conquistadors called the fruit (yes, it is a fruit) that grew wild in the Andes. The word tomato itself comes from the word tomatl, its name in the Aztec language Nahuatl. Anglophones likely corrupted it to rhyme with potato. The French, trust them, called it pommes damour (love apples), believing it had aphrodisiacal properties.Stop right there if you are reaching for one. Even without libidinal attributes, the price of this squishy everyday companion to cooking (along with onion) has already hit a new high in India, arousing ire. At Rs 70 a kilo last week, it surpassed the price of mangoes that are on their way out of the market. By this weekend, it had raced into record territory at Rs 100-plus a kilo.Famously, the rising price of tur daal and onion  our meat and potatoes  is something governments are leery of. But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

Supplies of onions in Market Yard have dwindled because of rotting in the godowns during the rains.Meanwhile, the price of tomato , the other kitchen staple, simmered to Rs 50-60 per kg from Rs 100 in July. Dilip Khaire, chief administrator of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune told TOI that the rainy season often sees fluctuation in prices because of the problem it poses for reaping vegetables from the fields.""The recent rise in onion prices is the result of stocks rotting in the godowns they are stored in during the recent rain,"" Khaire said. He added that vegetable crops are susceptible to disease during the rainy season. ""Areas around Pune, such as Velhe, Mulshi, Bhor, Ambegaon and Junnar, that are to the west of Pune received good rainfall in the last few days, which caused supply problems in many vegetables, including onions,"" he saidNew onion stocks will enter the markets post-Diwali, Khaire added. APMC officials had earlier told TOI that incessant rain after mid-July damaged the tomato crops, causing supply to fall and prices to go up to Rs 100 per kg.Onion supply data from APMC showed that since August 1, when close to 11,423 quintals of onions came into the APMC market, supplies dipped to 9,615 quintals on August 2 and 8,985 quintals on August 3.Though 18,760 quintals of onion entered the wholesale market on August 4, prices continued their upward trendfrom Rs 700 to Rs 1,500 on August 1 to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,600 on August 4. Another APMC official said onions in the wholesale market were being sold at around Rs 22 per kg on Thursday, which went up to Rs 25 on Friday.""The reduction in rainfall over the last few days has also caused a dip in cultivation of vegetables, including onions,"" he said. Yakub Pathan, owner, Fresh Vegetable Market, Wakad, said the retail price of onion is bound to be higher on Saturday.""From Rs 30 on Friday, it may go up to Rs 35 to Rs 40 on Saturday depending on the supply with retailers. Tomato supplies have normalized to an extent, but onion supplies are 50% less in the wholesale market on account of some stocks rotting due to rains,"" said Pathan.Vegetable vendors in the city on Friday were selling onions at Rs 30 per kg, as against Rs 15 on August 2. ""Tomato prices have come down to Rs 50-Rs 60. Though tomato prices have come down there is less supply,"" Inder Sen, a vendor in Koregaon Park, said."

He wished he had stocked up on Saturday, when the price was Rs 10 less. The retailer adviced a dejected Das that it's not too late either as onion prices are likely to go up further.Heavy rain in Nashik and the delayed supply from Karnataka, the country's two major onion baskets, have resulted in a spike in prices. Contributing further to this supply crunch has been panic buying, with consumers stocking up on the crop. Onion prices in the city have either doubled or risen by 60-80% from Rs 18-20 a kg just two weeks ago. In some markets in the city and its fringes, prices have more than doubled, with onions selling for Rs 45-50 a kg.""We mainly depend on the supply from Karnataka at this time of the year. They start sending onions from the first week of July and it continues till September. We need around 2 lakh tonnes for the state but we didn't get any from this southern state still now. This is creating a supply shortage. If we don't get it within a week, the problem will be acute,"" a senior agricultural marketing department official said.In 2014, when some onion-producing states like Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan threatened to stop supply of onion, Bengal had started cultivating the crop. At present, the production is enough for four to five months. ""In June, we had nearly 2.5 lakh tonnes of onions but that has been pumped into the market to keep the price under control. In this situation, we need fresh supply from other states. Else, we can't keep the price within limits,"" the official said.When asked about Nashik, the official said, ""Even three years back, nearly 90% of the crop used to come from Nashik but because of their attitude, the government has decided not to depend on imports for onion throughout the year. We now mainly look for onions from them in October, November and December. We could have fallen back on them on an emergency basis but because of incessant rain and flood in some parts of Maharshtra, the supply has been affected,"" the official added.""Onion prices have risen to Rs 40 in our market. We are buying onions at Rs 170 for every 5 kg, or Rs 34 a kg. Add another Rs 2 a kg as cost at our end. Hence, we are making a profit of only Rs 4 a kg,"" said Dilip Mondal, the secretary of the Gariahat Market traders' body.Traders in Lake Market, Behala, Kudghat and Kankurgachi attributed the upward price spiral to woefully inadequate supply. Heavy rain has made transportation of onions from Nashik almost impossible, they said. Very few trucks are entering the city with onion from Maharashtra.""There is a fear that some people might hoard onions and keep them in stock to sell at a higher price during the pujas. We are trying to increase the monitoring system so that individual hoarding of onion can be minimized,"" the official added."

The tuber, which was sold at `14 a kg a month back, now costs `30.Even as the State Government fixed the upper limit of onion at `17 a kg last week and opened Maitri shops (model fair price outlets) to sell it across the State to unburden the consumers, the retailers flout the order with impunity reportedly for lack of enforcement.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said, they are unable to supply onion at `16 a kg to Maitri shops as the supply price soared by `8 to `10. The price may escalate further due to scanty supply from the source States, he said.Odisha largely depends on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in Andhra due to lack of rain during kharif season and onions worth around `100 crore was damaged in floods in MP last month.Now, we completely depend on Nashik where the onion was priced at `2,500 to `2,600 per quintal on Tuesday. What can we do if the product is high priced at the source? We are managing since we had booked the commodity at less price a fortnight back, Panda said.Though Odisha, which consumes around 1500 tonne onion daily, stands second in the country after Maharashtra in area under onion cultivation, the productivity of the crop is very less compared to other major onion producing States.Panda said Odisha produces nearly 1.2 lakh tonne onion every year. But, it fails to utilise it within the State as a major share is diverted to Raipur. He, however, claimed that the price here is less compared to other States where the edible tuber is being sold at more than `40 a kg.Both the State Government and the Centre have to intervene to check the price rise. The Centre has to hold talks with vested interest traders in Nashik to regulate the onion price, he added."

As a result, the rise in demand for onions from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune led to a rise in wholesale onion prices.According to sources, Madhya Pradesh government has procured huge quantity of onions and also disposed the stock. The onion stock has exhausted that has led to the rise in demand there. Moreover, the flood-like situation in Gujarat and Rajasthan has damaged onion crop there.

A man on horseback stands guard, watching from a distance. Deer that destroy crops is just one more headache for the farmers of Puntamba, a village that played a major role in mobilising the recent farmers strike in Maharashtra, when tillers decided to let their produce perish rather than sell them at a loss.Puntambas other problem has been delinquent rains. If it does not rain for another eight to 10 days, our present crop will be in trouble, says Balasaheb Chavan, a local farmer.Mr. Chavan points to a third problem: erratic power supply. For the most part, their fields get power only at night. But it is neither easy nor safe to work in the fields in the dark. There are snakes around our village. Working in the dead of the night is not easy, he says.Parallel workWith agriculture proving a loss-making proposition, Mr. Chavan says that villagers keep their households running through parallel work. The better off try their hands at small businesses. The poorer ones become blue-collar workers.Another farmer, Vilas Dhanaute, says he has just returned from the market after selling 9.5 quintals of his onion produce. He produces a slip to show that he only got a rate of Rs. 2 per kg.He explains the math. I spent Rs. 600 on transporting the onions to the market, Rs. 450 on labour, and Rs. 900 on the sacks required. Just taking the onions to the market cost me about Rs. 1,950. I earned Rs. 200 on each of the 9.5 quintals I sold, or Rs. 1,900 for the whole lot, he says. Over all, I ended up making a loss of Rs. 50.Asked why sell at all if they suffer a loss, Mr. Dhanaute says, What do we do with these quintals of produce then? We cant let them rot in our village. He points to a large tent-like storage structure next to the fields, where much of his onions still lies. He says he would have to sell them all in the coming days, but is doing it a few quintals at a time in the hope that prices rise.In early June, farmers from this village, located 15 km from Shirdi, decided not to sell their produce. This set in motion a strike that spread across Maharashtra.Farmers in the village, however, seem resigned to a bleak future for farming."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

5a0b5e999855b76bf13ceb0f,Taming inflationary expectations,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/taming-inflationary-expectations/article19338912.ece,2017-07-24,"The official inflation rate dipped to 1.5% last month, the lowest in almost two decades. Inflation is a politically more sensitive challenge than joblessness for the simple reason that it affects everyone, whether you have a job or not.Indias long-term record in managing inflation has been very impressive when compared with most developing countries. We have never had the bouts of hyperinflation experienced in many Latin American economies or seen even in countries such as Israel. The relatively high double-digit inflation experienced between 2010 to 2013 was an aberration, which had a political consequence. There have been very few instances of such persistent, multi-year, high inflationary episodes in our history. The credit for this goes to the vigilance of the political system and also to effective monetary management. Inflation is after all a monetary phenomenon  more money chasing fewer goods. So, controlling money supply is part of the strategy for controlling inflation.Food prices as indicatorBut inflation is also an indicator of whether there is an excess demand or supply of goods. For instance, with a bumper crop of fruits and vegetables, prices plunge, even though money supply might be unchanged. Indeed, the recent drop in the inflation rate has been caused by a steep fall in the prices of vegetables (-17%) and pulses (- 22%). Conversely, and rather ironically, unseasonal rains in the north have destroyed a large part of the tomato crop causing prices to skyrocket. Food prices, especially of perishables, are notoriously volatile. High onion prices, even if temporary, have caused the downfall of governments in past elections. Food prices are a big component in the determinant of the overall inflation rate based on the consumer price index basket. Keeping them low and stable involves policies such as public procurement and a minimum support price regime. Inflation control thus involves a combination of monetary management along with measures to increase supply of goods (in the medium term) as also anti-hoarding measures or the release of stocks from government warehouses.Even though price stability is an important goal of government policy, it is now an exclusive mandate given to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Last year, in a landmark reform of monetary management, the government officially gave an inflation target to the RBI. Prior to this, the central bank had multiple objectives which included enhancing growth and reducing unemployment, although price stability was undoubtedly paramount. The new paradigm, called the flexible inflation targeting framework, aims for a numerical target given by the government. The main tool to achieve it is by setting the benchmark interest rate. This decision is now taken by the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), chaired by the Governor. The current inflation target is 4% plus or minus 2%. The MPC is deemed to have failed if for three consecutive quarters the inflation rate falls outside the band.Low inflation pointerWho would have imagined that in the new MPC regime, the first instance of deviation of the inflation rate would undershoot, not overshoot the target? Of course, technically, the MPC has not failed, for the June inflation rate of 1.5%, which is below 2%, may be transitory. However, there are strong indications and forecasts by many economists that point to low inflation in the coming months. Those numbers may be in the range of 2 to 4%.How did we get to this low inflation scenario? Partly it must be because the money supply has been kept dear, or tight. Thus, the benchmark rate (called the repo rate, or the rate at which the RBI gives money to banks) at 6.25% may be too high. Interest rates are the price of money, so if they are too high, money becomes scarce. If it is lowered, then there will be more money in circulation, more loans given out. But low inflation is also because of a steep fall in prices of fruits, vegetables and pulses, none of which was caused by high interest rates. These steep falls are highly seasonal. We have also benefited from low and stable crude oil prices, which are a crucial determinant of transport and energy costs.All eyes will now be on the MPC which meets again in less than two weeks. There is a strong feeling that high interest rates have deterred big industrial investments, or housing finance. High rates are crippling borrowers who try to come out of near-bankruptcy and are preventing a restructuring of stressed bank loans. Indias real interest rates, i.e. net of inflation, are quite high even compared to other developing countries. Much of the developed world has ultra-low rates, with some countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Japan even having negative interest rates. India needs much lower rates for higher GDP growth.But the job of the MPC wont be easy. This is mainly because its task is to target future inflation, not the past. The future has some troubling portents. The short run impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is bound to be inflationary. Thats because a bulk of Indias GDP is in services whose tax rate has moved from 15% to 18%. Besides, while sellers wait for their refund, i.e. input tax credit under the GST, their cost of capital locked up might go up. Many State governments have introduced additional levies to counter their apprehension of a loss of revenue under the GST. Besides the GST, there is the impact of the award of the Seventh Pay Commission to government employees. This effect will cascade to public sector organisations and State-level employees as well, and put pressure on prices. A third factor could be the loan waivers announced in some States which can cause fiscal stress. High deficit spending is not compatible with lower interest rates. A fourth factor is the uptick in commodity prices worldwide as metals and food prices are looking up.The last, and probably the most important, factor weighing on the MPCs mind would be inflation expectations. Household surveys conducted by the RBI indicate that people are expecting inflation to be close to 10% , not the 1.5% as is reported now. You may say that these expectations are irrational, but they do affect behaviour. In this season of salary increments, try giving someone a raise of 2%, as is common in the developed world. Workers will howl. Even their official dearness allowance is much higher. The real challenge is to slay this inflation expectations monster. In much of the western world, they are fighting disinflation if not outright deflation. But in India we are still struggling with inflationary conditions and expectations.In English the verb for inflation is inflate. It refers to rising prices. But in most Indian languages, the equivalent word in usage is  mehengaai , which refers to affordability and cost of living. Not all inflation is unwelcome. So if stock prices go up, that is good cheer. But  mehengaai  is hated by all. A low and stable inflation rate is a perquisite for sustained high economic growth. Mehengaai is antithetical to it. In the medium term, the growth impact of the GST, the improving ease of doing business  and hence increasing supply of goods  and a strong domestic currency, will all help keep inflation low. But the short run challenge is to temper inflationary expectations and keep them tethered.Ajit Ranade is an economist"

We had a young visitor from Vietnam, and one day we persuaded her to cook for us. She did  and what a meal it was.She had come carrying rice paper from Hanoi, and we went to INA Market to buy some shrimps, greens, peppers and ripe mango. And then she prepared a roll that was as much a visual delight as it was a treat for the palate. At the bottom of the translucent rolled rice paper was a thick strip of red mangoes, then some thinly cut green and red capsicum, shreds of basil and mint leaves and finally a layer of steamed shrimps.I was reminded of those rolls when I went to a lovely little restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Phone: 9650260408 and 9599450879) one afternoon. Its really little, so you have to book a table if you can.Still nostalgic about those rolls, we asked for a plate of pancakes with chicken (Rs. 220). They were different from the ones I had eaten, but rather good, nevertheless. The pancakes came with a helping of lettuce leaves, and we were urged to wrap a leaf around the pancake and eat it. There was a light fish sauce, which we could smear on the pancake if we wished to. The difference was in the casing  Chef Hana, who runs Little Hanoi, makes her batter with rice powder and beaten egg  so it looked and tasted a bit different.The fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat (Rs. 220) and with tofu and vegetables (Rs. 170) were little rolls of rice paper, stuffed with all the good stuff. I didnt try out the veggie one, but quite enjoyed my crunchy non-veg roll.Superb curryOur main dish was sticky rice with braised pork (Rs. 540) and yellow chicken curry (Rs. 330). The pork had a sharp taste, mildly sweet but piquant. The yellow curry gravy was simply superb, light and mildly flavoured, with little chunks of onion and carrot in them. The chicken pieces in the gravy, however, did not appeal to me much. I found them a bit too hard, and thought that the excellent flavours of the curry had not seeped into the meat.The vegetable aromatic rice noodle soup (Rs. 270) that a friend had asked for needed some more greens, and the server topped it accordingly. It was perhaps a bit bland, because of which we asked for the grilled fish Saigon (Rs. 320), which was very good. The fish was crisp, the flesh was firm, and the flavours were strong.We had our meal with some artichoke iced tea and hot tea (Rs. 95). And we ended with a delicious coconut ice cream with jelly (Rs. 120).This is one of the few places where you get Vietnamese food in Delhi, for strangely enough, there are hardly any Vietnamese restaurants in the city. Taj Palace had a Vietnam cuisine special called the Blue Ginger, but that shut shop, too. I find that surprising, for Vietnamese food is a rage across the world, and one of the best cuisines that you can have.I love Vietnamese food for two main reasons. One, the food is lighter than other cuisines for most dishes are steamed, grilled or boiled. And, second, the cuisine marks the coming together of many diverse influences. China and South East Asian nations have added to the cauldron, of course, but what sets it apart is the French influence, for France ruled Vietnam for almost a century from the middle of the 19th Century.But I am sure the food will catch on soon. And for the small group of die-hard Vietnamese food lovers in the city, there is always Little Saigon."

No, that's K Chandu. With one hand raised above his head and the other clutching a microphone, a freeze-frame Chandu grins from his auto which is plastered with posters of himself. It reads 'Haasya Samrat' (king of laughter) and a constant reminder of the man 'K Chandu' stage name for Chandrakant Kapse who has taken it upon himself to relieve traffic stress with his art of being funny as he uses his vehicle to ""advertise"" his skills, score gigs and test comic routines on unsuspecting riders.For a curious bunch of foreigners, he unleashed a female falsetto and masqueraded as an English-speaking woman bargaining with an auto-wallah. In splits, his passengers filmed his antic that has garnered over 850 views till date on YouTube.Not bad for an auto driver turned jokesmith from Sausuddi, a village in Belgaum, who began by performing at political roadshows and community celebrations before arriving in Mumbai 23 years ago to find his calling. ""I wanted to be an actor,"" says Chandu.There is a small chance you may have seen Chandu as a villain's henchman in one of the K-soaps or in a purple gown and large breasts playing a woman in a Hindi B-movie. His relentless wait outside the studios also fetched him a Marathi news show that he anchored for about a month.When he ran short of acting gigs, he decided to go back to his funny side and for the last 10 years, Chandu has been a mini celebrity at community festivals, malls, private parties and eco drives in not just Mumbai but Jodhpur, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolhapur and Sangli, averaging five shows a month and logging over ""700 stand-up comedy shows"" till date.Chandu dropped out of school in his teens but unintelligent he isn't. At a time when carefully scripted comic acts are flourishing, it's rare to see a comedian with a natural flair for cracking up his audience in Hindi, Marathi, Bhojpuri, Kannada, Gujrati and English with witticisms about the world he encounters every day - amorous couples in autorickshaws to Baba Ramdev's suspiciously black beard. When the rupee nosedives and onion prices shoot up, laughter resonates. While his act is more mimicry than comedy, you never know what he's going to do next - switching between 50 different voices - sometimes Mithun Chakraborty, sometimes a baby goat, buffalo, or parrot and sometimes a motorbike on high accelerator.His snappy poise as a comedian has often helped the funny man dodge a traffic fine. ""When cops ask me for my license, I tell them a joke,"" he beams, half-afraid to face people not like himself.""On the spot, my jokes come automatically,"" he says showing off his wardrobe of satin blazers, sequined waistcoats, fedoras and half a dozen sunglasses at his rented one-room house in a Mankhurd chawl where he lives with his wife and 14-year-old son.Ask him about his inspiration in a life that isn't easy and he snaps back: ""Why do you think I replaced posters of Gods and heroes with my own? I came from a village to the city for the world to see me. You came looking for me. Phir inspiration kaun?"""

He said Rs 580 crore has been provisioned for the onion purchase.Leader of opposition Ajay Singh termed it a 'wastage' of public money and alleged the onion purchase was a huge scam. ""Onion is stinking in the whole state. Besides, in Pipariya mandi alone, a scam of Rs 100 crore has taken place in the purchase of pulses,"" he alleged.Addressing the assembly, finance minister Jayant Mallaya said Rs 559 crore for PM Awas Yojana, Rs 76.91 crore for the ongoing expansion of the Mantralaya and Rs 700 crore for smart city schemes have also been provisioned in the budget among others.He said that Rs 40 crore has been sanctioned in the first supplementary for the Rs 1,000 crore agriculture price stabilization fund. The remaining funds would be sanctioned separately, he said.Referring to a better economic management in BJP government, he said that when the Congress was in power in 2003, the debt amount was 33.74 % of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) which has now been lowered to just 19.66 %.He said, ""the debt on the government hardly matters because our government is spending on infrastructure, education, health, power, irrigation and on the welfare of the people.""The FM said the per capita income in 2003-04 was Rs 8,234 which has increased seven folds and now stands at Rs 59,052.Earlier, the leader of the opposition criticised the budget provisions and said that most of the government money was wasted in publicising and projecting the image of chief minister. Whenever the chief minister makes some announcements, his hoardings are installed.A huge amount was spent in Namami Devi narmade yatra. The house was informed that the government had spent Rs 21 crore on its advertisement. His hoardings were even installed in New York and Los Angeles."

With onions selling at `40 per kg, the consumers are now feeling the pinch after prices of different vegetables soared between `40 and `100 per kg.In such a scenario, officials of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department have once again linked the price rise to the problem of limited supply at the source point in Nashik in Maharashtra. There are no reports of hoarding of onions by local wholesalers. We are monitoring the situation. If needed, onions will be sold through Government fair price shops, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said. In July, when onion prices had jumped to `28 per kg, the department had opened 37 fair price shops across the city.If onions were not enough to bring tears to the eyes of locals, vegetables added to their woes. While green peas were sold at `100 per kg, capsicum and carrot were priced at `80 per kg at the markets across Rourkela on Sunday, sources said. Pointed gourd, cauliflower, bean and seam were priced at `60 per kg each. Tomatoes and spinach were priced at `50 per kg, while brinjal, plantain, ladys finger, ridge-gourd and bitter-gourd sold at `40 per kg. Ginger and garlic were selling at `100 and 60 per kg, respectively, sources said, adding that the price of green chilli came as a surprise at `80 to `100 per kg.Amid the soaring prices, sweet potatoes, cow-pea, pumpkin, radish, papaya, cucumber and some local varieties of greens were available for `20 to `30 per kg. Potatoes came as a major relief, selling at `10 per kg, sources added. Usually, by this time of the year, vegetable prices should have decreased. The crisis can be attributed to the lack of locally-grown vegetables in the markets. I hope the arrival of new vegetables to Rourkela city from Nuagaon, Bisra block, Kuarnmunda and Lathikata blocks of the district besides from adjacent pockets of neighbouring Jharkhand will bring down prices, a local vendor, Subal Barik, said."

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

""Passengers will not be able to change the option once selection is made at the time of booking.""The railways has advised the IRCTC to ensure provision of e-catering facilities at stations on the route so that passengers have the choice of opting for local cuisine.Passengers welcomed the decision to have optional catering on Rajdhani. ""I prefer Jain food, bereft of onion and garlic. It is a waste of money for people like me who pay for food but do not consume it,"" Mulund resident Akshay Jain said.""I am a diabetic and have to forego the food for health reasons. This is a very good step,"" Ghatkopar resident Suman Shah said.Another passenger said after the CAG report which found the meals unfit for humans, it was time for a rethink for many passengers. ""I would rather carry home-cooked food when travelling in train,"" the passenger said.Catering charges range from Rs 295 to Rs 350. A family of four travelling by the train can end up saving more than Rs 1,000 on opting out of the catering system.The IRCTC is likely to seek feedback from passengers not opting for food to better understand their needs."

""The Biju Mahila Janata Dal (BJD's women's wing) will stage protest in all district headquarters against the anti-woman move,"" he said. Pramila Mullick, the BJD women's wing president, said the government undertook publicity campaigns to ensure that maximum women use LPG leaving behind firewood. When it became a habit for them, the government now is suddenly withdrawing the benefits so that the oil companies can make money. ""There can't be a worse form of deceit by the government,"" she said. ""We will announce dates of our agitation on Wednesday,"" she said.The BJD members on Tuesday joined the opposition in the protest against the LPG price hike move in Rajya Sabha. BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said the BJD is trying to make political capital against Dharmendra though the Centre's decision will not affect any poor and deserving family. ""Only the rich people who are getting undue benefits of subsidy, like the MLAs, MPs and bureaucrats will have to pay the actual price.""Political insiders feel the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the subsidized cooking gas scheme for economically weaker sections, is a major reason why the saffron party has been able to made inroads into newer territories at the grassroots. Now, the decision to withdraw subsidizes from the middle class may boomerang, they feel. ""It may become a setback to the momentum gained by the saffron party in Odisha after its impressive performance in the panchayat election in February,"" an analyst said.For the BJD, the move comes as a godsend political weapon. ""It will help bring Dharmendra to a spot of bother at a time when there is constant media scrutiny of BJD's poll expenditure,"" he added.The Samajwadi Party state unit said the Centre's move to hike domestic LPG cylinder price by Rs 4 a month is contrary to the Centre's slogan of 'clean energy and healthy life of women'. ""As such price of vegetables, tomato and onion is beyond the reach of the common consumer. Cooking gas price hike will further burden him,"" he said."

RamakrishnaG._RamakrishnaVegetable prices in the city have soared owing to poor rainfall last month and late arrival of loads from other states and districts. While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains. And then with rains, transportation and storage became a problem, said N. Nagamani, a vegetable seller in Mehdipatnam.Due to fall in prices at the procurement end, several farmers had to dump their produce including rich harvest of tomatoes last month, she said.As the month progresses, the prices are expected to dip as more produce will come from other states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, agriculturists predicted.Usually the month of August is when the prices dip with fresh harvest coming in. It has not happened so far but soon there will be a fall, said Sarampally Mallareddy from Communist Party of Indias farmers collective."
