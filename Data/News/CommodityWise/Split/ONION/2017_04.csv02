5a0dbaa99855b76bf13d115c,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

The breach occurred following heavy rains in the villages of Holagundi, Morigeri, Sonna, Uttangi and Talakallu, leading to the flooding of the tank and the subsequent breach.People in nearby villages faced a challenging time as the water entered their villages, flooding hundreds of acres of agriculture land where the maize crop had been sown. The 1,664-hectare tank irrigates 1,400 acres of land. A war of words broke out between the officials and the people, who said the latter had failed to take precautionary steps.Rain lashes GadagModerate rain was reported from Gadag city and other places in the taluk on Monday. It had rained in the taluk on Sunday also.Showers have returned to the district after a lull of three weeks. Farmers now see a ray of hope as crops had started withering away for want of moisture in the atmosphere in the sprouting stage itself. The Met department has forecast rain in the region over the next few days. Farmers have sowed green gram, sunflower and groundnut. They plan to sow chilli and onion in the days to come.Sowing has been completed only on 46.6% of the cultivation area in the district, which has a 115-mm deficit this monsoon. It has received 1.5 mm in August, against the normal of 75.4 mm for the month.Showers have receded in Uttara Kannada district, with reports of rain only in Kumta, Karwar, Mundgod and Siddapura."

(Express Archive) Summer tomato, harvested between May and July, sees bigger investments by farmers who expect better price realisations. (Express Archive)Speaking of tomatoes, excuse me, why arent we speaking of tomatoes? Theyve reached Rs 100 per kg. Or why arent we crying over the price of onions which has, apparently, spiraled 119 per cent in 10 days (ABP News)? These are seasonal (vegetable) problems, were told. Perhaps. But theyre of far more immediate concern to the public/viewer than politicians who are men and women for all seasons. And dont you remember that Delhis BJP government was brought to tears at the hustings in 1998 by onions?Why not also discuss, debate, expose the abysmal condition of public hygiene and sanitation? When was the last time you didnt see a male or female perform (ablutions) in public  and when, if ever, have you heard a discussion about toilets or garbage disposal or the menace of plastic? The PM cries foul but why doesnt his Mann Ki Baat or the Swachch Bharat advertisements on TV and radio on such fundamental issues make breaking news, headlines or (super) prime time debates? If the price was right, wed throw a few tomatoes at them.Lets not throw any at ABP. On Monday, at prime time, it went on the onion trail from Alwar to Nasik and onto Madhya Pradesh where it found them rotting. They bit into tomatoes too and tried to explain the price rise in both. It was a detailed, in- depth report. Odd that they should be recognised for doing what ought to be routine. More, please.Someone who was pretty red-faced under his skin but did a good job of hiding it is Nitish Kumar. The newly sworn-in chief minister of Bihar for the nth time, was at a televised press conference on Monday, bleeding, sorry, pleading, almost for understanding of the impossible position Lalu & Sons had placed him in. By the time he proclaimed Modi as the winner of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he looked somewhat crumpled, as if someone had sat upon him.Flashback to October 2015 and recall his stirring campaign speeches we watched during the Bihar assembly campaign when he challenged the PM to beat him in the state. On Walk the Talk (April, 2016, NDTV 247), soon after calling for a Sangh mukt India, he spoke of the BJPs ideology that was potentially poisonous as it divides society; of the need to set aside differences to fight the BJP, etc. What a difference two years makes in politics.If all this worldliness in politics is distasteful and soul destroying, never fear, help is near. Double digit spiritual/religious TV channels are available to salve your disillusioned heart. There are some 20-odd such channels on Tata Sky, including its own devotion channels. More than a dozen of these are related to Hindu spiritual discourse, with Lord Buddha TV, Shalom TV, God TV, Goodness TV for religious diversity. Didnt see one devoted to Islam, which only means that they are not on the popular bandwidths because they do exist.And what on earth is YO TV? No clue, after watching it. Speaking of Tata Sky, it has a bouquet of its own channels which offer education with entertainment and exercise: Tata Sky Fitness, Tata Sky Dance keeps you on your toes, Tata Sky Comedy plays old sitcoms for a laugh, Amitabh Bachchan promises you can learn to act (like him?) on Tata Sky Acting, theres Classic Cinema for those who want to remember when Sunil met Nargis, Tata with Javed Akhtar for the poet in you, Tata Sky Gurus to teach you a few lessons, etcetra, etcetra. Some of it is far superior to what entertainment channels offer.What one of them is offering just now is Pehredaar Piya Ki (Sony TV) in which nine-year-old Prince Ratan marries a woman twice his age, Diya. The age difference would be an emancipating thing for TV soaps but for Ratan being a child groom. They marry in order for her to protect him  again a liberating idea  but decidedly odd and disturbing since surely there are other ways to protect a child? Especially, when Ratan is besotted by her. Its all very absurd, trying to attract viewers by its bizarre premise.On news TV they scream, insult, and say even fake things, to get us to watch them; on entertainment channels they now exploit twisted fantasies.

The traders, who are forced to pay taxes after Madras High Court warned them of closure, are now raising pertinent questions about abject conditions of facilities inside the market.On any given day, the market, which receives around 14,000 vehicles on average, including trucks, vans, auto-rickshaws, tricycles, two-wheelers and cycles, hardly has any facilities, not even basic ones like drinking water and clean toilets, to serve the thousands who visit.If they dont set up the basic facilities, how can they seek tax and maintenance fees from us, asked a trader, angry at the Market Management Committee (MMC) for its move to seal shops that fail to pay a maintenance fee.Traders are fuming that they have to pay a maintenance fee for a market that is ill-maintained and lacks adequate truck bays for loading and unloading perishable goods.Kamal Vishwa, who owns a vegetable shop and was facing the heat for not paying the fee, said the private firm that took the maintenance contract has not been cleaning the market regularly.We have been allotted a space to throw vegetable waste. But as it is seldom cleaned, we dont have any alternative but to throw it in front of the shops, said Vishwa, who has paid the dues grudgingly.The market collects nearly 200 tonnes of garbage every day, which the MMC claims, is sent to the treatment plant.There are 68 toilets in Koyambedu market which were renovated at a cost of around `4 crore but traders complained that these still are not maintained properly. An onion truck driver confided to Express that unclean toilets forced him to use the open ground in front of the market to ease himself.However, officials denied toilets were badly maintained, but still blamed the traders for the poor condition.The toilets are renovated with high cost and it is also the responsibility of the traders to take care of it. People consume alcohol and break bottles inside the toilet creating a mess, and then blame the management, a top MMC official alleged in response.The official added that efforts are being made to have access control in the market as well as regulating parking inside the truck bays of the market. However, the issue is sub judice. We are hoping to implement it by the middle of next month once the case is settled, said an MMC official.Aside from this, the lack of parking regulations inside the market has resulted in chaos. Vehicles from other States are parked for a long time affecting trade, said Illango, a shop owner, pointing to the truck from Rajasthan which was parked in front of his shop.Now to access the goods from my truck parked at a distance, I have to hire workers to carry it from there. This is a usual scene during peak hours, he alleged.The market also does not have water facilities for more than a decade. The three reverse osmosis plants proposed long back at a cost of `58 lakh have yet to be inaugurated. Officials now say these would be inaugurated in the first week of August.The three plants are being set up in the 1st gate for the flower market, 4th gate for the fruit market and 14th gate for the vegetable market.Meanwhile, the MMC is likely to seal 80 more shops for not paying the maintenance fee. The fee is `1 per square foot that was fixed in 1998. The cost of clearing one tonne of waste in `1,000 these days. Vendors dont understand that the service MMC provides to them is funded by the fee collected from them, said a top MMC official."
5a0de1bf9855b76bf13d1c80,"Indian cuisine & spices, one true love!",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jul/26/indian-cuisine--spices-one-true-love-1633991.html,2017-07-26,"Food was and will always be my first love. My father was a chef and since my childhood, I have been watching him cook. I also wanted to get into the hotel industry and started my training in 2004 with Moti Mahal in New Delhi, which was the first restaurant in Delhi to serve tandoori chicken and naan. There I learnt the basics of Indian cuisine.After four months, I moved to Mumbai where I joined a kebab factory. In 2006, I joined the Marriott, and since then I was with this hotel albeit in different cities. After three years in Mumbai, I moved to Dubai for 16 months, then to Ahmedabad for three years and now I am here in Chennai.I have travelled to quite a lot of places in India and I love to cook Indian the most. We have 29 States here, and there are so many cuisines. There is so much to explore in Indian cuisine and Im still trying to learn as much as possible. I can cook Maharashtrian, Delhi cuisine, which is the food from my hometown, Mughalai, which is the root of Hyderabadi cuisine.Initially, I did not fancy South Indian food, but now I am exploring this cuisine as well. Im understanding how this cuisine works and how the ingredients are used. I have noticed that the ingredients in the recipes remain the same everywhere, hence retaining its authenticity. In Awadhi cuisine, we use ginger-garlic paste. But for South Indian dishes, we use chopped garlic and ginger in rasam or chopped onion in sambar and that makes the dish much more flavoursome. I find this cuisine healthy, as the dishes are made with coconut oil, which has many health benefits, unlike Mughalai or Awadi cuisine that uses a lot of ghee and butter.Indian cuisine is known for its spices and it is just amazing to know how the variety of spices is used to cook dishes in every region. For instance, Maharashtrian cuisine uses roots of vegetables, Mughalai food uses patthar ke phool (black stone flower or kalpasi) in their dishes, giving it an umami flavour. But these spices may not be used in Hyderabadi or Kerala cuisine. An important thing about Indian food is even if you miss an ingredient, you lose out on the flavour.My best dishes are Kashmiri mutton rogan josh, kebabs and Awadhi biryani. I believe my rogan josh is extra special because the recipe was passed on to me by my aunt, who is a Kashmiri. I have also learnt some Kashmiri dishes from her  Kashmiri rose tea and Kahwah (green tea) among others.I want to explore Kerala cuisine next. One of my most favourite South Indian dishes is karimeen polichhathu. There are very little ingredients and it is cooked in banana leaf. But the flavour and taste it gives out is just mouth-watering."

Similarly, it pulled up Bharti Airtel for its advertisement 'enjoy internet for the full month at just Rs 29' as it was misleading by ambiguity and omission.""The advertisement's claim, enjoy internet for the full month at just Rs 29, is misleading by ambiguity and omission as 75 MB being given at that cost may not last for a month,"" it said.The ad regulator also upheld complaints against e-commerce major Amazon for its advertisement showing a man and a woman riding two wheeler without a helmet as it violated traffic rules. It also noted that the company's advertisement claim of the price offer of Rs 63 (73 per cent off) on American style cream and onion flavour  party pack was false and misleading as the actual MRP of the product is Rs 65 and not Rs 230 as claimed by the advertisement.It observed that Asian Paints Royale Atmos advertisement claim of air purifying paint as inadequately substantiated and misleading by exaggeration.ASCI also pulled up consumer goods firm LG for its dual cool air conditioner advertisement showing a minor on multiple occasions leaving her home, crossing the road and entering a mall without the consent of her parents. The regulator said it depicts a dangerous act which is likely to encourage minors to emulate such acts in a manner which could cause harm or injury to such minors."

(Photo| ANI)LUCKNOW: Pricey tomatoes today spurred a fresh round of protests by Congress workers who parked a cart full of tomatoes in front of the UP Legislative Assembly and sold the kitchen staple at Rs 10 per kg.The party had earlier come up with a ""State Bank of Tomato"" that is being operated from the Youth Congress office here.Tomato prices have hovered around Rs 100 per kg in major cities with supplies being disrupted due to heavy rains.Congress workers led by state secretary Shailendra Tiwari stood in front of the Assembly with a cart full of tomatoes with a banner ""Tamatar ke aaye acche din"" (good days have come for tomatoes) and sold it at Rs 10 per kg per person.""This is our way to protest the soaring tomato price.We are selling it to the common man to show our concern for them. It's ironical that the government has not taken any initiative to open subsidised counters for selling tomatoes or to check its price,"" Tiwari said.The 'tomato bank' has some interesting schemes to offer like providing the commodity on easy loan as also a locker facility, 80 per cent loans on tomatoes and attractive interest rates for depositing tomatoes, especially for the poor.The idea behind the bank is to lodge a protest and to create awareness among the people about the commodity being sold at such high rates.Prices of tomato have shot up about four times since the beginning of June when tomatoes were being sold at about Rs 25 per kg in the Delhi-National Capital Region market.Industry body Assocham had said recently that ""Tomato prices may not immediately ease as flooding in some of the growing states has led to damage to the crop.""Unlike onion and potato, the shelf life of tomato is very short and it needs cold chains and modern warehouses for storage and transportation, it said.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states.The country produces around 18 million tonnes of tomatoes."

India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash.Onion exports from India have recorded a 10-year high in 2016-17, with the country recording export of 34.92 lakh tonnes (lt) of the bulb. The Central governments decision to provide repeated extension to the export subsidy and zero minimum export price (MEP) of the produce has fuelled the exports in the last year or so. Exports of onions play a crucial role in balancing the domestic price of the produce in the wholesale markets. India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash. Exports had virtually stopped in 2014 due to the Central governments decision to increase the minimum export price (MEP) in view of the steep increase in onion prices. Due to a glut in the prices of the bulb in 2015, the Central government had again reduced the MEP to zero (0) in December 2015. Also, the Central government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy for onions to clear the glut in produce.Since 2015, the exports of onions have seen a steady rise and at the end of the financial year 2016-17, 34.92 lt of the bulb was exported out of the country. This was almost three times the exports of the previous year when 11.14 lt of onions was sent to foreign shores. On an average, around 10 lt of onions are exported from the country every year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malayasia and Russia are major export destinations for Indian onion.Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter from Nashik, said the governments subsidy and the zero MEP has helped increase the export of the bulb. In June, the central government extended the subsidy for three more months to help clear the glut in the domestic markets. Exports, however, had failed to do much to improve the domestic price of onions which has been trading between Rs 5-6 per kg at most of the wholesale markets in the state.Over the last two weeks, prices of onions have seen a spike, with the Lasalgoan market recording an average price of Rs 12 per kg. This price rise, Apshunde said, was temporary and will remain till the Kharif crop arrives early September. Market sources pointed out that the price rise was due to stockists wading in the market in anticipation of a shortage in the future. Agriculture analyst Deepak Chavan said the rise in price is due to fundamental market forces. The outlook for the arrival of Kharif crop  the crop which is to arrive in September  is bleak. Onions from Karnataka start arriving by the end of August and there is a 40 per cent dip in the sowing area there, he said. The dip in sowing, Chavan said, was due to farmers going for other crops due to low prices of onions. While Maharashtra has reported near normal sowing of 10,000 hectares, prices, according to Chavan, would be bullish in the face of a dip in arrival of onionthis year.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

There are others like Dream Market, Valhalla, Alpha Bay and Hansa. The announcement by Madlyfooted was underneath a listing for clean and uncut Bolivian cocaine along with review of quality of the cocaine with a picture of it. The vendors also provide escrow services where one can track the consignment. DNMs are like any other e-commerce portals where payment has to be made in Bitcoins.DNMs have various filters include rating of a vendor and also from which country the drugs will be shipped and to where. DNMs sell a wide range of drugs like psychedelics, opioids, dissociatives, ecstacy, steroids, cannabis, benzos, barbiturates and prescription drugs.Indian drug vendors sell a wide range of prescription drugs like Benzodiazepines (antidepressants) like Xanax, Barbiturates (central nervous system depressants), pain killers like Tramadol and erectile dysfunction medicines like Tadalafil which are misused by drug addicts. While school students might not be able to buy these drugs online, drug peddlers and addicts having basic knowledge of computer, can easily buy drugs from darknet.Indian drug peddlers are using even India Post services for delivering the drugs, as claimed by an Indian drug vendor on Dream Market. Some vendors also send through their personal courier networks.When contacted, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Cyber Crime), Hyderabad police, KCS Raghuveer said, Till now there has been no case reported to us involving drugs bought or sold on darknet.

Moreover, we also have very good infrastructure in place which can help tracing these drug peddlers.Cops upset over political interference?HYDERABAD: The crackdown on drug racket in city seems to have created a divide between the police officials and politicians. A day after a cabinet minister reportedly expressed unhappiness over the excise and prohibition department exposing educational institutes from where students got addicted to drugs, senior police officers are understood to have been upset over political interference in the case. Police officials are of the opinion that there is nothing wrong in cracking the whip on drug peddling.When school management notices a student doing wrong, it will bring the matter to the notice of his/her parents in an attempt to mend ways of student. In the same manner, the excise enforcement officials wrote letters to schools/college managements asking them to take measures to sensitise their students on effects of drug abuse after a few students were found purchasing drugs from peddlers. Government must appreciate the police for cracking whip on drug peddlers, a senior police officer felt. It is also said that upset over the political interference, a senior officer involved in drug bust kept himself away from media glare citing fever. Meanwhile, DGP Anurag Sharma on Friday held meet with police commissioners and SPs asking them to be vigilant against drug peddlers."

The Maitree stores will sell the vegetable without keeping profit, Principal Secretary, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, Pradipta Mohapatra told this paper.After a meeting with representatives of the Mahasangh (Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations) at the State Secretariat, Mohapatra attributed the sudden price rise of onion to rising cost of the vegetable at source.Odisha being a consuming state largely depends on Nashik in Maharashtra, a major onion market of the country, to meet its requirement of the edible bulb. Rise in the price of the vegetable from `8-a-kg to `15 in source market has its cascading effect on the consuming states, said Mahasangha general secretary Shakti Samanta Mishra.Holding Madhya Pradesh government responsible for the spurt in the prices in major onion mandis of Maharashtra, Mishra said large scale procurement of onion from farmers and damage of the vegetable due to poor storage facility has further accentuated the crisis.Though the country had bumper rabi harvest of onion, large scale damage of kharif crop and traders meeting their export commitments had its effect on the domestic market, Mishra added.He, however, said there is no disruption in the supply of onion to the State which is receiving 1,600 to 2,500 tonnes daily. There has been a fall in supply from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh due to rains. The average requirement of onion in the city is about 200 to 250 tonnes.We have agreed to the State Government proposal for supplying onion to the fair price shops in the Twin City of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar in the first phase. If the situation persists, the vegetable will be supplied to other Maitree shops in rest of the districts at wholesale price, he added.The wholesale price of onion at Aiginia mandi is about `16-18-a-kg. The ideal price of the vegetable in retail markets of the city is `20 to `22-a-kg, Mishra said."

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

Balakrishnadu from Kurnool, the sources said.Balakrishnadu was not aware of the origin of the contraband and he was asked to offload the onion bags in Rameswaram for a payment of Rs. 30,000, including diesel expenses, they said.The actual destination was Vedhalai or Uchippuli, the sources said. After smuggling the logs to Sri Lanka through the sea route, the smugglers might send them to China or Thailand from Negombo on the west coast of Sri Lanka, the sources suspected.Meanwhile, sources in forest department said the driver was arrested under Sections 35 and 36 of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, and under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Timber Transit Rules.He was produced before a magistrate court, which remanded him in judicial custody, the sources added."

The official contacted the AP State Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (APSRSASTF) officials in Tirupati and passed on the information regarding the seizure of the contraband material.During interrogation, the T.N. police got information that it was a regular feature that some members of the red sanders smuggling network were operating between Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu through Karnataka. Ramanathapuram, the district close to the Sri Lankan coast, remained the ideal destination for the smugglers. The agents would pick up the stocks and facilitate smuggling of the precious wood to some specified locations along the Sri Lankas coast. Small ferries and fishing boats are said to be deployed to finish the deals.In the present case, Balakrishnudu had initially reached Tuticorin to unload the stock before reloading it for Sri Lanka destination. However, due to Coast Guard surveillance he had to reach Ramanathapuram, where he was apprehended. The logs were skilfully arranged beneath the onion bags to avoid detection at inter-State checkposts.Speaking to The Hindu , Circle-Inspector (Organised Crime-TNCID) Rajesh said the consignment was set to reach Sri Lanka. Though it is for the first time that we have made seizures of the red sanders in this case, we have information that regularly the goods [logs] would be coming to various locations in Ramanathapuram district, he said.

He said: Is this cure endorsed by the Health Department and administered as treatment in government hospitals? If this really works and there is evidence for the same, it should be used as the standard protocol for all dengue patients. If it is not so, then she should retract and give a press note to that effect.Left to themReacting to the controversy, Ms. Rajneesh said it was a remedy tried out by government AYUSH practitioners. At a time when dengue is spreading rapidly, any remedial measure should be shared. Im not saying people should set aside all other scientific treatment and take only this.

SrinathM_SRINATHWhile the price of small onions continues to rule high, the price of Bellary onions too has shot up in the city in tune with the nationwide trend. The price has shot up to Rs. 26 a kg in the wholesale market here over the past one week.Wholesale traders at the Gandhi Market, which caters to retail traders in several neighbouring districts, attributed the hike to the sharp fall in arrivals from Maharashtra and also due to heavy rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan.The retail price of the onion is higher by at least Rs. 5 a kg. Just about a week back, it was being sold at Rs. 13 a kg in the wholesale market.Wholesale traders say that the market was getting about 10 truck loads of Bellary onions from Maharashtra, accounting for just about 200 tonnes a day. Usually, the market receives about 600 tonnes a day, said A. Thangaraj, General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.Mr. Thangaraj said that the arrivals had come down over the past 10 days. We get bulk of the supply from Maharashtra normally during this period. But arrivals have come down, apparently as traders and farmers in Maharashtra are holding back supplies as production has been hit in some States due to heavy rain and floods, he said.Meanwhile, the price of small onions continued to rule high at the market at Rs. 70 a kg.The retail price in the city is around Rs. 80 a kg.

I am not trying to show off...but we had...tomato soup along with tomato rice for lunch today [sic], read a Facebook post.Not just tomatoes, onion prices have also been showing an upward trend, with an average increase of Rs. 1 per kg over 10 days.Rajendra Prasad Sharma of Sharma and Company said the supply of onions had been disrupted due to heavy rain.Onion is supplied from Nashik, where heavy rain has disrupted supply. Prices have increased from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg in less than 10 says, said Mr. Sharma.He, however, refused to speculate on far the prices might go up in the near future.Common phenomenonThe prices of seasonal vegetables, such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd and okra, have also doubled over the past fortnight.Hemant, a commission agent who deals in vegetables, however, argued that the rise in prices of vegetables was a common phenomenon during this part of the year.Crops are damaged due to heavy rain during monsoon, which in turn affects supply. The prices will continue to remain high for another two months, said Mr. Hemant.However, before the vegetables reach the kitchen, the prices go up by another 30-40%, making them unaffordable for the common man.Ram Pal, a squatter near Shani Mandir in Sector 37, argued that despite selling the vegetables at a rate 30-40% higher than the wholesale price, he ended up making only a marginal profit.I need to make up for the damaged and unsold vegetables and also recover the transportation cost. So, I end up making just Rs. 3-4 per kg after a hard days hard work, said Mr.Pal.Potato prices, however, continue to hover around Rs. 4-5 per kg on account of overproduction this year."

There was no triple bumper crop? So, where did all this dal come from?The state government doesn't procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the embers of the violent farmer agitation in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. When TOI contacted superintendent of land records, Narsinghpur, H L Tiwari, he said that the net sown area of toor dal in Tendukheda was ""around 8,000 hectares this year"". At 15,000MT, the average yield per hectare comes to 1.78MT which is thrice the average yield in the last five years.Information provided to TOI under RTI by the Madhya Pradesh land records department says that the average production of toor dal in the state was 0.32 metric tonne per-hectare in 2010-11. It rose to 0.63 metric tonne/hectare in 2011-12, 0.69 metric tonne/hectare in 2012-13, 0.72 metric tonne/hectare in 2013-14 and fell to 0.65 metric tonne/hectare in 2014-15. If you take the highest production on 8,000 hectares, it would only be around 5,000MT. That's 10,000MT short of what was procured. The same quantity of moong dal was procured from the same tehsil this year, though the yield per hectare is lower than toor and it was sown in less area in the tehsil.Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal. The government spent Rs 18 crore in procuring more than 30,000MT of toor and moong from Tendukheda alone.After complaints, the agriculture department set up a probe committee comprising officials from agriculture and the co-operative Markfed. It submitted its probe report to the government on July 29, said sources.Principal secretary agriculture, Rajesh Rajora who ordered the probe said, ""We have received the report and have sent it to the government for further action."" He wouldn't comment on the contents of the report, but sources say it points out several anomalies in procurement."

As Kurnool farmers cultivate the crop from August till November, the yield is supposed to arrive either in November-end or December. The wholesale market of Jnanapuram in the city imports 10 lorries every day of 40 tonnes each. Around 400 tonnes of onions are imported from Maharashtra this season alone and another 10 loads every week by Anakapalli traders, sources said.With the farmers in Maharashtra staging protests demanding the government for loan waiver, traders started stocking up huge quantities of onions which led to shortfall in supplies.A trader at Anakapalli S Seetharam said: ""We don't have any proper facility to store onions in huge quantity. The government should focus on this urgently.""On condition of anonymity, one of the farmers in MVP Raitu Bazaar who has been bringing onions from the wholesale market, said that they have been getting third grade onions and selling it for Rs 12 now. The entire market has been getting 20 bags. He says there will not be any respite for the prices till the end of November as the yield of various crops would come in next two to three months and Karthika masam would also see the prices soar.Thankfully, in a respite to consumers, tomato prices which touched Rs 100 in the retail markets due to insufficient yield till July 26, have now come down to Rs. 55.Not only onions, the prices of brinjal, cucumber, drumsticks, capsicum, beans, and others have also gone up in five days.

The appeal will now be heard after two weeks.The sale of garlic through agents had been disputed since the past ten years after the state government's order in 2007 banning agents from selling the spice."

The situation is almost the same in both wholesale and retail. The best quality of onions, which was available at about Rs14-Rs15 per kg in retail markets of the city's posh areas, has now touched the Rs50 mark. However, in certain markets like Vastrapur and Vejalpur, onion was available at Rs40, which was still three times higher than its prices a fortnight ago.Explaining the shortage of onions, officials said that against the requirement of about 8-10 truckloads of onions each day, the city was getting only one or two truckloads. Each truck carries about 10 tonnes of onions.Officials said that the prices of onion at the end of July was around Rs6 to Rs7 per kg in the wholesale market, and it has increased to Rs27.50 per kg. Interestingly during the same period last year, the prices of onions ranged between Rs6 to Rs8 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary of APMC , Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year, many farmers in Maharashtra and even Gujarat did not get adequate prices against their onion crops, and hence they didn't go for onion farming this year. This has led to a shortage of the vegetable.""Patel said it was difficult to make any prediction about the next season, but prices will most likely continue to rise. ""In Shravan, people refrain from using garlic and onion in Gujarat, but once Shravan is over, there will be a spike in demand accompanied by increase in prices,"" Patel said, adding, ""We expect onion prices to stabilize by last week of October or the first week of November, when the new crop arrives.""An office-bearer of APMC, Ahmedabad said that it was not just onion prices, but all vegetable prices have increased. Brinjals, according to quality, cost between Rs40 and Rs100 per kg in wholesale. At this time last year, tomatoes cost about one-fifth of what they cost now. Officials said vegetables in the retail market usually cost double or more than those in the wholesale market.APMC officials said that a good sign was that in the last couple of days prices had stabilized to a certain extent.

He added that by the end of this month, Kurnool stock will come and prices will come down.The consumers are worried that the prices will rise in next few days. Onion shops at rythu bazar experienced huge rush on Saturday. However, the rythu bazar officials are giving only three kilos per head.

The exorbitant prices are forcing them to cut down the consumption of onions.Jyothi Kshatriya, a homemaker, said: No matter what the price is, we will buy onions as it is a significant ingredient in any recipe.

5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

And the sudden increase in the prices can be attributed to low production and supply from Maharashtra and other neighbouring states.Almost 90 per cent supply comes from Maharashtra and 10 per cent from erstwhile Mahbubnagar district and some parts of Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, said J Ananthaiah, selection grade officer at Malakpet wholesale market.And if wholesalers are to be believed, big traders in Maharashtra are deliberately holding up the stock for weeks in cold storage, which is resulting in the huge hike. To get more profit, traders are holding the stock and creating an artificial scarcity.Actually, compared to past years, production of onion is very high in Maharashtra this year, said a wholesale dealer in Malakpet. Meanwhile, prices of tomatoes have come down drastically compared to last few months. On Friday, tomatoes were being sold at between `43 and `50 per kilo as against `90 per kilo in July."

If you thought you had seen it all with bhindi fry, masala, tadka or even a South Indian vengaya theeyal, then you Sir, need to order yourself some Bendakaya Pulusu at Nook, in Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park.The cafe style restaurant offers south Indian, north Indian, pan Asian and continental food. The ambience is set in green and white palette with box lights hanging from the ceiling. You are most likely to be surrounded by techies and a family crowd at this restaurant that also has a pool table and couch set in the lobby.The Lamb Seek Kabab is minced well and is topped with fresh coriander, the Prawns Tempura falls on the crunchier side and the Chicken Tikka was well marianted with flavours of the charred grill in the soft meat pieces. In the vegetarian part of the starters menu, the croquette were equal parts crunchy on the outside and goeey delicious on the inside.Among cocktails, the whiskey infused in tea, served chill was an interesting combination, but did fall back on the blend and the alcohol punch. The Hot Toddy is warm and soothing, but missed a brandy punch.And now that you have read through the starters, lets take a minute to talk about the bhindi, shall we? The Bendakaya Pulusu is hands down the best bhindi with tamarind curry combination I have had so far. The tamarind based gravy has the typical Indian curry texture with the sourness of the tamarind and tomatoes. And the ladies finger pieces soaks in the spicy tamarind curry flavours and makes for a delicious bite with naan. Save butter garlic naan for the non vegetarian curry, Id say.The Murgh Musallam, a Mughlai style chicken curry in the restaurant is rich and creamy. The onion based gravy underplays the spice tadka in the dish and tastes buttery instead. No complaints though.The aromatic Mutton Rogan Josh has rich Kashmiri flavours with delicate lamb chunks. The Chicken Biriyani came in as a colourful ensemble of rice cooked well, but was served cold. The Dal Makhani on the other hand was another star on the dinner table.The red kidney beans and black gram cooked with plenty of butter and spices was really smooth, creamy on the palate and yes, I asked for a second serving of this delicious Punjabi dal that stuck true to its roots.The cheesecake served with a side of blueberries sauce has balanced flavours of cream and cheese and has a chocolate chunk topping that adds crunch to the dessert.Place: Nook - Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, BellandurCost for two: `2000"

In some dishes, it was difficult to guess the ingredients even after tasting it. Anokhi Kheer, an old Hyderabadi dessert is one delight. Traditionally kheer has rice or some other similar ingredient in it. The word anokhi means unique, and the uniqueness of this particular kheer lies in the fact that it uses onions instead of the usual rice as the main ingredient with milk. However, the dessert does not even have even a little bit of sharpness of taste which we normally associate with onions.The story of Anokhi Kheer dates back a few centuries. Unlike some other Nizami dishes, this used to be a dessert of the masses. Onion was an economical ingredient, and it is said that middle class and poor citizens who could not afford good quality rice substituted it with onions in their dessert. Anokhi Kheer was a typical summer food, it was served chilled to keep the body cool.Anokhi Kheer is prepared the same way as you prepare any other kheer, but the main trick is to prevent the pungency of onion from overwhelming the taste. Large white onions are used here, and sliced onions are boiled in water multiple times till the same get blanched, bringing out the sweetness. Like other kheer recipes, it is then added to reduced milk, sugar and khoya. Powdered cardamom seeds almonds, cashews and pistachios are used to add further taste to the dish.Unfortunately, this unique dish is not commonly available now. Jewel of Nizam is perhaps the only restaurant which serves Anokhi Kheer as one of their signature dishes. However, a few wedding caterers and home chefs like home chef Ahaana Khan have kept this dish alive. According to Ahaana, Choice of the right onions and patience in removing the pungency are key to the taste of this delicate dish.She laments that now very few people know about this dish, and one of the reasons of this dish going off popularity charts might be that the prices of onions have gone up many times compared to rice in the last few decades. She also mentions about another similar dish in Hyderabadi cuisine known as Lehsooni Kheer, where large garlic pods replace onions in the preparation. She fervently hopes that these delectable dishes regain their popularity in the times to come."

The Kurnool Agricultural Marketyard supplies onions to Vijayawada, Chittoor and other parts of the State and one of the reasons being cited by traders in different parts of the State for the rising prices is supply shortage from Kurnool. But the ground situation in the Kurnool Agricultural Market Yard is different.Officials and wholesale merchants Express spoke to said there were enough stocks in the marketyard to meet the demand and blamed retail stores, traders and middlemen for the sudden spurt in prices. The wholesale price of onion in the marketyard was `2,020 per quintal on Saturday. In other words it is about `20.20 a kg. However, retailers are cashing in on the demand to make a killing. They have hiked the prices so as to double their margin of profit.We have sufficient arrivals. The rates here in the market are decreasing at the moment compared to last week. Last week, the price was `3,300 per quintal and today, it is `2,020. What the retailers are doing is defaming the market, Katta Sekhar, one of the directors of the marketyard committee and an onion trader himself, told Express.He clarified that there was no possibility of a hike in prices at the Kurnool marketyard in the near future. These are all speculations. An average of 30 trucks come here everyday. It is true that the weather has destroyed nearly 50 per cent of the crop, but that has not affected the market drastically in anyway, he explained, accusing the retailers of creating an artificial shortage.The marketyard secretary G Sivaramakrishna Sastry said that on Saturday alone, as many as 360 tonnes of onions arrived in the market. As per the directions of state government, the Kurnool marketyard exported 20 tonnes to Vijayawada and 10 to Chittoor. Nearly 20 lorries of onion load are sent to Odisha, West Bengal and other states from here regularly. Even now, the exports to other states are continuing from the Kurnool marketyard. According to official records, onion crop was sown in 9,000 hectares in the district this time. The district produces nearly 14 lakh quintals of onions.However, there are vendors who offer a different take. A wholesale vegetable vendor Hanumantharao Chowdary said that in the past few days, onion has entered the race of cash crops. Onion prices hit the roof due to rains as the crop has been damaged. Anticipating the trend to continue, retailers may resort to hoarding and create a crisis situation, resulting in the demand going up and, subsequently, the prices, he explained. Chowdary felt that if the government restricts exports to other states it may help in curbing the artificial shortage. Current wholesale price is `20.20 a kg, whereas in retail it is `35 to `40.Prices touch Rs 30 in ChittoorTirupati: For the last one week, onion prices have been going up. On Saturday, onions were selling between H24 and H32 kg depending on the quality. In the district headquarters of Chittoor, the price has shot up to H30 a kg.In Tirupati also the price touched H30 mark. Merchants in Madanapalli, Chittor, Tirupati, Srikalahasthi and Pileru, who have contacts with suppliers in other stats, are getting the stocks without much difficulty. At least there is no scarcity as of now in the district. Assistant Director Marketing K Indumathi said that there is no problem in getting onions."

Onion is sold at Rs 34/kg in Mumbai, Rs 40/kg in Kolkata and Rs 29/kg in Chennai, as per official data.To control the prices of onion, state governments have been advised to impose stock limits for onion on traders/ wholesalers, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted.A letter in this regard has been sent to state governments, who are empowered to take action against onion traders under the Essential Commodities Act.Onion prices have shot up in the last few weeks due to depleting old stocks and concerns about this years output as kharif sowing area is down by 20-30 per cent.Recently, Paswan had also written to the Commerce Ministry seeking imposition of MEP of USD 450 per tonne on onion to curb outbound shipments and withdrawal of incentives given to traders for its export.The issue was discussed at the recent meeting of the Committee of Secretaries, which too favoured imposition of MEP. A final decision is expected to be taken soon, sources said.Onion MEP was scrapped in December 2015. The MEP is the minimum rate below which exports cannot be undertaken.Last fiscal, India exported 34.92 lakh tonnes of onion.Onion stock of 2016-17 is being consumed currently. The new kharif crop is expected to arrive in full swing from next month."

The advisory informed that reports of a new ransomware, Locky, have surfaced and it is designed to block the data on the computers and demand money from the users for unblocking it. The alert pointed that Locky is similar to WannaCry ransome which had struck several parts of the world a couple of months back. The ransomware is being spread through a new file extension called diablo6.A new variant then adds the extension Lukitus to encrypt the files. Lukitus is a French word which means locking. Locky malware spreads through spam mails containing a malicious ZIP attachment. These ZIP file attachments contain visual basic scripts which are embedded in a secondary ZIP file. The VBS files contain a downloader leading to domain greatesthits(dot)mygoldmusic(dot)com. The e-mail messages contain common subjects like please print, documents, photos, images, scans and pictures.And, if these attachments are opened, variants of Locky ransomware gets downloaded automatically following which the desktop backgrounds of the computers change and display a HTM file named Lukitus(dot)htm. The users are then asked to pay a ransom of 0.5 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to `1.5 lakh. If the ransom is paid, the users are instructed to instal the Onion Router Network (ORN) browser, which leads to a decryption service. The advisory suggested the users to avoid opening attachments in emails from unknown sources, avoid opening links in emails and chat windows from unknown sources."
