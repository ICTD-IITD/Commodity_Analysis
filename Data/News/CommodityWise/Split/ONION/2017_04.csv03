In a week, onion prices at major trading centre of south Odisha, have risen from Rs. 12 to 14 per kg to Rs. 30 per kg. Traders say it may reach around Rs. 50 per kg soon.For the past few years, onion prices have risen steeply during the monsoons that includes the holy Shravan month. Usually kanwarias or persons involved in ritualistic offering of water at Shiva temples on Mondays of Shravan refrain from consuming non-vegetarian food as well as onion and garlic.This belief had become a good plea for roadside eateries to reduce their escalated production cost because of onion price hike. Onion price rise was coinciding with Shravan and it was showing downward trend by its end, said B.C. Sadangi, an activist."

KarthikeyanG_KARTHIKEYAN;G_KARTHIKEYAN - G_KARTHIKEYANCamaraderie and harmony were in the air at the 326th annual festival of St. Sebatstian Church at Muthazhagupatti here on Tuesday.The foothills of the Rock Fort witnessed the coming together of people belonging to different communities and castes in the preparations for the festival, which attracted over 10,000 pilgrims.The tradition is that at least one member of a family gets involved in the festival. This year, several members from each family, were engaged in the preparation of food and organising other festivities.While women were busy cutting vegetables, men engaged themselves in chopping meat and chicken. Children washed the cut vegetables and transported them to a mega kitchen set up on the church campus. Cooking was done in the traditional way in 12 big chulas using firewood.Dindigul Onion Commission Agents' Association offered 1.5 tonnes of onions and vegetable donated three tonnes of brinjal and one and a half tonnes of tomatoes.Devotees offered around 2,500 chicken and 600 goats for the community feast, said S. Robert of Muthazhagupatti.The excess rice offered by donors would be auctioned and the proceeds utilised for the next festival, said organiser A. Anbalagan.Elaborate arrangements were made to serve food to all pilgrims after the evening prayer. Around 10,000 areca leaf plates and 8,000 banana leafs were bought to serve food. Pilgrim could collect food for family members at home, he added.An interesting feature of the festival was 'anga pradakshanam' done by men after the evening prayer."
5a0f4f419855b76bf13d7d4a,Now  onion prices soar,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-onion-prices-soar/article19468761.ece,2017-08-11,"After remaining stable for over a year, the price of onion, a common ingredient in Indian cuisine, has begun to soar over the past one week. Rain that wreaked havoc in Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the supply to the city, traders said.Onions were priced at Rs. 40/kg in retail market on Wednesday and this may further go up, note traders.The Koyambedu wholesale market receives only half of the normal onion loads of 65 trucks daily. The city mainly receives its stock from Maharashtra and Gujarat apart from Karnataka.With the floods damaging crops in those States, less than half of the produce is reaching the city. Moreover, stocks from Karnataka are also being diverted to other places in north India like Delhi and Mumbai where the demand is high, traders said.Onions are priced up to Rs. 35 per kg in the wholesale market due to the increasing shortage, said P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association. Cabbage, a vegetable that is usually cheap, has become dearer as truck loads are being diverted to north India.Price of tomatoes downThough cost of tomatoes is steadily dipping, it still remains out of reach for many consumers and is priced up to Rs. 68 per kg in retail stores. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the market has started getting fresh supply of tomatoes from Hosur belt and this has brought down the price. But, we may have to wait till December for the onions to cost less as produce from Andhra Pradesh may arrive only then. Cost of onions may even go up to Rs. 60 a kg in retail market, he said.The supply scenario at Koyambedu wholesale complex is significant as several small markets in Chennai and other places such as Tindivanam, Cuddalore and Vandavasi depend on this wholesale hub for their supply. The sudden surge in prices of vegetables and off-season for weddings have also contributed to dull sales in the market. It may one or two months for sales to pick up, traders said."
5a0f4f7a9855b76bf13d7d68,Vegetable prices to remain high,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vegetable-prices-to-remain-high/article19468826.ece,2017-08-11,"Vegetable prices have been on the rise in the city for the last few days and are likely to remain high for the next few days.The average price of vegetables now is Rs. 30 a kg, says M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.The wholesale price of tomato is Rs. 40 a kg, small onion Rs. 70 a kg and big onion Rs. 30 a kg. Beans, carrot, yam and okra are all Rs. 40 a kg. In the case of chilli, it is Rs. 50 a kg. The prices of tomato and small onion are expected to come down and that of big onion go up, he says.Poor rainfallThe main reason for the spiralling prices is poor rainfall, say vegetable traders.There is no shortage in availability of vegetables and the demand has not reduced much because of the prices. Even in places where the rain has been good now, it will take three months for arrivals to start from these areas.Most of the arrivals to Coimbatore now are from other States.Further, there are restrictions to avoid overloading of trucks and transport costs are up, adding to the prices of the vegetables, Mr. Rajendran says.Hoteliers, domestic consumers and bulk buyers are affected equally. Even a domestic consumer needs four or five varieties of vegetables a day. Tomatoes and onions are essential. If the prices continue to remain high, it will bring down the volume of purchase.Usually, prices are down during this period. Arrivals from different parts of the State are not there now and most of the vegetables come from other States. Though hotels buy directly from farmers, availability is down this year because of monsoon failure, says D. Srinivasan, president of Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association. The volume of vegetables used cannot be reduced and there are no substitutes to replace some vegetables. Hence, hotels are finding it difficult to manage. Business is down 30 % since the implementation of GST, he says.The demand for vegetables will go up next month as the festival season starts and this might lead to further increase in prices, adds Mr. Rajendran."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

With collections from residents upwards of Rs3,000, the organizing committees are making sure that donors get their fair share of fun.With menus that cater to tastes of people from all regions, the food being served every day at a township in Ganeshpeth is a mix of Sindhi, Gujarati, Rajasthani and Maharashtrian food. ""It is important that the women are given freedom from cooking during this festival so that their participation is total,"" says Sunil Chirania, a businessman residing here.The members of this township are enjoying delectable food items for the past ten days. ""There are special menus for children which include chaat, noodles and pizza,"" he says. Many of the residents have paid an extra amount of Rs1,250 to enjoy the meals. ""This includes breakfast comprising of idili sambar, vada on two Sundays,"" says Chirania.Food also increases participation of members and ensures that a large crowd gathers at the venue. Besides the meals homemade prasad is also distributed at most places. ""Residents take turns at preparing halwa puri which is distributed every day,"" says Vikas Mishra a resident of Govind City near Zingabai Takli.""Combination meals like jhunka bhakar, pav bhaaji or chola bhatura along with two varieties of sweets are also served so that members don't have to go back home to have dinner,"" says Mishra.Even the societies that are not exactly cash rich are serving dinner for the members. ""There are 50 families residing here and we ourselves volunteer to organize dinner for nearly 100 persons who are present for the aarti,"" says schoolteacher Madhumita Bannerjee who resides in Pioneer Regency in Utkarsha Nagar.""Though we have a mahaprasad on the final day of the festival, for four days we also have what we call chota prasad where full dinner is served,"" she says.The size of the gathering varies from 75 to 200 at most of the venues in residential areas. ""The meal cost for this size is usually Rs10,000 and it includes a buffet of eight to ten items,"" says caterer Ankit Upadhyaye who is providing meals at many such venues. ""Maximum orders are from localities in Jaripatka and west Nagpur and Maharashtrians food is most preferred,"" he says.The rates are heavily subsidized by caterers as its fixed business for them and gets them publicity and exposure, says Neeraj Lakhotia whose residential society near Wathoda has not changed the caterer for past ten years. All types of food ranging from Punjabi, Gujarati and Maharashtrian is served for members here.Everyday there is a special menu without onion and garlic for Jain community members who are observing ten days of paryushan during this time. ""When we started the catering bill was around Rs50,000 and today it is a little over Rs2 lakhs. But they also form a rapport and provide their services at private functions of many residents round the year,"" he says."

Celebrated in honour of Lord Vishnu, it is another occasion for friends and family to share a traditional meal.Taking this tradition to even greater lengths, the landmark 350-year-old Mhamai Kamat house near the old secretariat, Panaji, throws open its doors to over a 1,000 visitors, of every faith.More popularly known as the 'Kongyachem Fest' (for the presence of a unique right-sided conch decorated with precious ornaments in the house), people throng to 'Casa de Camotims Mhamai' not only to witness newborn children being offered in a 'pudve' as thanksgiving to God at the matoli, but to indulge in a traditional 'Mahanaivedya' Saraswat meal on that day, which falls on September 5 this year.""Though the house is over three centuries-old, the Mhamai Kamats have been celebrating Anant Chaturdashi for just 150 years. The Mhamai Kamats consist of 10 families, which are spread out, but congregate here for this festival. During the Portuguese era, the Portuguese governor would always visit us on this day. Previously, invites would go out to people, but in the last 10 years we have stopped issuing printed invites. Instead we put a small advertisement in the paper,"" says ex-director of archives and archeology S K Mhamai.Meals, which are prepared from over 14 traditional vegetables, ranging from 'khatkhatem' to 'moongagatti' and the sweet 'payasam', are cooked by chefs brought all the way from Karnataka. ""These are mostly Saraswat cooks known to us. Meals are cooked in separate, large, copper utensils, maintained by us especially for religious functions, on wood fire. On this day, additional 'chulas' are set up in the spacious family kitchen to prepare meals for the large crowd. One important aspect of preparation is that no onion or garlic (which we consider non-vegetarian) is added to the food. It is a pure Saraswat preparation. Also, as a matter of tradition, we do not take any outside donations of food or otherwise,"" says Mhamai.To prepare for the big day, women of the family, including a large group of maids, clean and dice the vegetables. Cooking commences at noon. Every preparation is then offered to the deity as 'naivedya'.In a deviation from regular practice, on Anant Chaturdashi, no lunch is served to the public at the Mhamai Kamat house. Rather, a large spread is prepared for the evening. For the first batch of people who arrive at around 5pm, servings are on traditional banana leaves on the floor. After this initial serving, a buffet is laid out. Stainless steel plates are specially rented for the occasion.""The house is packed to capacity and queues stretch right outside as well. But no one is ever turned back without a meal. Our door is never locked,"" says Mhamai. ""The cooks are constantly replenishing the food. From the richest to the poorest, everybody partakes of a meal. Serving generally goes on till 12 midnight.""The buffet is a recent development in the last four years due to the paucity of space and helping hands. The most interesting aspect of this occasion is that not only people of different faiths enjoy a meal with us, but they come from as far as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. Throughout the night there are 'bhajans' and prayers offered till 'utar' puja the next day.""Close to the heritage precincts in Mala , the ancestral Mahale house has been observing a similar tradition for over 80 years. ""We have thousands of visitors,"" says Raghuvir Mahale. ""We start at 6am, when people bring offerings of milk, fruit and the like, and puja commences at 8am. Lunch is generally served in a buffet at around 1.30pm or so and goes on till 3-4pm. With the exception of the 'bhats', who are served on traditional banana leaves on the floor in front of the deity, the others eat at the buffet under a pandal outside the house. This is also an occasion to cook traditional vegetables like 'aluchi bhaji' which is a rarity these days.""We, however, do not cook mushroom as it is sometimes considered non-vegetarian. We also do not use onion or garlic in our cooking,"" says Mahale, who believes that such occasions are an opportunity for members of the various faiths that visit to witness the unique tradition of Anant Chaturdashi at both these houses."

It is located in Rajgurunagar, about 45km from Pune. It has developed several varieties of both the crops in the past two decades.A team of scientists led by project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of the DOGR has developed nine hybrid onion varieties. Of these, two are exclusively developed to for size uniformity.Confirming this development, DOGR director Major Singh, said, ""This is a breakthrough for us. With this, uniform-sized onions will be a reality in India soon. Preliminary findings of these varieties are excellent. Now, we are hopeful of releasing these varieties in the market by mid-2018. This variety will have a huge demand in the export market.""The team claimed that the varieties have been developed after conducting extensive research for a decade. In 2012, these varieties had been sent to multi-locations testing centres.Commenting on the observations of last five years, Gupta said, ""At six testing zones, these varieties have given positive results in bulb size and early maturity period than existing onion varieties.""As per the mandate, the DOGR team will compile a comprehensive report based on their observations and submit it to the ICAR varietal recommendation committee for recommendation.Gupta said there is a huge demand for uniform-sized onions in open markets not only in India and abroad."

Private traders have already imported around 4,000 metric tonnes of onions so far from Egypt and import of another 6,000 metric tonnes of onions are on way to Mumbai, which is expected within a week or two.The landing price of onions from Egypt in Mumbai is at Rs 20-22.But the average wholesale onion prices currently have dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. And traders are ruing their decisions due to decline in wholesale onion prices in domestic market.""These traders from Mumbai and elsewhere in the country are lamenting their decision to import inions since the domestic wholesale price of the commodity has dipped significantly. Their decision to import onions has gone wary and would have incur losses to sell them in the domestic market,"" said the sources close to the development.According to sources there is no chance that these traders will make any profit by selling imported onions,"" said a onion importer, who is importing over onion laden 100 containers each with 20 tonnes.The average wholesale onion prices in the domestic markets increased five times from Rs 450 per quintal on May 31 to Rs 2,450 per quintal on August 10, registering 20-month high price due to short of supply. Previous high of average wholesale onion price had been recorded at Rs 2,450 per quintal on November 19, 2015.In retail markets of Nashik, onion prices have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 30 per kg after rise in wholesale onion prices in past two-three months. The retail onion prices have reached up to Rs 40 per kg in many other parts of the country.The average wholesale onion prices are fluctuated in the range from Rs 1,550 per quintal to Rs 2,200 per quintal in past 20 days.The average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon APMC was recorded at Rs 1,500 per quintal on Friday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 700 and Rs 1,750 per quintal, respectively on Friday at Lasalgaon. Around 17,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Friday.There will be no fresh harvest of the crop up to mid-October. And the kharif plantation of onions too has been delayed due to late arrival of monsoon. Presently, the onions arriving in the market are of summer crop harvested during March and April. Since the shelf life of summer onions is much more than the kharif onions, the farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices.According to APMC sources, although the prices have dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal, but it may increase further towards Rs 2,000 per quintal in next few days due to short of supply in the country although there has been enough stock in Maharashtra."

Whenever I need directions, I stop by a rickshaw. And I get perfect directions to my destination from one of the thousands of hard working men who have left their villages to make Delhi their home.That is why, when I was on my way to Lajpat Nagar in search of a chholey bhaturey wallah that I had not visited ever, I didnt worry. I took the Metro from Rajendra Prasad Road to Lajpat Nagar, and once I walked out of the station at the Lajpat Nagar Metro Station, I jumped on to a waiting rickshaw.I am looking for some special chholey bhaturey, I said to him. Oh, Anandji, he replied, and took me right there.Its nice to know that there are still some chholey bhaturey in Delhi that I have not tried out.Seeing is believingI had been hearing about Anandji for a while, but, as it happens sometimes, I had never gone there. Last week, I thought I couldnt call myself a chhole bhatura expert if there was a much talked of place that I had not been to. So, as I said, I took the Metro.This is a 22-year-old shop in Lajpat Nagar 1. The address is Shop No 3, Krishna Market (Tel nos 011-29817406 and 41326226; owner Bittus number: 9811301302). I was quite impressed by the place  it was spic and span, and had high tables for those who wanted to stand there and have a quick meal. I was there pretty early in the day, so it was not crowded either. There were a few people there, and I was happy to see that they were all eating chholey bhaturey.I asked for four plates  each for Rs 70. The bhatureys were not enormous, as some bhatureys are. This I thought was the right size  neither too large, nor too small. The chholey was superb  and what I really enjoyed was that it wasnt dripping oil, or overwhelmed with spices. It was almost like the good chholey that you get at home, with the perfect balance of spices. There was a nice juicy piece of potato in the chholey, which came with chutney, some pickle and onion rings.The service is smooth, too. I went in, placed my order, paid up, went to the counter where I presented my receipt, and within fifteen minutes, I was out of the place, where my friendly neighbour GPS-wallah was waiting.There are quite a few other items on the menu, too  chholey poori, rajma rice, kadi rice and dal makhni rice, all for Rs. 70 a plate. There is a thali (Rs. 100) and a special thali (Rs. 130). From 4 pm to 8 pm you get aloo samosa, paneer pakora, jalebi and break pakora. They also sell a dal samosa, which I must try out one day.Anandji is also known for its lassi  sweet and salted (Rs. 60/Rs. 40).

The Centre will extend all help to those willing entrepreneurs towards establishing and expanding food processing industries that will provide value addition to the varied agriculture produce in the country, Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal said.Inaugurating a common food processing incubation centre for shallots at Chettikulam in Perambalur district through video conferencing from New Delhi, Ms. Badal pointed out that the facility got up under the joint auspices of the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) and the State Government would now help shallot growers avoid loss due to price variations and post harvest damages.Stating that the new facility would go a long way in helping farmers realise Prime Minister Narendra Modis dream of doubling the per capita agricultural income by 2022, Ms. Badal said that shallot growers suffered a lot due to climate, economic and market conditions in the absence of positive solutions to address their grouse. What is grown on the fields must fetch the farmers a profitable return. This facility will now show the way for onion growers not just in Tamil Nadu but also to those in Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country to get the benefits of proper value addition, she insisted.Stressing that agricultural produce must be supplemented with value addition, the Union Minister said that farmers must not just remain producers but should move ahead to become food processors and that would increase their income manifold. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries was extending all help to such agri entrepreneurs and investors through the flagship Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro Processing Clusters (SAMPADA) that rains a host of benefits including sizeable subsidies, Ms. Badal underlined.In particular, she invited the farmer producer companies and food processing entrepreneurs to participate in the upcoming World Food India fair in New Delhi between November 3 and 5 where a world of opportunities awaited them.Perambalur District Collector V. Santha observed that shallots were grown on over 8,000 hectares and the production levels touched 70,000 tonnes. Stakeholders would stand to gain in times of glut when they could have a stable return while they could also benefit from the value added products they could generate through the technology dissemination by the Common Facilitation Centre.IIFPT Director C. Anandharamakrishnan said four value added shallots products were available through the centre for the farmers group to produce. The peeled onion, onion flakes, onion powder and onion paste were poised to get the farmers remarkable returns in the international and domestic markets. The IIFPT has developed onion peeler, stem and root cutter and solar assisted curing cum storage unit especially for the Chettikulam Centre. The measures would help extending the shelf life of peeled onion and other products to get better returns to the producer group, he said.Head, Department of Technology Dissemination, IIFPT, A. Amudhasurabi explained the salient features of the centre and sketched the development initiatives of the IIFPT for the benefit of farmers."

However, with the prices seeing a gradual increase, farmers have decided to use the opportunity to cultivate onion with the hope it will bring them profit this year.According to Horticulture Department officials, the sowing target for the district is 3,398 hectares, including 1,705 hectares in Basavanabagewadi, 1,071 hectares in Vijayapura, 263 hectares in Indi, and 210 hectares in Muddebihal taluk.However, officials believe that with several farmers having irrigation facilities, it would be possible to exceed that target significantly.At present, the price of onionis between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 2,000 a quintal in the open market. Officials predict the price to remain steady in the coming days.Rudrappa Lamani, a farmer from Basavanabagewadi taluk, said that last year, several farmers kept the onion produce for a long time hoping that the prices would increase. But onion is perishable and cannot be stored for months. The farmers kept it in their sheds for around three months, but after that the produce started rotting. Having no choice, the farmers were forced to sell the crop for a meagre market price. Unfortunately, just after a month, the prices started going up, he said.He, however, expressed hope that they would get reasonable prices this season. The farmer said that while the cost of sowing is Rs. 1.25 lakh a hectare, it is expected result in a yield of around 20 tonnes."

Onion has been cultivated in 10,000 hectares till date this year as against 20,000 hectares last year.The price of dry onion shot up to about Rs. 3,000 for about four days in August first week when there was no rainfall and this led to more farmers raising the crop.

The minister said that following the increase of onion prices to `20,000 per tonne a month ago, farmers took up the cultivation of onion in large areas, leading to overproduction and fall in prices. And the prices have dropped to `4,000 per tonne, much to the dismay of the onion growers in the State.

Analyst feel the pressure on the economy is immense with retail inflation figures, released last week, showing a five-month high of 3.36 per cent in August due to costlier vegetables and fruits.Under such circumstances, experts say the Reserve Bank of India will have less elbow room to manoeuvre another rate cut following up on repo rate cut by 0.25 per cent last month. The central bank had stated it would try to keep retail inflation close to 4 per cent.There have been such episodes in the past and we need to double up our efforts to boost agri-production as well as improve the distribution and supply chains, said Pankaj Patel, president, Ficci. Led by onion prices that went up 88.46 per cent, vegetable prices increased 44.91 per cent in August, against 21.95 per cent in July, according to the Wholesale Price Index data released by the Union commerce ministry on Thursday.The prices of food articles went up by 5.75 per cent in August on a yearly basis, against 2.15 per cent in July. The localised impact of uneven distribution of rainfall on agri-production will have to be minimised through measures on the supply side including through better storage infrastructure for agri-commodities, said Patel.The data indicates the fuel inflation was high as petrol and diesel prices continued to remain high which is linked to the global crude oil rates. In addition the power tariffs also increased following lower domestic production. The fuel and power segment experienced high inflation at 9.99 per cent, against 4.37 per cent in July.A huge jump in petrol by over 24 per cent and diesel by over 20 per cent is worrisome and would prove to be cascading, Assocham stated. The industry chamber urged the government to bring fuel under the GST to save consumers from the heavy burden of taxation both at the Centre and state level.

It also cut its GVA growth forecast to 6.9 per cent from the earlier 7.2 per cent.Stating that the RBI may go for a rate cut at the December review of the policy, BofAML said, ""Although inflation is turning up to 3.1 per cent in August on rising tomato and onion prices and 4.6-4.9 per cent in 1H18, it is still well within the RBI's 2-6 per cent inflation target.""HSBC said there are ""downward risks"" to its growth forecast of 7.1 per cent, while Japanese brokerage Nomura cut its calendar 2017 forecast by 0.20 per cent to 6.7 per cent.""The key question is how soon the economy will recover from the GST-led disruptions,"" Nomura said. The brokerage, however, said that the RBI will hold rates.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they continue to see a recovery, but the data release poses downward risks to its growth forecasts.""The key risks to the outlook are the impact of weaker monsoon on agricultural output; the pace of NPL resolution, which would affect credit growth; and private capex and global trade conditions,"" it said.India's GDP grew slower at 5.7 per cent during April-June -- the lowest in three years of the Modi government while lagging China for the second straight quarter -- as manufacturing slowed ahead of the GST launch and note ban impact lingered.Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2017-18 was lower than 6.1 per cent of the preceding one and 7.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal.China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in January-March as well as April-June quarters.Expressing concern on the GDP numbers, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said manufacturing growth rate seems to have bottomed out as GST has been implemented and destocking of pre-GST stocks is almost complete."

One, because I am from Chennai which was formerly known as Madras. Second is because back from 1994-97 I was known to make a no-wait infusion cuisine at a time when everybody was expected to follow tradition. I was always fond of making new dishes and was the first to introduce paneer tikka pizza, which was made fun of at that point only to become popular later on.If someone enters my kitchen to learn I expect them to give nothing less than 100%. When we create new dishes, it may be too early for the time but we select dishes based on a balance of feasibility and the scope for marketing. My first dish was a cheese fondue when I was five, inspired from an Asterix comic with some help from my grandmother. It came out pretty well. I have come a long way and have created my own inventions like the orange peel what the corner and white chocolate pasta.My inspiration comes from all around. I refer to the flavour wheel and keep innovating to make new dishes. Food is my calling and I have the ability to visualise what a dish will look like, even before it is made. I can smell flavors and tell if a dish is salted, just by smelling it. I consider this my superpower.I remember a funny incident from college. There was a friend who rarely attended classes. During one of the tests when we had to make pasta and kheer, he ended up putting olives in the kheer and grapes in the pasta because he couldnt make out the difference between the two and it was hilarious.My comfort food comprises of anything made at home. For example, a good meal would be curd rice with pickle. I love to cook for my family and friends and I love the food that my family cooks for me; food is all about memories. My daughter is my biggest critic. If she likes something I have made, then its definitely the best.Molecular gastronomy is neither good nor bad but its definitely fun. Food wastage is a big issue in the food industry. I am the kind of guy that finishes whats on the plate, no matter how bad or good it is. It is sad to see people load up their plates even if they cannot finish it just because they feel they have paid for it. I am connected with a couple NGOs that collect excess food and give them to the needy.To anyone who is new to cooking I would say, just go ahead and try without worrying about perfection. It will come eventually. Ensure you are able to recreate whatever you do. My latest culinary experiment includes hope beef burger with an onion marmalade and slow cooked pork ribs."

Onion is sold at Rs 34/kg in Mumbai, Rs 40/kg in Kolkata and Rs 29/kg in Chennai, as per official data.""To control the prices of onion, state governments have been advised to impose stock limits for onion on traders/ wholesalers,"" Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted.A letter in this regard has been sent to state governments, who are empowered to take action against onion traders under the Essential Commodities Act.Onion prices have shot up in the last few weeks due to depleting old stocks and concerns about this year's output as kharif sowing area is down by 20-30 per cent.Recently, Paswan had also written to the Commerce Ministry seeking imposition of MEP of USD 450 per tonne on onion to curb outbound shipments and withdrawal of incentives given to traders for its export.The issue was discussed at the recent meeting of the Committee of Secretaries, which too favoured imposition of MEP. A final decision is expected to be taken soon, sources said.Onion MEP was scrapped in December 2015. The MEP is the minimum rate below which exports cannot be undertaken.Last fiscal, India exported 34.92 lakh tonnes of onion.Onion stock of 2016-17 is being consumed currently. The new kharif crop is expected to arrive in full swing from next month."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.

This is a crucial time for the onion farmers and if traders are engaging into hoarding and suspending auctions we shall take all possible measures against it, said B Radhakrishnan, district collector of Nashik.The farmers who feared that the onion markets were crashing and loss of produce due to rainy weather had resorted to agitation and had brought onions in larger quantities to the market. However, due to panicky situation amongst the traders after the IT raids, the auctions remained hampered and onion rates crashed by around 35 per cent in past two days, said the APMC sources.On Wednesday, the per quintal prices of onion at Lasalgaon APMC were around `1400. They fell to around `1000 on Thursday and further slide down to `500 on Friday, said Jaydatta Holkar, APMC Chairman of Lasalgaon.IT officials have raided two of the biggest traders in Lasalgaon. They have a capacity to buy out 30 per cent of the onion that comes in to the APMC. Since their trading has been stopped, the market is down, he added. He also blamed the farmers saying that some of the farmers didnt want to sell their onions at such a low price and hence stopped the auctions.Meanwhile, the raids are still on and relatives of some of the traders too might have to face the interrogation, said tax officials. The places where raids were conducted have increased from 24 to over 30 in past couple of days. Since the trading in APMCs remains closed on weekends, the onion traders are expected to huddle together tomorrow to decide on conducting auctions on Monday."

We will fight until this tax regime is withdrawn, Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said.Party leaders said increase in central excise duty 11 times in the past three and half years---133.47 percent in petrol and 400.86 percent in diesel, coupled with high food prices, has hit the people hard.Due to rise in fuel prices, food inflation showed rising price trends of onion at 88.46 percent, vegetables at 44.91 percent, and fruits at 7.35 percent and milk at 3.94 percent.Maken said though the prices of international crude oil have come by over 50 percent in the past three years, the benefits have not been passed on to the consumers.This, he said, would provide an ideal situation for the Congress to oppose the government, whose way of handling economic growth too has raised several eyebrows.The Congress, which had paid dearly for first reducing the number of domestic LPG cylinders per family per year from 12 to 9 and later restoring it to 12, further said that the centres decision to hike price of such fuel by Rs 4 per month from July this year has adversely affected around 18.11 crore customers.The price of a subsidised LPG cylinder has gone up from Rs 412 in 2014 to Rs 487, said Maken adding the kerosene users too had been impacted."
