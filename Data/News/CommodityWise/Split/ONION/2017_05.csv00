Onion prices have seen almost 100 per cent rise in past couple of weeks. Alarmed over the situation, Centre has directed the States to take proper measures including imposing stock limits to control the price surge.Prices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Wholesale traders in Delhi claimed that the reason is due to a shortfall in supplies from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. These regions have seen a deficit in rainfall which affected production in these States. On the contrary, many states like Rajasthan and Gujarat witness excess rain leading to damage of crops, said Surender Goyal, a trader in Azadpur wholesale market in the national capital.Traders claimed currently supply is mainly from Maharashtra.There might be possibility of hoarding or profiteering by the traders in Maharashtra leading to the surge in price. Supply in Delhi and other parts have come down and it will remain low in coming weeks due to heavy rain in Maharashtra these days, added Goyal.Officials of the Consumer Affairs ministry said that hoardings cant be ruled out at this stage to make a profit out of the current situation.Seeing this, states have been told to keep watch on such elements and take proper action accordingly. They can also impose stock limit to avoid hoardings, said an official.Meanwhile, the traders claimed that the situation will remain similar for some days as the new crop will start arriving from September onwards.Supply will start improving only after mid-September and till then price will remain in the range of Rs 30-40 a kg, said another trader.Onion price risePrices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Supply has come down due to bad weather in many parts of the country.States have been told to keep watch on hoardings and take proper action accordingly.

The truck owner was trying to change a flat tyre when the ill fated state transport corporation bus rammed into it. Around 20 passengers sustained severe injuries in the accident.Widening of Nashik-Pune Highway into a four-lane road is incomplete near Narayangaon, which might have lead to the accident, local sources said.While speaking at a function at Pune on Sunday Union transport minister Niton Gadkari had blamed the officials from his own department for causing delays in highway repairs.The accident at Narayangaon was the second accident within hours of Gadkari's public admonition of the officials. Earlier in the day another MSRTC bus had rammed into a truck near Shindewadi on Pune-Satara highway. Though there were no causalities reported in the accident, other two accidents in Nashik district were not so fortunate.In an accident on Yeola-Manmad highway in Nashik district 10 people lost lives when an SUV rammed into a Maruti Omni and a bus coming from opposite direction last evening, while Onion merchant Indar Chopra and his employee Sanjay Thube were killed when their car was hit by an unknown vehicle on the Manmad-Malegaon highway in the early hours on Monday."

(Bhola Prasad) The price of onion is hovering around Rs 35 to Rs 40 in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, almost double its normal rate, disturbing family budgets to the extent that state food and civil supplies minister Saryu Roy on Tuesday evening conceded it was a genuine problem. In Jamshedpur on Tuesday, minister Roy directed deputy commissioners of all 24 districts to take steps to stem the price rise. ""I received complaints from ordinary citizens not just in Jamshedpur, but also from Ranchi, Dhanbad and Hazaribagh, about onion's skyrocketing prices. I directed all DCs this evening (Tuesday) to ensure retailers sell at wholesale prices. I understand onions coming from Nashik are costly, resulting in a sharp spurt in price in Jharkhand. But, we should try to ensure retailers and wholesalers don't hike rates arbitrarily using this excuse,"" said Roy, who is also Jamshedpur West MLA. But, despite the minister's best intentions, it is not clear if DCs can tame the prices. Shambhu Gupta, member of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce & Industries (FJCCI), and its foodgrain committee member, said various factors were involved behind onion's soaring prices. ""For onions, Jharkhand depends on Nashik and Madhya Pradesh. But, rain damaged onion crops in Madhya Pradesh, hence the entire pressure of supply shifted on onion mandis in Nashik. So, obviously price will rise. In Nashik, earlier wholesale rate of onion was Rs 15 per kilo. It is now Rs 20. Add to add transport costs during rain, with further risk of damage. That's why price has gone up in Jharkhand too,"" said Gupta. Madan Prasad, a wholesale onion dealer at Pandra Bazar Samiti in Ranchi, agreed. ""We are selling good quality onion at Pandra wholesale market at Rs 27. Obviously, retailers will raise prices,"" he said. Satyanarayan Agarwal, a wholesaler and a senior functionary of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Jamshedpur, said it looked like people would have to put up with costly onions till Durga Puja. ""Prices can reduce only when new onion crops reach the market in the last week of September,"" he said."

""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda.

Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

However, no dealer shall sell or offer to sell to any person onions at a price higher than that specified in the list of prices of stocks. The administration also made it mandatory to issue cash memo at the time of sale of onions. Besides, every dealer, who imports onions to the state in bulk by rail or road, will need to furnish a weekly return. The deputy commissioner issued the rules to regulate the onion market following a recent surge in the prices of the vegetable. Onion is currently selling for Rs 40 a kg in the Guwahati market.

And it seems the airline companies have finally understood this universal truth.All the companies are scrambling their menu cards to provide their customers with the ultimate food experience as they fly towards their destinations. The cuisine being offered range from the oriental, continental etc to the local flavours.Among the airlines, Kochi-headquartered Air India Express has gone the extra mile and are giving their passengers the choicest of Malabar food, mainly Malabari poratta and chicken curry from their customised ala carte.Air India Express claims they are the only company in the country which serves complimentary snacks, both the veg and non-veg variety, in the domestic and international routes.We have added varieties like Malabar chicken, meen vattichathu, poratta and chicken to our lunch and dinner menus. These dishes can be ordered only online up to 24 hours prior to the departure of the flight. Bar snacks and starters such as chicken tangri kebab with mint chutney, chicken 65 and chicken nuggets with tomato ketchup rosemary chicken with caramelized onion in multi cereal roll and jeera rice served alongside butter paneer and aloo gobi with salad and gulab jamun are potential enough to tickle the taste buds of passengers, said the spokesperson of the AIE.AIEs inclusion of non-vegetarian dishes in its menu assumes significance considering the fact that Air India, the parent company of AIE, had recently discontinued the supply of these dishes in the economy class its domestic flights as part of cost cutting. The national carrier had also been in news a couple of times for mixing up veg and non-veg orders.According to a report tabled in the Parliament by the Civil Aviation Ministry officials, Air India had mixed up orders three times. Also, the airline had received as many as 44, 27 and 48 complaints in the last three years, regarding the quality of food and catering service. The multiple complaints forced the airline to take appropriate action against the caterer as per the contractual terms.Cost cutting measuresAir India stopped serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of its domestic flights as part of cost cutting measures. It also launched various cost cutting measures like a change in menu, meal schedule, rationalisation of dry stores and ancillary items as per current trends.The annual savings which are expected to be made from these measures is Rs 20 crore, said the officials while replying to a query. The annual savings from the discontinuation of non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of Air India domestic flights are expected to be around Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore, said Ministry. Apart from saving cost, it will reduce wastage, improve service and also prevent any chances of mix-ups.This doesnt mean the national carrier is dragging its feet in improvising the airline menu. The airline company has taken steps to improve its catering services by introducing new improved menu, doing away with food items not preferred by passengers, has began training chefs at its international stations on Indian cuisine, taking up passenger and crew feedbacks with the caterers aggressively and monitoring the quality or presentation of meal service closely and making surprise visits to the caterers often. Further, follow ups will be taken for rectifications if a deficiency in the caterers service is noticed, said officials.Local flavours a hitAround 95 per cent of air passengers from Kerala prefer to have local dishes onboard, said Gunasekaran Chandrasekaran, chief chef with Casino Air-caterers and Flight Services, Kochi.Today airlines are putting more emphasis on including as many deshi dishes as possible in their menu. And there has been a good feedback regarding the local cuisine. We have received orders from three major airlines to provide special Onam dishes for its flights to Kerala, he said.Though he refused to disclose the dishes since the airlines are planning the menu as a surprise for their passengers, a senior AIE officer said those flying with Air India Express will be greeted with a special Kerala sweet dish onboard the flight.Experts associated with the flight kitchens also maintain there has been a considerable increase in foreigners who visit the state and nearly all of them prefer to savour the best of the local flavour."

Onion prices surged a whopping 88.46 per cent in August as against a contraction of 9.50 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.45 per cent in August compared with 2.18 per cent in July.In the fuel and power segment, the WPI-based inflation saw a surge to a near double-digit level at 9.99 per cent against 4.37 per cent in July.Apart from vegetables, the food articles that saw a rise in prices include pulses, fruits (7.35 per cent), egg, meat and fish (3.93 per cent), cereals (0.21 per cent) and paddy (2.70 per cent).However, potato continued to see contraction at 43.82 per cent and pulses 30.16 per cent.The final print of June WPI inflation remained unchanged from the provisional estimate of 0.90 per cent.The sharp rise in wholesale and retail prices in August is likely to make the Reserve Bank of India ponder over the policy rate trajectory for the short- and medium-term. Last month, the RBI had cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low."

While there will be a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on September 20, at least 10 lakh signatures will be collected for a memorandum to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The signatures will be collected from people at petrol pumps for three days from Sunday. All Congress state units have been asked to devise their own programmes against the rising prices of petroleum products and food items like onions, tomatoes, some pulses and other vegetables. While onion and tomato prices have shot past Rs 50 a kg, some pulses are selling at over Rs 100 per kg even as arhar prices crashed after crossing Rs 200 last year. Congress leader Ajay Maken said at a news conference today: ""If petrol or food items sell at higher prices because of unavoidable circumstances, we can understand. But this government indulges in profiteering by looting ordinary citizens. Petroleum products are a case in point. The domestic prices have soared as international crude oil rates have gone down."" Maken added: ""While the government has given absurd reasons like 'Hurricane Harvey and Irma' for the increase in petrol and diesel prices, it has dealt a devastating blow to the savings of the common people by increasing central excise 11 times in the past three and a half years - 133.47% on petrol and 400.86% on diesel. The government has also robbed 18.11 crore LPG consumers by increasing the prices of subsidised cylinders by Rs 75 in the past three years."" Pointing out that international crude oil prices have come down more than 52 per cent since the Modi government took over on May 26, 2014, Maken said: ""If you take petrol of Rs 100, Rs 51.78 is going to the government in the form of taxes. In diesel worth Rs 100, Rs 44.40 is tax. This is dacoity. Which government punishes citizens to make up for its own (revenue) shortfall caused by wrong economic policies? This is not only insensitive, this is loot."" Maken declared that the Congress ""shall fight this battle to reduce taxes on every available forum"". ""We dare the BJP to come out with a white paper on taxes on fuel and the total gains. The Congress demands immediate withdrawal of excessive central excise duties and other taxes."" Maken stressed that the government had adopted a devious strategy to mislead people by raising prices in small instalments. ""18.11 crore customers purchase subsidised gas cylinders every month. The government decided to increase the price of every cylinder by Rs 4 every month until the subsidy is wiped out. In the last three years, the hike on a gas cylinder was Rs 75. This is done when international price is so low. The UPA government was paying a subsidy of Rs 449 per cylinder to provide relief to the common citizen."""

A long break in rain has heightened prospects of soya crop failure and portends a big trouble for farmers reeling under heavy debt.In past one year, they faced back to back losses, notwithstanding bumper crops of orange and onion. Post-demonetisation, onion was sold for Re 1 before the government stepped in. ""The government woke up too late and started procuring onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg. By the time the procurement started, thousands of farmers had already sold lakhs of tonnes of onion,"" said farmers in Agar Malwa bitterly.""It should rain soon or the soya crop may damage,"" they said. The district in western MP is known for producing good quality orange, onion and soyabean. Grown over almost 50,000 acres of land, orange crop was hit by demonetisation when traders did not turn up to buy the produce. Availability of onion at dirt cheap rate dealt another blow to growers.Poor rain in the district led to stunted growth of the soya crop. This is happening when many farmers are under debtfrom Rs 1 to Rs3 lakhdepending on the land area under cultivation.A farmer, Roop Narayan is trying hard to save his soya crop. Narayan, who sowed soya between rows of orange plants on 10 bighas of land, says, ""I incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh after spending Rs 3 lakh on onion crop. I had no other option, but to borrow more money from the cooperative societies. I am just praying nothing goes wrong this time.""He said the government should have ""reacted early"" to procure onions from farmers. The decision was taken after more than 15 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh could get barely Rs 90,000 by selling onion at Rs 2/ kg. He said the government, which talks a lot about the farmers, should actually do something concrete for them.Jain Singh, another farmer of the region, says, ""We need warehouses for onion and yields like tomato and orange cultivated in the region.""Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen, however, said, "" Onion procurement benefited 99% farmers. The government also procured urad and moong from farmers. We will always be around to help farmers."""

With Onam hardly two weeks away, they are worried whether the crisis will hit their plans for the festival.Taking into account the current rate for export of perishables at $1.75, the country is losing foreign exchange of Rs. 16.53 lakh daily.The crisis has hit the 50 exporters and over 10,000 people, from farmers to loaders at the airport. Operating airlines and allied service providers such as the KSIE and the CIAL have taken a hit.Exporters concernInclement weather at the source markets of Valiyoor, Kalakkad, Nagercoil, and Tirunelveli and shortfall in production had jacked up the prices. The price of banana has gone up to Rs. 80, njalipoovan Rs. 115, and small onion Rs. 125 a kg. The exporters say they will have to sell the perishables at a higher price overseas.The overseas buyers are not ready to bear the price hike as the shipment from Kerala is based on long-term C&F (cost and freight) basis. Moreover, there is stiff competition from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Africa, and other countries for these perishables, Secretary of the Agricultural Products and Processed Food Exporters Association (APPEXA) Dil Koshy said.A farmer-turned exporter from Valiyoor, Kanakarajan says selling the produce in the local market is more lucrative now.The GST on freight charges (on an average Rs. 52 a kg) has compounded the problems. Though refundable as there is no GST for agricultural produce and freight charges, an exporter with a freight of Rs. 2 crore a fortnight will need Rs. 36 lakh for remitting GST.The working capital has gone up and how will the exporter mobilise the funds. There is apprehension over the repayment of GST and confusion prevails, Mr. Koshy said.The APPEXA says a proper IT platform can solve the issue as the airports have the EDI-MES facility that has details of the export.The Centre and the State have to be approached for immediate solution for repayment of GST as the overseas buyer will not wait for us and we will loose the market, he added."

Their contention was that the yard barely had any facilities to support trade.Members of the Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association said they had learnt through newspaper announcements that the allotees of the new yard and some traders at the Yeswantpur ward had been asked to shift to the Dasanapura yard from Friday morning. They also said farmers who had travelled from Hassan with their produce were asked to take gate passes from Dasanapura before coming to the Yeswantpur ward.Protesting against this, hundreds of farmers and traders slept on the road outside the APMC yard to prevent vehicle movement and even dumped onions and potatoes on the road while shouting slogans against the government. The protest continued for over two hours leaving motorists stranded.Hundreds of vehicles queued up on both sides of the busy Yeswantpur Road that connects the State highway. People who went to the Dasanapura market say there is nothing there. It is 5 km away from the main road and there is not even a police station. Who will go there? Let them put these facilities in place before asking anyone to shift there, said one of the traders.The police rushed to the spot to manage traffic and asked APMC officials to redress the grievances of the protesters. The traders and farmers decided to cancel their plan to call for a bandh on Saturday after talks with the government."

The tobacco-to-FMCG-to-hotel-to-agri business major is likely to enter the market with fresh potato  a first-of-its-kind in India  followed by some more fresh vegetables. The company is also planning to launch fruit pulps and juices in order to become top food company in India.Devising the India First strategy for the future, CEO Sanjiv Puri (in pic) said: Currently, we rank No. 3 among the food companies in India with a total Rs 8,000-crore consumer spends and two Rs 3,000-crore plus brands  Aashirvaad and Sunfeast. ITC has always preferred to create indigenous brands for its new businesses that include foods, personal care products and stationary. The two Rs 3,000-crore plus food labels are also indigenous brands, which were created in the last decade.Puri pointed out that going forward, the focus will be on fruit, vegetables and sea foods because only 2%-3% of the perishables are now being processed in the country. We shall bring some food products in the fresh form or in shelf-life-enhancing form. Like, we are planning to introduce fresh potato soon, he added.The company is planning to launch low sugar potato and anti-oxidant potato soon. Besides potato, as indicated by Puri, ITC might come out with dehydrated onion later this year.The Kolkata-based company had created a brand called ITC Master Chef for prawn and blended spices earlier this year. The divisional chief executive of the agri business of ITC, S Sivakumar , said the dehydrated onion could come under the ITC Maser Chef brand. We are planning to launch more food products in fresh, semi-processed and in puree form. We are also launching mango pulp soon. This could be under B Natural brand, he added.The food brands of ITC include Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo, Yippee!, ITC Master chef B Natural, Aashirvaad Swasti Ghee, Mint O, Sunbean and Fabelle. Besides Sunfeast and Aashrvaad, the two other over Rs1000-crore brands are Bingo and Yippee!.Candyman has also crossed Rs 500crore mark in terms of consumer spends. Aashirvaad is alredy No. 1 in branded atta while Sunfest is among the leaders in biscuits.The ITC CEO argued that one of the main reasons to come out with semi-processed and fresh vegetables is to reduce colossal waste in fruits and vegetables in India. There is an annual loss of Rs 90,000 crore in perishables. This can be brought down by devising a proper strategy. Food is a very big opportunity for us. ITC has a very strong agro backend as well as trade marketing network, which is required for this, he added."

But the things you cant find in Venezuela any more, like milk and sugar, means the landmark has had to close.When Manuel Da Silva first opened its welcoming yellow doors in 1981, the Heladeria Coromoto offered its clients the tried and trusted: vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and coconut flavours.Until one day, Mr. Da Silva tried out an avocado sorbet on his customers. It was a success! said Jose Ramirez, his son-in-law.He had a crazy idea and he started to invent, to try things with meat, with fish, said Mr. Ramirez.He might have stopped at chipi-chipi, a small Caribbean mollusc, but Mr. Da Silva was clearly not a man to hold back on a hunch. New flavours followed when he experimented with garlic as well as onion flavoured ice cream. Soon his imagination knew no limits and the number of wacky flavours, and his reputation, grew.People were coming to try some strange things, said Luis Marquez, a young local in the mountain town of Merida who grew up with frequent visits to the Coromoto.Set a recordIn 1991, just a decade after opening and a world away from plain old vanilla, the Heladeria Coromoto got an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for providing the most flavours of any ice cream parlour in the world  at the time, 386.But Mr. Da Silva, a Portuguese immigrant, continued to innovate and play with peoples taste buds.Black bean ice cream soon followed, chilli, beetroot.. up to a staggering 860 flavours.The shop quickly became a key attraction in Merida, an Andean city of 4,50,000 which is also known for having the worlds highest cable-car ride, 4,765 metres above sea-level.Now it comes highly recommended in tourist guides such as Lonely Planet and TripAdvisor.But Venezuelas deepening economic crisis since the collapse of crude oil prices in 2014 meant it became an ordeal to source raw materials over the last few years.On the first Monday in September, Mr. Ramirez hung up his scoops and closed Heladeria Coromoto, defeated by the impossible task of getting the essential raw materials of ice cream in any meaningful quantity in Venezuela.For years we have been suffering from shortages and we buy on the black market. We can not get products from our traditional suppliers, said Mr. Ramirez, 56.Up to now, he has always managed to scrape by. But the situation got more complicated this year....Many Venezuelans battle hunger and malnutrition because of the economic and political crisis.We made efforts, we tried to keep going to the maximum, but the time has come when I cant resist anymore, Mr. Ramirez said."

Cooperative institutions had extended crop loans to the tune of just Rs. 90 crore in 2016.Of the current year target, the department has so far disbursed crop loan to the tune of Rs. 105 crore to the farmers, who have raised paddy in the kuruvai season in a few areas mainly in Lalgudi. Similarly, farmers, who have raised various crops such as sugarcane, tapioca, groundnut, turmeric, maize and onion in Musiri, Thuraiyur, Uppiliyapuram and Lalgudi, have also been extended crop loan.K.C. Ravichandran, Joint Registrar of Cooperatives, told The Hindu that the distribution of crop loan would gain momentum once the Stanley reservoir in Mettur was opened for delta irrigation. The increasing water level in the dam had raised the hope that it would be opened shortly.Crop loan target had been fixed for all 140 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) depending upon the coverage area. Out of Rs. 276 crore, about Rs. 170 crore would be disbursed for raising samba crop. Instructions have been given to the PACS functionaries for avoiding controversies and complaints while disbursing loan.Mr. Ravichandran said the societies would not charge interest from farmers for crop loan as the government would pay the interest to the PACS on behalf of farmers."
