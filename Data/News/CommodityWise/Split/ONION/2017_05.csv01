Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 2: The state government today resorted to market intervention by fixing the price limit for onion, which is now selling at Rs 25 a kg in retail market. Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro today asked the traders to sell onion within Rs 17 per kg and warned stern action in case of hoarding the commodity. Patro said the department had been instructed to keep close watch over the price situation. Officials will purchase onion from the source and sell it at fair price shops of the government named as ""Maitree"" at reasonable price. In the first phase, it will be sold in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The department has been asked to keep a token of Re 1 profit margin per kg and sell it to make the retail price affordable for the consumers. However, consumers have been left high and dry as onion price is now selling in the city at Rs 25 per kg. The price of onion was Rs 15 per kg early last week. The rise in onion price following the soaring of tomato price has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at Rs 100 per kg in retail market. The state needs nearly five lakh tonnes of onion annually of which it produces nearly three to 3.5 lakh tonnes. Odisha produces onions mainly in Kalahandi, Balangir, Boudh and Angul districts as well as a few areas in the state's western districts. Odisha depends mainly on Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for procurement of onions. Wholesalers said the recent floods in Nashik and crop loss in Andhra Pradesh had led to the price rise. ""The price of onion has increased at source points. The city is getting the normal supply of 10 to 15 trucks of onion on daily basis, but as the price has increased in the procurement areas, it has its impact in the state as well,"" said Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha secretary Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current price would prevail till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and then the price will stabilise,"" said Panda. Farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of lack of adequate number of cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to the over-production of the crop. ""However, the state government is yet to come up with adequate cold storages to ease the problem,"" said Abhiram Jena, a farmer. On the other hand, consumers are still bearing the brunt of price rise. ""The consumers have been badly hit by the skyrocketing prices of vegetables during rains. In this circumstances, price rise of onions will definitely put burden on us,"" said Nirakar Pradhan, a consumer."

Apart from haleem which comes to mind first, another dish in this category is Patthar Ka Gosht, where a heated stone is used to cook pieces of boneless marinated meat. A favourite from the days of Nizam Asaf Jahi VI, this dish is still much sought-after by food lovers on any visit to the city.It is said that late in the 19th century, the Nizam Asaf Jahi VI used to frequently go hunting in the forests. On one such trip, his bawarchis forgot to carry their skewers and shikanjas were required to prepare kebabs and innovated by cooking mutton on a flat granite stone heated by firewood from below. The Nizam developed a liking for the dish, and so this recipe was replicated repeatedly at the royal kitchens. More than a century later, the dish is still popular in many areas in the city.Especially during Numaish, the annual exhibition of Hyderabad, many visitors flock to their favourite Patthar Ka Gosht stalls at the exhibition grounds. However, cooking on a stone is not just a specialty of Hyderabad, it is prevalent in some Arab countries too. In India, Mumbai and Bangalore also have limited availability of street food prepared on heated stone slabs.There are few important aspects of making a perfect Patthar Ka Gosht  selection of a right granite stone is one of them. The stone should not crack under the heat, and it should not be too thick to consume extra heat, instead, it should act as a good conductor. In this recipe, slices of flattened lamb meat are marinated in garlic, ginger, chilli paste, salt and raw papaya for at least four hours and often overnight, so that the meat becomes quite tender. It is then roasted on a stone heated with charcoal below. The end result is often truly a melt in the mouth dish. The proportions of marinade, ghee, the roughness of the stone as well as the timing of flipping the meat over play a role in getting the optimum taste. One of the best places for Patthar Ka Gosht in Hyderabad is Bade Miyan Kababs, a small kiosk midway on upper tank bund near the Ramadasu statue.The shop is owned by Syed Shaji whose great-grandfather Haji Syed Ismail started this business. The outlet uses proprietary spices, and the ghee is used as a medium of cooking on the charcoal heated stone. As per Shaji, the stone used is called pahadi stone and it has to be selected very carefully. The soft Patthar Ka Gosht is served here with a little bit of onion salad and some delectable mint chutney. Rumali roti often becomes a perfect companion too.Bade Miyan has another stall at Forum Mall and sets up a temporary kiosk known as Ismail Restaurant every year at Numaish.

Sources said vegetables are being brought to Karimganj from Tripura, Shillong and Barpeta district, among others. However, since floods have affected those places too, the problem has been aggravated."

The increase in onion price at the wholesale market in Nashik, Maharashtra, has apparently led to the hike in price here.The wholesale price of onion has jumped to `3,500 per quintal. It is being sold at a rate of `40 per kg in the city as 10 per cent of the total 50 kg onions in a gunny bag often get damaged, a retailer, Harihar Barik, said. Three weeks back, onion was available for `20 per kg. Later, the price kept increasing by `4 to `5 every 4 to 5 days till it doubled, sources said.The price wouldnt turn moderate for one month, till the new onions hit the market. Even as the price has shot up, Rourkela city administration is yet to take any step towards moderating the hike.The Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department sent instructions on Thursday evening to monitor the situation. The officials will start verification of stocks with local wholesalers from Friday onwards, Rourkela-based Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) and Market Intelligence Officer R C Tudu said. The ACSO, however, attributed the rise in onion price to hike in wholesale price at the source point in Nashik. There is no shortage of onion supply, Tudu added.Meanwhile, locals have cut down on their onion consumption. I have stopped using onions for all the dishes cooked in my home due to the price hike, said Sangeeta Singh, a housewife.Earlier, the onion price had touched `28 per kg towards the end of July.

5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

A week ago, the tuber was being sold at `20 to `22 a kg.The essential commodity is going beyond the reach of consumers after witnessing a downward trend for nearly a month due to crackdown on hoarders. Its price has increased at least 60 per cent in the last few days. Traders, however, attributed the price rise to ongoing strike by truckers and rain in producing States like Karnataka and Maharashtra.General secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the wholesale price of onion has risen from `1800 to `2800 per quintal. As there is a huge gap between the demand and supply, the retial price is bound to increase, he said.Panda informed that Odisha is not getting the commodity from Nashik, Bengaluru and Tadepalligudem (Andhra Pradesh) as per demand. While untimely rain damaged the crop in Karnataka, Nashik region was hit by flood.Strike by truck operators demanding inclusion of GST on diesel also compounded the problem. The crisis will continue till the arrival of new crop in November first week, Panda added.Meanwhile, the State Government has warned the traders not to go for hoarding. Food and Consumer Welfare Minister Surya Narayan Patro said the officials have been asked to keep a close watch on hoarders and black-marketers."

Mango cultivation is being promoted in Andhra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while onion is the focus for Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh."
