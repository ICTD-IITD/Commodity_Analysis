Prices that shot up after recent rains continue to remain high, deterring customers, the sellers say.K.V.S. GiriK.V.S. GIRIVegetable prices in the city continue to remain perched at increased rates despite monsoon withdrawal from the State nearing completion.Prices in the city increased during the first few days of October even as supply was affected. Vendors attributed the poor quality and high price of some commonly consumed vegetables to rains. A check of prices in government retail as well as wholesale markets suggested prices continue to pinch the common man.High quantityThough the quality and quantity has improved, the prices continue to be high. Customers have cut down on their purchase, said Venu Naik, a vegetable seller in Sainikpuri. The effect of rains in grower regions continue to affect prices.For instance, at the Bowenpally vegetable market, the arrival of hybrid variant of tomato had nearly doubled since the start of the month, accompanied with a three-time price increase. The variant was selling for a maximum price of Rs. 48 per kilo in the wholesale market. In retail markets however, the price was about Rs. 75 per kilo.The local variant of tomato is selling over Rs. 65 per kilo while the wholesale price stands at about Rs. 32 per kilo.Different pricesWhile potato and onion prices did not register a high, the cost of carrot continue to remain higher than its price last month. A kilo at Bowenpally market was listed at Rs. 55 on Tuesday. Carrot price in Rythu Bazars was around Rs. 70 with the private retail market demanding about Rs. 5 higher.The price of French bean at around Rs. 100 in the local private market, also remains higher than that of last month."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

I started around a month back. I used to grind the herbal bath powder and health mix for my daughter and I thought why not do it and give others as well. I just posted it on Facebook  I am a part of this group called smart mommies. And when I put my product out there, a couple of people bought it and I got really good feedback. So that pushed me to go further and that is how it all started, smiles Vaishnavi.Both her products  the health mix (Nithya Poshak) and the body bath (Nithya Soundaryam) are completely organic. The materials are also procured from organic farms and shops.Since the health drink is also made for children, she adds a lot of dry fruits so that it tastes good. Kids can get fussy about food at times. So this will be tasty and healthy for them. Apart from kids, this drink is healthy for pregnant women and also old people. You can make a thick porridge out of this and have it for breakfast. It makes you full and at the same time its healthy too, she adds.Today, there are so many organic shops in and around the city and also most people prefer to eat organic and lead a healthy lifestyle. So how organic are her products? My product is authentic, because the main ingredient that I use is the ragi. And this is procured from my village, which is close to Vellore. And the rest I source from a friends farm in Pattur, a village close to Chennai  they grow the green grams and other millets, etc.The produce grown in these farms are completely pesticide-free as they use only a mix made with chilli, garlic and onion to keep pests away.Rs 100Nithya Poshak: 200 gmRs 80Nithya Soundaryam: 100 gmFor details call 8123275375"

5a1544ea9855b76bf13ecbf5,The need for upending feudal markets,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/U3MvWaOIyWNFlp0RKv2UvN/The-need-for-upending-feudal-markets.html,2017-11-05,"There is inbuilt resistance in feudal markets to innovative methods that upset the apple cart. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintTwo common threads run through all current discussions on the Indian economy. First, growth has been rapid since economic liberalization was initiated. Second, the benefits of this growth are skewed with reference to peninsular and western India in contrast to eastern and northern India.Having seen how Andhra Pradesh in the mid-1970s and early 1980s was transformed from a backward economy to a relatively modern economy, I am persuaded to believe that there are two categories of markets: feudal markets and modern markets. Or more appropriately, markets in feudal structures and markets in modern societies. The responses of these two markets to external stimulibe it funds and investment or softer skills such as education and healthare different. Feudal markets function on relationships, hierarchy and patronage. Patron-client equations in hierarchical structures set the tone for the functioning of the economy, ruling out the possibility of structural transformation. The approach is anti-change rather than of breaking conventions in sync with economic democracy.These factors inhibit investment. There is inbuilt resistance to innovative methods that upset the apple cart, restricting the claims of equal rights of participation and of resultant gains. Modern markets, on the other hand, function on rules and transparency, and are open to innovative ideas. These factors attract investment with competition ensuring equal rights to all claimants. The implications of feudal markets and their regressive impact have not been addressed enough, perhaps on the assumption that markets are homogeneous, inanimate institutions.Market classification into feudal and modern is based on the conduct of business in these two markets. Cartels are good examples to highlight these differences. They occur in all markets. Firms collaborate to form cartels and fix prices. As a result, consumers are denied the benefit of competition. Game theoretic framework, however, shows that firms follow business strategies that result in identical price structures even in oligopolistic market structures without the need to collaborate or form cartels. In their effort to detect and break cartels, competition authorities instead look for agreements that indicate collaboration. Alternatively, they encourage whistle-blowing with appropriate incentives.In the case of feudal markets, game theoretic modelling is of no relevance. Collaboration is a non-issue. Entry is restricted with complete lack of transparency in all transactions as the Competition Commission discovered in its investigation into the onion trade cartel. Of prime significance in the onion market was the presence of strong kinship bonds among traders cemented over generations. The corollary condition of feudal markets was discernible in the patron-client relationship between peasant farmer and traders with predetermined prices and marketable stocks. The auction markets and bidding mechanisms of modern markets for competition remained a farce in the onion market. What is interesting and significant is that the commission could not break the cartel for want of evidence.Of course, it could be argued that the onion market is a one-off case typical of vegetable mandis. The intent is not to delve into a discussion on cartel busting but to highlight features of feudal markets that deter private foreign investment in modern industry. Hierarchical structures based on personal relationships as seen in the onion market or the denial of equal rights and claims of all participants are hardly conducive for attracting investment. Current data on foreign investment shows that six states and Union territoriesMaharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telanganagarnered a large portion in 2017.What could be a catalyst? The new narrative currently doing the rounds is of foreign investment flowing into activities pertaining to agriculture in economically backward states. Foreign investment is agnostic but would it usher change in a short time frame? I would root instead for investment in business that disrupts existing structures on a large scale.The Andhra Pradesh experience underlines foreign investment as a catalyst of change. Catching the tail wind of outsourcing, these investments in technology companies led to a chain of events, which, in my view, made the difference. The emergence of a host of services catering to upwardly mobile young people employed in these companies created jobs for low-skilled workers, many from rural areas, and exposed them to modern markets.Digitalization and the spread of smartphones throws up several outreach possibilities. This has demonstrated the innovative and inclusive approach of digital finance. New finance companies are selling customized financial products online to clientele outside structured financial institutions and at minimum risk. In the era of big data, digital sale of data offers unexplored opportunities to farmers. Real-time data on cropping patterns; resistance of new seeds to pests; responses to new varieties of seedits all information sought by international firms engaged in genetically modified seed technology and automation of farm equipment. This data business empowers small farmers. Negotiation with large business houses is now possible, unheard of within the feudal constricts of patron-client relations. The only hitch is resistance to rule-based modern markets ingrained in feudal societies.Geeta Gouri is a former member of the Competition Commission of India."

Those arrested were identified as Kamal Kalra, a DJ, and Mahesh Goyal, who attends rave parties and supplies drugs to Kalra.The value of the seized drug is around Rs 3 lakh, police said on Monday.Digging Deep Web for drugsRajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said Goyal disclosed that the illegal online drug trade is done through deep web, which is the opposite term for surface web. Unlike surface web that is accessible to anyone using the Internet, the content of deep web is invisible and hidden behind HTML (hypertext markup language) forms.This illegal business works on peer group model and it spreads from one user to another by word of mouth. Goyal had first consumed ecstasy at a rave party in Chennai and learnt that it can be procured through online shopping using websites like dream market by operating in deep web accessed through browsers like tor browser and onion browser, Deo said.Bitcon for paymentsAlok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (crime) says the payment for such consignments is done through Bitcoin and the delivery is made by post and courier from countries such as the Netherlands and the US.Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously.The Delhi Police have approached the narcotic control bureau (NCB) and ministry of electronics and information technology to ensure that such online trade and transactions are stopped. They are also probing how the supply of contraband through couriers in India from other countries is going undetected and unchecked.According to Deo, Kalra was arrested on October 29 from Sector-13, Rohini with 100 pills of ecstasy, popularly known as yokes, MDMA and pills. Kalras interrogation revealed that he had procured the contraband from a man who contacted him and introduced himself with various names such as Sanjay and Utkarsh.Police collected details of the user of the mobile number and later arrested Goyal from Dwarka. Twenty grams of MDMA in raw form was seized from him, said the DCP."

According to market sources, the prices are expected to be within this range for some time as there has been an almost 60 per cent-dip in onion production in the neighbouring Karnataka.In view of the rise in onion prices in retail markets across the country, the central government had urged the state to investigate the cause of the rise. The district deputy registrar was directed to conduct an inquiry in the matter. Accordingly, the district collector of Nashik held a meeting with the traders and representatives of the various market committees and suggested that they forgo the traditional week-long Diwali break, which is supposed to start from Monday. The move aimed at stopping the escalation of onion prices.However, farmer organisations rejected the suggestion, saying that this was intentionally done to reduce the prices. Dipak Pagar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana and director of the Nampur wholesale market, meanwhile warned of an agitation by farmers against the anti-farmer policies of the central government.On Monday, the average modal price of trade was Rs 2,300 in Lasalagon market, with 1,500 quintals of onions arriving for trade. In the neighbouring Pimpalgaon market, the average price of trade was Rs 2,425, with 7,500 quintals arriving for auction. Sources attributed the low arrival to the festive season, when farmers normally refrain from coming to the market.The present price trend, Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaons wholesale market, said the price trend will continue till the new crop arrives. Farmers have the bare minimum stock. However, the price rise is mainly because of the almost 60 per cent-dip reported in the kharif area from Karnataka, he said. Maharashtras kharif onion, Holkar said, will start arriving post Diwali and, till then, the price rise is expected to continue.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. (Representational Image)AS THE price of onions witnessed a steep hike in retail markets across the city this week, traders attributed it to a shortage of supply of the vegetable to the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). In one week, the prices have risen from Rs 20 per kilogram to Rs 38 and 40. As per the traders, the price of the commodity is expected to remain high for at least a month, as the supply to the market has dried up. This, the traders said, was because the ongoing showers were creating issues in harvest of the kharif crops.Vilas Bhujbal, a trader at Market Yard, said, The markets should have received kharif crops by now but because of the ongoing showers theres difficulty in harvesting the crops. The stocks from Rabi crops have already dried up. Hence, the supply to the market is going down with every passing day. He added that the price of onions in wholesale market at Pune APMC range from Rs 2,000 to 2,200 per quintal this week. If this continues, the retail rates may even touch Rs 50 by the end of this month, he said.Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. Damage of the onion crop is not restricted to Maharashtra, a similar situation is prevailing in neighbouring Karnataka, they added. Changdeo Holkar, former director of the National Agriculture Marketing co-operative Federation, said, In some of the districts, as much as 60 per cent crop has been damaged due to untimely rainfall.

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."

In the uzhavar santhais in the district, the price remained at Rs. 90 on Sunday. The small onion was priced between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 last month.The hike is said to be due to sudden fall in the arrival of stock from the villages following the receipt of widespread rainfall in the recent past. Due to the hike in the price, there are not much takers for small onion.The uzhavar santhai in Edappadi used to have at least ten stalls marketing small onion. Due to the fall in the arrival, only one stall had small onion stock on Saturday.Instead, the consumers opt for the big onion whose price stood at Rs. 50 per kg in the open markets and Rs. 40  Rs. 45 in the uzhavar santhais.Due to the monsoon season, the price of greens has also gone up in the markets, so also brinjal which is being sold at Rs. 60 per kg in the uzhavar santhais.According to a cross section of vegetable traders, the inclement weather has affected the production of small onion and other vegetables in the villages. The villages are registering only one fourth of usual small onion production in the recent past.Due to the rainfall, the farmers are not able to harvest the small onions, leading to sharp fall in the arrival.The marriage days have further led to the increase in the price. The price of the vegetables, including small onion, is expected to register a downward trend, once the arrivals from the villages stabilised, they add."

Finally, he abandoned paddy cultivation, but for a good reason. With failures teaching him lessons, Kalaiselvan, instead of relying on paddy crop to make ends meet, cultivated more than eight varieties of crops by adhering to mixed cropping system. To his surprise, it has fetched him an eight-fold surge in net income which includes meeting the food requirements of his family.A graduate in BSc (Physics) and an organic by profession for more than half-a-decade, Kalaiselvan has been cultivating paddy on seven acres supported by an open well for irrigation. But the young farmer failed to get lucrative returns. Realising that the mono-cropping system of paddy cultivation has become increasingly risky due to failing monsoons, he decided to change the cultivation pattern in early 2017 by experimenting with mixed cropping system.""I took less than an acre of my land to experiment mixed cropping cultivation. Groundnut was taken as the major crop inter-cropped with pulses like red gram, cowpea, and mung dal in the field. Small onion (shallot) was also cultivated on the irrigation bunds. To avoid cattle from feeding on the cultivated pulses, sesame crop was grown around the standing crops to act as fence since cattle would not consume the crop owing to its sticky nature,"" Kalaiselvan told TOI.A couple of months after the attempt, he found that the weed growth was suppressed in the mixed cropping system due to multiple cultivation occupying more space, thus resulting in the reduction of farm labour required for weeding. As Kalaiselvan found available space to cultivate other crops, he introduced cotton too. ""In mono cropping system, only paddy can be harvested for the family and other food items had to be sourced from outside. On the other hand, the mixed cropping system contributed food products such as pulses, small onions and oil extracted from groundnut and sesame for the family needs,"" Kalaiselvan adds.Besides the financial gain, the problem with pest was also said to be contained in mixed cropping system. ""In mixed cropping, if one crop fails, the loss can be compensated with other crops. But such assurance and risk reduction component are missing in the mono-cropping system,"" K Suresh Kanna, deputy director of Kudumbam , an organisation promoting organic farming, said. With this success, Kalaiselvan said that he has been planning to extend some more areas to mixed cropping method and also attract more farmers to it."
5a1588e29855b76bf13eea63,The quiet charms of Khichdi,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Citycitybangbang/the-quiet-charms-of-khichdi/,2017-11-06,"It now appears that there is no proposal to anoint Khichdi as the national dish of India, but regardless of whether khichdi deserves that title or not and glossing over the question of whether in a country like ours, any one dish can or should be classified as such, it certainly gives us an occasion to talk about something that has been a significant part of most of our lives.The sniffy comments about this simple dish made by assorted food snobs tell one part of the story. The experts on health and culinary tradition have other stories to tell. As someone who has grown up relishing khichdi, what follows is a very personal tribute to this humble dish.The simplest possible combination of the two major food groups, khichdi is food at its comforting best. A hot meal of khichdi shushes the senses, evens out temperamental stomachs, and satiates without leaving any residue behind; khichdi burps taste of nothing.My memories of khichdi are many. In our Gujarati household that lived outside the state most of the time, khichdi was most commonly our Sunday lunch. It was a meal that was looked forward to with quiet pleasure; it had a wholesome quality that made for hearty satisfaction.The consistency that was most preferred was wet without becoming runny, with grains just a little bit squished up. Ghee was poured in generous quantities; as children it was fun to make a mound of the khichdi dig a little hole in the centre and fill it up with ghee. Into this mixture went some spiced potatoes, a special jeera-clad onion salad, chaas, papad and some mango pickle. Together, this unfussy confluence of simple tastes came together week after week in a very precise way.The masterful simplicity of each ingredient in the meal bears reflection. Rice, dal with almost no spices, cooked without ceremony. Unlike the idea of khichdi as mish-mash (kya khichdi paka rahe ho?), an ungainly dumping together of disparate ingredients, the reality about it was the wordless harmony that existed between the two major food sects.Khichdi blended rice and dal together as if they belonged. Ghee, which makes the world feel plumper, adding a rich emulsion of pleasure to anything it is poured on, accentuated the bland fullness of the taste. Potatoes, that staple filler of blank spaces with several kinds of awesomeness, cooked with mustard seeds and left dry. Papad, the provider of crunchy service on demand, the attendant always ready to confer its crackle on a meal. Pickle, the little bite sized compression of a universe of very expressive flavours, seething naughtily in its own juices. Onion, the simple slice of a food that served as spice, an ingredient that turned any dish slightly sideways, a dash of knowing worldly wisdom added to things bland.In our house, with khichdi, and only with it, the onion was slathered in oil with jeera and salt sprinkled on it, and set off the potatoes particularly well. And to top it off, Chaas, gentle and kind, making ones stomach, and by extension the world, a calmer place.In some parts of the country, khichdi is looked down upon as the diet for those convalescing. This makes it the poor cousin of food, the stuff we make do with when our bodies are not quite ready for the real thing. I have never quite understood this view of khichdi, for it passes up on the pleasures of simplicity and confuses it with ordinariness.The idea that food must always perform, that it must necessarily transport us somewhere else, is a rigid view of its role in our lives. There is a time and place for that, indeed there must be for food is travel, and food is music, but food is also home.And the thing is, getting simple meals right is not easy. A cup of tea, scrambled eggs, nimbu-paani, coconut chutney- these everyday foods are very elusive when it comes to getting proportions just right. Khichdi is no exception, and getting the balance of the ingredients right was both very easy and extremely rare.With some people, notably mothers, getting khichdi right was effortless while in other cases, something always seemed a little off. With simple foods, it all comes down to proportion, timing, touch, restraint, love- there is no particular technique or skill involved, nothing dramatic by way of ingredients or presentation. The person cooking works with very little, and do so with instinct, as a habit. Perhaps, simple staple foods are nothing but an organic overflow of the person cooking.Khichdi derives its power from what it is not. It chooses to sidestep the flashy culinary razzle dazzle, choosing instead to let the taste come to the food, rather than the other way around. There might well be other ways of defending this noble food, perhaps from the perspective of health, perhaps even from the standpoint of culinary heritage, but personally, the truth that khichdi spoke had nothing to do with these. It held things together, it sat in the middle of everything, right at the centre with no interest in anything that lies at the edges. Khichdi is home, comfort without any reason, taste without any credentials.The stomach full with a hot meal sleeps easy. We regain an alignment with the world, things slip back into place, afternoon heat settles on us, and our eyes find it no longer useful to stay open. Slipping into khichdi-induced sleep on a hot summer Sunday, under a reluctant fan, the distant buzz of some insect, life takes on a timeless drone of inevitability. The complex, the layered and the textured can be great, but only the simple can be perfect."

Ecstatic people, young and old, gathered at Nehru Park for the 7th Delhi International Jazz Festival , organised by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. After the ceremonial lighting of the lamp, the fest was started by a French band, Lorenzo Naccarato Trio . For 25 minutes, the crowd was treated to the melodious rhythm of the piano, bass and drums. Tapping and grooving, the crowd was seen swaying to the crescendos and the diminuendos. Joining them on stage next was 4 On A Swing, a band from Kolkata. The evening was brought to a close by a jazz group from Spain, Alfonso Aroca Flamenco.Lorenzo Naccarato Trio, a band from FranceLorenzo Naccarato Trio, who performed in Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Pune as part of their five-city maiden international tour in India, found India to be a place that is constantly moving. Apart from the language changes with each city, they also took interest in the onion dosa, idli, parantha, palak and chana-parantha and the famous 'cha'. Lorenzo, sharing one incident from his tour, said, ""I met this tuk-tuk driver and wanted to have real cha, on the streets. So I asked him, let's have cha together. Since he didn't know English, he brought another man, Ravu, who was our translator. He took to me to a fantastic cha and kokora (pakora) shop. We spent good five hours together."" Having been influenced by classical Italian music as well as French, Lorenzo thinks that jazz needn't be understood, but enjoyed by everyone.""(BCCL/ Samik Sen)Talking about how long will jazz survive in a Bollywood obsessed country like India, Pradyuman, a member of 4 On A Swing, said, ""I think that jazz is just about surviving. And it is not alone, there are Blues, Latin, classical - they have been in India since pre-Independence. But there are only a few people following it now. Park Street in Kolkata used to be full of jazz bands. It is great music, but it is now surviving only because of a few people.""Members of Alfonso Aroca Flamenco, a jazz group from Spain, at the eventAmong the people who attended the festival was Kiara, a nine-year-old, who had come with her parents.

5a15a5439855b76bf13ef17d,Shallots to remain dearer for 3 months,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shallots-to-remain-dearer-for-3-months/articleshow/60931667.cms,2017-10-04,"Madurai: The price of shallots or small onions which has touched Rs 100 a kilogram is likely to remain high for the next three months in view of the festival and pilgrimage season. However, the saving grace for consumers has come in the form of tiny Bellary onions costing just Rs 12 a kg which have been flooding the markets.Dindigul district is known for its onion cultivation, predominantly shallots which are cultivated on about 3,000 to 4,000 hectares. However, drought conditions had brought down the cultivation by more than fifty per cent. Deputy director of horticulture, Dindigul, Suresh Sriram said that it would take at least another three months for the price of shallots to come down as only some farmers had taken up cultivation and it would take another two months for them to harvest their crops.Unlike millets, all vegetable crops, including onions are water-intensive and though there was rainfall this season it was insufficient to recharge the ground water for a full-fledged cultivation to take place, he said. Onion was a short-term crop of which harvesting can be done 65 days after cultivation. As some of the farmers have just sown the seeds it will take another two months to harvest, he added.A P Mahendran, a farmer and wholesale onion seller, said that the price of onion seeds had also increased many fold making it difficult for farmers. ``Onion seeds per hectare cost Rs 50,000 and there is an additional cost of Rs 50,000 for cultivation. So, Rs 1 lakh is needed to cultivate onions on an acre,'' he said. When water availability was also less, farmers were not ready to take the risk, he added.On the other hand, onion bulbs are selling at Rs 1,500 a kilogram. Since they start sprouting in 40 days and can be harvested in three months, many farmers had gone for it, he said. The price of mature big onions has been hovering over Rs 25 to Rs 30 at present."
