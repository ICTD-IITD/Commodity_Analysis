The late rains will benefit planting of rabi crops such as wheat and chana, Pattanayak said on Thursday.""We are expecting a very good rabi season, so that should make up for all the minuses which has been ascribed for kharif,"" he said. The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%. Some parts like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam and east Uttar Pradesh have also been impacted due to floods, where once the water receded farmers went for replanting,"" he said."

5a16fe379855b76bf13efa85,'Quackery' ire at bureaucrat,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170726/jsp/nation/story_163907.jsp,2017-07-26,"Bangalore, July 25: A senior bureaucrat who heads the Karnataka health department has invited ridicule from rationalists with a social media post that claims dengue can be cured with jaggery and onions. Shalini Rajneesh's post has come at a time the government has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent the disease and prompted one rationalist to describe her advice as ""quackery"". The principal secretary had forwarded the post yesterday citing the jaggery and small onions used in south Indian cuisine as an effective cure for dengue fever. The post, in Kannada, roughly translates to: ""There's nothing to lose with this easy-to-follow cure with no side effects. Take small onions with jaggery to cure dengue."" Rationalists slammed the post that came in the middle of the government's struggle to control the vector-borne disease, with hundreds of cases reported daily. ""This is nothing but quackery, that too propagated by the civil servant responsible for the state's healthcare system,"" scientist and rationalist Narendra Nayak told The Telegraph today after emailing a complaint to health minister Ramesh Kumar urging him to stop officials from spreading such misinformation. ""I just don't understand why educated people in responsible positions spread such unscientific claims. Onions and jaggery don't cure anything. A senior official like her should have been careful about forwarding such material that might encourage gullible people to consult quacks and endanger their lives,"" Nayak added. Nayak listed some previous instances too. ""She (Rajneesh) seems to be in the habit of posting such wrong information as she had earlier put up claims of urine therapy. I have listed all these posts in the complaint,"" he said, likening the opinion to Sangh Parivar's claims about cow-urine therapy. According to the Bangalore municipal corporation, 1,300 dengue cases have been reported so far this year. Rajneesh could not be reached for comment on her post, with aides saying she was ""busy in meetings"". Srinivas Kakkilaya, a doctor involved in the rationalist movement, said the bureaucrat should have initiated action to control breeding of mosquitoes. ""Firstly, dengue is a self-limiting illness, which goes away in three to four days without any treatment in 99.99 per cent cases. In rare cases of complications, the patient might need hospitalisation. So her (Rajneesh's) claim itself is wrong as jaggery and onion cannot cure dengue."" ""By vouching for something totally unscientific and unproven, she has gone against the recommendations of the (Union) health ministry that do not mention anything about jaggery or onion,"" Kakkilaya added. He was alluding to guidelines issued by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme."
5a173b6f9855b76bf13f0226,The learning from a ‘Robin Hood’ Demo that backfired,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/nov/06/the-learning-from-a-robin-hood-demo-that-backfired-1693167.html,2017-11-06,"Almost a year after Prime Minister Modi in one fell swoop declared Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes illegal tender, sucking out 86 per cent or Rs 15.4 lakh crore from the system, India is still limping back to normalcy.At the Lasalgaon market in Nashik district in Maharashtra, Asias largest onion trading hub accounting for 15 per cent of national sales, IndiaSpend.orgs Swagata Yadavar reports an atmosphere of gloom. Onion prices have crashed.The government insisting on cash being replaced by cheque and digital payments is working against farmers and in favour of traders, the IndiaSpend survey shows. With slow digital infrastructure, cheques take 3-4 weeks to cash, delaying the buying of seed and fresh sowing operations. Often, the cheques bounce.On the night of November 8 last year, the government declared a war on the cash economy and black money. What happened, in fact, was a reasonably robust economy slowed down, and many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) got wiped out. The poor and the marginalised lost their jobs and had to spend days in queues at banks to draw a few rupees of their own hard-earned money.Little black money recoveredOn the first anniversary of notebandi, the PM is still in an aggressive mood threatening to crackdown on benami assets. There is still support for his bold move to root out the parallel economy that was funding terrorism and corruption. Some even said stone-pelting in the Kashmir Valley disappeared after the Rs 500-per-day per stone-pelter could not be sustained after the evaporation of illegal money stashes!But beyond the rhetoric, was the government able to unearth large stashes of black or unaccounted money?A Reserve Bank (RBI) report in end-August this year showed that of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore of demonetised notes circulating in November 2016, 99.96 percent or Rs 15.28 lakh crore was returned, leaving just Rs 16,000 crore unaccounted for. The government was expecting around Rs 3 lakh crore of dirty money not coming back to the system; but black money operators, traders and criminals employed armies of mules to deposit their stashes under benami names, money that became legal when withdrawn from the banks.The learning: unaccounted income is not stored in cash and under mattresses. An analysis of IT records shows that only six per cent of unaccounted wealth is kept in cash, while the bulk is parked in real estate, or abroad in a variety of instruments.Digital blunderDemonetisation was also an attempt to move towards a cashless, digital economy, but that is not easy for an economy that runs on cash. There was an initial spike in digital transactions. From November to December 2016, mobile banking and other digital payments went up from 9.6 lakh to 10.4 lakh transactions; but once more cash became available, by February 2017, digital transactions fell 16.7 percent to 8.08 lakh. A cashless economy needs a high level of digital infrastructure and financial education; and India will take some time before getting there.Pain on the groundOn the other hand, demonetisation triggered a slowdown and job losses that has meant unending pain for the common man and an embarrassment for the government. India showed a robust 7- 7.9 per cent robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the three quarters till the end of calendar year 2016, making it the fastest growing economy even ahead of China. Post-demonetisation, GDP growth fell to 6.1 per cent for the January-March 2017 quarter, and then further down to 5.7 per cent for the April-June quarter, making our growth rate slip behind China.Translated into real terms, it is estimated that businesses suffered losses of Rs 1.28 lakh crore for the first 50 days of demonetisation, and approximately 15 lakh people lost their jobs in the first four months after November 8.With hindsight, it is clear the government did not have its ear to the ground. The Prime Minister ignored the advice of Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor who retired in September last year. Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian remained silent and was believed to have also been against the big bang reform. Perhaps, some convinced the PM that a Robin Hood attack on black money was easy to muddle through; and it would give him rich political benefits.Events have proved demonetisation was an economic disaster; but the jury is still out on whether the people perceive it so, and will punish the ruling party in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections.[The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com]"
5a5222499855b770e0374c7f,Himachal Pradesh polls: BJP on knife’s edge in Kangra valley,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/nov/07/himachal-pradesh-polls-bjp-on-knifes-edge-in-kangra-valley-1694127.html,2017-11-07,"NAGROTA: The BJP is carpet-bombing the Kangra valley with rallies by top leaders, in an indication that it could again play a key role in deciding the winner of the November 9 Himachal Pradesh elections. In 2012, the lotus had wilted in the valley when the Virbhadra Singh-led Congress swept 10 of its 15 seats, denying Prem Kumar Dhumal the chance for a saffron rerun.The Prime Minister kicked off his campaign with a rally in Kangra valley. BJP leaders are swarming the place in an unprecedented manner, said Sudesh Chouhan, a government employee.BJP chief Amit Shah is learnt to have taken upon himself the task of ensuring that his party does not run into the ghost of 2012, when it could win just three seats in the district.In 2012, Dhumal and the Lok Sabha MP from here, Shanta Kumar, had sparred to defend their respective political turfs, which proved detrimental to the partys interests. Shah is giving due recognition to Kumar in this election, while Dhumal is promising to bring development work to this district on the lines of Hamirpur, said a local BJP functionary.However, Kangra, the most populous district of the hilly state, is humming with complaints against the Modi government at the Centre. Only a couple of days back, the price of an LPG cylinder was hiked by Rs 96. Besides, onion prices are burning holes in the kitchen budget, said Sumitra Rana, a beautician in Nagrota town. The people were unable to spell out specific grievances against the goods and services tax but claimed there was a loud negative buzz about it.In 2007, Kangra had thrown up an opposite verdict, with the BJP winning 10 of 15 seats. Panch-panch saal (five years each), said Rajesh Thakur of Dehra constituency, suggesting that people in the district liked a change in the party in power every five years. He added that Congress candidates were well known to the people.Although the Thakurs are the predominant caste accounting for roughly 30 per cent of the electorate, too many candidates from the community are threatening to split caste votes. Brahmins have been traditional BJP supporters. With two Thakurs (Virbhadra and Dhumal) slugging it out for the chief ministers chair, the caste vote will split. In many seats in Kangra, both parties have fielded Thakur candidates. This gives an advantage to the BJP, which hopes to gain sizeable Brahmin votes, said a BJP functionary.Himachal Pradesh has 68 Assembly constituencies with an electorate of 49,91,921. Kangra, which is dotted with temples, has an electorate of 11,83,468 and draws hordes of religious tourists. Foreign tourists throng Dharamshala and Mcleodgunj, mostly to seek an audience with the Dalai Lama."

Photo: MintNew Delhi: With major crop prices plunging below minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers are likely to lose an estimated Rs35,968 crore in earnings for the kharif season, a coalition of farmers organizations said on Thursday.In the two weeks to 7 November, farmers have incurred a loss of Rs6,283 crore, having sold crops at lower than their support price, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 180 farmer unions, said.The AIKSCC numbers on loss to farm incomes were arrived at after a comparison of average wholesale prices in mandis (regulated farmer markets) and MSPs announced by the centre. The analysis was done for seven major kharif (summer) cropspaddy, maize, bajra, soybean, groundnut, cotton and uradby taking into account market arrivals and a weighted average of modal prices in major growing states.After four droughts, farmers have been hit by three successive seasons of low crop prices, the coalition said in a statement. The estimates, it added, are conservative as the actual prices at which farmers are selling their produce are often lower than official wholesale prices.The coalition also said, citing data published by the agriculture ministry, that for several crops the government-fixed MSPs are lower than the cost of production as calculated by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. These include crops like jowar where the support price is 19% lower than the cost of production and pulses like moong for which the MSP is 2% lower than the production cost.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised before the 2014 general election that MSPs will be fixed at 50% above the cost of production. However, of the 14 kharif crops, the MSPs of seven have been fixed lower than the (C2 or comprehensive) cost of production, the coalition said. Assuming an MSP at 50% over costs, farmers will lose an estimated Rs2 trillion going by current mandi prices, the coalition said.The government has set a target to double farmer incomes (by 2022), but even after successive years of normal rains their losses are mounting, said Yogendra Yadav, a farmers leader and a member of the coalition. Our estimate does not take into account losses suffered by growers of horticulture crops like potatoes and onion for which there are no MSPs but farmers are selling at a loss, Yadav added.Analysts agreed with the farmers analysis.The actual losses to farmers may be a little lower on account of government procurement of crops like paddy, but overall the analysis is fair, said Himanshu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and a Mint columnist. There is little doubt that crop prices are plunging and that is due to a serious demand deflation in the economy.The coalition also unveiled a social media campaign. AIKSCC which has been at the forefront of farmer agitations across several states, also announced a farmers protest in Delhi on 20 November with demands for remunerative prices and loan waivers."

That their protests are localized and often about apparently different issues provide adequate scope to pretend that they are making a fuss about nothing much and the problems, if there are any, only need a quick-fix solution. In Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh last week, around 10,000 farmers - the number, if reported correctly, is nothing to sniff at - gathered to demand that the district be declared drought-hit. It did not help their cause that they were led by the former Congress member of the legislative assembly of the area and the Opposition leader. There was trouble enough with the police in front of the district magistrate's office where the farmers were agitating, reportedly throwing stones while the police used lathis and tear gas. But when the farmers were dispersing, the police arrested some of them, and allegedly beat them up. More, pictures and video clips show that the farmers were forced to strip down to their underwear. Unnerved by these images, the Madhya Pradesh government has ordered an investigation. What will an investigation do? In June, six farmers were killed by police bullets in Mandsaur in the west of the state during an agitation demanding, among other things, a farm loan waiver as in Uttar Pradesh and better minimum support prices. Overproduction of certain items had driven prices down, without any let-up in the high input prices. Advice from government agencies had led many farmers to grow, say, onions, on a much larger scale, after which the excess of onion crop found no takers. Forty-six first information reports were filed after the incident, all of them against the protesters. No accountability was demanded of the policemen who shot them down. Why should the aftermath of Tikamgarh be different? The police's alleged actions were intended not just to intimidate the men but also to humiliate them: the farmers were being shown their place. The police represent the state government, hence the government's attitude to farmers can be inferred. The problems are not really localized or discrete. Farmers killing themselves year after year exposes how agricultural policies keep failing them. Now, it seems, models of development too are ignoring their needs. As Tikamgarh shows, the State has no wish to deal with the deep problems that underlie their grievances."

Most of the time farmers dont even recover the production cost of onions. There are instances when farmers have thrown way onions on the road and at times they have simply left the crop in the field, said Garhwal, a resident of Sikar.The 41-year-old, who is the director of Olitia Foods Pvt Ltd, said that the dehydration plant will be set up at the cost of Rs 40 crore in Sikar and a MoU has been signed with the state government during the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet (GRAM) in Udaipur.Onions will be washed and peeled by machines at the plant and then dehydrated onions will be turned into flakes, powder, or ground into a paste.There is a huge demand for dehydrated onion in the market. Many products such as noodles, meat masala etc sold in the market contain dry onion powder. Dry onion flakes and paste are also used for preparing food.Olitia Foods will buy onions from the farmers directly and then turn them into paste, flakes and powder and sell it in the market. Onions will be bought from farmers at a rate which they will decide so that they dont suffer losses. The dehydration plant will be operational by the end of this financial year, said Garhwal.When a farmer takes his onion crop to the mandi, the commission agent knows that the farmer will sell the crop at any cost and will not take it back paying for transportation a second time. When the retail price of onions is Rs 40 per kg, farmers sell it at the mandi for Rs 2-5 per kg, he added.Garwal said that white onion, which has a higher moisture content and lower shelf life than the Nasik red onion, is grown in Rajasthan. White onions cannot be kept in cold storage and need to be sold soon.In Rajasthan, onions are generally grown in Sikar Jodhpur, Sikar, Nagaur, Alwar, Jhunjhunu, Jaipur and Churu. More than two lakh farmers are into growing onions in these districts.Setting up an onion dehydration plant in Rajasthan will prove to be a boon for the onion growers in the state. Now, farmers wont need to throw away onions on the roads, as Olitia Foods will buy them from farmers, said agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini.Formed in 2015, Jaipur-based Olitia Foods Pvt Ltd is into making natural food products (without any chemicals). The company sells milk and milk-based products of the indigenous breed of cows, they also make natural beverages such as sherbet by distillation of various edible items such as ajwain, jamum, tulsi, methi etc for medical purpose. They also make spices such as chole masala, sambhar masala etc and manufactures processed olive leaf tea."

The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.As the UP government waived farm loan worth Rs36,369 crore, Maharashtra has been under pressure to do something similar.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis earlier said the cost of extending the loan waiver to 31 lakh farmers is Rs30,500 crore and if the government decided to bear it, that would mean depriving other sections of society from their social schemes.The CM said rather than giving loan waivers, the state will focus on sustainable growth of agriculture. Due to impressive agricultural growth  12.5% this year from the negative growth rate last year  the collective income of farmers grew by Rs 40,000 crore.When asked to scrap infrastructure projects to avail funds to waive the farm loan, the CM had said the international funding agencies fund the infrastructure projects, but there was no provision of funding the loan waiver to the farmers.POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM ALLIESShiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray recently gave a veiled threat of pulling out of the government if his demand to waive off farmers loan is not accepted. Addressing the farmers, Thackeray said his party would give unconditional support to the government if it grants a farm loan waiver. Give a loan waiver and all the Sena ministers will vacate their seats and will give unconditional outside support. If the waiver is announced, we will ensure the government completes its full term, Thackeray said.NDA ally Swabhimani Paksha, headed by farmers leader Raju Shetti, will go no holds barred against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over loan waiver for distressed farmers. Accusing the government of deceiving farmers, Shetti said he was repenting his decision of supporting the government, which had adopted a Mar Jawaan, Mar Kisaan (Die Youth, Die Farmer) policy. The farmers who elected this government will eliminate it. The jawans being martyred at the border are from farmer families and in villages, farmers are killing themselves. The government is following a Mar Jawaan, Mar Kisaan policy, he said, adding farmers are against the Mumbai-Nagpur expressway for which their land will be acquired.FARMERS STRATEGYWhile farmers want a loan waiver, the state government has sought time for deliberation. The strike is the farmers way of creating shortage of milk and vegetable supplies to putting pressure on the government to give in to their demands."

The authorities, Anjana said, were only processing 250 trollies a day. There are already a 1,000 of us here with more arriving each day.Ranchhod Singh Goyel, another farmer, has more pressing worries. The farmer is caught between two boats: should we plant the next crop or be in line to get paid for the current crop.Though initially indifferent to the plight of farmers facing a glut and declining prices, state authorities have opened at least one procurement centre in each onion-growing district in the wake of last weeks farmers stir in Mandsaur that resulted in six deaths, including five in police firing. The procurement centres will be open till July 9.Onion growers can now sell their produce at a higher price compared to Rs 1 they were getting earlier per kilogram. The government plans to sell the onions for Rs 2 a kg. But farmers are worried. Prices will crash the moment the government stops, said a trader. And the Rs 2 onions will destroy the small vegetable vendors.The states marginal farmers are suffering too. The mandi is only procuring onions from tractor-trollies as their weighing-bridges cannot handle other vehicles. I dont own a tractor, said onion farmer Bharat Sharma. It costs Rs 1,500 a day to rent one  Rs 6,000 just to stand in line for four days to sell the onions. Instead, Sharma is selling his onions to a private trader at Rs 6 per kg, 30% lower than the government price.Poor farmers are going to private sellers because they can get cash right away, said Om Patidar, an onion farmer and trader. The government is buying, but no one knows when the money will appear in farmer accounts. We may have to organise a second agitation to get our money, farmer Mohan Sharma agreed.Madhya Pradeshs farmers have always grown onions, but when prices skyrocketed in 2010-11, the land under onion cultivation doubled over the next five years, resulting in the current problem of plenty. When prices crashed for three consecutive years, the Madhya Pradesh government offered an MSP for onions for the first time in 2016 and acquired about one million quintals. But the government did not know how to store onions, said an onion trader in Ujjains vegetable market. The entire consignment rotted away in damp warehouses.Many feel the onion crisis is emblematic of the dysfunction at the heart of Indian agriculture. State governments have no clue about price movements of agro-commodities, so they do not plan in advance, said G Chandrashekhar, a Mumbai-based commodity analyst.Though driven to distress, farmers in Madhya Pradesh have not given up on onions yet. Next year is an election year, so the government will have to buy, said a farmer with a smile, It makes sense to plant even more onions."

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of the then ruling Left Front in West Bengal had just stormed to power on the promise of reviving the industrial glory of the state, but Nandigram proved to be his nemesis. Overnight, farmers across the state turned hostile; the Opposition closed ranks; the intelligentsia distanced itself from the bhadralok chief minister and eventually, the Left lost the plot in a state it had ruled for 34 years.Cut to 2017, the nation is perhaps staring at another Nandigram moment. The killing of six farmers in a police crackdown in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh earlier this month has put the spotlight on Indias worsening farm crisis. The farmers unrest that has since spread to other parts of Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere in India is a wake-up call. For it is a result of years of neglect of agriculture, something that still provides livelihood to two-thirds of the Indias 1.3 billion people.Burden of farming outweighs rewardsAt the core of the problem lies a growing mismatch between what it takes to grow food and what a farmer fetches for his produce in the marketplace. Economists explain this using the phrase terms of trade for agriculture, which improved for a brief period in the 1990s before turning unfavourable for most part of the new millennium.Sample this: In 1992, a typical farmer in Punjab paid Rs 6 per litre for diesel to keep his generator sets running, bought a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) for Rs 200 and hired labour at a daily wage of Rs 40-50. Twenty-five years on, diesel costs 10 times more, DAP priceshave increased more than five times and farm wagesare 10 times higher. In contrast, the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat, which is what most of Punjab grows, has increased only five-fold during this period  Rs 330 per quintal to Rs 1,625 per quintal.Moreover, farmers in the past rarely spent much money on pesticides, to protect their crop. They do now, and pesticide prices have spiked more than the cost of any other input. Twenty-five years ago, farmers didnt have to bore deeper every year to pump water into the fields. They do now, because water tables are dropping at an alarming rate.In other words, the burden of farming has grown much faster than the rewards it brings. Demonetisation made it worse. As my journalist colleagueHarish Damodaranwrote, Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation. Much of the trade in farm goods is cash-based and financed through a chain of intermediaries  wholesale buyers, processors and retailers. Demonetisation crippled this network of informal credit, causing a free fallin the prices of farm goods across the board.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced into distress selling. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.A bountiful harvest, which helped the broader economy post a somewhat impressive growth of 7.1% in 2016-17 despite a demonetisation-driven slump in manufacturing, had turned into a curse. What could have been an occasion for celebrations has turned into a season of mourning for deaths triggered by a glut in farm produce and their plunging prices.As someone said, it is the worst time to be a farmer. A five-part series  Being A Farmer Now -- that will appear in this newspaper, starting Monday, brings out the depth of the despair that is sweeping farmlands across India.MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedYears of neglectThe imbalance between input costs and remunerative prices, however, is just one explanation for the growing farmers unrest. From sluggish infrastructure to lack of research breakthroughs, Indias farm sector faces many challenges. For most crops, yield per acre grew at a slower pace over the past one-and-a-half decades compared to the 1980s and 1990s. So did the expansion of the irrigation network. Successive governments have paid little attention to building research and institutional support to the farming community. As we speak the most premiere agricultural research institution, IARI, is into its third year without a full-time director.The share of government spending in agricultural research and education in the gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen by almost half in the past 15 years  from about 0.5% to under 0.3%. Developed countries, which depend much less on agriculture, spend 2% of their GDP on agriculture. The figure is at least twice higher for even countries like China and Brazil.The neglect of agricultural research has had a bearing on growth in farm productivity. In a well-researched article published recently in theEconomic and Political Weekly, economist Shantanu De Roy demonstrates how, for most crops, yield per acre grew at a slower pace over the past one-and-a-half decades compared to the 1980s and 1990s. So did the expansion of the irrigation network.Public investment in agriculture has been stagnant for nearly a decade, while private capital flows have not picked up enough to provide the stimulus that the sector needs.From my reporting days in the late 1990s, I remember how the government built a narrative to defend its failure to invest enough in the farm sector. Foreign-returned economists, many of whom occupy positions of power, would twist data to show how private sector investment could more than fill up the gaps in public investment. It never happened. We know that now.As a result, growth in agriculture has decelerated from an annual pace of 2.8% in 1990s to 2.4% through the decade of 2001-10 and to 2.1 % in the first half of the current decade.What Indias farm sector desperately needs is a radical policy overhaul based on a new imagination. Interventions such as loan waivers or MSP revisions can at best offer temporary succour. At worst, they deflect attention from the real issues behind the crisis that has been in the making for long  India is reaping what it sowed as it scripted a story of economic transformation that left the farmers out.Rajesh Mahapatra is the chief content officer, Hindustan Times.

This phenomenon gave rise to violent protests by farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The death of six farmers in clashes with the police in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district brought the farm crisis into national focus, uniting the Opposition against the National Democratic Alliance government. The Centre, for its part, reiterated its promise of doubling farmers income by 2020.The indicators of how farm produce prices crashed this year became clear on Monday, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released. One can understand the reasons for farm distress in a bumper crop year by comparing CPI prices with the latest wholesale prices of pulses and vegetables in agricultural markets.The index showed that vegetable prices fell by about 13.5% in May, as compared to the corresponding month last year. The dip in the price of pulses was even higher, at 19.5%. This led to an overall deflation of 1.05% in food prices for the first time since 2012.The fall was higher in wholesale markets, where farmers offload their produce, with pulses and vegetables selling at nearly two-thirds (or 63%) of last years price. It was a sad year for farmers despite having a bumper crop after two tough years (of drought), observed T Haque, former head of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedIn many states, the farmers have not even been able to recover the input costs, he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the states to ensure that agriculturists are provided with a price cushion.Highs and lowsIndias farm sector production grew by 8% this year, the highest ever.According to agriculture ministry data, the production of pulses amounted to 22.14 million tones  50% higher than 2014-15. Horticultural products, for their part, witnessed a growth of over 40%.However, the high production caused an unprecedented glut in farm markets already loaded with imported food items  including pulses. The government imposed 10% duty on these items in May, after prices crashed.In 2015-16, the Centre had allowed the import of pulses such as pigeon peas (tur dal) and lentils (mosur) to check rising prices even as the Opposition accused it of failing to control food inflation. The resultant glut in the market caused prices to come crashing, and the dip was as low as 80% for commodities such as onions and pigeon peas.I could not find a buyer for my produce for two whole days, said Mandsaur farmer Rakesh Patidar, who was finally left with no option but to sell his onions for Re 1 per kg in mid-May.Many farmers like Rakesh started growing onions after their prices skyrocketed in 2014, leading to a significant increase in its area under cultivation. Pigeon peas witnessed a similar trend in 2015 owing to crop failure.It seems like farmers were not looking at anything else, said a senior agriculture ministry functionary on the record production of onion and pigeon peas. They thought onions and pigeon peas would fetch them a good price, but they lost money instead.Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs violence-hit Malwa region, who have been growing onions since 2015, are now witnessing a dip in prices for the second year in a row. The situation is similar in many parts of Maharashtra, where the state government has now announced loan waivers.India is not the only country to have witnessed a steep fall in prices of pulses and vegetables this year. According to agriculture ministry officials, there has been an over 50% dip in prices across the globe due to a demand crunch. However, unlike India, farmers in other countries have the requisite infrastructure to store their produce and sell when prices stabilise."

Annual wholesale price inflation was at 2.6 per cent in September. The food inflation quickened to 3.23 per cent in October from 1.99 per cent in September. Among the food items, prices of vegetables prices were up 36.61 per cent year-on-year, potato 44 per cent and onion 127 per cent.Data released on Monday showed retail inflation picking up in October to a seven-month high, driven by faster rises in prices of food and fuel products, dampening chances of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next month. Consumer inflation in October increased to 3.58 per cent from a year earlier.Some analysts expect the GST Council's decision on Friday to slash tax rates on 178 items could marginally lower retail inflation in coming months.The central bank holds a policy review on December 6.Prices pressures are building just as the RBI projected last month inflation to rise in October-March to 4.2-4.6 per cent, above its medium-target of 4 percent, while leaving rates unchanged.Crude prices have rallied, sending Brent crude to its highest since June 2015, a worry for policymakers given that India imports most of its energy needs.(With agency inputs)"

Hawkers with stacks of attar (fragrant oil) vials call-out to passersby. Its a little over 4pm, but the citys smog and the charcoal smoke have lent the evening an odd shadow. We make our way through winding alleys, lined with flower and chaadar sellers, the homeless and the fakirs. Soon, the dimly-lit walls give way to a sprawling courtyard, which Delhiites know as Nizamuddin Dargah. On one side there is a 800-year-old mosque (believed to be built by the powerful ruler Alauddin Khilji), and on the other, the shanties of Nizamuddin Basti. Going back in time, we revisit the life, and times of Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya on his 803rd birth anniversary, today.One of the many shops in the winding alley leading to the dargah. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)Born in Badayun, Uttar Pradesh to Khwaja Syed Ahmed and Bibi Zulekha  both natives of Bukhara (present day Uzbekistan)  a boy named Muhammad became disciple of Baba Farid Ganjshakar (disciple of Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki), and was to grow up to further the Chishti silsila (spiritual lineage) of the Sufi order in India. We know him as Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya.We celebrate the day with great devotion. The qawwali programme will begin at 8pm, and go on till 5.30am the next morning. The kalaams (compositions) written by poet Amir Khusrau will be sung, along with other Sufi poetry, informs Syed Afsar Ali Nizami, chief in charge of Dargah Sharif.We will organise a langar at night with vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, coffee and tea. At 1am, the mazaar sharif (burial place) will be opened by the family of the saint  to be cleaned and decorated. It will be shielded from outside view, and even those who are inside will not be able to see outside. We wash the darbar with kewda (flower essence) and sprinkle attar fragrances like oudh, shamama and gulab. The third rasam (ritual) is to smear sandalwood paste on the mazaar sharif. Lastly, we offer a chaadar. After the morning namaaz (fajr), devotees can offer flowers and chaadars, adds Nizami.Afsar Nizami is the 38th generation of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas family. He never married and our family has descended from his sisters family, says Nizami, adding, Today, there are three families, comprising 645 members, associated with the dargah. Babas father died when he was about five years old. The family shifted to Delhi when he was 16, for his higher education, says Nizami.The aura of the saint is such that it attracts people from all faiths, across all age groups and social statures. Nizami says: He never differentiated. He propagated the message of universal brotherhood and peace. He showed the path of love and respect, irrespective of age, religion and status.Devotees light incense sticks at the dargah. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)Auliya was accorded with many titles. Among them, the most famous is Mehboob-e-Ilahi (Beloved of God). Another title is Zari Zar Baksh (giver of gold). Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya believed that service is more important than ritual. He would put silver and gold coins under peoples plates. His langar was legendary; its said that just the onion peels were carried on 70 camels, says Sadia Dehlvi, author of The Sufi Courtyard: Dargahs of Delhi. She adds: He nurtured Delhis cultural landscape and made it composite. It was a coming together of Indian, Turkish, Persian and Arab cultures.Devotees offer prayers to the Sufi saint. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)During the conversation with Nizami, some helpers enter carrying deghs (cauldrons) of food. Afsar Nizami informs that every Friday, a Dubai-based Hindu family sends langar to be distributed at the dargah. Soon, the Muezzin calls to the faithful for the sunset (Maghrib) namaaz. Theres silence, followed by prayers. After the namaaz, devotees gather around the mazaar (shrine) and pray to the saint.As dusk descends, the music of the qawwals fills the air. Qawwalis have always been a part of Sufism, but became commonplace with the khanqah (spiritual retreat) of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. His disciple, poet Amir Khusrau composed several qawwalis using tabla and harmonium. He is called the Tuti-e-Hind (songbird of India), says Nizami.Khusrau is also credited with the origins of Khayal school of music and the development of Urdu. Khusrau is acknowledged as the first poet of Urdu, then called Hindvi. He created songs to provide novelty to the musical assemblies of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. All the Chishtis were very committed to music as its the source for reaching spiritual ecstasy, says Dehlvi.Qawwalis are an intrinsic part of Sufism. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)The love of the guru and his disciple was so deep that Khusrau died six months after Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, and on the same date. When talking about saints, we never say they are dead. We use the term parda farmana. Even though the saint is not here physically, his presence will always be with us in this world, says Nizami.The burial place was chosen by Auliya, and on his birthday, it will be decked like a bride. Its said that saints define timelines, and it wouldnt be wrong to say that Delhis timeline can be classified into pre and post Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya period, says Dehlvi.Catch It Live What: 803rd birth celebrations of Hazrat Nizamuddin AuliyaWhere: Hazrat Nizamuddin DargahWhen: November 14Timings: 8pmNearest Metro Station: Jangpura on Violet LineFollow @htlifeandstyle for more"

Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Rangarajan refused to answer whether the RBI would consider the inflation rate while determining the policy review next month. Photo: HTHyderabad: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor C. Rangarajan on Thursday said the inflation, which rose to 3.58% in October, may ease by December and end up below 4% by the end of the current fiscal.Rangarajan said he thinks this is the end of the season when prices rise as far as food articles are concerned. There will be a seasonal decline in food prices by next month. Therefore I believe that, now that the monsoon has also been good, the food prices may come down rather than further rise, the former governor of the RBI said.He was speaking on the sidelines of a lecture by Rathin Roy, the director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, organised by the ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education in Hyderabad.It (the inflation) could be close to four per cent limit is what we are talking about. It should be four per cent or slightly below that, he further said.The wholesale inflation rose to a seven-month high in October as prices of food articles, led by onion and vegetables, witnessed a sharp rise.Rangarajan, however, refused to answer whether the RBI would consider the inflation rate while determining the policy review next month. Earlier in his address, he said the governments role as producer of marketable goods is coming down. The governments role as a regulator is very important given the prevailed market conditions to ensure that the system and structure remain competitive, he said.The role of the government as producer of public goods and services has definitely increased. Whether we accept it or not there is an increasing demand on the government to provide what they call public goods which are broadly defined as primary education and primary health and so forth, Rangarajan said.Rathin Roy, who was also a member of the N.K. Singh committee on the new fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) law, stressed on the need for fiscal prudence."

Though the space allotted to the fair at Pragati Maidan has been reduced by almost half, some say this may allow them to cover more ground and stalls in a shorter period of time. Visitors will be allowed entry till 7.30pm.Some exhibitors had been worried that as the permanent state and central department pavilions had been razed for construction of an exhibition centre, visitors would not be able to find them. However, with compact space, the stalls, halls and hangars of the fair follow almost a straight line from gate number one to gate 18, allowing people to visit almost all the pavilions, food courts and stores on the way.We dont have to walk much between pavilions. You can cover almost all the pavilions in a single day now, said Mona Oberoi, North Delhi resident who said she has been visiting the trade fair religiously for years now.Tickets are not available at the gates of Pragati Maidan or the Pragati Maidan metro station this year, and daily number of visitors has been capped at 60,000. Tickets are to be bought in advance either online, or at other metro stations. The fair, which started on November 14, was open only for business visitors for the first four days.If you enter the Pragati Maidan through gate number one, your first stops will be hangars number one, two and three, where the pavilions of Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, UP, Punjab, and Jharkhand, among others, are set up. Food stalls serving Litti Chokha from Bihar or onion kachoris from Rajasthan are right outside on the way to hangars four and five, which have more state pavilions.The food at the fair is one of our favourite things. My kids had already said that they would want to eat chole bhature, chaat and kulfis, before we even got here, said a father visiting the fair with his two children on Friday. He did not want to share his name.Hall no 7 has khadi products, coir and jute products, and also stalls as part of the Hunar Haat of the minority affairs ministry. Outside, the Saras stalls stock handicraft from across the country. Hangar 15, which is one of the largest temporary hangars, and has 11 state pavilions including those of Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan, come up next.Right across, you find the stalls of the social justice and empowerment ministry of social justice and empowerment for more handicrafts, clothes and other trinkets.Business is going well. I just made a sale of Rs 4,000. If this keeps up, it will go well, said Ajaj Hussein, from Lucknow, who was selling chikankaari items.The foreign pavilion is at hall 18, where you will find lamps from Turkey, trinkets from Thailand, dry fruits from Afghanistan, shoes from Italy, and candies from the UK, among other things. The closest gate from here would be gate 18, which takes you to the metro station."

Photo: MintRs7,000 croreWhat is it? The amount founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises Sunil Bharti Mittal and his family have pledged for philanthropic activities, which is a tenth of their total wealth.Why is it important? Mittal is among the growing list of billionaires in India who are committing a significant share of their wealth towards philanthropy. Recently, Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani and Rohini Nilekani signed the Giving Pledge initiative, sponsored by American investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, to give away half their wealth for charity. Other Indians who have signed this pledge include Wipro chairman Azim Premji, Biocon managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and founder chairman of Sobha Group PNC Menon.Tell me more: Most of Bharti familys wealth would go towards setting up a university in an effort to offer free education to youth from economically weaker sections of society.$850 per tonneWhat is it? The price at which Indian exporters can sell onions in international markets until the end of the year.Why is it important? The Indian government has applied this restriction as onion prices in domestic markets shot up. At Lasalgaon, the countrys largest wholesale onion market, prices increased to Rs3,211 per 100 kg last week, which is its highest in two years. On Thursday, the modal price went up even higher to Rs3,600 per quintal, according to government data. Onions are said to have a curious connection with Indian elections in India, where a rise in their prices is a politically sensitive topic.Tell me more: Some traders say onion exports are not possible at $850 a tonne, and that this might result in an increase in key importing countries such as Bangladesh, UAE and Sri Lanka.Rs5,636 croreWhat is it? The amount the Indian Railways says it has saved in power bills between April 2015 and October 2017.Why is it important? This has been possible due to the Open Access Policy under the Electricity Act, 2003, which allows consumers with an electricity load of above 1 MW to procure power directly from markets. Over half of the total requirement of 2,000 MW for electric traction power has been accessed through this route. This has resulted in the decrease in the average cost of power to Rs5 from Rs7 in states from where electricity is procured via the open access route. The Indian Railways has seen a decline in passenger and freight traffic revenues in the last few years even as the central governments financial support has largely remained at similar levels.Tell me more: The Indian Railways says the cumulative figure can go up to Rs6,927 crore, about Rs1,000 crore higher than the stipulated target, and has projected total savings of Rs41,000 crore over the next decade.7-10%What is it? The average cut in product prices across categories that Hindustan Unilever will effect in about 600 stock keeping units (SKUs), post the recent rationalisation of tax rates under the goods and services tax (GST).Why is it important? This Hindustan Unilever action follows similar announcements by FMCG majors like Dabur, Godrej Consumer and ITC, and comes in the backdrop of the scathing critique from the government that it had done its bit to lower tax rates for many items of everyday use, but companies and service providers had not extended these tax cuts to consumers. It even threatened companies with action, and asked them to take corrective and informative steps.Tell me more: On 10 November, the government took out 178 item headings from the 28% category, leaving 50 items in that GST bracket.23What is it? The points margin that Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes needs over Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari in the last race of the 2017 Formula 1 season this weekend to finish second in the drivers championship. Effectively, Bottas would have to win and Vettel would have to score no points.Why is it important? If Bottas does manage to overtake Vettel, this will be the fourth consecutive season in which Mercedes would have finished one and two in the F1 drivers championship. It would also be a blow to Ferrari, which was leading the drivers title race till seven races ago, but saw its prospects implode after a series of driver and team errors.Tell me more: Lewis Hamilton clinched the championship two races ago, in Mexico, for the fourth title of his career.

Photo: MintNew Delhi: In an effort to tame rising onion prices and increase domestic supplies, the centre on Thursday imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne.According to a notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, export of all varieties of onions will be permitted only at a minimum price of $850 per tonne till the end of the year.The move to bring back MEP on onions follows a decision earlier this month to import onions and initiate local procurement to moderate prices.The retail price of onions is currently around Rs50 per kg in Delhi, substantially higher than the Rs27 per kg in early August.Rising vegetable prices are a cause of concern for the government as Indias retail inflation quickened to 3.6% in October, its fastest pace in seven months. During October, vegetable prices rose sharply to 7.5% from 3.9% the month before.Indias kharif (summer) crop of onions started arriving in markets in October in producing states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.However, the crop size is expected to be smaller due to lower sowing by farmers. According to the agriculture ministry, planting of (2017-18) kharif onions is 29% lowered than last year.Data from the National Horticulture Board shows that arrival of onions in major wholesale markets in October fell 17% compared to the year before.Domestic supplies are also tight as India exported 0.79 million tonnes of onions between April and August this year, show numbers from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.In 2016-17, India exported 2.4 million tonnes of fresh onions, about a tenth of its estimated production of 21.7 million tonnes during the year."
5a53850b9855b770e038032c,A mix of local flavours and tradition: How an Indian Christmas is celebrated,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-indian-christmas/story-K0tV83DZD1FRzvcMM8XPbP.html,2017-12-25,"Come December, and there is a mood of celebration in the air. Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

Price of all vegetables has increased by `7 to `9 per kg from last month. This is unusual for the city markets which used to be flooded with a variety of vegetables during winter and prices usually plummet compared to the other times of the year. But, that has not been the case this year so far due to unseasonal rain. Almost all vegetables are priced `30 or above as most of the produce is procured from other States, mostly Andhra Pradesh. Onion was selling at `50 per kg on Friday.Meanwhile, hopes of consumers for some relief from the local produce too failed as last weeks unseasonal rain not only damaged paddy crop but also destroyed the vegetable crops. The growers in Ganjam, Purusottampur, Hinjili, Digapahandi, Chikiti and Khalikote blocks besides several others have faced the natures wrath.Gopal Panda of Hinjili, who raised brinjal in two acres, said after pest menace, rains poured cold water on our hopes. Gopal Malick of Digapahandi said his ladies finger crop raised in half an acre got destroyed in pest attack while spinach crop cultivated in over two acres by Sadasiv Panda of Purusottampur got destroyed in rain. Surendra Sahu, a wholesaler of Bada Bazar, said the prices are likely to go up further as crops in several areas got damaged in the rain. Most of the vegetables imported from Andhra Pradesh are being sold to retailers with a minimum profit margin.Besides vegetables, prices of edible oil also increased adding to the woes of the consumers."

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million. Farmers need to give a missed call to access its services.EM3, another firm, offers farm-labour services at Rs 2,000 an acre of wheat, which it claims is half of what it normally costs during peak season.The government document said it would prefer solutions that are scalable and can reach small farmers.The average size of farm holdings is 1.15 hectares. This means nearly 85% farmers are small and marginal. India has 120 million agricultural land holdings."

He said the cost of production has increased because of rise in cost of poultry feeds, vaccines, medicines and maintenance of farms.Sundargarh Chief District Veterinary Officer (CDVO) Dr D K Patnaik said the Sneha Layer Poultry Farm (SLPF) in Bargaon block daily produces about 50,000 eggs, while another layer farm in Kuanrmunda produces about 20,000 eggs. They cater to the bulk of the citys demand. Balangir district is the biggest supplier of eggs to Rourkela. Eggs are also supplied from Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.SLPF proprietor Ujjal Kundu said the sudden rise in price of egg is due to rise in consumption and no matching growth in production. He said the situation is gradually improving as wholesale price of egg has come down to `5.40 on Thursday and it would reduce by another 20 paise.Meanwhile, the retail prices of onion skyrocketed to `48 per kg on Thursday.

The prices of the states leading crops - from pepper to cardamom, rubber to nutmeg and cocoa - are on a free fall while the prices of its vegetables, eggs, chicken, and fish, which Kerala depends on the neighbouring states, are shooting through the roof. Experts said the situation is alarming, and the way out of it is key policy changes by allowing farmers the freedom to bring in capital and technology to grow a fruit/vegetable he wants in vast areas of land.Right now, the rules allow only plantation crops, especially rubber, to be grown in over five acres of land, restricting farmers the freedom to farm crops that yield better returns. While pepper prices have fallen below Rs 400/kg compared to Rs 730-735/kg in the same period last year, cardamom prices have slipped to Rs 1,000/kg from Rs 1,500/ kg in May-June this year.Nutmeg prices declined from Rs 350/kg last year to Rs 200/kg while nutmeg flower prices have come down by Rs 1,350/kg to less than Rs 1000/kg in the same period. Clove prices fell from Rs 1050/kg to Rs 600/kg and cocoa from Rs 230-235 to Rs 160/kg. The only exception to this is coconut with prices ruling at Rs 30-35/piece, a two-year high, but low production means no big gains for farmers. In contrast, the prices of vegetables, which the state relies on neighbouring states, mostly Tamil Nadu, are skyrocketing.Small onion prices have gone up from Rs 40-50/kg to Rs 130/kg, tomatoes are ruling at Rs 60/kg, doubling from Rs 30/ kg some months ago, cabbage going up from Rs 18/kg to Rs 60/kg. Renny Jacob, group chairman of Kanjirappally-based Homegrown Biotech, which is engaged in research, cultivation, and development of exotic varieties of tropic fruit trees, says the legal framework of the state is anti-farmer. You cant force anyone to farm rubber. But, the rules are doing exactly that, Renny, who sees immense potential for growing exotic fruits such as rambutan in his farm, says."
