Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R. Arivanantham, Karthik Madhavan, Wilson Thomas, and M. Soundariya Preetha)"

Krishnamurthy on Wednesday assured farmers in the district of water supply to the standing crops.Addressing the Kurnool Zilla Parishad general body meeting, he assured that water would be released to the KC Canal through Muchumarri lift irrigation scheme. Proposals were sent to the government to disburse compensation by assessing the crop loss due to drought conditions and flash floods. Disbursal of input subsidy to farmers for 2015-16 was delayed due to lapses in linking the farmers accounts with Aadhar, he added.Mr. Krishnamurthy said the government was considering proposals to fill 106 tanks in the district. Kurnool district was in the sixth place in construction of individual toilets under Swachh Bharat. He called upon ZPTC members and mandal presidents to cooperate to make the district as open defacation-free by March 31, 2018.Referring to road widening, he said the road from Rajvihar centre to Kids World would be widened by 15 feet. The ZP unanimously resolved to hand over 15 feet land of the ZP to Kurnool Municipal Corporation, which would build the compound wall and related constructions.The Deputy Chief Minister stressed the need for building godowns to store onion crop. Crop loss compensation and loan waiver amounts were being deposited to the farmers accounts, he said in reply to a query by members. He told Joint Director of Agriculture Umamaheswari to distribute tractors to farmers in Adoni, Alur, Dhone and Mantralayam constituencies. District Collector S. Satyanarayana told revenue and agriculture officials to enumerate crop losses without bowing to political pressure.MLC K. Narasimha Reddy sought subsidy and minimum support price for onion crop. Kurnool MP Butta Renuka wanted crop insurance claims cleared. ZP chairman M.

The hybrid variety of tomato is being sold at Rs. 55 a kg.m.a. sriramWith the prices of onion and tomato, two essential vegetables, going north, families are being forced to replan their monthly domestic budgets and purchase in moderation.The prices are unlikely to come down until fresh stocks, especially of onions, hit the markets. The prices began rising over a month ago and old onions (the red variety usually procured from onion-growing belts in Maharashtra) cost even more now.In the retail market of Mysuru, onions cost between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 a kg. Larger onions cost even more and the premium quality fetches Rs. 5 more per kg. Meanwhile, the hybrid variety of tomato is being sold at Rs. 55 a kg while the local variety is fetching between Rs. 40 and Rs. 45.At the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets here, onions are being sold at Rs. 55 a kg and tomatoes at Rs. 40 a kg.HOPCOMS managing director Anand told The Hindu that onion prices in the wholesale market of the APMC here have gone up, forcing retailers to revise their selling price. The purchase price of onion is Rs. 40 a kg, plus 5% tax. Despite the spiralling prices, we are selling onions at our outlets with a wafer-thing profit margin. Even the price of tomatoes has remained on the higher side, with the selling price hovering around Rs. 40 a kg, he said.Datta, manager at a HOPCOMS procurement centre, said there has been a drop in supply of onions from the major onion markets in north Karnataka and Maharashtra. This is following a fall in production owing to untimely rains.We have no agreement with the farmers on onion procurement. Therefore, we procure them directly from the wholesale dealers at the APMC [yard]. We pay them according to the days market rate with tax, he said.A cashier at a grocery shop in I Block of Ramakrishna Nagar said customers keep asking why the prices have skyrocketed and why they have not stabilised even after so many days."

Traders fear the situation may push up prices further.A lot of importers in the city have cancelled orders from southern states because the prices were too high. Out of the total consumption of 2.5 crore eggs in the city, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana export around 1.5 crore.""The largest chunk of the eggs in the state come from the West Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh. They are pricing each egg at Rs 5.22 and that is not viable for us. We have asked them either to bring down prices or stop sending consignments,"" said Sumit Deb, a wholesaler at Sealdah market. Deb imports around 3.5 lakh eggs each day from Andhra Pradesh.""These are not isolated cases as most of the importers were feeling the heat. While calculating prices, we have to add 55p towards transportation, packing and handling charges. That comes to around Rs 5.74 for each egg. The profit margin will be calculated after we factor in breakage and wastage. It is not possible for us to sell each egg at Rs 6 if producers don't bring down prices,"" said Kajal Datta, secretary of the Kolkata Egg Merchants' Association.While the wholesalers have refrained from buying eggs at a higher price, retail markets across the city have been selling eggs at a premium. The sudden price hike has been prompted by an increase in demand at the onset of winter. At Hogg market , eggs cost Rs 6 apiece, whereas rates in Lake Market and Jagu Bazar are around Rs 6.5-Rs 7 apiece and Rs 80-Rs 84 for a dozen.Sellers in Lake Market blame the price rise on the cake season when there's a surge in demand. Even then, they said, it wasn't expected to go this high. ""The prices always go up during this time but never have we had to face this situation,"" said Rabin Haldar, a seller in Lake Market. ""Sales have come down to 20 crates per day from an average of 30-35 crates daily.""The state allows a benefit of up to Rs 8 lakh to poultry units that hatch more than 10,000 chicks per month. The department of animal resource has asked the district administrations to make a detailed data bank so that the government can plan how to make up the deficit. ""We can tackle the situation the way we tackled it with the onion shortage,"" a senior official of the animal resource department said."
5aeae2a39855b7179ad6f758,Dining on the Grand Trunk Road,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/dining-on-the-grand-trunk-road/article21160858.ece,2017-11-30,"Once considered a poor mans food and meant to eaten at breakfast, nihari is a dish typically eaten in winter. As Mumbai welcomes its mild cold season, I discovered my nihari fix at the new BKC restaurant  Taftoon. I ate this delicate Gosht Nihari (Rs. 489) for dinner, digging into the creamy gravy and enjoying the slow-cooked meat and bone marrow. This was mopped with taftan, an oven-baked flatbread made with flour, milk and eggs. It was soft, flaky and crisp on the edges, well worthy of lending its name to the restaurant.Taftoon, from the people  Pankaj Gupta and Abhir Dhawan  that gave us Indian restaurants Oye Kake and Caf Haqq Se, brings a different concept of food to the table. We wanted to capture food from the northern belt and came up with the idea of doing food from the Grand Trunk Road, extending from Kabul to eastern part of Bangladesh. This diverse cuisine covers Persian, Afghani, Pakistani, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Awadhi, Lucknowi and Bengali food. One of the things connected these places was the taftan. The oldest name for this bread was taftoon, hence the name of the restaurant, said chef Milan Gupta.In a bid to stay true to form, Gupta is using traditional pots and pans  wide brass langdis , degchis and Lucknowi lagans . He is sticking to authentic recipes and cooking styles. The meat thats the star of the mixed platter, Taftoon pe Harissa (Rs. 529) is beaten for hours with a mallet till it achieves the required texture. The chicken or mutton (and mushrooms for vegetarians) is then spiced with cardamom and saffron, slow-cooked, and drizzled with truffle oil. A scoop of this is served on a mini taftan, making for morsels of meaty deliciousness.The kitchen has a Robatayaki grill and tavas that send out delicate kebabs and tandooris. Theres the slow-cooked Galauti Kabab (Rs. 369), the creamy Malai Broccoli and Gobi (Rs. 309) and the crunchy Lipta Jheenga (Rs. 569)  barbecued prawns wrapped in chicken salami brushed with mustard. Its the Mirza Hasnu Tikka (Rs. 389) that steals the show. An old Lucknowi recipe, the dish has boneless chicken marinated in tandoori spices, cashew and onion and slow-cooked. The result is meat thats tender, creamy and smoky with just a hint of spice.The drinks have been made using ingredients commonly used in these cuisines. Dried spice adds a sweet smokiness to the Silk Route (Rs. 489), a whiskey drink with apricot brandy, plum juice, bitters, egg white and sour mix. Rosemary and honey star in the Botanic Blend (Rs. 519), a gin and tonic with lavender and a ginger honey syrup.The Grand Trunk Cocktail (Rs. 489)  gin with orange and cucumber  helps soothe the burn from the fiery Akhrot ki Seekh (Rs. 389). A dish from the streets of Srinagar, it consists of minced lamb kebabs tossed in a stock of red chillies, mixed with garlic, onion and garam masala, and finally topped with crushed walnut. Similarly the Bharwaan Kadhai (Rs. 389) is a rich but spicy dish of bhindi, brinjal, and chillies stuffed with grated onion, ginger, and khatta masala.The Railway Khosha Chops is a dry dish of succulent mutton coated with spicy, bhunao masala. This dish was invented during the British era especially for service on long journeys. Since they didnt have refrigeration, they would roast the masalas to create a drier dish and add tamarind and lime to preserve it, shared Gupta, who dropped by after every course to explain the origins of the dishes.Taftoon is a spacious place, all pale yellow lighting, wooden flooring and blue upholstery. An open kitchen gives a view into the making of the dishes, especially the breads. Theres the Zafrani Taftoon (Rs. 109) flavoured with saffron and cardamom; Baquerkhani (Rs. 99)  thick, poppy crusted and spiced leavened bread commonly found across Kashmir; Lal Naan (Rs. 139)  Amritsari bread laced with chilli oil giving it a fiery red colour, and sesame seeds, and the Raampuri Parathy Paratha (Rs. 99)  a tandoor baked layered bread with cashew.To end the meal, theres chewy and rich Shufta (Rs. 339), a Kashmiri compote of apricot, cashews, dried coconut, pistachios and sultanas toasted in ghee and stewed with whole spices in honey. It is served with a light mango ice cream that manages to cut through some of the richness. Theres a Bengali tasting platter, a Chena Plate (Rs. 349) with bite-sized chenna sweets, from gulab jamun, sandesh, rasmalai and kheer kodom.Although the meal was heavy on Indian food, Gupta promised other dishes in the future, including a Pakistani version of haleem, and Afghani mantou.Taftoon Bar and Kitchen, Naman Centre, opposite Dena Bank, Bandra Kurla Complex, 11 a.m. to 12.30 a.m.; 65656100/26530255"

Karthikeyan.Farmers attributed anomalies in disbursal of drought relief and compensation under crop insurance to laxity and lethargic attitude on the part of Village Administrative Officers.They did not identify beneficiaries properly and slipshod work led to such chaos, they said.The farmers blamed VAOs for the inordinate delay in getting compensation for crop loss at the farmers grievances day meeting here on Thursday.Representatives of various farmers associations from Oddanchatram said several beneficiaries did not get drought relief and compensation under the crop insurance scheme due to slackness on the part of VAOs. Despite several complaints, no action had been taken against them till now, they said. Reacting to their complaints, District Revenue Officer P. Velu said the account number and name of beneficiaries did not match in some cases.We had received the fund and it would be deposited in their account after verifying their documents, he added.When Joint Director of Agriculture (in-charge) V. Manoharan advised paddy growers to insure crops on or before November 30, farmers from the Vaigai river Ayacut said that they would transplant only in December. How can we insure our crops, they asked.The JD said the rainfall for November was 30 mm, far less than the average rainfall of 168 mm. If we do not get rain before December 15, we will face acute water shortage.Small onion growers from Vedasandur and Oddanchatram appealed to Horticulture officials to import onion seeds from nearby States as the price of shallots touched Rs. 200 a kg. It was impossible to buy seeds at this rate.When officials replied that they had supplied seeds to farmers to raise 80,000 acres, farmers from Oddanchatram said no supply was made in Oddanchatram union till now.Collector T.G. Vinay assured to send fresh proposal to the government for additional sanction of seeds.When farmers from Kodaikanal complained that the revenue officials were trying to handover dry lands to the Forests Department, the collector clarified that it was false information and said that no cultivable or barren land under revenue land would be acquiesced under any circumstances."

Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed onion in the second half of August.But the first sowing was ruined, as heavy rain led to water stagnation in the farms.There was massive crop loss in the second sowing as well owing to rain, bringing down the yield to less than half, he said.Onion harvest season in Karnataka starts from September and the crop floods the local markets till December. However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location.

This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough.

Wholesale prices of onions have soared up to Rs. 40 per kg against the selling price of Rs. 15- Rs. 20 per kg last year. The prices are still in control in comparison to last week, when the bulb was retailed at Rs. 80 per kg in many parts of the city.Fuctuations all weekWe dont know what the exact reason is but supply from Nashik has been very low for weeks, said 18-year-old Mohammad Saddam, a vegetable retailer based in east Delhis Kalyanpuri who procures his supply from Ghazipur.Mohan Kumar, a wholesale trader, said fluctuations of around Rs. 5 were being registered in onion prices on a daily basis since the beginning of the current week.On Thursday, the price per kg was Rs. 55 and on Friday it is Rs. 50. Hopefully the trend will continue and we will be able to procure the stock. We will be able to pass it forward at a reasonable profit margin, which is currently at its lowest per quintal, he said.Suchetna Khanna, a housewife, complained that her budget had gone haywire due to daily fluctuations in onion prices.I bought just 1 kg onions at the beginning of this week because that was all I could afford at these prices but the bulbs went bad over the next two days. Not just the supply, even the quality of onions is a problem, she claimed.Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller at Okhla Sabzi Mandi, said, We received only 500 bags of onions against the expected 3,000-5,000 bags. There has been significantly lower planting by farmers this year. Heavy rain compounded the problem. Some of the produce we received was wet and spoils faster but we sell it anyway.Traders pointed out that they saw more customers in the mandi due to limited supply and soaring retail prices outside but were quick to complain about the instability of the supply and the rates.Farmers in my village cried last year because the produce did not sell and what sold went for ridiculously low prices. Hence, they unanimously decided to produce a bare minimum this year. This must be the plight of the farmers across the rest of the country, said Munga Lal, a trader at the Mandi.He blamed the governments anti-farmer policies for the unpredictable vegetable prices.I purchased onions for Rs. 50 per kg some days ago. The prices have suddenly dropped now and I am forced to sell the same produce at Rs. 40 per kg. Rates and supplies become unpredictable in this chaos, said Mohammad Sahil Khan, a retail onion seller."

The governments were neglecting the farming community and were engrossed in ensuring their political sustenance, Mr. Narayana alleged.Farmers would produce the much-needed food grains when they were extended assistance and requisite facilities rather than sanction ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to their kith after they committed suicide, the Lok Satta leader said.He later visited Kurnool market yard and interacted with onion and groundnut farmers who brought their produce for sale on their hardships. The farmers lamented that they were hard-hit by lack of remunerative prices and were becoming debt-ridden by not getting back their investment. Mr. Jayaprakash Narayana said the Kurnool market yard was being maintained properly by its secretary Sivaramakrishna Sastry and staff were serving the farmers. The market yard turnover was about Rs. 500 to Rs. 600 crore.Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was claiming to have waived loans of farmers, but they got loan waiver only to the tune of Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 and most of them were securing loans at high interest rate adding to their repayment burden and were forced to sell their produce at lower prices. Government policies were leading to fall in price of crops, but not increasing the revenue of farmers, he added. Onion farmers got only half of the normal yield of 50 quintals per acre and were getting about Rs. 3,300 per quintal.Seeks cess on importsIndia was importing about Rs. 1 lakh crore worth of groundnut, pulses and edible oils, he said and suggested a levy of 30% cess on imports. The groundnut, sunflower and oilseed farmers must be given the minimum support price and a share in the import cess collected to help them flourish and increase productivity to avert the need for imports.Constructing godowns for storage of agricultural produce and processing of perishable products would help the farmers get the desired prices, the Lok Satta president said. As farmers lacked the facilities, they had no option but to sell their produce at lesser prices and become saddled with debts, he said.Mr. Jayaprakash Narayana recalled that he had taken out a padayatra in 2011 when the then government banned agricultural exports, when prices were high in other States and abroad. The protest led to permission to export and farmers got Rs. 3,600 crore additionally that year, he said.A farmer was getting Rs. 18,000 by selling his produce but the school fees of his son was Rs. 20,000, but the governments were giving temporary sops but not formulating plans to increase their revenue. While 50% were dependent on farming, farmers income was hardly 15% . Agricultural exports fell by Rs. 70,000 crore and imports fell by an equal amount after Mr. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he said.Agriculture would be a gamble unless the governments chalked out policies to increase the revenue of farmers, extend health benefits and impart free and qualitative education to their children, he said and called for a debate on the issue.Lok Satta leaders Rajyalakshmi, coordinator Ranjit Kumar and others took part."

Wholesale dealers expect the price to touch Rs. 32 to Rs. 30 a kg in the coming days. With improved production in main markets such as Nasik, Ahmednagar and Kurnool, the onion cost is likely to drop further in January, says P. Satyanarayana, a wholesale onion dealer, who received fresh stocks from Ahmednagar after a long wait.The onion supply in Visakhapatnam is largely dependent on Maharashtra and Kurnool markets. Since the crop suffered a severe blow due to unseasonal rain, local markets have to adjust with the limited stocks available for the past four weeks. With the local producers contributing only a small share to the requirement, the onion rate has increased over the past few weeks.Apparently, arrivals started picking up in the district as nearly 250 quintals were received in the first load and another 260 quintals of onions arrived as a part of the next consignment in the last one week. On Sunday, about 450 quintals of onions reached Visakhapatnam from Kurnool.RequirementThe approximate requirement of onions in 13 rythu bazaars across the district is 450 to 500 quintals a day. However, the supply crunch has increased the gap between the market requirement and arrivals for the past one month. With onion auctions resuming at the Kurnool market yard, Agriculture Marketing Department is now procuring directly from farmers by utilising a part of the revolving fund set aside for the market intervention scheme. We intend to meet the demand and supply in future,  says P.V. Sudhakar, Regional Deputy Director of Marketing, Visakhapatnam.A part of the onions sourced from Kurnool has also been supplied to Krishna, Guntur, and East Godavari along with other districts of the State.Farmers at rythu bazaars hope for an improved sale at the stalls as the onion rate is expected to touch Rs. 20 a kg next month."

Consequently, the affected families have been moved to a church, a marriage hall and a school in the village.Whenever the flow in Tamirabharani is abundant, the water would enter the sea through six estuary points. As the flow had dwindled a lot due to poor rainfall over the past two years, sand had got accumulated in five points and only one point was free for the water to enter the sea. Since the river was in spate, the existing single estuary point was not sufficient to drain the water into the sea. So, the water entered our hamlet, say the villagers, who have urged the officials to remove the sand accumulated in the other five points.After the gale and rain caused serious sea erosion in their hamlet, the fishermen of Periyathaazhai have urged the district administration to extend the existing groyne by another 700 metres.The match industry in Kovilpatti has suffered a huge loss as the downpour had hit production. Owners of various units have been unable to fulfil their commitment. Finished goods worth several crores could not be sent in lorries to northern States.After a gap of two years, the Eppothumventran reservoir, in which 120 million cubic feet water can be stored, is overflowing thanks to good rainfall in Kayathar, Kadambur, Maniyaachi and Kazhugumalai areas. As the reservoir has sufficient storage, farmers of Eppothumventran, Kaattunaickenpatti, Aathanur and nearby areas can carry out farming operations on 837.78 hectares.At the same time, the rain has affected crops such as maize, cotton, black gram, green gram, onion and chilly cultivated at Keezha Vilaaththikulam, Kamalapuram, Zamin Karisalkulam, Sivagnanapuram, Jakkammalpuram, Marthandampatti, T. Subbiahpuram, Sidhavanaickenpatti, Kodangipatti, Vellaiyammalpuram, Padarnthapuli, Pudhupatti, Ramanooththu and Kazhugaasalapuram, all under Vilaaththikulam block.Since the rain lashed the entire block and water is still stagnating in the fields even as the crop had reached the fruit-bearing stage, this will seriously affect the yield, the farmers say.Though the district received intermittent rains on Saturday, no damage was reported from any part of the district.Rainfall in the district (in mm): Kaayalpattinam  84, Kulasekarapattinam  66, Tiruchendur  59, Thoothukudi  40.20, Sattankulam  37, Srivaikundam  35, Vaippar and Ettaiyapuram  29, Kayathar  28, Ottapidaaram  24, Vilaaththikulam and Vedanaththam  20, Kaadalkudi  16, Kadambur  12, Kovilpatti  11, Kazhugumalai  7, Keezha Arasadi  3 and Maniyaachi  2."

The crop has been damaged due to rains. Secondly, production has fallen in neighbouring districts because of a sudden dip in temperature, said Shankar Pingle former director of the APMCs vegetable division.Mr. Pingle said that the price would be high till regular supply begins.

We have been receiving around 150-200 tonne of shallot onions for the past few days. This scenario is in contrast to the 50 tonne during November. So wholesalers have reduced prices sharply, said A Thangaraj, a wholesaler and the secretary of the Tiruchy district Shallot Commission Wholesalers Association.From the inputs, only 10 per cent is being distributed for the local trade in Tiruchy and the rest is exported. We are exporting a minimum of 30 tonne to Kerala, 40 tonne to Sri Lanka and 70 tonne to other districts such as Thanjavur, Pudukkottai and Nagapattinam, added Thangaraj.Shallot onions, otherwise known as small onions or sambar onions, saw a sharp price rise in the first week of November. First-grade shallot onion cost Rs 180 at retail outlets. Demand was attributed to the dip in procurement. More farmers in the shallot belt chose to re-cultivate their outputs as investment inputs in their own fields rather than sending shallots for procurement.To increase inputs, wholesalers started to employ more agents in villages in districts such as Perambalur and Tiruchy. Perambalur has a bulk share of 24 per cent of overall production of shallots in the State with at least 8,000 hectares under cultivation. In Perambalur district, shallots are mainly cultivated in Chettikulam, Irur and Echankadu in Kunnam taluk. They are also cultivated in Alathur, Nakkasalem, Padalur and Nattarmangalam in Alathur taluk and Chatthiramanai, Pommanapadi and Ammapalayam in Perambalur taluk.In Tiruchy district, shallots are cultivated in Thuraiyur, Marungapuri and Mannachanallur. Through the agents, wholesalers were able to convince farmers with an eight per cent commission, three per cent more than what wholesalers pay traders, who acted as middlemen.Shallot procurement mainly used to take place at the Shallot Trade Complex in Chettikulam in Perambalur district, which has an auction centre and storage godown. However, many farmers have begun to lose faith in the facility. Thus agents began to unload more shallots in the weeks that followed the November hike. Our fellow farmers in Perambalur do not mind trading with wholesalers in Tiruchy as it is more profitable for a fresh harvest. Their stocks also do not need to rot in the cold storage and refrigeration in the Shallot Trade Complex, said R Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal SangamOur sales of shallot onions were down by 33 per cent as many of my consumers started opting for large onions, which were three times cheaper than shallots, said C Muhammad Eliyas, a vegetable shop retail seller.We are expecting another Rs 10 dip in all grades before Pongal, said Thangaraj.Agents at work to bring more produce to marketTo increase inputs, wholesale merchants started to employ agents in villages in districts such as Perambalur and Tiruchy.

More significantly, the economy clocked a growth of 6.3% in the second quarter of this year, after slowing for at least four quarters. But official data for the third quarter (October to December) so far suggest that the economy is still not entirely out of the woods and fresh headwinds, such as rising oil prices, could upset the fragile recovery. Manufacturing growth, driven by restocking by producers after the rollout of the goods and services tax, was a major factor in the second quarter growth pick-up. After two months of robust 4%-plus growth, industrial activity however slipped in October, with the Index of Industrial Production reflecting just 2.2% growth. October was a festive month but consumer durables production contracted by nearly 7%, mining was virtually stagnant, and manufacturing growth moderated to 2.5% from 3.8% last year. This coincides with exporters seeing a 1.1% slump in shipments in October, after growing at an average of over 13% in the second quarter. It is also borne out by the nearly 10% drop in GST collections that month compared to September. The IIP has now grown just 2.5% in the first seven months of 2017-18, compared to 5.5% in the same period last fiscal.If the spectre of slower growth with weak exports at a time when global trade is recovering is not worrying enough, with job creation still to pick up, the latest inflation data set too is cause for concern. Prices at the consumer level rose at the fastest pace in 15 months this November, with inflation touching 4.88%, up from 3.6% in October and just 1.5% in June. This reflects a broad-based price rise under way, although it is led by fuel inflation (at 7.2%, from 6.1% a month ago) and food inflation (4.4%, from 1.9% in October). Within food, rising onion and tomato prices pushed vegetable inflation to a 16-month high of 22.5%; inflation in egg prices quickened from 0.8% in October to 8% in November. While some of this food inflation could wane in the coming months, there is greater concern about the rise in core inflation (excluding food and fuel) and inflation imported through high global prices. On Tuesday, oil prices breached the $65 a barrel mark for the first time in over two years. The government faces difficult choices. Slashing fuel taxes could calm inflation, but it would hit revenue collections that are already uncertain owing to GST deadline extensions. Not doing so would leave less room for the central bank to lower interest rates. As the Economic Survey said, oil at $60-65 could hit consumption and public investment and dent private investment further. That is not a path to a sustained revival."

(File Photo) One of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. (File Photo)Onions are, once again, in the news. Last week, retail prices touched Rs 50/kg in several markets, and wholesale prices touched Rs 30/kg in major onion markets like Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. This is not the first time that onion prices have spiked. Almost every alternate year, this roller-coaster of boom and bust in onion prices happens (see Graph). But 2017 is interesting as it saw record low prices in May-June when farmers sold onions at around Rs 2/kg in several mandis in Madhya Pradesh. This has led to grief and anger among farmers.The situation became precarious when farmers protested and police fired at them, resulting in some unfortunate deaths. The MP chief minister realised the sensitivity of the incident and quickly announced a decision to procure onions at Rs 800/quintal and state agencies procured 8.76 lakh tonnes. But in the absence of ample storage capacity in the state, onions had to be quickly disposed of through the PDS and open market operations at almost one-fifth the cost. The whole operation caused a loss of Rs 785 crore to the MP government.However, the more unusual aspect of the onion situation was that only a few months later, in August 2017, prices started shooting up (see Graph) resulting in a visit by officers of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs to Lasalgaon, income tax raids on traders in September and the suspension of trading in Lasalgaon APMC for about a month. The prices then fell for some time but they have been rising since Diwali, prompting the government to announce the import of onions by the MMTC to bring down domestic prices.This is not the first year when government action has been so ad-hoc and puzzling within a few months. In previous years, too, we have seen the government fix the minimum export price, ban exports of onions, and even a study by the Competition Commission of India. The lesson: Income tax raids proved futile in keeping the lid on onion prices even for a few months. We need better policies.So, what is it that causes high volatility in onion prices and what could be the way out? In order to respond to these questions, one may first note that India produced 21.7 MMT of onions, which is about 20 per cent of global production in 2016-17, second only to China. India also exported 2.4 MMT in 2016-17, up from 1.2 MMT in 2014-15. About 60 per cent of onion production is in the rabi season, sown in December-January and harvested in April-May. This is the onion which is stored by farmers and traders and it meets export as well as domestic demand till the arrival of the kharif onion crop, which is sown in May-June and harvested in October-November. The late kharif crop is sown in August-September and harvested in January-February. Kharif and late kharif crops produce about 20 per cent each of the annual production. Kharif onion is of rather poor quality and cannot be stored for very long. The prices tend to rise in October-November when rabi onion stocks are almost depleted and kharif onion is yet to hit the market, or if the kharif crop is damaged, as is the case this year.One of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. Also, the traditional storage practices incur losses as high as 40 per cent. While Maharashtra used the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and National Horticulture Mission and created 42,282 low-cost onion storage structures with a capacity of 9.65 lakh tonnes, there is hardly any storage facility in MP. No wonder, MP farmers suffered most in a bumper onion crop year. However, modern cold storages, as being set up by Allround India, a subsidiary of Allround Holland, and other such companies, can bring down wastage within the 10-15 per cent range.So, the first policy action has to be to promote modern cold storages and develop a system akin to that of the warehouse receipt system for farmers. While a bulk of the storage has to be undertaken by the private sector, the state can do some stocking under a price stabilisation fund. They can hire the services of specialised private sector agencies to carry out such operations on the governments behalf.Second, use trade policy for price stabilisation. In case of a bumper crop, promote exports and in case of a deficit crop, encourage imports. This has to be done well in advance  as soon as one comes to know the advance estimates of production.Third, encourage the setting up of onion dehydrating units and promote demand for dehydrated onions amongst large consumers (restaurants, fast food chains, army, hospitals, etc). Gujarat has already emerged as the main centre for dehydration units with 85 out of 100 units located there, while Maharashtra has just five units. Dehydrated onions are being exported to Japan, Europe, Russia, US and some African countries. The Ministry of Food Processing and state governments can encourage entrepreneurs to avail grants for setting up onion dehydration and processing units. A subsidy of up to 35 per cent with a cap of Rs 5 crore is available to such units. However, the budget of the Ministry of Food Processing for this scheme is just Rs 95 crore. And MP, in its budget for 2017-18, has provided just Rs 7 crore as grants to food processing units. This needs to go up manifold if we are serious about encouraging food processing and stabilising prices even of fresh onions.Thus, instead of raiding traders or banning exports et al, the Centre and the states would do better if they promote investment in scientific storage and processing facilities, and use trade policy more judiciously.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) There is no question in my mind  or in the minds of most experts  that the MPC should be completely independent in the formulation of monetary policy. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)In our previous article, Making RBI Accountable (IE, November 25), I had presented data on Indian inflation over the past year, and concluded that neither on growth nor on inflation has the RBI conformed to any known models of central bank behaviour. I had also argued that there was reasonable evidence to conclude that the RBI/MPC had not been very transparent, or consistent, in its guidance and that by allowing the real repo rate (nominal repo rate minus year-on-year CPI inflation) to triple over the last year to more than 3 per cent, its policies had hurt both growth and employment.There is no question in my mind  or in the minds of most experts  that the MPC should be completely independent in the formulation of monetary policy. Some have suggested that if some government officials believe the real repo rate should be lowered, then all Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to do is call up Urjit Patel and tell him that he wants the rate lowered. Rarely have I heard worse nonsense than this. Most countries of the world, including India, want their central bank to be independent, warts and all.But the problem we are facing in India is rather sui generis  the central bank is going against all known models of central bank policy. Therefore the question arises, in the immortal words of Lenin, What is to be done? My simple proposal, which should both preserve independence of the central bank and make the RBI more accountable, is as follows: Change the RBI Act, if need be, to require the RBI governor (as lead representative of the MPC), to testify to Parliament twice a year. In separate testimony in both houses of Parliament, the lawmakers can ask questions of the RBI governor and the governor can respond.Though I have repeatedly asked for clarification of the RBI memo on fiscal deficits, the RBI has chosen not to respond. Just to reiterate, in my note I have stated that important results pertaining to the RBI policy on fiscal deficits causing inflation cannot be reproduced. Worse, the RBI may have cherry-picked the data to suit its (ideological?) conclusion that the government policy on loan waivers will have a large impact on the consolidated state plus centre fiscal deficits. This expansion of fiscal deficit of 1 per cent of GDP due to loan waivers (RBI estimate) will, the RBI concludes, lead to a large 0.5 per cent increase in CPI inflation. Note that at present we (including self) are in the wilderness about (i) the actual magnitude of loan waivers this fiscal year; and (ii) more importantly, the impact it would have on CPI inflation, the principal concern of MPC policy.What is the empirical evidence for the argument that an expansion of fiscal deficits leads to an increase in CPI inflation? The RBI did not use, in its estimation with quarterly data, the information contained in the data for the years 1996 to 2005 (1996 is the starting year for the quarterly GDP data series). The table shows three-year averages of the two variables of concern  fiscal deficit and CPI inflation. Looking at the period 1996 to 2004 (the data omitted by the RBI, and omitting the onion outlier year of inflation in 1998), annual inflation declined from around 6.6 per cent to 4 per cent. The fiscal deficit expanded from 8 per cent to 9.4 per cent of GDP. If the RBI had included the data from 1996 to 2005, as I show in my note, they would have found that there is no relationship between fiscal deficits and inflation for the long time-period 1996 to 2016.Now let us look at the data considered by the RBI on fiscal deficits and inflation, 2006 to 2016. During this time-period, there is a sharp increase in inflation  from around 6.5 per cent to 9.9 per cent (year ending 2013), and then a sharp decline to 4.5 per cent in 2016. The trajectory of the absolute value of the fiscal deficit in the same period follows that of inflation  from 5.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent, and then a sharp decline to 6.6 per cent in 2016.You dont need a complicated estimation procedure as the RBI has done in its note to conclude that the period 2006-2016 will likely yield to a significant statistical relationship between increases/decreases in the absolute fiscal deficit and increases/decreases in CPI inflation. Ignoring the 1996 to 2006 data is the clearest, and obvious, form of cherry-picking the data, an intellectual crime that the RBI seems to have willingly committed. Such actions will be rendered impossible if India were to introduce the policy of jawabdehi.In English, jawabdehi means accountability. The idea behind it is not new. Indeed, it is as old as 1978 when the Humphrey-Hawkins Act was introduced in the US. The Act of October 1978 states: To assert the responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable programs and policies to promote full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, and reasonable price stability, to improve the coordination of economic policy-making within the Federal Government. Attainment of these objectives should be facilitated by setting explicit short-term and medium-term economic goals, and by improved coordination among the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (emphasis added). It is worthwhile to quote from our own Finance Act of 2016, the one that established the MPC: And whereas the primary objective of the monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. The Central Government may, if it considers necessary, convey its views in writing to the Monetary Policy Committee from time to time.Both the US FED and Indias MPC have very similar goals  price stability with full employment. By experience, the US found it fit to introduce legislation to make the FED accountable to its own objectives. Should we not do the same in India? How will the introduction of jawabdehi help? Can we trust our parliamentarians to ask relevant questions, let alone the right ones? Equivalently, can we trust the RBI/MPC to deliver honest (true to its own goals) policy? Can we trust our analytical experts not to be cowed down by the RBI and be honest in their appraisal  a point also made, in the same context, by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramaniam? Three questions  answers to the latter two we know, which is No.In the US, the Humphrey Hawkins testimony is one of the most important FED events  it is televised, and both the politicians and the FED governors perform beyond expectations. No reason it will not happen in India. All we are saying is give accountability a chance. It is a win-win proposal for all, with zero downside  the country is better off, the RBI/MPC is better off, and even the follow-the-RBI analysts may begin to do some much-needed, independent, and honest analysis. At the time of writing, the RBI-MPCs decision of December 6 is not unknown. Regardless of what the MPC does (rate hike, stay pat, or rate cut), my proposal deserves consideration. The only goal of the jawabdehi proposal is to bring about accountability, not rate cuts or rate hikes.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) Each day in my school began with a prarthana sabha (prayer meeting) on the playground during which we stood in rows while a small group of teachers and students led us in singing Vande Mataram. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)During the 1950s, when I was getting educated in a government-run, Hindi-medium vidyalaya in a small town of Madhya Pradesh, India had Congress governments in the centre as well as in most states. The BJP was then on the fringes, known as Jan Sangh, trying to make some headway in the so-called cow-belt of Hindi-speaking states.Each day in my school began with a prarthana sabha (prayer meeting) on the playground during which we stood in rows while a small group of teachers and students led us in singing Vande Mataram. It was the same in the girls schools where my three sisters studied. Those were the days when owning a radio set gave a family middleclass status. My family didnt own one so me and sisters got our share of film music from the radios plying film songs in full volume in some of the upmarket tea shops which we passed by on way to or return from school. We strained hard to memorize the words so that we could then amuse ourselves by singing those songs at home. Since we sang the two stanzas of Vande Mataram in the school daily, it was a song that sprung to our lips most often. We sang it with the gay abandon of children at play, with no care for what it meant or symbolized. There was also Jana Mana Gana, but it was played only at the end of school functions. At our single digit ages at that time, Jana Mana Gana was to us a signal which marked the end of all festivities.Being raised in a orthodox Muslim family, we were made to offer the full Namaaz on a regular basis, recite the Koran as often as we could, and were told that soon we should start fasting during Ramzan. But such deep commitment to Islam didnt stop our family from getting close to Mishrajis family, as any two families can.The house of the Mishras was conjoined with our house, with a common verandah. Whereas my parants were in their late thirties, Mrs and Mr Mishra were in their twenties, having married recently. They were not only pure vegetarians, but didnt even eat onion and garlic. While we offered morning namaaz, we could hear a steady drone of Sanskrit words as Mishra did his morning pooja. After breakfast Mishra would come to our part of the house seeking the blessings of my father, whom he called Bhai Saheb, and they would go off to work. Mrs Mishra, whom my parents called bahu  a term for younger brothers wife  would finish her cooking and come over to spend the day with my mother till her husband returned from work.For any food to be served to the Mishras, my mother brought over their utensils and cooked in them because the utensils of our house, in which non-veg had been cooked, would not be appropriate. My siblings and I had no such restrictions so we helped ourselves liberally with the snacks Mrs Mishra used to make.In due season the Mishras were blessed with a baby boy. He became the centre of attention of both the families. He frolicked, napped, and pee-d with as much ease in my mothers lap as he did in his own mothers lap. The Mishras were forever asking my parents to bless their son, appearing certain that my parants aasheerwaad would do him good. Not that the Abbasis and the Mishras were exceptions at the time. Everywhere around us there was similar bonding and sharing. In our town, and wherever else we went.More than 60 years have rolled by. The India of my childhood was a poor country, which had been looted by the British so comprehensively that it had been transformed into something that was portrayed by western cartoonists as an emaciated half-naked man in a torn dhoti stretching his hand with a bagging bowl. The India of the present is a massive market for luxury cars, designer goods, cosmetics and many other non-essential playthings of the rich and the wealthy. By the paradigm of development set by the World Bank, India is doing great things on the development front. At least bits and pieces of India have become the land of riches as most of India used to be before the advent of the British.But there is also an India emerging that never was. An India which wants to practice a certain form of a religion, follow a certain unsubstantiated interpretation of history, and treat everyone outside its ad-hoc definition of legitimacy as a subversive. Sometimes, here and there in the same India, Mishras and Abbasis still live together the way they used to in the 1950s, but they are rapidly losing their old spontaneity and innocence.For someone like me whose childhood was inseparable from Vande Mataram, the mere mention of it now causes unease. If I dont sing it, some fellow countryman will brand me a gaddar. If I sing it, some others will call me Uncle Tom. Foregoing lucrative jobs abroad and trading it with much lesser pay and much greater hardships, solely for the pride and satisfaction of serving India, is no longer any evidence of my loyalty to India. I could as well have migrated to the US after completing my education at IIT Bombay, 41 years ago, served my American masters and lived luxuriously on their dollars.In fact, I probably would have been deemed a true patriot today if I had posted a video of myself on Youtube, showing myself singing Vande Mataram, while partaking the pleasures of some foreign land.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But after reaching the market, he was disappointed in the wake of the extremely low prices he got for his greens.A couple of months ago, he sold the same quantity of greens for Rs. 1,000. However, this time, he had no choice but to accept Rs. 300 for his produce.The crash in the prices of vegetables in the market here has, on the one hand, brought cheer among customers as they are buying greens and vegetables at a cheaper price, the farmers, on the other, are extremely disappointed as they are unable to retrieve even the cost of cultivation and transportation.Sunday, when the main vegetable market functions in the district, witnessed vegetable being sold at the lowest price in the last three months. While a small bunch of coriander cost Rs. 10-Rs. 15 sometime ago, on Sunday customers bought five such bunches for a mere Rs. 10 in the retail market.Other green vegetables are also being sold at such low prices allowing customers to buy more vegetables for a small price.Tomatoes, which were sold at around Rs. 60- Rs. 80 per kg till about three months ago, are now available at Rs. 7- Rs. 10 per kg.Besides the general public, hotels and restaurants owners are delighted as they are able to buy huge quantity of vegetables at small prices.The farmers believe that owing to good monsoon, many farmers have cultivated vegetables in their fields, because of which prices have sharply declined.In the summer, only those farmers who have irrigation facility cultivate vegetables; therefore, the prices go up owing to limited cultivation of vegetables.But post-monsoon, since most of the fields have adequate moisture, farmers use the opportunity to cultivate short-term vegetable crops. When most of them do the same thing, the prices obviously come down in the market, said an official in the Horticulture Department.While the prices of a majority of vegetables have dipped sharply, the onion farmers are in a good mood because of a better price their produce is fetching  Rs. 40-Rs. 50 per kg. Onion was sold at about Rs. 20 per kg a couple of months ago."

Due to the fall in the arrival and good demand, the price remained constant since then.The price of bellary onion, which was received from other states, too ruled high, much to the anxiety of the consumers.For the first time in many weeks, the price of small onion has registered a downward trend and is being marketed below Rs. 100 for the past couple of days.

5aeb48ba9855b73f522c87c5,Project complete  inauguration awaited,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/project-complete-inauguration-awaited/article21384155.ece,2017-12-10,"Major investment:The Ramthal irrigation project got administrative approval from the State government in August 2012 for an estimated cost of Rs. 786.11 crore.Special ArrangementRamthal, said to be the worlds biggest micro-irrigation project that is being implemented at Hungund taluk in Bagalkot district, is awaiting official inauguration even though it has been completed.The project provides irrigation facility to over 24,000 hectares of land, to the benefit of more than 15,000 small and marginal farmers in the district. Officials say nowhere in the world has such a large-scale micro-irrigation project been implemented in one place. The project got administrative approval from the State government in August 2012 for an estimated cost of Rs. 786.11 crore. It proposed to utilise 5.84 tmcft of water from the backwaters of the Narayanpur reservoir of the Upper Krishna Project under two stages.The government had given contract of installation and maintenance to a private agency, which has used a high-end automated centralised control system for supplying water to the fields.The government decided to implement the micro-irrigation project in order to save water, as unlike in the conventional (flood irrigation) system which needs more water, under micro irrigation a wider area can be covered with limited water, said Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil.Elaborating on the other major benefits of the project, he said micro irrigation or drip irrigation allows water to percolate and reach the root of the plant, thus improving crop quality and increasing output. As water uniformly reaches every plant, unlike in the flood irrigation system, the crop gives higher yield. Micro-irrigation projects also avoid major problems such as salinity, which has damaged thousands of acres in the State, Mr. Patil said.Calling land acquisition as one of the major challenges the government faces in implementing irrigation projects, the Minister said a micro-irrigation project does not require a large area, unlike a flood irrigation system. Besides this, micro irrigation saves precious water from seepage and evaporation as the water reaches [the plants] through pipelines, not canals, he said.Farmers happyThe farmers in the region are happy to have a micro-irrigation facility in their farms.When Channappa Budihal, 63, began working on his familys 22-acre land as a youth in Kamatagi village of Hungund taluk, the farm was rain-dependent. Despite having a large agricultural plot, owing to absence of a proper irrigation facility, the farm was not giving a high yield. But things have changed for the better with the arrival of the Ramthal project.It has changed our fate for good. Today, I am cultivating horticultural crops such as onion which we could never do in the absence of irrigation facility, he said.Mr. Budihal said now, the farmers of the taluk cultivate crops such as gherkin, soybean and coriander. Officials demonstrated to us that even agricultural crops such as toor, sunflower and jowar give a higher yield of about 40% with drip irrigation, he said.... unlike in the conventional (flood irrigation) system, under micro irrigation a wider area can be covered with limited waterM.B.

Further price drop is expected as the effects of increased Minimum Export Price (MEP) and arrival of imported onions are set to kick in the market.Since June, onion prices had seen a steady rise with the wholesale market at Lasalgaon in Nashik recording average trade price of over Rs 3,000 per quintal. Drought in Karnataka and the late arrival of the kharif crop in Maharashtra were cited as the causes for the price rise. The stored rabi onion was feeding the market with Maharashtra being the only state with ample storage of onions. Onions from Maharashtra were feeding the markets and subsequently prices had crossed the Rs 3,500 per quintal mark in the wholesale markets. Retail prices had touched Rs 80 per kg.MEP and imports follow indirect tactics adopted by the government for the last two months to control onion prices. Income tax raids were conducted on traders in Nashik to look for stored onions. Reports had come in of traders being threatened by officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to not raise the price in the wholesale markets. Talk of the possible raising of MEP and imports has been doing the rounds since September with traders terming this as sentiment doctoring to get the prices down. MEP has been zero since December 24, 2015 to boost exports and reduce the then glut in the market. Besides imposing an MEP of $850 per tonne, the central government has also floated tenders for importing 2,000 MT of onions. Both these moves, the government hopes, will bring down the onion prices in retail markets.This has not gone down well with the farmers. Santosh Goarde, an onion grower from the village in Talki in Niphad taluka of Nashik, said the governments move comes at a time when growers are being hounded by the power distribution companies to pay up their bills or face disconnection.The discom is demanding one time payment at a time farmers have no ready cash. When the prices were just getting right offsetting the losses of the last 18 months, the government took steps to stop it, he said. Deepak Chavan, an agro commodity analyst felt the crop has had its top run and prices will taper off slowly. Post December 15, the arrival of fresh onion will pick up momentum and prices will drop further, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express file Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Express fileFive major wholesale markets in the state, including Punes, are likely to see a major change in the way their board of directors are elected. Instead of elections to pick the board, the state government is likely to appoint senior officials as directors to run these markets. These five markets  the wholesale markets of Vashi, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur, besides Pune  receive around 30 per cent of the commodities arriving from other states and have substantially large turnovers. Vashis is the largest wholesale market in the state and, besides Maharashtra, records arrivals from Gujarat, among other states. The move to appoint senior officials as directors is part of the new model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act circulated by the central government in March this year. The Act specifies markets with more than 30 per cent arrival from other states as markets of national importance.State governments have been asked to give their suggestions and objections to it and adopt it as they deem fit. The Act has numerous other provisions to improve the performance of wholesale markets and help farmers realise better value for their produce. The government has formed a special committee headed by the director (marketing) to study the matter and submit a report. The report, it is learnt, is in its final stages after which it will be put before the Cabinet for approval.APMCs for long have been the hub of politics. In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP have traditionally controlled these markets with the ruling BJP having a thin presence in them. Earlier, the state government had mooted the concept of expert directors, who would be political appointees on these boards. Majority of those appointed, it is said, were close to the BJP. The present move, many say, is another government move to wrestle control of these markets.Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Meanwhile, most traders say the move will not affect the functioning of the markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the Vashi markets onion and potato traders, said trade would go on unhindered. This is purely a political move and will achieve nothing substantial, he said.Jagdish Apshunde, a director of the Nashik market, however, said the move will have its pros and cons. An upright officer will be able to run the markets better but if power is concentrated in the hands of a corrupt officer, the market will go for a toss, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

""We need to pay commission in the local market, which is higher than the transportation charges required to send the produce to Bengaluru. We have to pay Rs 140 per quintal as transportation charges while the commission crosses Rs 170 in the local markets. So, we are all transporting our produce to Yeshwantpur market in Bengaluru,"" he explained.Nasir Hussain Attar, an onion trader in Hubballi APMC , noted that the supply from local farmers is very low in Hubballi.""As there were no rains in the beginning of the season, many farmers opted for traditional crops. The recent heavy rains destroyed onion crops. So we are depending on arrivals from neighbouring districts like Bagalkot , Belagavi and even Maharashtra,"" he stated.Another trader Suryakant Habib predicted that the arrival from Maharashtra will increase from Monday. ""Once it starts, the price will automatically come down. However, onion sowing has decreased all over the nation due to drought. Moreover, onion growers turned to other crops as prices crashed to Rs 300-500 per quintal last year.

Cyclone in neighbouring states, arrival from Maharashtra is the reason for the decrease of price. However, there is hope of retaining average price as North Karnataka has grown small onion more this year. There is big demand for this small onion, which is tastier than its bigger counterparts from Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan.
