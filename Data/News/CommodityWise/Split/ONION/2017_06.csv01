Besides the poor arrivals, marriage season added to the supply-demand gap in carrots as many consumers bought vegetables directly from the wholesale markets in bulk quantities. Those who visit rythu bazaars hardly come forward to buy carrots and a few end up buying 100 to 250 grams, says P. Rameshwari, a farmer from K. Kotapadu.Consultant of Horticulture Department Y. Nanaji says that even in Anandapuram, Araku and Sabbavaram mandals, the crops have been affected this year. These are some of the regions where the farmers grow carrot. However, the production is comparatively low even in these areas. The arrivals are likely to improve in the coming weeks with the harvest of the crops sown by local farmers, he observes.Main rythu bazaars such as Gopalapatnam, Kancharapalem, Akkayapalem, MVP Colony and Seethammadhara used to get one to two tonnes of carrot a day. But, now we are hardly receiving half a tonne a day which is quite less compared to the growing demand of the vegetable, says T. Linga Murthy, estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar.Vegetable pricesAt present, the prices of some of the vegetables per kg at rythu bazaars are: onion Rs. 46, tomatoes Rs. 36, leafy vegetables Rs. 10 for three bundles, beetroot Rs. 34, ladys finger Rs. 18, ridge gourd Rs. 22. The roadside vendors at Sithammapeta are selling carrot at Rs. 150 a kg."

But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up. Tomato has been selling at Rs 60 per kg, broad beans at Rs 80/kg, okra for Rs 60/kg, drumsticks at Rs 200/kg and green peas for Rs 100/kg. These apart most vegetable prices are hovering around the Rs 50/kg mark."

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

CM Manohar Lal Khattar unveiled the scheme  which will be initially extended to famers growing potato, onion, tomato and cauliflower  in Karnal.Haryana director general of horticulture Arjun Saini said the schemes aim was to help farmers in distress and ensure they recover input costs. For example, if a farmer has spent Rs 400 on producing 100kg potato, he is free to sell it at any price to reap profits. However, if he fails to recover his input cost due to drop in rates, the department will compensate for the difference, he added.Saini said the cost of horticulture produce would be determined by experts from the Haryana Agriculture University, department of horticulture and Kisan Ayog. It is different from minimum support price (MSP). With this, distressed farmers growing vegetables in Haryana will no more have to throw their produce on roads in the event of a crash in prices. The idea is to encourage them to resort to diversification of crops, he said.The department clarified that farmers would be compensated only if they registered themselves on the portal and the produce was sold through the market committees using J-forms. A separate fund would be constituted by the state government for the scheme.Speaking at the inauguration of scheme, Khattar said compensation at the rate of Rs 400 per quintal would be given for tomato and potato, and the amount would be Rs 500 per quintal for onion and cauliflower.Terming the scheme as a big sham and a huge fraud on the farmers of the state, Haryana Congress legislature party leader Kiran Choudhry said the state government should fix MSP for vegetables and procure those if it was keen to help them.She added that the scheme seeking to offer input cost for four crops  potato, onion, cabbage and tomatofrom January onwards, consciously puts the cost of growing way below the cost price so that the government was not made to pay anything."

Farmers were expecting a minimum support price as just before the elections the government had announced that it will purchase different crops including groundnut at MSP. So, the farmers want MSP for onions.In the APMC Ahmedabad, onion was trading at Rs 25 to Rs 35 per kg depending on the quality, though in the retail market, the consumer has to buy onions at around Rs 60 per kg.J V Vaja, the secretary of the Mahuva Agriculture Produce Market said, The price was higher than last year and there was not much of a hue and cry from the farmers.

The central bank left policy lending rate (repo) unchanged and hiked borrowing rates (reverse repo) at the last policy review on April 7.RBI has already signalled that uncertain monsoon and low statistical base effect will keep CPI inflation at 4.5% in the first half and 5% in the second half of 2017-18. The government may also increase the minimum support prices (MSPs) of crops, which will put an upward pressure on inflation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.A pick up in new currency in circulation helped revive consumer demand after a bout of severe cash crunch during the demonetisation drive of November-December of 2016.The March inflation number was still higher compared with the 0.45% fall in WPI during March 2016, as prices of petrol, diesel and minerals, firmed up due to an upward trend in global prices.Festival demand pushed up prices of vegetables by 5.7% and fruits by 7.6%. However, potato prices fell 17%, onion 10.8% and pulses 6.1% from a year ago.Mineral prices were up 23.5% while fuels were costlier by 18.2% as petrol and diesel prices were revised up.Last week, government data showed a rise in the prices of sugar, confectionary, snacks and fruits during Holi pushed up Indias consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3.81% in March from 3.65% in February.The slowing pace of remonetisation, or pumping new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes into circulation, during March to replace the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, helped inflation to stay within 4% in the financial year ending March 2017.Consumption and investment activity were dampened after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the bold decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.While the demonetisation weeded out Rs 15.44 lakh crore or 86% of currency from circulation, the government and RBI has been able to pump in about Rs 13.35 lakh crore worth of new notes so far."

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver"

The erstwhile Congress-NCP government had taken loans of Rs75,000 crore at the interest rate of 9.5%. We have now asked it to bring down to the prevalent rates  6.75%. If this gets approved, the government will save Rs2,062 crore every year, Mungantiwar told HT.He said that Jaitley has agreed to consider the demand, as it will help improve the financial health of the state.The debt of the state is slated to cross Rs4 lakh crore in this fiscal and the state is likely to pay around Rs31,027 crore as interest for the loans in 2017.Mungantiwar also demanded deadline for onion export to be extended so that its falling prices can be controlled. We have requested to extend the deadline for export of onion by three months. The finance minister has agreed to facilitate us for the same, he said.Prices of onion have dropped substantially, creating more issues for the farmers as they are not getting appropriate price for their produce.Meanwhile, while speaking to the representatives of various manufacturing industries, Jaitely said they need not worry about the GST roll out as tax rates of the commodities have been placed in the slab nearest to the existing tax rates. The GST has five slabs for tax rates starting from 0 to 5, 12, 18 and 28%.He is also learnt to have assured to consider their demand to reconsider inclusion of raw materials required for liquor and petroleum products in the GST when both the above commodities are kept out of the ambit of the GST.Also read: Four bills for GST roll out will be introduced next week"

Speculations are rife that the Communist Party of India (CPI) may join the Yatra.The leaders from all the seven parties, including legislators, would be covering 1,500 km while passing through Vidarbha, Marathwada and Western Maharashtra, where farmer suicides have remained the highest in the state. Politicians would be with farmers and the families of those who have committed suicide.A senior Congress leader confirmed that they have invited Gandhi on the last day (April 4) of the Yatra, and have received a positive response. Similarly, NCP legislator Jitendra Awhad said the NCP chief would also be joining the event.Meanwhile, the government announced a slew of schemes under its Unnat Sheti, Samruddha Sheti initiative on Tuesday .While addressing farmers on Akashwani on Tuesday, state agriculture minister announced an initiative to raise the food production and productivity.The project has the provision of additional funding for drip irrigation, distribution of soil health cards to 1.06 crore farmers, funding for 8,000 onion chawls (godowns) with storage capacity of two lakh metric tonnes, a five-year plan for seed supply and mechanisation of farming.Also read: Opposition readies to corner Maha govt over farm loan waiver"

The government has also requested to extend the benefits of the scheme, which is ending on March 31, by three months.Under its Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS), the central government has been providing 5% grant on onion export since September last year . The idea is to encourage onion exporters so that the prices can be arrested from further fall.The state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar wrote this letter to Jaitley hoping to maintain onion prices if the Centre agrees to the demand.The move assumes significance in a scenario, where loan waiver for farmers is already a hot topic in the state with the Opposition beginning the Sangharsh Yatra on Wednesday to take on the government. In the interest of farmers, I request you to kindly consider increasing grant under MEIS up to June 30, 2017, he wrote in the letter dated March 22.If the grant is increased to 15%, the average price per quintal will improve and farmers will get the production cost of their produce, the letter further said.The issue was also discussed when Jaitley was in the city on Sunday to talk on issues related to Good and Services Tax (GST), which will be implemented from July 1. Jaitley assured Mungantiwar that he would consider the demand, sources said.Looking at this as a positive development, Jaydutt Holkar, president, Lasalgaon APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee), largest onion market in Asia, said the situation can improve if the central government approves the demand. The rise in grant will certainly help encourage exporters in exporting more onions and farmers will be benefitted as cascading effect, Holkar told HT.Currently, average price for a quintal is between Rs450-500 which ideally should be around Rs1,500 per quintal as cost of production for a quintal comes around Rs1,000 to a farmer, he said."

On the backdrop is a blaze, smoke and cracking sound of his crop burning with government officials spraying kerosene to stoke the flames. At the other end of the adjacent plot, a harvester machine is busy felling the crop. Just about 24 hours ago, Sheikh was unaware that his crop with be razed to the ground and burned.Safat Ali Sheikh, 52, of Hatkhola village under Chapra Block is facing the same ordeal for his 40 decimal land which the giant harvester cleared in a few minutes. Fending for a family of nine, he and his sons are now at a loss as to how they will manage to run it.The enemy, however, is invisible. The spores cant be seen with the naked eye. If the fungus attacks a wheat spikelet at one point, it travels upwards and the seeds simply wither away. We have been told by agricultural officers, the fungus seems to spread by air, and quickly spreads to the nearby plants, said Sheikh.For the Mamata Banerjee government, it is a race against time. While the farmers stand helplessly ruing the disease that struck them with lightening speed from across the border, for the agriculture department officers it is a race to clear the fields and burn the wheat to ensure there are no fungal spores that can travel from Bengal to the wheat bowl of the country in the Hindi heartland.Read:Deadly wheat blast symptoms enters India through the Bangladesh border, Bengal govt burning crops on war footingI have heard they are cutting off my crop and setting fire. I dont know what happened. They (government officials) said that I will get compensation. But I dont know when the money will come, said Safat Ali.I have invested Rs 4000 for 12.5 cottah of land in terms of seed and fertilizers. This is apart from the toil me and my son put in. If everything went well I would have got Rs 6,000 for my produce, which means a profit of Rs 2,000. But now I dont know what will I do, Dulal Sheikh told HT, while the field burnt.Government officer speaking to farmers in Sonpukur village, Nadia. (Subhankar Chakraborty/HT PHOTO)In Nadia five blocked bordering Bangladesh has been severely hit including Chapra, Tehatta I and II, Karimpur I and II.Last year, the fungus entered Asia for the first time, creating havoc in Bangladesh where crops of over 20,000 hectares in six districts had to be burnt. In Bengal it has already spread to Murshidabad and Nadia districts bordering Bangladesh forcing the government to sound a red alert.The HT team visited a number of villages in Chapra I block in Nadia district. The scene was the same at Sonpukur, Hatikhola, Mohotpur, Sikra and other villages near the Indo-Bangladesh border.On Sunday, I visited a field in one of the villages and saw a couple of spikelets and detected symptoms of wheat blast. After two days I visited again and to my dismay found that 30% to 40% of the entire crop in the plot affected. We are not taking any chance whatsoever. We are calling it wheat blast like disease, since confirmation is yet to come, said Pranab Kumar Hembram, assistant director of agriculture (Chapra block), who was seen with a team of panchayat and government officials running around in the villages since 7 am on Saturday.Read: Fungus sees wheat crops in Bengal go up in flames as govt controls its spreadThe state government has deployed men and machines in the villages including combined harvester machines to chop off the crop, jars of kerosene and spray machines.On Sunday a notification was issued by the state government. We are felling the crop first and then spraying kerosene and setting the field on fire. We must ensure that all crops and seeds are destroyed. The spores which spread through air has to be contained, said Arun Roy, project co-ordinator and additional direct state agriculture department, who have been sent by the state secretariat to oversee the containment initiative.Though no government officer would say it on record, they indicated that the farmers would do well to avoid sowing wheat for the next two-three years.Bengal government has deployed combined harvester machines to clear the fields of the standing crops in Nadia district. (Subhankar Chakraborty/HT PHOTO)Initially, panchayat and government officials faced resistance but were able to convince farmers of dangers of the deadly disease.Initially there was some resistance among farmers. But we were determined since this is serious issue. We convinced them ultimately, said Mrinal Kanti Tarafdar, sabhapati of Chapra panchayat samity.But there are gaps in the crop destruction process. Wherever men and machinery are not available, the government is not able to deploy harvesters. The officers are directing the farmers to destroy the crop themselves. The irony is, most of the farmers are so poor that they are not able to afford the required to fell and burn the crops -- an exercise that will deliver an additional financial burden.The administration is offering Rs 50,375 as compensation for crop destroyed of per hectare. The amount is paltry and we are not sure when the money will be disbursed, said Atiur Khan, a farmer of Sonpukur. He has 17 bigha of land and he has cultivated in 1.5 bigha.Nadia is one of the most fertile tracts of Bengal with Gangetic alluvial soil flowing from both the Ganges and Padma enriching the fertility of the tract. Agriculture officers pointed out that the district displays a remarkable variety of crop diversity with jute to paddy, wheat to onion, oilseeds to vegetable.Fortunately, the fungus affects only wheat and, as a result, the fields next to the wheat that are laden with red chilli and onion are safe."
