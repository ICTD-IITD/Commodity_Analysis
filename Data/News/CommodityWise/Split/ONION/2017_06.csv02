The show is on and Sherry, a teetotaller himself, is on a high.From laughing all the way to the bank with comedy shows, 53-year-old Sidhu is now tickling the funny bones of Punjabis as Congress star campaigner and candidate. At Tanda in Hoshiarpur on Tuesday, the former Indian opener starts his speech by licking his fingers, like a spin bowler before a cricket match.I used to hit boundaries as a cricketer. Now I will hit Badals for a six. Bhukha teh rajj janda e, bhukkhad nahin rajjda. Bhajj Badala bhajj tere layi main kalla hi kaafi aan (A hungry man gets satiated, not a greedy one. Run, Badal, run; I alone am enough for you), he says. Lest the crowds forget to cheer, he adds, Thoko taali (Come on, clap!).He then belts out funny anecdotes from Punjabi folklore to prick the Jat Sikh pride. Ek billa Jat da duddh pi gaya. Jat ne bille te bhaanda maareya. Naal de bande ne puchheya duddh te pi hi gaya si, mareya kyon? Jatt kehnda billa duddh pi ke muchhan nu tav denda si. Chori, upar se seena-jori (A cat drank milk from a Jats home. He threw the vessel at him. When a neighbour asked him why throw the vessel when the cat had already drunk the milk, he said the cat was stoking his moustache after drinking the milk. First he steals, then shows attitude too).He adds, Pagri sambhaal jatta, pagri sambhaal, Badala ne tera sara lutt leya maal (Save your turban, Jat. The Badals have looted your state). Ki mein jhooth boleya? Nai taan, thoko taali (Have I lied? If not, cheer out loud).AAPS TURNAfter the Badals, he guns for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). More analogies follow. He starts by calling it a baraat without a dulha (marriage party without a groom). He takes a dig at AAP boss and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, calling him, again, a handpump which is four feet above the ground and 120 feet below it. Another round of thoko taali. More cheers.He is not done with Kejriwal yet. Sidhu goes on to shower some more adjectives. This Kejriwal is a very cunning man. Heads he wins, tails you lose! He wants to break the partnership of Sidhu and Maharaja saab (reference to erstwhile Patiala royal and state Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh) by tweeting, Sidhu will be CM.And then mimics Kejriwal in Hindi. CM face announce karna humari policy nahi hai (We dont have the policy to announce a CM face, he told me). Yeh kaale angrez hain. Delhi se Punjab paar raaj karna chahte hain (They are dark-skinned British. They want to rule Punjab from Delhi).With a helicopter waiting to take him to Amritsar, he rushes through the same anecdotes, epithets and analogies at the third rally at Sham Chaurasi on Tuesday. He refuses to talk to the media as he reaches for his Toyota Land Cruiser surrounded by a security ring by staff that follows him in a Toyota Innova.Next day, it starts pouring and we wait for speaking to Sidhu outside his residence in a colony named Holy City, a stretch of luxury within the holy city of Amritsar, lined with palm trees.His best friend Bunny (Rupinder Singh Sandhu) remains noncommittal on an interview. Two hours later, his private security men come out of two cars and we rush back to the gates. Sidhu had to cancel his days roadshow at Tarn Taran and we finally get to sneak in.OF SOCIAL MEDIA, AND A JAINI LUNCHDressed in a khaki Pathani suit and matching sleeveless jacket, Sidhu is sipping tea, Punjabi style, in a glass tumbler. He talks about his resentment over being called a hard bargainer by the media and says he doesnt read newspapers or watch news channels. People are hearing me on social media. My speeches are getting lakhs of views, Sidhu says. Then there is no stopping him.Recalling his first speech as a school captain, he says he had to go on stage and say two words, School dispersed. I fainted after saying those two words. I was a very shy child. When I scored a century, I used to dread the press. But now I dont prepare my speeches. Even if I have not watched cricket for a while, I start the commentary after reaching the ground, he adds. As we talk on Punjab and Congress, Sidhu hands out a file of how Badal businesses have grown over the years at the expense of Punjabs coffers.Over lunch  three sabzis without onion and garlic, and chapatis with no ghee  Sidhu says he is a teetotaller and has Jaini food. He says he follows the early to bed, early to rise regime. I need six hours of sleep. I go to bed by 10 and get up at 4 in the morning. I do meditation for hours after I get up. I go into a trance. I have no internet in my house. I sleep a sound sleep as I am answerable only to my conscience, he says.There is jaggery for dessert and Sidhu cant help throw yet another analogy as he eats it. The Badals hatch conspiracies to finish people politically. Gur de ke maarde ne (They kill you by serving jaggery).ON HOME TURFOn the phone, he tells someone hed welcome anyone from the rival camp to join him willingly. Its time for him to leave for his office to discuss his campaign in Amritsar East, the seat of his wife Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu, which he is contesting this time. As he reaches for the door, his dog, Poochi, a French breed, Petit Basset Griffon, comes running and Sidhu shouts as she pees near a sofa. He fondly says his other dog is named Batman.At one end of Sidhus house is a room where Guru Granth Sahib is placed. On the first floor, there is a rare crystal Shivling. Sidhu calls himself a devotee of Mahadev (Lord Shiva) and also a devout Sikh.And, not just the clock, he goes by the stars too for luck. So much so that Congressmen now joke he leaves home only at a time thats auspicious. He is wearing four rings studded with gemstones -- pukhraj and rubies -and a gold bracelet of rubies. Does he believe in astrology? Sidhu nods a yes. I do.His wife is out campaigning for the seat and, other than the two pets, the palatial house with a swimming pool in the basement seems empty.Ask him if his kids are campaigning, and Sidhu smiles, My daughter Rabia is doing fashion designing in London and my son, Karan, is a lawyer in Delhi. Even when a traffic cop challans him, he does not tell them whose son he is. Modesty may not be one of Sidhus virtues, but the gift of the gab surely is.But, on pride, you cannot blame Amritsaris. The famous restaurant Bharavan da Dhaba in the city tells you why. Namak swaad anusar. Aakad aukaat anusaar (Salt as per taste. Attitude as per your stature), reads a placard there."

Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

Picture by Ashwinee PatiBhubaneswar: Gothapatna resident Shanti Lata Rath had to run from one vendor to another on Saturday to buy fresh groceries. When she did find a vendor with a relatively fresh stock, she was stunned by the price that the he asked for.Rath wasn't the only one to go through such an ordeal.Rumours of a cyclonic storm hitting the state not only emptied vegetable markets, but also saw prices soar. The most affected were the smaller shops. Tomato prices rose to Rs 50 to 60 a kg from Rs 40 earlier, while cabbage was selling at Rs 50 a kg compared to Rs 30 a kg last Monday. Prices of potato and onion also witnessed a sharp rise to Rs 15 and Rs 40 compared to Rs 10 and Rs 30 earlier.""I prefer fresh vegetables and buy them daily. However, it seems that my practice came heavy on my family and me. It has been raining for the past two days and the vegetable shops have nothing apart from cabbage and potato,"" said Rath, a homemaker.Old Town resident Sushil Hota faced a similar predicament. ""Such rumours of cyclones affecting daily markets, mainly in October, have become a yearly practice. I was aware of the situation, but failed to stock the essentials, so had to suffer for that. I had a tough time finding tomatoes at the market,"" said the schoolteacher.Small vegetable vendors in the city suffered the most because of the hoax as they failed to provide bare essentials even to daily customers.""I bought vegetables from the wholesale market, but the prices there witnessed a dramatic rise. I was forced to get the vegetables at much higher prices and sell them,"" said a vendor at CRP Square.On Wednesday, the regional meteorological centre here traced a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal and predicted heavy to very heavy rain for the city.""We rigorously monitored the system and never stated that it would intensify into any cyclonic storm. The system moved to neighbouring Jharkhand on Saturday and weakened gradually into a well-marked low pressure. Rainfall in the city will stop, and it will be the same for the state from Sunday,"" said Met director Sarat Chandra Sahu."

The trend will continue till Chhath as many people will only consume vegetarian dishes during the course of the festival.Residents, however, are feeling the pinch of the price rise - a pair of cauliflowers available for Rs 50 now costs Rs 100. Similarly, bottle gourd, which was available for Rs 20 a piece, now costs Rs 40 per kg. Even the price of onion has gone up from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 45 per kg.Be it pointed gourd, bitter gourd, sponge gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, tomato or potato, the price of all the vegetables have soared. The most expensive among them is coriander which now stands at Rs 400 per kg.On the sudden price rise, Bablu, a vegetable seller at Rajapur Pul vegetable market, said: ""The price of vegetables has increased just before Diwali and it will continue till Chhath. It is not in our hands as we are also purchasing it at higher prices so we do not have any option but to sell at higher rates to make up the margin.""People who are involved in wholesale business are responsible for charging unnecessary money as they know very well that residents have no other option but to purchase at higher rates.Residents, naturally, expressed pain over the price-rise.Richa Kumari, a housewife at the Boring Canal Road locality, said: ""Pointed gourd which was available at Rs 20 per kg now costs Rs 40 per kg. Similarly, the price of sponge gourd and ladies finger has equally jumped. In the winter season, we love coriander sauce and it is really expensive; a little bit of coriander is not enough to make sauce. God knows when the prices will come down.""Agriculture department deputy director and agriculture expert Anil Kumar Jha, however, said the reason behind the sudden rise in vegetable price is the transition period.""This is the time when summer is on its last lap and winter is approaching. Because of this, the seasonal vegetable is getting over and fresh vegetables are coming into the market. It is actually a transition period when the supply of vegetables is less. Once winter vegetables fully reach the market, the prices will automatically go down."" Jha told The Telegraph.He also admitted that the traders intentionally increase the price to make more money during the festive season specially Chhath as many people abstain from eating non-veg."

The other three days he will devote to the Sun God.Niraj has been observing the rituals along with his mother Shashi Sinha. Shashi is now a Chhath veteran with 20 years of rituals behind her. ""I always helped my mother during Chhath and it used to leave me with a good feeling,"" said Niraj. ""There wasn't any particular mannat (wish) in mind when I began observing Chhath myself eight years ago.""But over the years, he observed, whenever he or any family member faced a problem, the Sun God bailed them out. ""No problem is too big for a Chhath devotee,"" Niraj said. ""I also feel an inner strength through the year after observing Chhath. Like any other Chhath devotee, I am also conscious not to commit any mistake during the entire festival. Chhath rituals are tough. Not everybody can observe it.""Niraj is very particular as far as Chhath rituals are concerned. ""You cannot wear stitched clothes,"" he said.

My mother takes care of the prasad preparation while I arrange puja material and create an artificial pond on the rooftop, apart from looking after other festival-related things. I visit hospital only on Day One of the four-day fest. The other three days I totally devote myself to the festival.""On Tuesday, which is Nahay-Khay, Niraj went to Ganga Ghat to collect holy water.

5b2e5c209855b72640115aca,Bosch embraces change!,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/634769/bosch-embraces-change.html,2017-09-24,"German auto components giant Bosch, which set foot on Indian soil in 1922, has now become a household name  be it in automotive components, or building and security solutions. The company, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, has constantly been in a state of evolution.From a supplier of automotive components and technologies, it has diversified into other business areas such as energy, building solutions, consumer durables and electrified solutions.Its composition is akin to an onion bulb. Every layer opens up a new facet about the Group and the environment in which it operates, Soumitra Bhattacharya, Managing Director, Bosch Limited, and President, Bosch Group India says.We have made headway from being an intelligent organisation to a connected set-up. For Bosch India, transitioning to a connected era requires a change in mindset. The decision to become a smart, and then eventually a connected company, is not an option but an imperative for long-term success. To embrace the opportunities put forth by the future, Bosch Limited needs to first understand the needs of its existing and potential customer, Bhattacharya told shareholders earlier this month.First, the company started a representative office in Kolkata, and from 1951, Bosch is present through its subsidiary Bosch Limited (then Motor Industries Company Limited or MICO).The Bosch Group operates in India through 12 companies including Bosch Limited, Bosch Chassis Systems India Private Limited, Bosch Rexroth India Private Limited and Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited.Looking forward, the company is well prepared to offer its large customer base an array of full-line solutions, diesel and gasoline included, as the nation transitions from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms by 2020.Electrification is futureRecently, Bosch announced its plans to offer a portfolio of electrified solutions for the Indian market. The company foresees electrification as a future growth area in India.Today, the Indian supplier base is fragmented for electromobility solutions. With the current powertrain offerings from Bosch India, the company is aiming to bridge this gap and have the first mover advantage, said Peter Tyroller, Member of the Board of Management of the Bosch Group responsible for Asia Pacific, during his recent visit to Bengaluru.Currently, the company is in advanced stages of development and plans to move into series production after 2018.He emphasised three trends that Bosch sees for the future of mobility -- it is automated, connected and electrified. We especially see the small-vehicle segment driving the transition to mass electrification, as urban dwellers seek a simple and affordable alternative to conventional standards, he said, adding the powertrain of the future will be a mix of electromobility and combustion engines.Accoding to him, the Government of Indias initiative to convert the Indian automotive market into an electric vehicle nation by 2030 is another important step. We believe that electrification in India will first gain momentum via fleet operators. The pre-requisite for the same is shared and connected mobility. As for personal mobility, small vehicles will be essential for this as they make it easier to weave quickly through traffic. Bosch is ready to start its electrification journey in India, first through light vehicles. As the opportunity expands, Bosch India will foray into other segments, Tyroller added.In February 2017, Bosch India launched the Connected Vehicle solution for commercial vehicles and passenger vehicle fleets. The product allows the owner to track, trace, geofence and get custom alerts in case of any deviations.Boschs vision for 2020 entails that every product is connected via the Internet of Things (IoT). At Bosch India, several legacy assembly lines have been restructured to achieve higher efficiency and increased productivity while having a lower payback time.Towards Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence is a topic that Bosch is planning to deal with greater detail from next year onwards.Ten years from now, scarcely any Bosch product will be conceivable without artificial intelligence (AI). It will either possess that intelligence itself, or AI will have played a key role in its development or manufacture, Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner had said. Within just five years, products featuring artificial intelligence are expected to account for 10% of Bosch sales. Bosch will use AI to turn things into intelligent assistants. Products will become partners, companions, personal assistants, the CEO said.Bosch India is ramping up its AI centre in Bengaluru. Apart from this centre, the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI) is operational in Palo Alto in the US, and Renningen in Germany.The BCAI is formed to help Boschs greater aspiration to come up with future offerings in IoT, specifically in electromobility.Targeting the youthBoschs skilling programme BRIDGE (Boschs Response to Indias Development and Growth through Employability Enhancement) is targeted at employing the youth in the service industry. From the present 125 centres across the country, it plans to take it to 200 centres.Nearly 7,500 people have graduated from this (BRIDGE) skilling programme over four years. Our long-term career-oriented training offered at the Bosch Vocational Center (BVC) has been Indianised over the years, and as of December 2016, around 3,500 individuals have passed out over these years, Bhattacharya said.Also, over the past two years, the company has developed a new training programme that focuses on producing high-quality skilled artisans, such as carpenters and electricians, in India.Mentoring startupsWith many companies starting either incubator or accelerator programmes, Bosch also jumped on the bandwagon recently, with the announcement of graduation of 13 startups from its first accelerator programme - Discover, Nurture and Accelerate (DNA).It said that startups create significant value, and India is one of the crucial hotspots. A proof of that is the variety of startups the Group is partnering with: from a team which converts soot (collected from a diesel generator) to printable ink using a proprietary liquid, to another team which provides customisable home automation solutions.Taking forward its vision, in future, Bosch Indias accelerator programme will increasingly look to collaborate with those who build technology solutions in areas such as IoT, deep learning, analytics, cloud, virtual reality and block chain.Wide presence in IndiaBosch Limiteds key manufacturing facilities are located at Bengaluru, Bidadi, Nashik, Jaipur, Gangaikondan, Oragadam near Chennai and Verna (Goa). In all, it operates 18 manufacturing facilities and seven development and application centres.Today, the company maintains its presence across sectors such as mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and building and energy technology, while manufacturing and trading products as diverse as diesel and gasoline fuel injection systems, automotive aftermarket products, special purpose machines, packaging machines, electric power tools, security systems, and industrial and consumer energy products and solutions.In 2016, Bosch earned revenues of over Rs 10,500 crore. Bosch Group employs roughly 3,90,000 associates worldwide (as of December 31, 2016).The Group in India employs over 31,000 associates, of which close to 18,500 work on areas relating to R&D."
5b2e84f29855b726401160a4,Being prepared,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/648745/being-prepared.html,2017-12-12,"Devaki was literally up with the lark that Sunday morning. She was of a cheerful disposition. As such, she was not one to grumble about rising early, especially on a holiday when most people lazed. There was a spring in her step, a lilt in her voice as she sang to herself, and a smile hovered about her lips.Briskly, she set about getting coffee for herself, the South Indian filter variety - just the way she liked it. She switched on the motor, started the Aquaguard and filled two jugs and six bottles of water to last for the day. Then, she loaded the washing machine. While that was doing its work, the milk was boiled and the decoction ready. She made herself a cup of the rich, creamy beverage and relished every drop. She had switched on the heater earlier, and the water now hot, she went in for her bath.When she had finished, she called out to her husband who entered the bathroom obediently. Then she said to her daughter, ""Gowri, go bathe."" Gowri, clearly unhappy about being hustled, grumbled about it being like Deepavali which Devaki wisely ignored. She reminded her son Venkatesh that his turn would be next. He retorted, ""I am not having a bath today."" Devaki said, ""Suit yourself.""She then set about preparing breakfast. Sunday special was idli with onion sambar and chutney or masala dosai with chutney. Today, it was idli-sambar-chutney. Everyone assembled and the family had a hearty breakfast followed by 'degree' coffee.Devaki told her children to clear and clean the table, and summoned her husband to help with lunch. That done, she announced, ""Now all of us can relax.""All these arrangements were because of an announcement in the newspaper the previous day. ""Maintenance work by the KEB will impact power supply between 11 am and 5 pm on Sunday.""Devaki collected the newspaper to read in a leisurely fashion, lying comfortably on her bed and solve the crossword puzzle. Gowri and Venkatesh opted to watch a film and the father retired to read a book in peace. The film was a long one and Devaki cautioned, ""Once the power is cut, you must stop watching the film.""""What's the UPS for?"" asked the duo, in unison. ""For emergencies!"" replied Devaki. But even after the film ended, the power supply had not been impacted.The family had a peaceful - relatively - lunch, rested and woke up for tea. Still, they continued to have power.""Did you check the date on the newspaper, amma?"" queried Gowri, with a sly smile.

As soon as the pan hit the heat, he added a generous portion of melted butter. Simultaneously (multitasking with much ease), he broke in a couple of eggs into a bowl, followed by an array of not-so-finely diced ingredients, and his secret ingredient black pepper. With an up-and-down as well as back-and-forth motion, he then beat the hell out of them until there was no strand of white or yellow.""This is going to be the perfect omelette,"" I thought to myself. After a long leave that I had happily sanctioned my cook, soon after which I fell sick, our kitchen had turned into a dismal wasteland. But the man of the house aimed to do something productive in the kitchen that day.But it was when the eggs produced a loud satisfying sizzle on the pan, that I critically questioned my insights. ""Wait a minute! Tell me you didn't tell me that you 'don't know how to cook'!"" I exclaimed. He smirked extravagantly wriggling his elbows and body, and then drawling to me he said, ""Don't know, yah.""After five years of sharing our lives, I had just come to terms with the fact that he's probably never going to make the kitchen a romantic place to be. And yet, here he was, regaling in harmony amid broken egg shells and inedible onion skins.Whilst I coughed away to glory, he gracefully plated up a perfect, bright-yellow, butter-doused omelette with a sprinkle of pepper and a burst of colourful veggies that looked warm, earthy and inviting.Unwittingly following the pattern of a triangle as we sat at the dining table, the three of us began consuming the omelette effectively. As my husband and I recounted the story of ""I don't know how to cook"" and laughed out loud, while also praising the newly discovered sneaky chef, it was obvious that our three-year-old daughter didn't like this kind of commotion at the table. She preferred her mother giving her the fullest attention. I then cut a perfect triangle and speared a morsel of omelette into her mouth and asked, ""Happy now?""Of course, while I can't say enough good things about our new chef's debut performance, one thing is certain. As Gloria Steinem puts it: ""Women are not going to be equal outside the home until men are equal in it.""So in her mortar when you swing a pestle, there, you can see Her fly across the evening sky."
5b2e93039855b72640116345,Make MSP legally binding,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/667222/make-msp-legally-binding.html,2017-12-12,"For over two weeks last month, farmers in Chhattisgarh's Durg district dumped tomatoes on to the streets. In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."

The harvesting is underway in one section and cultivation on the other simultaneously.Farmers in Nadupatti, Ambatturai, Kathiripatti, Kurumpatti, Kalikkampatti, Perumalkovilpatti, Settiyapatti and many other villages in Athoor union in Dindigul district, have been cultivating shallots for the past 20 years. Last year the drought had deterred many from taking up the cultivation and went for alternative crops instead. The lesser production early this year resulted in the price of shallots selling at a minimum price of Rs 80 per kilogram. It went up to Rs 120 per kilogram in June this year and has remained so till now.R K Palpandi of Nadupatti who has been cultivating shallots for the past 20 years says that the changing prices of the shallots had encouraged and discouraged some farmers to cultivate it. But, this year with fairly good rainfall and the ground having sufficient moisture, most of the traditional onion cultivators have started it again. He said that they had brought a kilogram of onion seed for Rs 150 and started cultivation. About 400 kilograms of seed is needed to cultivate onion in one acre of land. Mahendran of G Nadupatti, says that under ideal conditions, a kilogram of seeds will yield, 100 kilograms of onions.They had purchased the seeds from the seed centres in Perambalur and Thuraiyoor. He added that this crop gets ready for harvesting in about 70 to 90 days, and needs a lot of tending. They have to sprinkle pesticides thrice for a crop at regular intervals.This year the yield has been good, and they have started harvesting it and encouraged by the output, farmers like Shanmugam of Kurukkampatti have started cultivation and harvesting simultaneously as the present climatic conditions are conducive for these crops."

Eateries saddled with bags of the waste product can now turn them into a power source - the skin of a single onion can light up 12 green LEDs.Professor Bhanu Bhusan Khatua , his PhD scholar Sumanta Kuman Karan and their team at the Material Science Centre (MSC) have developed the green technology after a year-long research. The result has been tested and improved by scientists, led by Jin Kon Kim , at Pohang University of Science and Technology Postech ), South Korea . The paper was published in the Nano Energy journal in October.The researchers have applied for a patent on the technology which can be used in places where onions are used in bulk. ""The technology can be easily adopted at restaurants where a lot of onion peels are accumulated on a daily basis. Only, they end up in bins,"" said Khatua.His research found that only half-an-inch of an onion peel is enough to generate 20 volts. ""If you gather the peels of six onions and place them in a series, they can light-up 80 LEDs or charge your laptop or mobile phone,"" the scientist said.To make the system work, the user has to encapsulate the onion skin and fabricate the device - the size of an adhesive plaster. The device, called nanogenerator, must then be attached to mechanical or bio-mechanical energy sources to generate electricity.Nanogenerators convert kinetic energy created from vibrational and mechanical sources into electrical power, doing away with the need for external circuits or batteries. In scientific jargon, the devices are called bio-piezoelectric nanogenerators (BPNG). ""The fabricated nanogenerator will be capable of harvesting many kinds of mechanical energies, including body movements, wind flow and machine vibrations,"" said Khatua.""This is the first time that a nanogenerator has been designed using onion peel as the medium for generating electricity. Onion peels are bio-degradable and bio-waste material. Unlike other piezoelectric materials, they don't require pre-treatment or electrical polling. We just have to place the onion peel-based nanogenerator, connected with the smart electronic devices, under the mechanical or bio-mechanical energy sources,"" said Khatua.The electricity in the cellulose-based onion skin is produced as a result of structural changes in the cellulose under external mechanical stress or force, including movements as delicate as the touch of a finger or a heart pulse.""We are currently developing the technology for industrial and domestic application, and applying for its patent,"" Khatua added.""The onion skin used to fabricate the nanogenerators will keep on generating electricity until they are naturally destroyed,""he said. Since harvesting energy through human body movement (joint movement) is an emerging trend for smart applications, IIT-Kharagpur's effort to commercialize electricity generated from onion peel may go a long way in providing free power to rural India.""We look forward to the day onion skin-based bio-piezoelectric nanogenerators find applications in health care as a self-powered energy source for pacemakers or as a sensor for monitoring heart pulse,"" Khatua said."

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."
5b5088d89855b708a7ccca2f,Veggie buyers feel price pinch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/veggie-buyers-feel-price-pinch/articleshow/62060198.cms,2017-12-14,"BHOPAL: A steep hike in vegetables prices is leaving an unsettling effect on consumers home budget this winter. At this time of the season, a fresh and affordable stock of vegetables brings down the prices. But it does not look so for consumers this season. From traders to experts, nobody seems to have a definite answer for the spike. Some traders said monsoons played the spoilsport, some others heaped the blame on demonetisation and GST.With the onset of winter, when prices of vegetables are lower, consumers are shelling out as high as Rs 50 per kg for many vegetables. Take for example onions till the time of filing this report, the price of onion in the local markets for Rs 50-Rs 60 per kg, this when price hike has eased considerably. I purchased onions a few days ago for Rs 80, said Rajesh Kumar Saxena, a government official.Tomatoes were available at Rs 8-10 per kg last year. Till Tuesday evening, it was at steep Rs 60 per kg. On Wednesday, tomato prices somewhat cooled. Vendors say it will take at least a week to 10 days for prices to come down.WHAT THE VENDORS SAYDemonetisation effect could be the reason for this hike in tomato prices, say some vendors.Good quality tomatoes take 50-100 days to grow depending on the variety. Usually people begin sowing in May-June after the summer harvest. By winters, tomato is ready. However, this year there is less quantity of tomato this season. Small farmers who sell their produce directly in the market have been removed from the process this years, said Shri Kant, a local vegetable vendor in Bagsewani vegetable market, adding that there was a disruption in the production cycle induced by demonetisation.According to Abdul Raqib , president of Aloo Pyaaz Wholesaler Association , ill-timed monsoons resulted in wastage of many crops this year. The monsoon was unpredictable this year. There were no rains for better part of the monsoon season, but there were flash rains in the end. This lead to a crop failure in many parts which is why, there is less supply this season and more demand leading to push in prices. Raqib, however, said hike in tomato prices is likely to ease in coming days and have already seen a drop since Wednesday. The retail prices of vegetables are around 35-50% higher than the wholesale rate, due to wastage of perishable goods in winter. For example: The wholesale price of onion is Rs 30 per kg, whereas in market Rs 60.Other perishables like potatoes, cauliflower, peas, green onion, green leafy vegetable, pumpkin, brinjals are also seeing a price fluctuations because of the same. Vendors, however, say prices of seasonal vegetables will stabilise in the next two to three days.WHAT THE RESIDENTS SAYThis has been troubling Bhopalis as they have to make do without an essential vegetable in their winter platter. Tomatoes and onions are used in almost every Indian dish. These are essential products which cannot be substituted for anything else. This hike in prices upset my daily grocery budget, said Natasha Matani , an engineer, working with a private company. This pattern, however, is not limited to Bhopal alone, but is a nationwide phenomenon. According to government data, inflation based on consumer food price index rose to 4.42% from 1.90% a month ago and 2.03% a year ago, whereas vegetable prices have increased to 22.48% in November from 7.47% last month.This despite the fact that Madhya Pradesh saw a bumper onion crop this season.Some residents feel the government is also to be blamed for this. Every day we read in news that onion has been rotting in the open. In a country where people are still struggling for daily meals, government should have not let so much food get waste, said Matani. There were others who said that the administration should intervene as the prices are burning a hole in the pocket of common people. Maladministration and crop wastage lead to such a situation. The government should intervene to ensure easy distribution of vegetables in markets so that we do face loss due to poor administration, said Reeta Prakasham , an educationist.WHAT THE EXPERTS SAYAfter initial slim pickings of food crops in few months post-demonetisation, many farmers were forced to terminate their summer crop due to which there is shortage of tomato supply in the market this season. Experts say during this time last year with demonetisation, the sapped currency supply lead to sudden decrease in prices. The farmers needed money and traders did not have it, which is why they had to sell their products cheap which eventually lead to less sowing in the next season. The effect of which is becoming apparent this winter.B L Sharma, an economist in the Madhya Pradesh Planning Commission, says as the winter intensifies, prices of perishables will drop. Prices are expected to come down in coming few days after the winter intensifies. Perishables are dependent on weather and also on the demand supply gap. When demand goes up, vendors stock supplies to take advantage of it, further pushing prices.State horticulture director Satyanand said, The rise and fall in prices is due to market forces, which balance themselves on their own. When there is a gap between harvest and sowing new crop, this problem comes up, which will get solved as soon as the new stock arrives.However, there are many, who blame demonetisation and GST for the same. Indias perishable market is a cash-based mandi dependent system. Even though cash has come back in overall circulation, it is yet to be efficiently circulated in the mandis. Over a year has gone by, but payments are still being done in cashless method, which is not convenient to small and medium farmers, said an expert seeking anonymity.The surge in prices is also due to delay in reaction to the supply and demand. Due to disturbed production of perishable goods this year, the market is not very flexible to demand and supply changes this year. For example, if demand increases for a vegetable, it will take time for market forces to adjust themselves to accommodate the rise in demand with the supply, since the mandis and wholesale markets are still not running efficiently as compared to previous years, the expert said, adding that another week might give the market enough time to adjust with the demand leading to a stable rate."

The retail price, however, has remained more unchanged.While green peas prices have spiraled to Rs 40-45/kg in wholesale market from Rs 25 on Wednesday, pushing the retail price to Rs 70-80/kg from the earlier Rs 50-60, the low supply of capsicum from Palghar due to the recent unseasonal rain has pushed up the wholesale rates to Rs 30-35 a kg from 25-30. Capsicum is currently retailed at Rs 60-70/kg from Rs 50-60 earlier.However, tomato prices have dropped to Rs 20 from Rs 25-30/kg in the wholesale market, bringing down the retail price too to Rs 40-50/kg from Rs 50-60 on Wednesday. It was sold at Rs 40-55 in Andheri.Onion prices rose in wholesale market despite the arrival of 125 trucks on Thursday, said potato-onion wholesale trader Ashok Walunj. APMC received just 30 trucks on Wednesday as against 110 trucks on Tuesday. However, the prices had remained unchanged with poor turnout of retailers. The rates are expected rise further and then stabilize in the next couple of weeks. While red onions were retailed at Rs 45-50/kg at Andheri-Versova, old onions were sold at Rs 55-60.Experts say the recent showers may have affected the quality of onions. Even a days non-seasonal rain can cause a lot of damage to the crop that is being harvested. The quantum is yet to be ascertained; a clear picture will emerge by next week, said Manohar Totlani, a trader. The harvest may get delayed by almost a week due to wet ground conditions, where farmers avoid collecting the crop.Early this week, wholesale onion prices had dropped to Rs 25-30/kg from Rs 30-35, attributing to arrival of fresh crop armed with the Centres cap on export by raising the minimum export price. But after the unseasonal showers on Monday and Tuesday, the prices have shot up yet again. Vegetable prices will remain uncertain till this weekend. The picture will be clear by Monday when the quantum of damage crop is expected to come to fore, said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.Mumbaikars are worried about the rising prices. Kandivli resident Abhijeet Thakur said, There has been no relief from expensive vegetables for the last few months. We have reduced the quantity to adjust the kitchen budget. The prices of other vegetables have remained mostly unchanged despite only 450 truckloads arriving in the APMC compared to the usual supply of 500-600 trucks. After a spell of inflation, vegetable prices were normalizing, but rain played spoilsport. A small bundle of coriander costs Rs 20 against the earlier Rs 10, said Mahim resident Rekha Sharma."
