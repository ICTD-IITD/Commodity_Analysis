Born and raised in Kumbakonam, catering has been her family business for many years. Sambar and rasam run in my genes. Cooking is like yoga, it gives me peace of mind, says Prema mami, as she is fondly called. It is this dedicated hobby and love for food that has turned into a full-time profession. And Prema mami has a specific mission too. People should know that there is lot to offer in vegetarian Tamil cuisine, too,she says.Premas husband is also a chef. He used to work as a senior chef at a five-star hotel in Dubai. My husbands way of thinking is different from mine. I focus more on the homemade traditional recipes but I also like cooking North Indian and Chinese items, says Prema. Her daughters too draw inspiration from their mothers cooking, and continue to experiment interesting varieties on a daily basis, with her inputs.Prema cooked her first dish, the humble onion uthappam, when she was 10. For the last four years, Prema has been catering food in the US, and in Muscat for three years. Recollecting these experiences, Prema shares, Cooking for international crowd was special. They love homemade food. So they crave for anything fresh and not preheated. I make sure there is a balance in spices, oil and ghee so that you feel light after the meal.Prema is in the city presently, for the annual Mylai Mami Samayal Food Festival, for the fourth time. The spread of 26 varieties starts with panagam (a summer health drink) and has a blend of variety rice, kuzhambu (curries), poriyal (vegetables), sweets like godhumai halwa (wheat), and wraps up with neer mor (buttermilk). We come during vacations to ensure that kids get a taste of these forgotten Tamil vegetarian recipes. Its not often that we make kodamilagai thayir pachadi (capsicum and curd salad) or kathirikai (brinjal) podi curry. I will be making Kanchipuram idli and alwar dosa this time, she shares.Premas dishes dont have garlic or onion. She plans to write a book soon.Morkali with Vathal kuzhambu (A Must-try combination)Ingredients Rice flour: 1 cup  Curd: 2 cups  To saute: Mustard, urud dal and mor mozhaga.(Green chilli soaked in buttermilk or curd for many days and deep fried)Instructions Heat coconut oil and then add mustard, mor mozhaga and urad dal.

This mango season treat yourself to the ongoing mango festival 'Aamlicious' at Khandani Rajdhani chain of restaurants spread over 27 cities in India and one in the Middle East. Rajdhani is known for its king size thali of Guajarati cuisine that they serve to their customers. This mango season, be ready to witness the riot of flavours, spices and celebration of senses that lingers for days. The Aamlicious festival will end on May 31, across the country.I was lucky enough to witness and enjoy their Aamlicious thali at Indiranagar branch. As welcome drinks, they served us with two refreshing drinks, one being the kairi panna, a raw mango based tangy drink. It was sweet, savour and salty and had a touch of Jeera, which was very well balanced. The other one being the mango thandai, a concoction of riped mango, a handful of rich Pista and badam. This drink was more on a heavier side and truly rich in flavours. Next up, they started with serving four varieties of chutney - kairi onion chutney, kairi coconut chutney, green chutney and chunda mango chutney. The chutney had a sour yet tangy taste to it.The waiters then quickly kept filling the thali with a number of items. The mango corn bhel and kacchi kairi khichiya chat were a relish to eat and the crispy bhel and tangy mango syrup was also a delight. After this, they started to serve the main dishes, which consisted of 20 varieties of items. One of their speciality is the aam dal dhokli, which was prepared with normal dal, with a touch of raw mango and the special Gujarat dhokli. It had the correct amount of spice with a touch of tanginess from the raw mango. The special roti they had prepared was the kairi maithi thelpa. It wasnt the regular thepla which is usually prepared, but it had a taste of raw mango in it, with dollops of butter and pure ghee. Fajito khadi was another dish that grabbed my attention instantly, khadi as we eat is the normal khadi with pakoda, but this particular one had riped mango flavour which made it a sweet khadi.The thali consisted of not only mango based dishes but were accompanied with their regular dishes like, parwal ki subji, paneer ki subji and the Gujarati dal. Their aim was not to make the whole platter mango-based, as that would stop the customer from eating more. Hence, they stayed with the idea of keeping regular dishes. The dhoklas werent as exciting as the other items, as it did not stand up to the mango flavour.No meal can be complete without desserts. One more brilliant surprise was waiting to be tasted which was the hapus jalebi. This was nothing like the regular round jalebi. It was prepared by dipping small pieces of mango into the jalebi batter and deep fried until golden brown. As you take your first bite, the concoction of mango and sugar syrup takes you to another world of satisfaction. Indeed a good way to finish a meal.Recommended dishes: aam dal dhokli, kairi panna, hapus jalebi, aam ki subji aur pyaz, kacchi kairi khichiya chaat. Overall rating -4/5."

Two persons have been arrested so far.ADG (Narcotics) Varun Kapoor said, Use of codine laced cough syrup is prevalent in the North East, where it is used as a substitute for hard drugs, but this is the first time that we have come to know that Madhya Pradesh and especially Indore has become the transportation hub for these drugs.Officials said they seized these bottles from a truck being used for transporting the bottles and also from a godown in Lasudia area of Indore where it had been stored. These syrups had been sourced from a factory in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, then stored in the godown in Indore, from where it was being transported to North East.The cough syrups had been cleverly hidden behind sacks of onion and potato in the truck seized by the narcotics wing on April 9. Initially the police arrested the truck driver Mohanlal Pathak (54) resident of Indore. On the basis of information provided by him, police arrested Ranjan Shukla (29) also resident of Indore, who had loaded the truck from the godown. However, another crucial link, Manish Bhaskar, owner of Anmol Medical Store, who had rented the godown in his name is absconding.ADG Kapoor says that the investigations are still in a preliminary stage, but from the interrogation of the two accused we have come to know that smuggling had been going on for the past two years from Indore which is a major pharmaceutical manufacturing and transportation hub."

He says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein April and then quit farming. Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were The loan waiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using Aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameter The system was hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with Aadhaar accounts more than Rs 1.5 lakh and a cash incentive of Rs 25,000 for those who repaid loans on timewaiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using Aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameterwas hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with Aadhaar accounts So far, the government has disbursed Rs 13,580 crore to 3.532 million farmers accounts; 7.7 million farmers applied for the loan waiver and around 4.652 million were found eligible for the various components. Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said."

Raje arrived in Sikar Firday on a four-day visit.The farmers in Rajasthan are up in arms against the government over its failure to procure Rabi crops at minimum support price (MSP). While the state government has made arrangements to procure major crops, including wheat, at MSP, farmers union have alleged that the designated centers for wheat were too less and it was not possible for those living in remote villages to access them.Apart from wheat, farmers are also being forced to sell other crops such as mustard and chana (gram/ chick pea) at below MSP, according to the union leaders.As against MSP of 4,000 per quintal, farmers are selling mustard at Rs 3,500. The situation is worse for chana. It is being sold at Rs 3,000-Rs 3,500 per quintal while the MSP was set at Rs 4,400. The MSP for wheat is Rs 1,735 per quintal, but at most mandis farmers are selling it for Rs 1,500, Kisan Mahapanchayat leader Rampal Jat said. We plan to gherao the chief minister during her visit to Sri Madhopur on April 9, he added.On April 3, police had detained Jat along with about 50 other farmers when they were trying to march to chief ministers residence in Civil Lines area.The farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) are holding demonstrations at mandis in Kota district to protest steep fall in the prices of garlic. In Sikar, farmers are holding protest against steep fall in onion prices.Wheat is being purchased at MSP by Food Corporation of India (FCI) at 207 designated centers in Rajasthan. It is up to the farmers to sell the wheat at designated centers, a state agriculture department official said requesting anonymity.Jat, however, said that FCI procures crops during a 90-day period and it was not possible for farmers from more than 45,000 villages across Rajasthan to access 207 centers. So they are forced to sell their produce below the MSP at nearby mandis. In addition, farmers are getting only Rs 1,200 for jowar against the MSP of 1,425, he said.Other farmer unions are also unhappy. In February, AIKS leader Amra Ram had spent four days in jail after he attempted to lead a farmers protest march to the Rajasthan assembly. On February 22, Rajasthan Police had arrested 179 farmers from different locations and detained around another 2,000 who were marching to Jaipur to stage a sit-in outside the assembly that was in session."
5aeaa5309855b73f522c19c4,2019 polls will be fought on farmers’ issues: Maharashtra MP Raju Shetti,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/2019-polls-will-be-fought-on-farmers-issues-swabhimani-pakhsha-mp-raju-shetti-5119014/,2018-04-01,"The Bills, which will be introduced as Private Members Bills by Swabhimani Pakhsha MP Raju Shetti (above) and CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh. The Bills, which will be introduced as Private Members Bills by Swabhimani Pakhsha MP Raju Shetti (above) and CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh.Earlier this week, leaders from more than 30 major opposition parties had assembled in the national capital, at the invitation of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), to deliberate over two Bills that the committee had prepared. The Bills, which will be introduced as Private Members Bills by Swabhimani Pakhsha MP Raju Shetti and CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh, call for a complete loan waiver for farmers and farmers right to guaranteed remunerative minimum support price for agricultural produce.Both the Bills came about after deliberation between 193 farmers organisations. Shetti, a two-time MP from Kolhapurs Hatkhanagale constituency, spoke to Partha Sarathi Biswas about ongoing efforts towards building a farmers vote bankWhat is the significance of the whole opposition coming together for farmers causes, and is this the first time such a mobilisation has happened?Attempts to create a political consensus around agrarian issues have been made in the past, but such efforts were not successful. The creation of a vote bank, or even political dialogue, around the subject is difficult for many reasons. In India, the fragmentation of farmers is myriad, and it is difficult for them to come together. Taking advantage of this, political parties have, so far, refused to address farmers as a single unit or a vote bank, and instead, kept them divided on the lines of caste, creed and region, among others.For the political leadership, the angst of the consumer is more important than the distress of the farmer for the simple reason that the former is united. For example, if prices of onions cross a certain threshold, then consumers from Kashmir to Kanyakumari will be united, but the same will not be the case if wholesale prices of onions fall. Then, only the onion grower would become vocal. This lack of cohesion between the growers is a major hurdle for the formation of a farmers vote bank, or for political parties to take up agrarian issues at the national level. So, this would be the first time that all farmers leaders have come together on the same platform and compelled political parties to listen. In the run-up to the 2014 general elections, issues like black money and corruption were on the agenda, but the 2019 elections will be fought on farmers issues.How was this unity achieved? What were the common causes that made the farmers unite?Under the banner of AIKSCC, farmers leaders have been working towards getting all farmers together on common issues. The task was challenging, given the deep and often rigid differences. Our committee had representation from groups who were opposed to globalisation, as well as from groups that welcomed it. During discussions, two points emerged on which all of us agreed: The demand for complete loan waiver for farmers and the implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions recommendations, which assured remunerations equal to 1.5 times the production cost. During discussions, farmer leaders came to the conclusion that the present indebtedness was due to poor prices. So, till remunerative returns are assured, we will not be free of the vicious cycle of unending loans. The incidents of farmers being shot dead at Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, had also acted as a clarion call for all farmers leaders to forget their differences and join forces. We understood that if we remained fragmented, we would not be able to get justice for our cause.Our demand for loan waiver is based on facts. Recently, the government has announced the Seventh Pay Commission, and government servants were to get arrears as well. In our case, the farmers are in debt as they have not been able to get remunerative prices. The recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission were given in 2005, but not a single government has implemented them. So, farmers are asking for a complete loan waiver.Why were only opposition leaders invited for the discussions? What is the next step?Our movement is for farmers, and we will go with any political party which assures us of meeting our two main demands. In a democratic set up, the present day opposition party is the future government, and thus, we need to maintain a dialogue with them to ensure our demands are met. The present government has, unfortunately, let farmers down, and we cannot believe them till they directly implement our suggestions.How will you keep the momentum of the movement going till the elections?In Maharashtra, I will soon embark on a state-wide yatra to raise awareness amongst farmers. With prices of each and every commodity at an all-time low, we will be talking to farmers and telling them not to get disheartened. We will tell our farmers that we are trying to create a viable alternative to the BJP, and that they should support us. At this hour of need, we will tell them to be with us and not to take the extreme step of committing suicide.Farmers leaders have realised that while we are not strong enough to form a government, we can play the crucial role of a pivot, and swing the balance of power. All our efforts will now be directed towards strengthening that role.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

They came in a fleet of lumbering tractors, around 80,000 peasants, cattle, hay to be used as bedding and foodgrains to see them through an unrelenting protest.It was the scene of a spectacular rural takeover of Delhi. Tens of thousands of farmers erected tents, slept, cooked food and ate in the open as well as defecated there, laying siege to the Boat Club lawns, a stones throw from Parliament. They vowed to not budge until their demands for higher sugarcane prices and a waiver of electricity charges were met.Tikaits Bhartiya Kisan Union successfully extracted key concessions from the then Rajiv Gandhi-led government.Farm protests have seldom been so strong, but in Maharashtra in March, 35,000 farmers walked 180 km on a long march to reach Mumbai from the states Nashik district seeking loan waivers  a turnout not seen since the days of Tikaits agitation.Farm loan waivers have now become the new rallying point for farmers movement because there are just losses, losses everywhere, says Amra Ram, a leader of the All-India Kisan Sabha, the organisation that led the long march.Under the NDA government, farmers havent fared too well due to a combination of factors, including two successive droughts and a slump in global food prices. This has led farmers groups and lobbies to re-energise themselves around two key demands  loan waivers and profitable prices.Dont call it a protest. Ours is a political movement of farmers, says Kedar Sirohi, the Indore-based social-media savvy leader of the Aam Kisan Union (General Farmers Union).Before Tikait, there was another tall peasant leader in Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP). His biographer Paul Brass, a professor at the University of Washington, writes in An Indian Political Life that Charan Singh was devoted throughout his political career to the interests of the peasantry.According to Brass, Singh, a known detractor of Nehru, sowed the seeds of a strong farmers lobby in north India by first dissenting against the Congress 1959 Nagpur Resolution on Agriculture, which advocated collectivisation and a cooperative model for the farm sector.The Nagpur Resolution was the most significant agrarian programme formulated by the Congress since the abolition of zamindari in several States, wrote Walter Hauser in a January 1959 piece in The Economic and Political Weekly, analysing Singhs role. Singh contended that cooperatives will lead to bigness and that this, with mechanized agriculture, would result in a decrease in per capita production rather than an increase, Hauser writes.Building on his peasant support base, Charan Singh went on to become prime minister.Read: Agriculture not always a dead end: Here are young, successful farmers who made the cutThe green revolution of 1960s saw farmers prosper and emerge as a class of bullock capitalists, a term coined by American political scientists Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susan Rudolph to describe the empowered Indian agrarian class. Bullock capitalists were well-to-do enough to raise their voice politically, but werent fully capitalist farmers, the Rudolphs logic went.This was followed by the rise of powerful farmer organisations. These included Rajya Ryot Sangha in Karnataka, the Bharatiya Kisan Union in UP and Punjab as well as the Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association in Tamil Nadu and the Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra.A new era of social-media-enabled farm movement has now taken over.As it heads into a crucial general election due next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised a slew of measures to quell farmer protests, including prices that are at least 50% over production costs.The Congress has promised a fresh loan waiver if voted to power like the one it announced in 2008 (and which played a part in its return to power in 2009).The BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Congress-ruled Punjab have already announced loan waivers, forced by protests.Maharashtra (also ruled by the BJP) did so too.Loan waivers are a pressing demand because the single biggest cause of agrarian distress is indebtedness. Farmers take loans to buy inputs such as seeds and irrigation machinery. Many of these farmers get into debt traps when crops fail or prices fall.The Situation Assessment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO, 2013) has reconfirmed the situation analysed in 2003 by the NSSOs 59th round of indebtedness of farm households. It showed that 52% of farm households in India are in debt.Loan waivers could have a bearing on the combined fiscal deficit of states. According to India Ratings and Research, farm debt waivers announced by five states together are likely to widen the combined fiscal deficit of states by ?107700 crore. Bankers have argued against farm loan waivers because they are no panacea and could affect credit growth.According to Reserve Bank of India data, bad loans in agriculture have increased by ?11,400-crore in 2017 to over ?60,000 crore, a jump of 23%, from 2016.From 2012-13, the year before the BJP government took office, till 2016-17, bad loans in the agriculture sector have increased 142.74%. The biggest defaults were during in 2016-17, suggesting a worsening of agrarian distress.RBI data further shows that compared to 20.83% defaults by corporate borrowers, defaults by farmers stood at only 6% of their total outstanding.This shows that farmers dont willfully default. Why dont they catch the bigger thieves? asks Ram of the All India Kisan Sabha.Agricultural economist AV Manjunatha of the Bangalore-based Institute of Social and Economic Change, who carried out an all-India study on farmer suicides, says farmers in real distress do need some sort of system to report distress. They also need facilities to negotiate loan restructuring. These could be adopted as policy solutions, he said.A new phase of farmers mobilisation has put both state and central governments on a tight leash. Reforms in markets and other structural measures for a better farming future dont appeal as much as loan waivers.They put my land on notice for auction. Its the only thing I have. Only a loan waiver can save me, says Tulchha Ram, an onion grower from Rajasthan Sikars district."

In Chennai, the price is ruling at Rs 45/kg, as per the official data. A similar trend prevails in small cities as well.""It is a temporary phase. Traders are taking advantage of the temporary ups and downs. But the fundamentals are strong,"" Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak told PTI.Though the onion crop is estimated to be slightly lower in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) but the total production would be sufficient to meet the domestic requirement, he said.As per the Agriculture Ministry's data, the country's onion production is estimated to decline by 4.5 per cent to 21.4 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year due to lower acreage as against 22.4 million tonnes last year.Pattanayak said the prices of onion will get corrected with the increase in arrival of the crop in the coming days.Nasik-based National Horticultural Research And Development Foundation (NHRDF) acting Director P K Gupta said, ""The arrival of the Kharif onion is less at present and therefore prices are under pressure. The arrivals are expected to improve by end of the month and the prices will accordingly get corrected."" The kharif onion output is expected to be lower as acreage was down by 20-25 per cent because of less rains during the sowing period in key growing states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he said.Once the kharif arrival and later rabi onion crop hits the market, the retail price situation will automatically improve, he added."

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."

What is surprising is that the consumers are not protesting when the Government machinery has failed to control the soaring price by cracking down on unscrupulous traders, general secretary of Odisha Byabasai Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said. Since the Government is keeping a tab on the prices of essential commodities on daily basis, it is their look out to ensure that commodities are made available to the consumers at reasonable prices at retails points.The market intelligence wing of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has the responsibility to impose stock limits on onion and crack down on hoarding. But nothing is happening for obvious reasons, he rued.Ideally, onion should be sold at Rs 40 a kg in the retail market as a margin of Rs 5 per kg is enough for the retailers to make a good profit, said Shakti Shankar Mishra, seceratry of the Aeiginia Potato Merchants Association.The source price of onion, Nasik in Maharashtra being the major supplier of the vegetable, is ruling high due to shortfall in production in Andhra Pradesh and Karanatak, the two other States which also meet Odishas demand. The onion production has fallen short by 8 to 10 per cent due to unseasonal rains in major producing States including Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh. The production of the vegetable this year is about 22 million tonne as against 24 million tonne last year, Panda said adding, the prices will cool down after arrival of the new harvest.While the daily requirement of edible bulb in the State is about 1,500 tonnes, there is a short supply of about 200-300 tonnes. Bhubaneswar, one of the major mandis of the State, is getting a normal supply of about 150 tonne every day, Mishra said."

The farmers demanded crop loan waiver and purchase of crops at minimum support price, among others. The state government later waived farm loans up to Rs 50,000, and started the process to procure crops at MSP.Sikar district is a hub of onion cultivation in Rajasthan and this year the production is expected to be about 4.50 to 5 lakh metric tonnes as against states total output of 12.80 lakh metric tonnes. There are about 50,000 onion growers in the region.With farmers not getting reasonable prices for onion, many of them have dumped the produce at Sikar mandi as they await buyers, AIKS leaders said.As against the price of Rs 10-12 per kg two weeks ago, the farmers are now getting Rs 3-4 per kg at the krishi upaj mandi, AIKS leader Amra Ram said. At times, there are no buyers at even these prices. The input cost for growing onions is about Rs 8 per kg.Officials said prices crash whenever there is a glut in the market and will pick up soon. This year the onion cultivation area in Sikar district is estimated at 13,000 to 14,000 hectares while the yield is 350 quintals per hectare. The prices crash whenever there is a glut, but will recover when the supply to other states pick up, said B S Yadav, Sikar assistant director, horticulture.Onion production in Rajasthan in 2017-18 has been estimated at 1.28 million tonnes. The state contributes about 6% of Indias onion production estimated at 21.4 million tonnes in 2017-18.Only a few days ago, onions were selling at Rs 10 kg and then fell to Rs 7, and now to Rs 5. We are not able to recover our input cost that is about Rs 8 per kg, said Satyajit Bithare, a farmer in Rasidpura village.The governments move to build an exclusive onion mandi at Rasidpura village in Sikar has been delayed. The other major onion hub in the state is Nagaur where the onion prices have also crashed.Prices at Maharashtras Lasalgaon mandi near Nashik, have also crashed with rising arrivals, but are ruling higher than what the farmers are getting in Sikar.Prices rose after last August, with delay in kharif crop arrivals and estimates of lower production in 2017-18 by one million tonne. After peaking in January first week, the prices have fallen since."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP). There is no demand from the outside markets, said Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter at Nashiks wholesale market.

Eggs Kejriwal acquired its name because one of the members, a Mr Kejriwal, was not allowed eggs at home and would relish them cooked in his favourite style at the Club.Other members would describe the dish to the stewards as get me eggs the same way as Kejriwal likes them, informs foodie and funny man Kunal Vijayakar, a veteran of many club meals. The Bombay Gym had a dish named after Jean Manekshaw, a Parsi-French member; and one of the most popular dishes on the menu of Ambassadors Society was its Steak Fernandes, named after its famous chef.What dish would Vijayakar like to have named after himself given the chance? Going by my favourite, it would have to be a Bhujne Kunal Vijayakar. It is fish prepared in garlic and onion, with haldi, chilly and garam masala in the Pathare Prabhu style, says the scion of the traditional Maharashtrian clan, known for its nuanced cuisine.Kunal Vijaykar (HT File )Incidentally, friends of Mehta were bemused that the charismatic conductor had been ascribed with the pomfret preparation. As far as I know, he never spent time at the club during his Mumbai days and his favourite dishes are Goan fish curry and eggs Akuri, said one.Which is what makes this a fishy tale.True LiesStories of corruption amongst the high and mighty often make ones skin crawl, but none comes close to the alleged brazenness of this once-powerful CM, now enjoying just desserts in prison.A visiting American former head of a large MNC recently in India narrated this incident: A deal and an MoU was signed almost a decade ago between his firm and the CMs government. It was known that the firm would earn huge profits from this. The executive was flown down to ink the deal and get a photo op with the CM.When his plane stopped in Dubai for a layover, an Indian bureaucrat boarded and sat next to him, introducing himself as one of the CMs aides, and wasted no time before asking for a bribe. When the exec said his firm did not entertain such deals, the aide told him he had two hours before they landed in India to come up with an offer or the deal was off. Not taking it seriously, the exec proceeded the next day for the signing, only to find the state representatives hadnt showed up.He was told the deal was off and was asked to take the next flight back to the US. The story doesnt end there; so enraged were his principals back home that a few months later he was sacked.

The farms floor is iridescent-green and spongy as you walk it. Its actually a month-old black gram or channa crop. Ram risks losing this bucolic haven measuring 3.72 hectares to his creditors.A loan of Rs 3 lakh taken on Kisan Credit Card from the Punjab National Banks Badalwas branch in Sikar district turned into a Rs 4.5 lakh monster after repeated defaults.It was like a noose around my neck, he says, showing off a notice issued on February 9, 2017 from a local official in Dhod tehsil to auction his land to the highest bidder. An auction fee of 5% was also added to the outstanding. Then, the bidding took place.One-third of the total land holding  which is Rams share in the family property -- was auctioned at Rs 18 lakh to the highest bidder, Nandlal Chawla from a neighbouring town.Just as the auction proceedings were being closed, Ram showed up to pay the debt. He had collected the outstanding by begging and borrowing from everyone he could ask for help. Effectively, that was a loan to repay another loan. At the behest of local elders, the auction was reversed, he says.Ram isnt off the hook yet. Now, I worry about paying all these creditors who helped me save my land from Punjab National Bank, he says.Farmers in many states have got into precisely these sorts of debt traps  a generic problem caused by high costs of cultivation and falling returns from agriculture. In state after state, governments have succumbed to pressure and waived off farm loans or are considering doing so. Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka have waived off loans, or partially written off loans, or part of the interests.On February 12, Rajasthan announced it would partially write off loans owed by small and marginal farmers worth Rs 8000 crore. Its decision was forced by an 11-day protest by farmers in Sikar, 200 km from capital Jaipur from September 1-13 2017, last year.History shows that an agitation launched from Sikar never fails. It has always spelt trouble for governments. It is a revolutionary place, says Amra Ram, the leader of All-India Kisan Sabha, who led the agitation. The siege was intense. Highways were blocked. Traders shuttered shops and transactions in the Sikar farmers market ground to a halt. Thousands from all over the politically influential Shekhawati region  comprising the three big districts of Churu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu  joined in. Amra Ram says the loan waiver will cover only 2% of the farmers caught in debt traps.In 2000, the Kisan Sabha forced the government to release more power to farms. In 2015, it forced the then government to roll back electricity tariff hike after a 15-day protest, just like it forced the current government to defer a decision to raise rural electrify prices in 2016.What made last years agitation successful was that everybody joined us, even local DJs, with their fan following, says Ram Ratan, a prominent farm leader from Sikar. DJs bring to mind hip jockeys in city nightclubs, but in the Shekhawati region, they are local Jat youth who play ear-numbing music in local marriages, religious festivals, birthdays and other rural events from atop specially modified pickup trucks. When harvests are good, they make good money. When onion prices crashed in Sikar  the biggest growing district in Rajasthan  even DJs were without business.The Rajasthan governments loan waiver, limited to small and marginal farmers, is a follow up on an agreement it had signed with protesting Sikar farmers.It promises to pay off Rs 50,000 of each small farmers total outstanding on short-duration loans taken from cooperative banks. The first test of whether this has managed to placate farmers took place on February 22. The main farmers body that staged the massive agitation last year, forcing the government to accept its demands, called for a similar agitation on that day. It believed the waiver wasnt enough because it takes care of just 1 of its 11 demands. Its major demands were a total loan waiver, not partial, of all categories of farmers and a complete freeing up of cattle trade in the state.Despite a loan waiver, hundreds of farmers blocked the Bikaner-Agra national highway 52 near Sikar town on Thursday. Two days ago, the government arrested the national secretary of Kisan Sabha, Amra Ram and his colleague Pema Ram, to pre-empt the protests. Our leaders were arrested when they were on a padyatra (protest march) in Jaipur, Ratan, their colleague said.With elections due later this year in the state, the government is watching the farm sector closely.We need to understand that Rajasthan is neither Gujarat, nor Maharashtra. Rajasthans economy is mostly about tourism, mines and agriculture. I dont think disruption from policies such as the Goods and Services Tax is an issue here unlike in Gujarat, which is a textile hub, says Prof. Sanjay Lodha of Udaipurs Mohanlal Sukhadia University. The plight of farmers is because they havent been getting good prices, Lodha says.Just a few years ago, things were smooth-sailing. The rough patch in Rajasthans agriculture began roughly four years ago. Incredibly, a fracking boom in faraway US -- which saw a surge in natural gas production to offset rising oil prices -- brought prosperity to Rajasthans poorest farmers.Fracking is a method of extracting shale gas by pumping high-pressured gas into the ground, which requires a processed powder called guar gum made from guar (cluster beans). Rajasthan is Indias largest gaur producer, with a share of 84% in national output. At its peak, the total export value of Indias guar gum  most of it from Rajasthan  rose to Rs 21,287 crore from about Rs 121 crore in 2003-04. In 2016-17, this came down to just Rs 3,106.62, an 85% fall.The boom ended but farmers got used to better lifestyles. They bought cars, tractors and jewellery. The boom was over in 2012-13. What followed were two years of drought beginning 2014-15. Farmers were already in distress. They got angry when they heard the government was going to increase power tariffs, says retired bureaucrat Shankarlal Choudhury.The pastoral economy has also been hit by self-styled cow vigilantes.Laxman Singh, a livestock farmer in Dujod village, says income from cattle trade has dwindled because of cow vigilantism. Milch cattle were like ATMs. If I need money, I just sell them. Theres hardly any buyer now, he said. The government has tried to do its bit. Agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini says the government procured pulses, soyabean and peanuts worth Rs 2,800 crore at minimum support prices.Rajasthan has also promised 6 months of free cow feed to cow shelters worth Rs 50 crore and help set up biogas plants in 25 identified large gaushalas with a subsidy of Rs 40 lakh for each. It is banking on these measures ahead of the crucial poll that will decide the fate of the Vasundhara Raje-led government.The farmers are still unhappy lot. There are stuck on a demand for a total loan waiver. Ratan says he and others have forcibly put off auctioning of 122 land-holdings in Sikar, none of which will be benefit from the current loan waiver because they arent small farmers."
5aeacfcd9855b73f522c38e7,Low demand and ample supply: Chances of price recovery bleak for tur growers,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/low-demand-and-ample-supply-chances-of-price-recovery-bleak-for-tur-growers-5070634/,2018-02-20,"Tur continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. (Photo for representation) Tur continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. (Photo for representation)There is no respite for tur growers from the vicious cycle of low prices this year as the pulse continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. Huge carry-forward stock and absence of price parity in the export market, analysts said, would almost kill any chances of prices firming up later in the year. Like tur, chana whose harvest has started also faces a dim price prospect because of a bumper crop.Tur, a major kharif crop in the arid regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha, had slid way below its MSP last year because of a bumper yield. While the central and state government had waded in the procure tur at the MSP, the process was riddled with allegations of corruption at various levels. The price of the pulse has been well below MSP levels even before it started arriving in the markets. This despite a 20 per cent reduction in area of tur in the state for the kharif season of 2017-18.Maharashtra has reported 12.19 lakh hectares of tur cultivation in 2017-18 as compared to 15.32 lakh hectares in 2016-17. State government estimates say Maharashtra will produce around 9.83 lakh tonnes of tur this year. In view of the continuing low prices, Nafed through its agencies  the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation (VCMF)  has started more than 180 procurement centres.Till about last week, the State Cooperative Marketing Federation had reported procurement of over 1 lakh quintals of tur. This year, the state is set to see more than 4.8 lakh tonnes of procurement under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). However, prices in the wholesale markets continue to be much lower than the declared MSP. At Laturs wholesale market, which sets the national trend for the pulse, the price is hovering between Rs 4,385-4,400 a quintal.Trade sources said chances of prices rising in the future were remote as the country has already 9 lakh tonnes of tur procured last year. To add to this stock, around 80,000 quintals of imported tur is lying unutilised in the godowns of importers. The state marketing federation has over 1 lakh tonnes of tur it procured last year. This the government is now releasing into the market for milling and offloading the daal in the open market.Traders said this would keep prices low in the months to come. Chances of export, market sources said, are dim given the Indian produce lacks price parity in the international market. Nitin Kalantri, CEO of Latur-based Kalantri Foods, called for steps to increase the demand for pulses. The government should include pulses in the mid-day meals and also take up campaigns to increase consumption of pulses by people, he said.An increase in demand will create newer avenues for the commodity and thus help firm up prices in the wholesale market. Similarly agro-analyst Deepak Chavan called for a five-point programme to increase consumption of pulses and help farmers get assured returns. Chavan suggested the inclusion of the old stock in the public distribution system as well as other government-run schemes like mid-day meals. Chavan too called for a campaign to help increase the consumption of pulses among the general public.At the farm gate-level, the government should take up projects to build small pulses godowns which will allow the farmer to store his produce, he said. Such on-field storage structures, Chavan said, has helped onion growers in Nashik to store their produce and offload it at better prices. Banks should provide finance for such structures, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

He was expecting to earn Rs1.40 lakh from his yield of 35 quintals of wheat from the standing crops. The hailstorm, that lasted for just 10 minutes, ruined all his hopes as the crop was smashed to ground. Days before, his cotton was attacked by the pink bollworm that resulted in the loss of Rs3.50 lakh that he was expecting from the crop. He says he has been hit by natural calamities consecutively for past few years.With satisfactory rains in past two years, I was expecting to make up for the losses I incurred during the drought years. For last two years, it has been either unseasonal rains or hailstorm that has been destroying our standing crops. Delayed rains last year had damaged Kharip and rabi crops of soyabean, pulses, and wheat, among others. The insurance cover given by the state does not work, as many farmers have not taken cover due to the bad experience over past few years. Few crops such as grape are not eligible for the insurance cover, as its area under cultivation at the block level is below the average of the insurance parameter, said Raghunath Golde, a farmer from Revgaon in Jalna district.Malhari Pathade, a farmer from Thar village in Jalna, sustained heavy losses as his grape orchard on 10 acres was destroyed. He had sold his orchard with about 2,400 quintal grapes against the advance money of Rs15,000 from a trader. He was expecting to earn at least Rs50 lakh. I will now end up getting a compensation of about Rs50,000 from the government, he says.Tryambak Jadhav, a social worker who is involved in counselling the farmers in Jalna, said, Hailstorm is a common phenomena in Marathwada over past few years. But the hail stones that poured in February were bigger in size - around 20 mm - against the 6-mm stones in May or June. Secondly, the hailstorm in February proves disastrous as it destroys crops ready for harvesting. It is time to adopt technology to minimise the effect of the hailstorm. China has done it effectively.Almost a fourth of the tehsils in Marathwada have been affected by the hailstorm and unseasonal rainfall over the past three days. Standing crops on about two lakh hectares of land has been damaged, which has led to loss of crops of thousands of crores of rupees. The standing crops of wheat, jowar and grapes have been badly-hit in almost all the districts of Marathwada.The farmers have also complained of huge losses to the seed plants of onion and cotton in villages of Waghrul and Revgaon in Jalna.Eight districts have reported three deaths and injuries to 17 farmers in the hailstorm in three days in Marathwada. 46 cattle have reportedly died, while thousands of chickens have also been killed.The district administration has begun conducting the punchnamas of the losses to the farmers in all the eight districts. We expect the punchnamas to be completed in next few days. Our village and tehsil level officials have been on the field from Sunday, assessing the losses. The reports in the villages with higher losses may take some more time. The final decision about the compensation has to be taken by the state government, said a top level officer from the divisional commissioner office."
