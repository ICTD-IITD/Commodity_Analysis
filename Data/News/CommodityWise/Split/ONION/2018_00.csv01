(Express photo by Kevin DSouza) A foodie, Ankita Raina has shed her calorific intemperance to improve her fitness. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza)The delicately delicious onion-tomato orgy on mutton for the Rogan Josh, was the biggest sacrifice Ankita Raina remembers making at the altar of tennis success. Olive oil drizzled salads and the bland pasta staple replaced the waft of a wonder memory of that Kashmiri kernel.Ankitas journey will continue from a strong showing at the Fed Cup in Delhi to the next port of call as she tries to better her ranking beyond 222the highest she reached around the time the last Fed Cup was played in India at Hyderabad in 2015. Indias No 1 takes flights mostly now, but recalled the train journey she undertook alone in 2012 as a 19-year-old finding her perfect Rogan Josh. I was playing a tournament in Delhi and realised itd been long since I visited my grandparents in Kashmir. First, all the cousins had planned to go, but then everyone else chickened out. There is a lot of strife there, but Kashmir is really heaven on earth, I found a lot of sukoon (peace) there at that time, she had said, speaking in the summer of 2015. Also, I really like mutton cooked in our Kashmiri stylewith lots of onion and tomatoes. That impulsive train journey was memorable, shed added with a sigh.Ankita is accustomed to long, meandering journeys in tennisand not just matches that last 2 hours-24 minutes, and 2 hours-53 the next day to beat Chieh-Yu Hsu incidentally Indias longest Fed Cup tie over the last weekend in Delhi. I always loved travelling by train as a child, and hated returning home. Tennis took me to places like Kavali in Andhra, Gulbarga and Mandya and I started travelling alone at 14. It used to be scary sometimes  new places, new culture, but I realised I dont panic immediately. Also you cant stop trains by pulling chains in Morocco! she laughs retelling her pet tale.Ankita Rainas oft-told Casablanca story involves a miss and a sigh. Followed by some shrill, hysterical cries of Pull it again, man! as she tried to stop a train she was travelling in, by cranking repeatedly at the first thing resembling a chain, with a friend screaming nearby.The pair of them, teenaged tennis players from India, had landed at Casablanca and were to take a connecting train from the basement of the airport to Rabat in Morocco for a junior tournament. The two misheard announcements alternating in Arabic and French and would miss their station just as Ankita  an accomplished train traveller back home owing to her India-wide criss-crossing for ITF juniors meets, immediately scanned around for a chain to pull and bring the train to a halt. Its when she rushed to the door pressing frantically at the buttons  that the chaos reached a crescendo. The pair were slapped a fine of 6000 dirhams. This opened the floodgates of the bawling friend. When the TC came, I told him how we were headed for a tennis tournament, and were traveling alone. We were very little and howling, and they finally understood and put us on the train back, she recalled.Indias top singles player at World No 253 has had a different graph than the countrys high-achieving predecessor in singlesSania Mirza. At 25, the results havent come in a bunch and she continues to battle to climb every step of the rankings ladder. The turbulence on the flight up hasnt quite stopped. My first flight alone was to Hyderabad and I told people I was 15. I was actually carrying a note from parents that said I was 12 and needed supervision, she recalled. Other adventures include winning a meet in Muzaffarnagar, watched by a ring of phlegmatic policemen guarding the tournament in the crime-infested area.When you dont hit the double digits of rankings early in tennis, theres a lot of unglamorous detours and wrong trains where life inadvertently takes you. Remaining undefeated in singles through a zonal Fed Cup week in your national capital has taken time to happen, with the double-fisted backhand and the serve variations for speed and placement, still being work in progress.Though her father accompanied her to meets in her pre-teens, it was her mum who nudged her into tennis. I started at 4. My mother was a sports enthusiast who did athletics and TT. Travelling with a parent though means double the cost so I had to learn to fend for myself very early, she added. The family had first watched Tim Henman play a Satellite Challenger at Ahmedabad where young Ankita chased the Brit for autographs, and it was from watching Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi that the girl started falling for the game.After some male players from Ahmedabad started training at Hemant Bendres academy in Pune, Ankita would shift too. Though her favourite surface for her aggressive game remains grass, shed do well on hard courts even while practicing on clay taking her time to learn the proper clay game of slices and slugging. Ankita favoured the chip and charge and took a liking for the drop shotsomething she used when downing Yulia Putintseva, the 81-ranked combustible Kazakh. As a kid, Ankita started loving smacking the ball and didnt hold back even if they kept landing long and thumping against fences at Ahmedabad.The forehand was developing into a weapon, but in 2012 shed run into a Chinese at a meet to secure a wildcard for the Australian Open who kept banging the ball with such menace that rallying at that speed got impossible. She would double her gym work to gain that kind of power, and though she detested running rounds, weight training soon became the favourite part of her workout. I have puked during running sessions though to try and get to that level of stamina, she recalled. 2013 would see her change her diet after extensive travel and oily food gave her acidity and sore throats during matches. I was a foodie. Then suddenly my dietician was telling me about olive oil and eating right, she said.All the time she would be wracked by the perennial dilemmawhether to chase titles at smaller events that fetched her headlines to woo the sponsors, or whether to play the higher graded meets of WTA and push for ranking points. All my time was spent making decisionstaking gambles on meets and balancing risks, one eye at the entry date, the other at withdrawals. Retreating from Japan, going to Marrakesh. After the last Fed Cup, Sania advised me on which tournaments to pick. When she was coming up, she was an inspiration and it was a dream to try play like her. Everyone used to say, Indians are not that strong, and we dont have the genes for tennis. Its difficult but Sania proved its possible, she added.On rough days, the family including brother Ankur, would be rushing from embassy to airportwith Ankita taking in her stride different cities and time zonesjust trying to get to the venue, tired and spent and losing in the first round as a result. There are times when Id feel low and not confident. But Id think that when I succeed all the praise will be for me, while my family is doing it all selflessly, she said.Her transition from juniors to seniors was typically protracted, and shed seek help of a psychologist. Ankita frequently started using the drop shot in stiff tie breakers. After a point, finishing the crunch matches is all mental, she had said, after a few close matches at the Fed Cup went the other way.From 2015 to now, Raina seems to have sorted out her end-game and won all her singles matches this time. Her parents whod watched Sharapova win the Wimbledon in 2004, would chip in with advice: how Cibulkova was always on her toes and jumping on court, how Ivanovic picked everything on the rise, how Federer stayed calm and Nadal covered the court. I went through a phase where I used to be confused  I wanted to be calm and aggressive also at the same time, she chuckled, adding that though she used to be shy off-court, she could pull out the fangs when playing.Ankita, meanwhile faced problems that tennis divinity rarely does. First it was tough to travel much, then I started feeling the need for a physio. The shoulder would get tight when I pushed too hard in training, she said. Shed stack up some good results in doubles in makeshift partnerships, but it needed solid singles results for Raina to grab eyeballs.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

It also resulted in heavy losses of the standing crops of grapes, wheat, jawar and seeds of onion among others.Though the meteorological department had issued the advisory about the unseasonal rainfall and the hailstorm earlier, the farmers said they could do nothing to save their standing crops.Two farmers, Mandodari and Rama Shelke, lost their grape crops of about 200 quintal. They claimed to have sustained losses of about Rs8 lakh.Though only a few grapes are damaged, the entire bunch of grapes is damaged due to the fungus and infection it will develop in the following days. Against the production cost of Rs4.5 lakh, we were expecting Rs8 lakh from our sale. We could not even get our crop insured as the grape orchards in our village do not qualify for the cover due to less area under cultivation, said Mandodari. According to officials from the divisional commissioner of Marathwada, the hailstorm was reported in Parbhani on Sunday evening and in parts of Aurangabad on Sunday morning. According to preliminary reports, losses in Jalna were highest. Agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar has directed his department to begin conducting the panchnamas of the losses.We have taken a review of the situation. The panchnama and the disbursement of the compensation may take few more days, said Rajesh Joshi, resident district collector of Jalna. Villagers said the losses would have been more had it been a working day.Bhaiyyasaheb Shinde from Vanjary Umrad village said Marathwada had been witnessing hailstorm regularly in last few years but the size of hail stones that poured on Sunday caused more damage."
5aeae3199855b73f522c4683,Mumbai Police Hunt for a Way to Enter the 'Dark Web' of Drug Suppliers,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-hunt-for-a-way-to-enter-the-dark-web-of-drug-suppliers/story-X3PFvM4yXJkLoy8UbZOpuM.html,2018-02-06,"Dark web  this, according to the anti-narcotics cell, is where most suppliers place orders to get their share of drugs.According to a cyber expert, the dark web is a part of the Internet that cannot be accessed through standard search engines. It can only be accessed using The Onion Router (Tor), a software that allows for anonymous communication. On this site, users get password-protected or dynamic pages to surf encrypted networks.The ANC learnt about the web after interrogation of five students who were arrested in May last year in connection with the seizure of 1,400 LSD dots worth Rs70 lakh. They had an Indian friend settled in the United States. They used to send money using Bitcoin to him. This man would then place an order for drugs on the dark web and would get the drugs delivered to the youngsters delivery address, said DCP (ANC) Shivdeep Lande.A police source said the man in the US placed orders with the drug syndicates in Western Europe. Mumbai youths got the drugs from Holland. Not only LSD, they also ordered MDMA (Ecstasy) with help from the friend, said the source.Another police source said many high-end expensive party drugs found in Goa, and rave parties in other parts of the country were sourced through the dark web, as it offers absolute anonymity and encrypted data making tracking of users tough. After getting payment through Bitcoin or other crypto currencies, the suppliers send the consignments, mainly through shipping or couriers. In Mumbais case, LSD dots were concealed in some documents, a police officer said.Usually, global suppliers dont cheat the buyers, as they want to grow. Also, the customers alert others about cheater on chat rooms in the dark web. The cheaters are then blocked, said cyber expert advocate Prashant Mali.In the US there is a parallel world, notorious for drug trafficking and other illegal practices, on the Dark Net. The Indian enforcement agencies need to form a Cyber Spy Force, which will keep a close watch on the trend in the virtual world and take measures to check it, said Mali.Deputy Director General (NCB) Mutha Ashok Jain said in the present scenario, one cannot deny that Dark Net is a big challenge. Dark web hides the source, forcing us to rely on human intelligence or keep an eye on overseas couriers, DCP Lande said.Another senior Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official from New Delhi said, The dark web is only a mechanism to hide identity. Once an order is placed, its needs to be executed and that needs a physical presence. And to switch to dark net mechanism one has to somewhere get linked to the existing system and this link leaves a trail for enforcers."
5aeae7fa9855b73f522c4a06,Very Little for MSME Sector: Indian Industries Association,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/very-little-for-msme-sector-indian-industries-association/story-fUZl9mrdqbc7WdiwDcMcwN.html,2018-02-02,"The Indian Industries Association (IIA), a prominent industry lobby group, has said the budget has nothing for the micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, which comprises a bulk of industrial units.Although a lot of measures have been proposed for the poor and farmers in the budget, there is very little for the MSME sector, said Sunil Vaish, president of the IIA.We were expecting further reduction in corporate tax for the MSME sector in this budget, he added.In last years budget, the finance minister had said corporate tax will be reduced in a phased manner. At that time, it was reduced to 25 % for business houses having a turnover up to Rs 50 crore, benefiting the MSME sector.But in the union budget for 2018-19, the tax benefit has been extended to larger business units having an annual turnover up to Rs 250 crore.Vaish also said, It has been announced that bank loans to the MSMEs will be sanctioned online. Yet, the MSME sector is doubtful in view of the attitude of banks towards it.Moreover, the online systems are not reliable at present as is being experienced in the case of the GST, he said.Today, reports have come in from various chapters of the IIA that the online e-way bill system is not properly operational, he added.Vaish, however, said the decision to set up mega food park and provide incentives for the apparel and leather sector will give a boost to the MSME sector.Manmohan Agarwal, the IIA vice-president, said the emphasis on road and health infrastructure and improvement in the education system would indirectly help the MSME sector.CONSUMER DEMAND TO GET A BOOST: ASSOCHAM PRESIDENTSandeep Jajodia, the Assocham president, said the finance minister had placed much emphasis on agriculture and rural India, allocating bulk of resources to interior landscape, while helping the middle class salaried employees along with giving relief to senior citizens. These measures will boost consumer demand and help revive economic growth, he said.The budget is on expected lines and provides support to sections of the society where it was needed the most. The agriculture and rural landscape were in some kind of distress and provision of over Rs 14.34 lakh crore on rural infrastructure should also add to employment generation, especially in the farm sector, Jajodia added.Relief to salaried employees by way of Rs 40,000 per annum standard deduction in lieu of transport allowance and medical reimbursement will leave more disposable income in the hands of the middle class and boost consumer demand, he said.Initiatives like Operation Green to stabilise prices of onion and potato will help ease retail inflation and help the RBI in keeping interest rates on the lower side, Jajodia said.MANY MEASURES IN LINE WITH CII RECOMMENDATIONSChandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said: Many of the measures in the budget are in line with the CIIs recommendations such as incentives for new jobs, extending fixed term employment, enhancing quality of education including teacher training and addressing healthcare access.Overall, this is a balanced and prudent budget that sets the foundation for future growth in the economy, he said."
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said."
5aeb03a09855b73f522c5e43,Parottas from Deep Down South,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jan/19/parottas-from-deep-down-south-1758979.html,2018-01-20,"lSabyasachi Roy Chaudhuri ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: Parottas or layered flour breads are popular in the southern states of India as well as the island country of Sri Lanka. Whereas Malabar parotta from Kerala is the most well-known among these, there are other variants like kothu, veechu, lappa and Ceylon parottas which are in demand in these places. It is said that the parotta recipes of South India did not migrate from the northern part of the country, instead, it was the Sinhalese workers in the southern part of Tamil Nadu and Kerala who brought these recipes from the island. The Arab traders visiting the coastline also had a role to play in this.Each type of parotta has its own unique style of preparation. For example, for making Veechu Parotta, a popular dish from Madurai, the dough is spun in the air to make the parotta thinner. The thin layered bread is then folded and fried in oil. This dish is popular in Southern Tamil Nadu and gets its name from veesu, which in Tamil means tossing in the air. Ceylon Paratha is a two-layered parotta usually stuffed with vegetables or meat. The parottas is normally served with a gravy known as salna as well as onion raita.Kothu Parotta is a completely different dish altogether. Roasted parottas are chopped into small pieces and sauted on a tawa with masala, and other ingredients like onions, tomatoes, chillies, egg and even meat. Beachside shacks in Sri Lanka are known for the varieties of Kothu Parottas that they rustle up. Seeing the parotta being prepared in front of you and the sound of chopping and mixing itself makes you feel hungry.Lappa is typically made with an egg filling and is widely known as muttai lappa in parts of Tamil Nadu. After preparation, the parotta is again covered with another layer of egg batter, before folding into triangular or square shapes and fried. The recipe has influences of Arabic cuisine with strong similarities with muttabaq, a popular Arabic dish.Pondy Parottas, with two outlets at Madhura Nagar and Hi-Tec City, brings all these types of parottas to Hyderabad. As per Rajasubbaiah who owns this place, the kothu parotta here is prepared in the special Karaikal style, where the masala is cooked on the tawa folded inside the parotta and then chopped into pieces. For Lappa, the stuffing is uniformly spread on the parotta directly on the tawa. They have chicken, mutton and seafood versions of the parottas, as well as kalaki, an omelette type egg delicacy popular in Tamil Nadu.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

How else could one describe the allegations against Health Minister K K Shylaja. What did she do? Submitted some bills and claimed reimbursement she is entitled to. Look at the mud thrown at her for that. For ages kanji or rice porridge has been the staple diet of Malayalees and this is often suggested while under Ayurveda treatment. Critics with no heart have found fault for claiming the bill for kanji and certain other health supplements like onion vada and Gobi Manchurian.They hardly stopped at that. For they didnt even spare the Ministers late mother, blaming her for claiming reimbursement from a non-existent hospital and for declaring that her husband is her dependant. She has stated only plain facts in the declaration - that her husband is solely dependent on her and that he is unemployed. What do these critics know about medical expenses and how hard it is to meet them with the pension of a retired LP School headmaster.Voices are being raised against the Ministers husband seeking treatment from a five-star hospital and a specialty clinic for diabetes. How else does one sort out lifestyle diseases. As lifestyle changes, such diseases are but natural fallouts and one has to seek solutions from the best possible facilities. The government has made provisions for the Minister to claim reimbursement for herself and family. She has done just that, and only what former Chief Ministers and ministers have done. Isnt the deafening silence of the main Opposition party explanatory! BJP leaders like Kummanam Rajasekharan and K Surendran can cry hoarse for they havent had the chance to enjoy the pie yet!But Comrade Shylaja hasnt bothered to explain something. Isnt her act of sending family members to costly private facility a classic statement of the confidence she has in facilities run by the department she rules over? Or are government hospitals only for the poor KSRTC pensioners?Well, she can still justify herself. Unlike many senior Comrades, she didnt go to Russia, Germany or USA; rather chose to endorse the quality of treatment in Keralas private hospitals.If likes were votesGet ready for the magic! The social media accounts and pages of Left ministers are going to be flooded with likes. The directive has gone down from the chief of staff M V Jayarajan. For a change, staffers of all ministers have been asked to follow the footsteps of Finance Minister Thomas Isaac who has managed maximum likes. Even the Chief Minister, with his army of advisers of all sorts, comes only second. In a meeting of personal staff of ministers, Jayarajan came armed with a stat-book of likes, according to which Isaacs official Facebook page has over 6 lakh likes whereas the CM comes a close second with 5.97 lakh. A monitoring mechanism is also reportedly being set up to review action in the pages of ministers. Dont know whether instructions have been issued to transform likes to votes in the next elections!What a transformation for a party which went on the rampage in the AGs Office and Government Secretariat against computers!"
5aeb24a69855b7179ad71a77,World economy: Looking up,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-proof-required-world-economy-looking-up-5006371/,2018-01-01,"The IMF forecast is for AE inflation rates to stay constant at around 1.6 per cent in 2018, before inching towards 2 per cent in 2022. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The IMF forecast is for AE inflation rates to stay constant at around 1.6 per cent in 2018, before inching towards 2 per cent in 2022. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The world economy had a very successful year in 2017. Just how successful can be gleaned from the fact that GDP growth (IMF data) registered close to 3.7 per cent in 2017. Unemployment rates in the advanced economies (AE) are at multi-year, if not historical, lows. What is surprising is that (median) inflation rates in AEs, while up from near-zero levels in 2015 and 2016 (0.3 and 0.8 per cent respectively) could only register 1.6 per cent in 2017.The IMF forecast is for AE inflation rates to stay constant at around 1.6 per cent in 2018, before inching towards 2 per cent in 2022.The emerging markets (non AEs) also had a banner year in 2017, registering a mean GDP growth rate of 4.4 per cent, up from the 4 per cent levels of the previous two years. Median inflation rates also stayed low, at 3.2 per cent in 2017, up from 2.3 per cent levels the previous two years. This rather laboured presentation of basic macro-economic data is for two reasons: One, to achieve some clarity on what has happened, and two, to provide some perspective on what lies ahead.Regarding the past  emerging markets contain 85 per cent of the worlds population and have grown faster than AEs by an average of 1.35 per cent per capita per year, and done so for the past 37 years. This means that average incomes in the emerging world have gained on average incomes in the West by around 65 per cent. Still, a long gap in average incomes remains, but the journey has well and truly started.These facts put into perspective some of the extraordinary claims being made about world inequality getting worse. To be sure, income inequality in the US is at its highest level ever  while global inequality (including the US) is at its lowest levels ever, or at least since 1870.What are the likely economic downsides in 2018, and beyond? If not inequality, it must be inflation that will rise phoenix-like, around the world, and especially in inflation-prone India. Even if inflation registers a high 4.5 per cent average in each of the remaining four months of this fiscal year (December 2017 through March 2018), the average fiscal year inflation in India will still register only 3.5 per cent, a full percentage point lower than the 4.5 per cent observed in 2016-17. More to the point  this 3.5 per cent will be the second-lowest inflation level recorded in India, ever (or since 1980). Lowest inflation rate: 3.4 per cent in 1999/2000, a year after the 13.3 per cent onion inflation of 1998/99. Unless inflation hawks can tell us exactly what they are eating, and digesting, inflation levels in India are unlikely to exceed the median rate in emerging economies by much in the foreseeable future. The IMF forecasts this median rate to fall towards 3 per cent by 2019. Which means that India is unlikely to see the average headline rate above 4 per cent in 2018/19.The IMF can be wrong about its inflation forecast. If they are wrong, my forecast will also be in jeopardy. But I am unlikely to be too far in error about the inflation spread between emerging markets and India. Many (make that most) Indian experts are visualising Indian CPI inflation registering at least 4.5 per cent for the foreseeable future (next couple of years).Indian GDP growth numbers for 2017/18 are not very flattering. We had (at least) two major economic reforms in the past year  demonetisation and the beginnings of the implementation of GST. It is likely that by mid-year next year, GST will be approaching the clean two-tier tax system that most of us, and India, wants. And if GDP growth rate begins to exceed 8 per cent, we will all conclude that the slow growth pain of 2017/18 of 6.7 per cent was a price worth paying. For the year gone by, GDP growth rate in emerging markets accelerated by 0.4 per cent (over 2016-17). In India, the likely outcome is that GDP growth would have decreased by a near similar magnitude. The next few months data are eagerly awaited.I want to close this futuristic assessment with comments on a few broad trends that are likely to emerge. Oil price increases, even if they occur, are unlikely to have much of an inflationary effect in most parts of the world. Median inflation rates in advanced economies declined from 2.7 per cent in 2000 (Brent at $28/barrel) to 2.2 per cent in 2007 (Brent at $72/barrel). Global growth is likely to approach 4 per cent in 2018, and if it does so, it will be near the top of its range for the last 42 years, barring the four go-go years, 2004-2007. At the same time, a drift in global growth towards 3.5 per cent cannot be ruled out.Regardless of how transparent and effective the US corporate tax cut is, one should not underestimate its significance for the rest of the world. Likely good news for India, as Modi-Jaitley are on record that reduction in corporate tax rates is a major policy goal.Throughout this article, I have assiduously avoided talking about employment. Job creation is not just an Indian problem, it is a worldwide phenomenon. Again, and not just to plug my book The New Wealth of Nations, one of the biggest developments in 2018 might be the beginning of a new (world) welfare order, a welfare order that emphasises work-related income support, and a guaranteed cash transfer (basic income) for the bottom quarter of the population. This, along with tax cuts, increased compliance and competition-induced low inflation, may provide the world with one of its best Goldilocks years.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

This price is recovered from the farmers. At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b1374ed9855b7624637765f,Handling perception is Modi’s biggest challenge,http://www.newindianexpress.com/prabhu-chawla/column/2018/may/27/handling-perception-is-modis-biggest-challenge-1819883.html,2018-05-27,"Prabhu Chawla ByReformist US President Franklin D Roosevelt once said: The future lies with those political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in government than in politics. As India wades into the election battlefield next year, it will be governance that decides the mandate and not mudslinging. Indian voters have usually voted out non-performing leaders to bring in ones who promised better governance or Achche Din. Last week, almost the entire Opposition descended on Bengaluru to forge the blueprint of an alliance which will try to dislodge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.They had little in common except a venomous dislike for him. The optics of Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, Sitaram Yechury and Siddaramaiah, Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav and others preening on a festive stage erected as a launching pad for HD Kumaraswamys ascension to the chief ministership of Karnataka was a political anagram spelling a warning to Modi. Beware! Our phalanx is ready to demolish your juggernaut.Not one of them put forth an alternative agenda for governance, and refrained from attacking each other, as they had done before arriving in Bengaluru and did soon after landing back home. But the message from Bengaluru was loud and clear: Battle 2019 would be fought between the Mighty Dozen and Crafty Modi. Once again, history is repeating itself.In 1977, it was Indira vs the Rest. In 1989, it was Rajiv vs United Enemies. The choices were between one opportunistic coalition and an unprincipled alliance. In 2018, Modi finds himself in the unenviable position of facing the entire regiment of Opposition leaders who cannot individually defeat him in nearly any major state. Rajiv Gandhis Congress was trounced by his own former minister VP Singh, who launched the Janata Dal from Bengaluru in 1988, supported by the BJP and the Communists. For Modi, 2019 is a greater challenge than 2014, when he was pitted against a defamed government and tainted leadership. Since then he has almost fulfilled his promise of achieving a Congress-mukt Bharat. What next?Though the Congress is just a ghost now, the BJP and its partners rule 22 states while regional satraps control the remaining states where the BJP is weak; some of them were once part of the NDA. The challenge for the Congress and other non-BJP Opposition parties is to snatch Lok Sabha seats away from the saffron sultan. Analysis of data shows that the electorate rejects over 65 per cent of sitting lawmakers in every state in every poll.This means the probability of sitting BJP MPs losing is higher than that of Opposition legislators, who together hold only 225 seats in the current Parliament. Hence, the Opposition has joined hands to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and other states where the BJP has been in power for one or more than two terms. Various opinion polls also indicate its vote share may shrink.While Modi remains the voters top choice, his personal popularity has shown a significant fall. However, it is not impossible for him to win a second mandate by making a course correction in the next nine months. Having created an admirable climate of economic stability and GDP growth, the prime minister will need to convince the voters that he has provided a government which works by adopting the Mantra of Reform, Perform and Transform. For that he must:*Improve perception. Modis promise of delivering Maximum Governance with Minimum Government seduced peoples high expectations. He correctly thought of right-sizing or downsizing the government. But four years later, its mass has bloated further. There are more secretaries and higher level officials now than in 2014. Bureaucracy is like a wildfire that has spread in favourable winds across the corridors of power. Taking advantage of the PMs trust in honest officers, babus have created innumerable tribunals, commissions and expert groups to accommodate retired colleagues.*Tame inflation: Modi had promised to reduce prices and provide more employment. Though the job market has shown recovery, it is less than expected. The wholesale price index is either stagnant or stuck, though within tolerable limits. Yet the perception created by the record spurt in petroleum product prices should be a major concern.The BJP made gas prices one of its major election issues in 2014. In 2018, consumers are paying more to fill fuel tanks, though the average cost of imported crude is down 40 per cent. Public perception that the government is squeezing the middle class is gaining ground. Modi should perhaps note that the BJP lost many elections in the late 1990s due to a rise in onion prices. Any hike in petroleum prices devastates the domestic budgets of the middle and lower classes. It has a spiralling effect on the cost of other goods and services. Providing affordable housing to the middle class is still a dream. Healthcare costs are exorbitant and the quality has plummeted in most of India.*Increase his Indian footprint. Modi has left his imprint on international diplomacy through inimitable Modihuplomacy. During the past four years he has travelled to a record number of countries and exhibited his popularity and innovative skills to numerous global leaders. But now he needs to reconnect himself with the electorate more. The BJP has wrested all the states from the Congress thanks to his magnetism. Modi is bigger than the BJP; the voters plump for him and not for his party. His domestic travel should be aimed at connecting with his core constituency and not just official events.Former deputy prime minister LK Advanis political relevance may have diminished in New India, but Modi should take his cue from a statement he made after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, that the BJP lost because it had ignored its core constituencythe middle class and the committed Sangh Parivaris.*Forget Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister is committing the cardinal mistake of attacking the Gandhi Parivar more frequently than politically required.Both mother and son had almost hit the political bottom after the Congress won just 44 seats in 2014 and lost in all the states it ruled between 2014 and 2018. Gandhi bashing paid dividends in 2014 since they remote-controlled the Manmohan Singh government and were punished by the electorate. Double jeopardy does not work. Indira Gandhi was defeated in 1977 for imposing the Emergency, but staged a triumphant return in 1980. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA lost in 2004 despite an admirable performance.During the run-up to the 2019 elections, Modis oratorical skills and charisma would face the real test. He will have to convince India that he is not a leader who makes promises which are forgotten soon after the election, and that he has actually delivered more than what was promised in 2014."

(Express photo by Arul Horizon) The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)The central government has announced a 5 per cent incentive on onion exports to boost the roots flagging prices, said Pasha Patel, chairman of the state governments committee for agricultural prices. Patel said he had met Union Minister of commerce Suresh Prabhu to discuss the matter. The minister has agreed to extend 5 per cent incentive for onion under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme, Patel told The Indian Express on Thursday.Onion prices have crashed in the wholesale markets of Maharashtra due to the bumper crop in the state. This year, Maharashtra reported plantation of over 3.5 lakh hectares of land, instead of the usual 3 lakh hectares. The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. The price drop comes after an eight month bull run for the bulb in wholesale markets. From June last year till early March, average prices of the bulb hovered between Rs 25 per kg and 30 per kg.The price rise was mainly due to the drought in Karnataka, which had resulted in the failure of Karnatakas rabi crop last year. Rabi or summer onion is planted late December and harvested post March-April. This onion is the only one which is amenable for storage and feeds the market from April till September before the arrival of kharif onions. Farmers in Maharashtra store these onions moisture proof storage structures called kanda chawls and offload them when prices are right.Last year, due to the scarcity of onions, prices were high. The government took several steps to reduce the prices, such as importing at least 20,000 tonnes of onion while income tax officials raided the premises of seven traders who were allegedly storing onions. Also, the Minimum Export Price (MEP), which was kept at zero since December 2015, was raised to $850 per tonne. Between April 2017 and February 2018, the country had seen exports of 21,35,421.57 tonnes of the bulb  a record high.Since March, onion prices have been on the wane as arrival has increased in wholesale markets. The governments decision to free exports by removing the MEP slab in February had failed to boost the market sentiments. Similarly, the decision of Nafed to wade in the market and procure 25,000 tonnes of the bulb at Maharashtras Lasalgoan mandi had failed to firm up the prices. It is expected that the price of the bulb will increase in the days to come. Agri-commodity analyst Dipak Chavan also welcomed the move, saying this will be beneficial for domestic markets. Our currency is at an all time low, so this incentive will have a positive effect on the markets and firm up the prices, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Express) Over thee crore toilets have been constructed across the country. (Express)As crores of toilet blocks are constructed across India as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, making toilet usage a sustainable solution in the long run has been a challenge for authorities. There have been several reports about the newly-constructed toilets being used for other purposes, including for storing grains. Now, a pilot project in Pune aims to resolve this issue, by offering an incentive to local residents to use the toilets.Explaining the project, Assistant Collector of Khed taluka, Ayush Prasad, said it was based on harvesting the decomposed night soil from twin pit toilets and using it as manure. In rural areas, the Abhiyan promotes construction of twin pit toilets, which allow complete decomposition of night soil into manure. Our project will involve commercial usage of this manure and paying the householder to harvest the same, he said.In the preliminary stage, the manure was tested in a field owned by the Rajgurunagar-based Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research and the results showed a nine-fold increase in yields. Scientists of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) are now trying to devise means to improve the quality of the manure, said Prasad.Under the project, a farmer producer company will be entrusted with the work of harvesting the manure, treating it and selling it to floriculturists. Surveys are being undertaken to identify twin pit toilets that were constructed and in use between 2010-2013. In the first phase, we will harvest the manure from these pits, said Prasad. The pilot project is expected to be rolled out in October.Jayant Deshpande, state sanitation consultant of UNICEF, said the scheme will incentivise the usage of toilets. If a monetary incentive is provided, the households will continue using the toilets and take care of its upkeep, he said.Under the flagship programme of the central government, district administrations provide both household as well as community toilets in urban and rural areas.Government figures reveal that the total number of toilets constructed across the nation is more than 3 crore. Maharashtra was recently declared open-defecation free (ODF), with almost 70 per cent toilet usage being reported. The National Rural Sanitation Survey has put the toilet usage across the country at around 93.4 per cent.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b13898e9855b762ecebd00c,Keeping it authentic,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/keeping-it-authentic/article22672981.ece,2018-02-07,"Masters of Italian cooking, Chef Attilio Di Fabrizio and Chef Roberto Gatto believe that it is the quality of ingredients which make each of their dish special, heart warming. They also generate a feel-good-factor as the taste lingers long after consuming their delicacies . Little wonder, the duo brought the best of herbs, cheese, fish, white wine, olive oil and other veggies all the way from their homeland to conduct a special masterclass at Hotel Imperial.The two have contrasting cooking styles but share a common passion for creating magic with traditional Italian recipes. Both Chef Attilio and Executive Chef Roberto, working at Belmond Villa San Michele, Florence, and Belmond Hotel Cipriani respectively, unveiled their secrets of Italian cuisine at the masterclass as part of an ongoing two-week festival at San Gimignano restaurant of the hotel which culminates on February 11.The guests were treated to a traditional Italian lunch eaten by families and young couples during summers. It comprised parma ham aesthetically decorated with cut slices of water melon, fish cooked in white wine and risotto. I found the meal hearty and wholesome/ The flavours came in with every bite, and Tuscan fish, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, ensured that cholesterol level didnt shoot up.The flamboyant Robertosays he gets irritated when he sees fusion which has gone horribly wrong. Fusion is confusion. I become angry when I see this. In Europe, Indian cuisine is incorrectly represented. They try qorma but it is nothing like what is made here.Giving his take on Indian food, he says, I want to master Indian cuisine. One of the most popular dishes in my restaurant is a curry dish.  He has plans to explore the spice market in Old Delhi and try local delicacies.Offering a piece of advise for those who cook Italian at home, he says: People should use seasonal vegetables and not imported ones. Roberto pitched in for Make in India when it came to veggies like aubergine, which is available round the year even while supporting Italian cheese and ham.Meanwhile, Chef Attilio, who makes tasty Tuscan food, started off with elementary tips like how yolk can easily be separated from the egg white without spilling it on the table. It is necessary for binding it with flour, he said, while mixing it with his hands.Garlic was virtually worshipped by the chefs as it plays a significant role in almost every Italian dish. They ensured that it was roasted and looked brownish. They emphasised that a balance is essential between different ingredients.Chef Attilio says: The key to good cooking lies in the fact that our ingredients are fresh and healthy and are combined in such a way that the taste of chicken would not be overpowered by any other ingredient. If it is a seafood dish, its taste should not be overpowered by garlic or any other ingredient.Noting that ham with water melon is eaten during summers, Chef Attilio says: In Italy, we have different kinds of ham which are eaten with fresh melons. Tuscan people eat mostly meat but slowly we are substituting that with fish as it is lighter to digest, is healthy and keeps the constitution well balanced.Advocating wannabe chefs to focus on the main ingredient, he says: If Italians prepare a sea food dish, then fish has to be the protagonist. Italian food is all about balancing ingredients.For the duo, the trip is helpful as it is not just about cooking and interacting with foodies but also about sharing of knowledge with Imperials Executive Chef Prem Kumar Pogakula, who plans to take them to Khari Baoli for spices and trying Mughlai delicacies.Chef Pogakula, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, and is cooking along with the two chefs, says in Delhi, people get to eat only Indo-Italian. Like we put garam masala, they dont use spices at all. Even pepper is not used in Tuscan region. Technically, there are flavours of Parmeson, thyme, rosemary and parsley.He underlines the importance of white wine in Italian cooking. It is used in risotto for de-glazing. When you put butter in onion for saut, the sugar in onion gets caramelised. That is the base which sticks on the pan. So the wine elevates the flavour.Summing up, Chef Pogakula, who will travel to Italy this year to promote Indian cuisine as part of a cultural exchange programme between The Imperial and Belmond Hotels, says India lacks in quality of ingredients because of logistical issues. Italian hotels run their own farms. Freshness of ingredients is an aspect where we need to focus on."
