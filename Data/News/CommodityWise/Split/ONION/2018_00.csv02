Last year, the farmers agitation in the state had started at the same time over the price of onions, which sold at the lowest price of 50 paisa per kilogram, eventually leading to police firing in Mandsaur that left six persons dead. In some Mandis of Rajgarh and Neemuch, the lowest price of onion was 30 paisa to 50 paisa per kg since farmers started selling onion under the Bhavantar scheme. The maximum price was reported to be Rs 5-Rs 6 per kg.In the past two years, the state government purchased onion on MSP  first at Rs 6 per kg and then Rs 8 per kg  but this year it was brought under the Bhavantar scheme, under which the traders will purchase onion from farmers at mandis and the government will pay farmers the difference between the MSP and the average wholesale price. The MSP rate this year is again Rs 8 per kg.Mandi secretary at Narsinghgarh in Rajgarh RK Jain said the price didnt fall that much but admitted that Rs 1 per kg was the lowest price of onion of poor quality. Kedar Sirohi, a farmers leader from Harda, said Bhavantar had hit the farmers hard. Traders have joined hands to purchase onion at a throwaway price and convinced farmers that the government would pay them the difference between the MSP and sale price, he said. The fact is that farmers would get the difference between the MSP and average wholesale price, not sale price.Tarun Baheti, a farmers leader in Neemuch, said a farmer, whom he identified as Shaukin Patidar, was being forced to sell onion at 50 paisa per kg on Friday despite the fact that his crop was of good quality. When he requested Mandi president Rajkumar Tiwari to intervene he got Rs 1 per kg. But even with that price he was not able to recover even the transport cost he had born, said Baheti. Mahesh Patidar, leader of the Patidar Samaj in Malwa region, said the average price of onion in the markets was Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg. Traders who buy onion will store it and later sell at Rs 20-Rs 25 per kg, he said, adding that middlemen and traders stand to benefit the most.Steep fall in prices of garlic and onion has given a shot in the arm to the Opposition, which has said it will raise issues of farmers in the run-up to state polls later this year. State Congress president Kamal Nath said, Congress has been saying right from the beginning that Bhavantar scheme is meant for the benefit of BJP- supported traders, not farmers. But Shivraj (Singh Chouhan) government is not willing to listen. After garlic, price of onion has also fallen after being included in Bhavantar scheme. State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said the government included onion in Bhavantar to ensure the farmers didnt suffer losses."

However, the farmers are upset as they say that the input cost is Rs 8-9 per kg (Rs 800-900 per quintal).The announcement of purchasing onion by the government was nothing but a sham. As against the input cost of Rs 8-9 per kg, the farmers are getting about Rs 6 per kg in the mandi, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) president Amra Ram said.Sikar district is a hub of onion cultivation in Rajasthan and this year the production is expected to be about 4.50 to 5 lakh metric tonnes as against states total output of 12.80 lakh metric tonnes. There are about 50,000 onion growers in the region.Onion prices rose after last August, with delay in kharif crop arrivals and estimates of lower production in 2017-18 by one million tonne. After peaking in January first week, the prices have fallen since.The government has extended the date of purchase of garlic under MIS that is being bought at Rs 3,257 per quintal. The date has been extended to May 18 and will be extended further, if required, Lochan said.The government has so far purchased 2,865 metric tonnes garlic as against target of 1.54 lakh metric tonne. This translates into just about 1.8% of the target.In case of garlic, the MIS was launched on April 26 and government had announced to procure 1.54 lakh metric tonne garlic. It had set up 10 purchase centres and procured garlic at 3,257 per quintal or 32.57 per kg.The net area under garlic in Rajasthan has increased from 69,000 hectare to 1.32 lakh hectare and the production has also doubled from 3.77 lakh MT to 7.7 lakh MT this year.The Hadauti region comprising Kota, Bundi, Jahawar and Baran, accounts for about 90% of the states production.The farmers and farmer organizations in the Hadauti region are now demanding that government must extend the dates for garlic procurement.The garlic crop had started arriving in the market more than six weeks ago, but the prices crashed due to a bumper production.Two years back, garlic prices were ruling between  60 and 90 per kg at the mandis. Farmers have been dejected due to steep fall in the prices."
5b13ae3a9855b762463796b9,Farmer Unrest Surfaces in MP Again as Garlic Prices Plunge,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/farmer-unrest-surfaces-in-mp-again-as-garlic-prices-plunge/story-ZRQqkE8LeEu3wowslYhpPP.html,2018-05-07,"Farmer unrest has resurfaced in Neemuch and Mandsaur districts in Malwa region of poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, this time over crashing garlic prices.On Friday, garlic prices plunged to Re 1 per kg at Shyamgarh mandi  the vegetable wholesale market  in Mandsaur district, while the price in neighbouring Neemuch mandi stood at Rs 2 per kg. The selling price of garlic was between Rs 50 and Rs 80 per kg in January this year, said Suryabahnu Singh, a farmer from Darukheda village.The Shyamgarh mandi saw nearly 100 farmers gherao the market committees office on Friday evening, forcing committee authorities to call the police.The Malwa region in western MP had witnessed a violent farmers protest demanding higher prices for produce in June 2017. Six farmers from Neemuch and Mandsaur died during the violence as police opened fire.A garlic glut in Rajasthan, the countrys second largest producer after MP, has caused prices of the commodity to decline in wholesale markets. The downside pressure on garlic prices comes amid Indias subdued wholesale price inflation, which eased to an eight-month low of 2.47% in March, compared with a 2.48% rise in February. This was led largely by a 0.4% decline in food prices alone.The Hataudi region of Rajasthan comprising divisions such as Kota and Jahawar, is the states prime garlic belt. Oversupply has been the key reason why prices have been depressed this season. Rajasthan garlic is sold in major markets of neighbouring states such as Indore, Ahmedabad and Nasik, said Digvijay Singh, a state marketing board official. The area under garlic in Rajasthan has increased to about 13 million hectare in 2017-18 from about 70,000 hectare in the previous year, while production has doubled from 0.37 million tonne in 2016-17 to 0.77 million tonnes this year.While Madhya Pradesh is the largest grower, accounting for 31% of the total output, Rajasthans share is 24%.Sensing a glut, the Rajasthan government had intimated the Union agriculture ministry last month on a proposal to intervene in the market by launching a limited-period procurement scheme of garlic.After the approval from the Cente, the Rajasthan government has started buying garlic at a state-determined price. The official pegged daily arrivals from the Kota region at around 12,000 tonne.MP, where elections are expected this year (the assembly tenure ends on January 7, 2019), too has a programme, Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, to pay for farm produce, but farmers such as Suryabahnu Singh are not convinced that is enough.Former Neemuch mandi president and garlic farmer Umrao Gurjar explains why. Under Bhavantar, the government is going to give Rs 800 per quintal to a farmer. As the government has fixed 15 quintal as average production per bigha, a farmer is going to get only Rs 12,000 per bigha, while the actual input cost comes to Rs 20,000 per bigha. No wonder the farmers are angry.Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Sharma said the pricing has repeatedly hurt food growers of Malwa region, which accounts for a majority of the garlic production in the state. Malwas farmers lost out last year when they produced onion and the prices crashed to as low as 50 paise per kg. Many shifted to garlic and its price too has crashed.(With inputs from HTC, Delhi )"

A state-level convention will be held from June 15-17, where a strategy will be chalked out, BKS leaders said.A five-member representation of BKS told the collectors that natural calamities and pests damaging crops leave farmers in distress, and absence of minimum support price and unavailability of crop insurance add to their sufferings.BKS has from time to time held protests as well as talks with the government to highlight the plight of farmers. The government improved the power policy, provided MSP to farmers and short-term cooperative loan waiver, but policy changes are required to redress farmers grievances, said Kailash Gandoliya, state general secretary of the RSS-affiliated organisation.He suggested that policy measures be introduced to provide profitable prices to farmers based on the production cost of the crops.The government should announce profitable prices for crops, vegetables and milk, and ensure their purchase throughout the year. Buying and selling crops below minimum support price should be made an offence, Gandoliya said.He called for a kisan corpus fund with the insurance premium amounts payable by the Centre, state and farmers, and demanded that crop producers be ensured the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.In Rajasthan mustard, gram, wheat, garlic and onion have been registered for buying through MSP. In the absence of purchase, the farmers should be given difference between market price and MSP, Gandoliya said.Farmers should be provided places in the mandis for selling organic products; farmers platforms should be freed from encroachments by middle men, he said, seeking funds to farmers for maintenance of cows.Last year, BKS had joined an agitation, spearheaded by other farmers organisations, demanding waiver of agriculture loans and remunerative price to farm produce."

I did bump into Chef Alex Moser at some food do, but we never got to speak with him. Then, when a persistent young publicist invited me to try out the chefs fare, I agreed.The chef is at a restaurant called Hong Kong at Hotel Andaz Delhi  a concept by Hyatt, as it says  in Aerocity. I met the chef, discussed food, had a great Chinese meal and came home happily sated.Glitzy placeHong Kong is truly a glitzy place. The restaurant is huge, with a ground floor that seems specially designed for the young, and a first-floor area which is more suited to families and those who like to eat their food in peace. There is a king-sized bar, around which the young sat, drinks in hand, and not the least bit troubled by the loud music that was being played. I sat on the ground level, but wished it was better lit. I like to see what I eat.But what I ate was excellent. The food is essentially Cantonese which is not very hot, like, say Sichuan food. The dishes are light and flavoured with fresh herbs. And chef Moser tells me that his focus is always on fresh ingredients. He makes the most of what is seasonal, substituting some Chinese vegetables with Indian cousins freshly plucked from organic farms.We started with a warm roasted duck salad, with pomelo, pine nuts and shallots, which was very nice, indeed. Then there was some crunchy pickled radish with chilli and soya, and a dumpling with chicken  that was all right.Melt in the mouthWhat I loved was the crispy pork belly with a kasundi mustard sauce. The thick cubes of pork were crisp on the top, and incredibly soft below. I actually didnt have to chew it at all  it just vanished once I popped a piece into my mouth. And, of course, it went deliciously well with the mustard-kasundi sauce, the latter giving a somewhat bitter-and-sour flavour to it.Another dish that I really enjoyed was the Hong Kong style duck, served with a homemade barbecue sauce and mini baos. I took a bao, filled it with some of the roasted duck pieces, added the sauce and some greens, folded it, and took a nice juicy bite. It was delicious  the greens were crunchy, the duck was tender, and the sauce, piquant.The main meal consisted of a delightful wok-fried rice dish, and some free-range chicken, cooked with black bean, bell pepper and scallions. The rice was a mix of textures and flavours, for it had been cooked with three kinds of rice  red rice, bamboo rice and jasmine rice. The rice had been flavoured with preserved olive leaves, which gave it a tart flavour. Together, they did a neat number.The dessert consisted of an almond tapioca pudding (okay), passion fruit jelly (good) and bitter chocolate tart (very good).The chef likes to give a tweak to traditional Cantonese cuisine keeping regional produce in mind. And he adds a spice like onion seeds to his stir fried vegetables, to give it a little twist that is familiar  yet inspiring. And a lot of the taste in the dishes is linked to the fact that he doesnt use powders in his kitchen.It was a great meal, and I was happy to be able to catch up with the chef. I hope Ill get to see more of him this year."

Since there was a delay in disbursal of crop insurance benefits due for 2016-17, the farmers, who largely relied on it, did not have enough money and struggled to pay the premium.If the insurance company had released the insurance benefits to eligible farmers, they could have paid the premium, A. Varadharajan, a farmer from Vadamalapuram, Ettayapuram taluk, and MDMKs State deputy secretary of Farmers Wing, told The Hindu here on Sunday.Citing these problems, he demanded that the authorities extend the deadline to February 28. Further, he said, it required a sum of Rs. 1,800 towards insuring a hectare of onion crop and Rs. 950 for a hectare of chillies. Among other crops, high premium was notified for onion and chillies. Several farmers in Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam and its surroundings were depressed by monsoon failure last season, which saw only 40% of cultivation.Lack of informationMoreover, he said some crop insurers felt that there was not enough information about the insurance company on acknowledgement slips. Except for the companys name, columns meant for address, website and email were blank, whereas all details of crop insurers, including cell phone numbers, were added. If such details were mentioned in the acknowledgement slips, farmers could get their doubts clarified."

Banks should look to lend to the sector, where investments are required by both individuals and institutions to strengthen the infrastructure, Collector K. Rajamani said.Food processing industry is another area of focus and the district has already initiated measures such as collective farming, procuring, sorting, grading, storing and transporting perishable commodities such as banana and onion with financial support of Rs. 30 crore from NABARD for supply chain management, he said and suggested that bankers step up lending taking advantage of the emerging opportunities in the district.Mr. Rajamani was speaking after releasing the Potential Linked Credit Plan for 2018-19, prepared by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), here recently. The NABARD has assessed the credit flow potential of the district at Rs. 8259.20 crore, a growth of 10% over the projections for the current year.Mini textile parkDwelling on the potential for industrial growth in the district, Mr. Rajamani said a mini textile park is likely to come up soon on an area of about 10 acres in the district. The textile industry, he observed, is bound to grow rapidly in the district. About 1,000 acres has been earmarked for an SIPCOT industrial park at Manapparai. Opportunities are likely to emerge in ancillary activities supporting Defence and Railway sectors in the district.A trade centre would come up at Panjapur and it would serve as a facilitator for MSME growth. With the Tiruchi airport poised for expansion with Rs. 900 crore investment, it is expected that exports in agri and other sectors would grow, he said. The focus should also be on improving the skills of the work force to seize the advantages, he said.Highlighting the importance of dry land farming, he emphasised the need for improving production and productivity of millets, pulses and oilseeds.Education loansBankers should be considerate and extend education loans to needy people without delay, as it will serve as a catalyst to uplift a generation, he said.S.

Venkatesh here on Wednesday.Rajendran, a farmer, said there was no water in the following six tanks  Muthalaimozhi, Thenkaraikulam, Nochikulam, Keela Puthukulam, Vellarikaioorani and Themankulam  and the shortage had affected cultivation on a total 3,323 acres of paddy crop.Despite demanding water release from the Papanasam and Manimuthar dams, no action had been taken, he said. The Collector asked the PWD authorities to take action. Meanwhile, several farmers raised the issue of delay in crop insurance disbursal and sought early release of benefits to eligible farmers.Mr. Venkatesh said for paddy farmers, insurance benefits for Rs. 75 lakh for 2016-17 were sanctioned and being disbursed.As for maize crop, Rs. 59.83 crore was sanctioned and Rs. 37.63 crore had been disbursed so far. For green gram, insurance benefits for Rs. 20.73 crore was sanctioned and money was being credited to bank accounts of farmers.Insurance benefits for crops such as black gram, cotton, cumbu, cholam, chillies, onion and banana were yet to come, the Collector said.K.P. Perumal, a farmer from Thoothukudi, said Thoothukudi had already been declared as drought-hit by the State government and there should not be any partial treatment in allocation of crop insurance benefits.Varadharajan, a farmer, sought extension of time to pay crop insurance premium, for which February 28 was the deadline.Tamilmani, a farmer from Kurumbur, said nowadays farmers, who suffered crop loss without water, were hard-pressed for money and loans obtained by them from banks could hardly be repaid.Citing the situation, he said bankers should at least reduce the interest rates for farmers."

Some of them were using high-water intensive vegetables as an intercrop. The vegetables being grown by the farmers are cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, onion and radish.Commissioner of Horticulture, AP, Chiranjiv Choudhary went round the fields and interacted with the farmers along with Leaf (Lawrencedale Agro Processing India Pvt. Ltd.) CEO P. Vijayraghavan, horticulture officials and Leaf representatives.The wish list of the farmers include connecting to the big markets in Visakhapatnam and other parts of the country, supply of good quality seed and supply of motors for drawing of water from the nearby stream. The Commissioner wondered as to why the farmers were producing rice as it requires a lot of water. The farmers replied that they grow it in small quantities for local consumption only. They are getting around 40 bags on two acres of land.Some of the farmers have been receiving quality seeds and inputs on scientific farming methods for the past few months from the Ooty-based Leaf, an agri-value chain major. The soil quality is good and the tribal farmers are hard working, but the returns are meagre due to unscientific farming methods. The tribal farmers here are practising only organic farming and organic products are in high demand in the market, said an agro-scientist of Leaf.Later, the Commissioner visited another village and found that turmeric crop, grown on two stretches of land, in close proximity, were looking different.While the turmeric plants in one crop looked fresh with green leaves, the leaves of the plants on the other were dried up. The villagers explained that one was the traditional variety, which could be harvested once in two years, while the other was roma variety, which would be ready for harvested in nine months."
5b142c289855b744d6388b8f,In an organic fashion...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-an-organic-fashion/article22408611.ece,2018-01-10,"For someone who embraced ikat when Indian fashion was yet to find its feet, Madhu Jain has always been looking ahead of her times  first in 1980s when only a handful of designers would rummage for raw materials in the labyrinthine bylanes of the Walled City to now when designers have no compunction of procuring imported fabrics, accessories to economise cost of their outfits.As a precocious child, Madhu was quick to appreciate the aesthetic eyes of her father, who liked dressing up in his best bib and tucker and lived in regal style in posh Aurangzeb Road. Madhu meticulously studied everything  be it dcor, lifestyle, cuisine and heritage. Years later, that would reflect on her sartorial choices.She loves figurative work of Thai ikat and that translates into her food as well. As we meet at Zing, the Asian restaurant of The Metropolitan Hotel and Spa, she observes the large vegetarian spread aesthetically. After settling down, the food connoisseur in her comes alive as she inquires about erstwhile Siams Pamelo salad and raw papaya.Madhus dietary influence has come from Rajeshwari Devi, her mother, who hailed from a traditional Jain family of Kucha Bulaki Begum in Old Delhi. At home, mother would cook onion and garlic-free food which was so sumptuous. At school in Delhi, I would take tiffin in which she packed me lip smacking chana and puri. Surprisingly, she was enlisted as a non vegetarian at Welham Girls School in Dehradun. But, right from day one, I was adamant to stick to my vegetarian palate.B.D. Meattle, her father, was fond of fashionable clothes. And would gift floral French chiffon saris to her mother. She wore it with pearls. His aesthetics could be seen in Belgian chandeliers, Persian carpets at our home. The Walled City continues to be her favourite haunt for street food.  Jo khatir nawazi wahan hoti hai, kahin nahi hoti . At my nanis house in Old Delhi, khumchewalas would send banana leaves filled with kulfi, kulle, a fast disappearing edible, from which sweet potatoes and other veggies would be scooped out.Foraying into fashionHaving taken the bold decision of working on the ancient weaving technique of ikat even though she was a student of Economics, Madhu was not perturbed by the fact that Indians then had virtually no exposure to couture.I was lucky to be around the same time as Rohit Khosla. Those days camaraderie existed between designers. Today, it is rare to find two designers on the same page, she says, while sipping her hot and sour soup.Shehas remained loyal to the indigenous handmade crafts and textiles. Foreign buyers have a lot of respect for our handmade clothes but the problem is that only a few designers are presenting Indian art and craft in their totality abroad. Like when I took Kashmiri handicrafts to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Americans were in awe of it. There needs to be responsible fashion and the idea of giving back to society should be pursued. That is what I believe in and follow.She is worried that blatant commercialisation by designers these days is making a dent in Indias image overseas. She laments that the finesse with which she did her crafts no longer exists now. Now it has become too commercialised, she gripes, while sipping her soup.Like she zeroed in on Kalamkari, which gave her a chance to express her creativity, one asks. It also created multiple jobs. How many designers have worked on it? We used it for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. That is when it took off, she says.Sustainability factorThe conversation shifts to how imported fabrics have penetrated across the nation and are threatening to ruin livelihood of artisans. Tamil Nadu is famous for its kanjeeverams which is staple for weavers there. However, there is influx of kanjeeverams from China at one third the price. It has become a huge issue. What is going to happen to weavers of the State?While polishing off Pamelo salad, Madhu feels the solution lies in designers following the path of ethical fashion. Indian fashion designers need to work on this. They should not alter the geographical craft index. There need to be ethics in fashion. There has to be credibility on what we showcase on the ramp. If designers are trying to work with traditional crafts, then economics is a consideration but that doesnt mean that theyforget about backward linkages.She further says that designers need to understand how much damage powerlooms are doing to handlooms. .Everybody is falling in line due to the push given by the powers that be. Our history informs us that crafts have always been protected by rulers. All it needs now is right positioning. The government has to step in to protect our identity, suggests Madhu, a strong proponent of the governments Made In India scheme.In 2018, Madhu forecasts that alternative fabrics, anti-fit silhouettes would be worn by fashionistas. We will have more eco-friendly textiles and practical silhouettes based on comfort. This is where the Ministry has to play a bigger role and I am glad that Smriti Irani is open to new ideas.As far as story of sustainability goes, Madhu is a cut above the rest of her fraternity. And this could be seen from the special award conferred on her by the FICCI.Explaining how she seeks to take the sustainability story forward, Madhu asserts that she is the first designer in the world to come up with bamboo silk ikat. Not even in the North East there is any designer who has converted bamboo, which is found in abundance into textiles. This is my gift to our industry.Sipping fresh orange juice, Madhu opens up about the secret of hard bamboo from which furniture and upholstery is made in the North East.It doesnt require much water.

It is estimated that it will cost Rs. 1.95 lakh for establishing a low-cost onion storage unit. Eligible farmers will be given 50% subsidy.A shed opened at Marudhur near Lalgudi under the NHM is all set to store shallots raised on the field of A. Sebastian. The shed can store 250 tonnes of shallots. Provisions have been made to protect them from rain. The facility for free aeration enables the farmers to store onions for at least four months. The sufficient air flow protects the shallots from hot weather conditions too.We have so far followed the method of storing onion in our fields by covering them with thatches. We have now realised that it is unscientific. We hope that the low-cost onion storage units will serve the purpose of selling shallots when it is in high demand, Mr. Sebastian says.R. Krishnamoorthy, Deputy Director, Horticulture, Tiruchi district, said all 67 beneficiaries had been identified for 2017-18. Most of them had set up storage units. Most of the beneficiaries were from Thuraiyur, Uppiliapuram, Thathaiyargarpettai, Mannachanallur and Thottiam blocks, which were considered as onion belt in Tiruchi district."

On Thursday, the celebration of his 714th urs began with much fanfare.Sufis are not mourned; rather, their union with God is celebrated every year by their followers. Its the return of the lover to his source, a reunion with the Almighty thats an occasion of immense happiness, said Syed Kashif Ali Nizami, head of the dargah.Its said that Nizamuddin, the patron saint of Delhi, had willed that there should be sama (musical festivities) at his funeral procession. That tradition has continued for over 700 years now.Over 1.5 lakh visitors came for last years urs, reaffirming that the shrine is at the centre of the citys multicultural ethos. We might by living in troubled times, but the numbers are steadily rising, said Bilal Nizami, a duago (a person who holds prayers) at the shrine.Hindu yogi Sahil Nath, who says he has been attending the urs for several decades, agrees. People come here when hope escapes them. There is no distinction of religion. Only the heart should be pure. All religions teach the same thing, Nath said.Faquirs, qawwals from other Sufi dargahs from across the country attend the urs.Across the marble courtyard, hundreds of people sit under a shamiyana where qawwali troupes from other dargahs come to perform. But for most visitors, the shrine of Nizamuddin, also called Mehboob-e-Ilahi, is a symbol of the pluralistic and syncretic culture of Delhi.Nicolas, a Scandinavian visitor, said to him music represents Sufism.Sanjiv Rao from Malviya Nagar said that the shrine has given him many good, and at times miraculous, experiences. Having experienced it myself, I must have brought several hundred people here. It provides peace and fulfilment to all, Rao said.Author-historian Rana Safvi said the message of love, peace and compassion towards each other continues to bring people to the shrine. Even the meals served as langar here are without onion and garlic. We have always been open to everyone. In his time, Auliya would feed all the poor first and then take his meal. He stayed away from the rulers and was a pro-poor egalitarian figure loved by the masses, said Nizami.The five-day urs would continue till late night on Sunday. Qawwalis have been starting at 6.30pm and lasting till 10pm. But since Saturday would be bada kulthe big day when Nizamuddin actually left this worldqawwalis would continue till 3am."

This debris is dangerous too, as it comprises concrete, stones, bricks sand, and even shards of glass and other, potentially injury-causing substances.A walk in the area reveals a long list of disposables scattered all over the vacant land, which has thick shrub growth. The garbage contains packets of cigarettes, food packets, plastic waste, dry leaves, and paper littered by smallscale vendors that line the pavement near the roundabout.May people working in Sector 32 converge to these makeshift, street-side shops in Sector 33 for lunch, and dump the disposable plates that come with the food in the open piece of land. We try and clean our own waste from the area. We are not responsible for this, said a food vendor, who did not wish to be name.Domestic waste and garbage from nearby sectors, including kitchen waste, vegetable residue, peels, and onion skins can also be seen in the area. The plot has an undulating appearance, with thick undergrowth stemming out in large clusters all around. Wood shavings , and other types of furniture waste have also been dumped in the plot by carpenters unwilling to locate a suitable dumping area nearby."

Children and hapless women suffer more when they come across speed breakers and road junctions while riding pillion. Moreover, some people carry heavy luggage such as vessels, plastic materials, iron and wooden items tied to both sides of the two-wheeler. Such rides may prove to be fatal, besides causing hazards to other road users. Let us follow road safety rules in every aspect.S. Venkatesh,Madura CollegeBus shelterThe bus shelter on the eastern side of Iyer Bungalow bus stop was removed four months ago. But a new shelter has not been constructed till date. Thousands of passengers use this bus stop daily to reach various destinations. Now the summer has advanced and the mercury level is going up daily. People have to stand under a scorching sun to board buses. I request the authorities to construct a new bus shelter at the earliest.V. S. Madhavan,Iyer BungalowShift onionmarketThere should be coordinated efforts among the Madurai Corporation, police, other government agencies and trade bodies to draw up a plan to avoid incidents such as the recent Meenakshi Temple fire. The central vegetable market has been shifted and the onion market and others are in the process of getting shifted. On the other hand, big textile and jewellery showrooms are given permission, though they do not provide parking space. The authorities may consider denial of permission for such establishments, at least in future. In addition, unauthorised stalls, fuel pumps on narrow roads and lapses in enforcement of rules should be viewed seriously.The construction of a parking lot in the erstwhile central market area may be expedited. The onion market should be shifted to Mattuthavani without further delay.P. Thavamani,K. K. Nagar"
