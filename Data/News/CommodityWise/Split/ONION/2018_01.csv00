5b1528e79855b76246385171,New address for wholesale onion traders,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-address-for-wholesale-onion-traders/article23778783.ece,2018-05-05,"Wholesale onion traders of the Gandhi Market are all set to move to their own market complex at Ariyamangalam in the city soon.The move comes amidst stiff opposition from different sections of traders at the Gandhi Market on attempts to shift them to the Central Market for Vegetables, Flowers and Fruits built by the State at Kallikudi, off the Tiruchi-Madurai highway. The district administration is expected to begin the process of allocation of shops at the market, which has been lying idle for nearly a year now, in the next few days.Meanwhile, construction of the private onion market complex along the Chennai-Tiruchi Bypass Road has reached the final stages. Civil works have been completed and the shops are ready. Internal roads are being laid now and will be completed in another 15 days. We are also building a Vinayagar Temple inside the complex. Once it is completed, we will inaugurate the complex. In all likelihood, the market will be declared open by mid-June as our members are keen to shift during the Tamil month of Vaikasi, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.The onion market complex has been built at a site purchased by the Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association as early as 1991. However, the association began construction of the complex only three years back.We started construction after we came to know that the shops at Kallikudi market, which was then under construction, will not meet our requirements. Our new market is much closer to the existing onion market and customers will not be affected, Mr.Thangaraj told The Hindu .The new onion market has 90 shops and modern amenities. The project has been executed at a cost of about Rs. 15 crore, including about Rs. 5 crore raised as loan from bank, Mr. Thangaraj said. The shops would be owned by about 75 members of the associationThe complex has all necessary amenities and infrastructure for traders, public and farmers visiting the market. The market includes rest rooms for traders and farmers. We have ample two-wheeler parking area, adequate toilets and water supply. We have also wide internal roads to ensure smooth loading and unloading from the 20-tonne capacity trucks, he said.The wholesale onion market is an important part of the Gandhi Market in the city. The market is the hub for Bellary and small onions trade in the region and caters to retail traders from Tiruchi and neighbouring districts.The market largely functions along the Sub-Jail Road outside Gandhi Market and traders process the onion on roadsides. Over 75 shops are situated along the narrow Sub-Jail Road. The road remained closed for traffic for several decades before the former City Police Commissioner Karuna Sagar ordered its reopening for traffic in August 2009.Yet, traffic congestion remains a perennial problem on Sub-Jail Road and Vellamandi Road intersections as loading and unloading of onions take place right on the road. The congestion is expected to ease to a large extent once the onion traders shift to their own market."

However, this could take time as they have to identify and purchase a suitable site to build their own market.With the district administration announcing that heavy vehicles carrying vegetables and fruits would not be allowed to enter the Gandhi Market in the city from June, time is fast running out for the wholesale traders. Meanwhile, retail traders of the market have grown apprehensive over the hints being dropped by the district administration that the wholesale traders are being shifted in the first phase, thereby implying that retail traders too may have to move over to the new market in course of time. Besides, a recent statement from Collector K.Rajamani also indicated that the Gandhi Market is to be redeveloped under the Smart City project, though it is not clear whether it would be retained as a market.Retail traders argue that they have been operating out of the market for decades in the Gandhi Market, established in 1940. The market has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about 6.5 acres of land. Different wholesale sections such as the vengaiya mandi, vazhakai mandi, vellamandi and the pazha mandi spill over to Madurai Road, Thanjavur Road, Nelpettai Road, East Boulevard Road and Sub-Jail Road and only these shops created traffic congestion. Once they are shifted, the traffic problems would be solved. If necessary, the market could be renovated and modernised to retain the retail market, they contend.There is a lot of confusion. There is no reason to shift traders who are functioning inside the market and so far we have not been given any notice or intimation by the authorities. Retail traders function within the four walls of Gandhi Market and do not cause any disturbance to traffic around the market. The city needs a retail market that is accessible and offers vegetables, fruits and flowers at affordable prices.Big trucks need not enter the market to transport goods for us, said U.S.Karuppiah, president, Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Platform and Permanent Shopkeepers Association. There are about 780 approved shop keepers functioning inside the market who are paying rent to the Corporation, he points out and claims that the Corporation was getting annual revenue of over Rs. 10 crore from the market. He contends that the Kallikudi market was essentially meant to cater to wholesale market and does not meet the requirement of retail traders.If the retail market is shifted hundreds of traders, farmers and labourers will be affected, he said. Representatives of a few other associations were in favour of retaining the market at Gandhi Market. We want retail traders to be retained. We held a meeting recently and our members expressed strong opposition to any move to shift retail shops to the new market, said M.K.Kamalakannan, president, Tiruchi Gandhi Market Vyaparigal Munnetra Sangam."
5b1538d29855b76a5f1a07e1,Contemporary  but much too crammed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/contemporary-but-much-too-crammed/article23790070.ece,2018-05-06,"In one of the few sequences where the characters of Aabhasam speak directly to the audience, the character played by Mamukkoya talks about people who dare to think differently. The comparison is to an onion which refuses to take the fixed path from the sack to the basket to the bowl, and instead jumps out to follow an independent path. The camera closely follows the onion which, before long, gets crushed under the wheels of a police vehicle.That happens to be one of the messages that the film wants to convey mostly through allegories, some of them subtle, and some others in-your-face. Jubith Namradath, in his debut film, attempts a satirical take on contemporary society through a bus journey from Bengaluru to Thiruvananthapuram. The story happens inside the bus named Gandhi which belongs to Democracy Travels, with Ambedkar, Marx, Jinnah and Godse being their other buses.Inside the bus is a cross-section of our society, from a young woman who has been tricked by her parents to agree to an arranged marriage and a little girl who is dreading the advances from her uncle at her ancestral home, to a sexually frustrated man, and a young man who always tends to stand up for what is right.As the title Aabhasam (which stands for Aarsha Bharatha Samskaram ) suggests, the satire points at the self-appointed moral guardians, who are shown to be using their twisted understanding of culture as a veil to cover up their own perversions. We see the same persons who get uncomfortable at open expressions of love making lewd remarks and behaving inappropriately with single women travellers. In between, the film takes detours to other issues, including beef politics.Yet, half-way through the journey, the narrative continues to still meander along aimlessly, like a bus without a definite destination. Too many issues are taken up and crammed into the available screen time.Some of the individual stories pique your interest, like the one involving Indrans. But, the script needlessly refrains from giving us a little more background of some of the more interesting characters. The dialogues are either too obvious or too weak.In some of its rather bleak phases, the film springs small surprises, especially the scene where some of the passengers, without a second thought, hop on to the Godse bus, when the Gandhi bus gets stuck. But, these scenes are few and far between. The film itself is almost like the overnight bus journey that it uses as a tool for its messages. All darkness outside the window, with a few bright spots.S.R. Praveen"

One part of the mission states that officials must make effective use of waste from farmers markets (uzhavar sandhais) by establishing small compost bins on their premises.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar on November 26 had spoken to private hoteliers, owners of restaurants and marriage halls urging them to compost their own waste. In the subsequent week, he said that compost bins and pits would be established in farmers markets across the city at Bibikulam, Anna Nagar, Anaiyur and Palanganatham.Although compost bins were placed in three locations and a compost pit in one, agricultural officers say that they have barely been used.At Bibikulam farmers market, an official at the managerial position said that they had dug a vermi compost pit in 2012 as part of the National Agricultural Development Programme. After a few months, we realised that maintenance was difficult. Officials from the corporation said two months ago that we had to compost our waste. Compost pits cause an unpleasant stench preventing customers from coming to the market. He said farmers who come to sell their produce here usually have livestock. When the market closes at 3 p.m., they take leftovers back home and feed their animals. Nothing but onion peels are left behind.The compost bin at Anna Nagar farmers market lays in a corner, away from the eyes of visitors in an unused state.The Agricultural Officer handling the affairs there said that there was little or no waste getting accumulated everyday. Hoteliers come right before closing time and buy vegetables that are not fresh. The price is cheaper thus being more profitable to them. So, there is no too much waste, he said. He said that the leftover strewn around the premises is cleared each day and dumped into the garbage truck.The usage at Palanganatham and Anaiyur too is erratic. An officer says that there are a few takers for the end product - compost.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says that all items classified under bio-degradable waste must be composted by bulk waste generators. He said that a monitoring mechanism would be in place to check the use of bins."

Where is profit? I think I will not even earn the cost of cultivation, he said in dismay.Onion farmers in the district have been facing the same problem for the last three years as they are unable to get any profit from their produce in the open market.With the hope of getting some profits at least this year, farmers cultivated onion in over 2,950 hectares of land during the rabi season, while they had cultivated the crop on 2,651 hectares of land during the kharif season.Though onion is arriving in the APMC yards, owing to falling prices farmers are unable to earn any profit.The prices have come down to Rs. 600 a quintal in the open market, while in retail it is being sold at Rs. 15-Rs. 20 a kg.At this rate, farmers will not recover even the cost of cultivation. Surely, lower prices will make consumers happy but certainly not the cultivators who have been incurring loss for the last three years, said Arvind Kulkarni, district general secretary of Akhanda Karnataka Raita Sangha.Meanwhile, officials of the Horticulture Department also said that a specific policy should have been framed to help onion farmers.When cultivation dips, prices shoot up causing inconvenience to consumers and when prices fall, it becomes a burden for farmers. There is no middle way where consumers and farmers can both be kept happy, the officials said."

The processing centres would have all necessary facilities for handling, processing and storage of banana and onions.The primary processing centres for banana are being established at Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Arasalur, Pidaramangalam and Thiruchendurai and for onion at Manachanallur, P. K. Agaram, Uppilliyappuram (South), Thuraiyur and Thathaiyengarpet. Construction of these centres is underway and is expected to be completed by August.Though cold storages can be established as part of the initiative, onions and the banana variety raised in the identified villages do not require them, officials in the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business told The Hindu . Marketing linkages would be established between farmers and farmers producers companies or big traders, entrepreneurs or exporters to ensure that the farmers got good returns. The SCM programme is being implemented at a total investment of Rs. 398.75 crore in 10 districts. In Tiruchi district, Rs. 28.66 crore has been allotted for the establishment of the 10 primary processing centres.Collector K. Rajamani, accompanied by R. Kailasapathy and other officials, inspected the works and the construction of the storage godown for agriculture produce at the Thathaiyengarpet Regulated Market. The 1000 tonne capacity godown is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 2.35 crore. Farmers can store their produce and also obtain credit by pledging them."

For retired employees, the government may also consider changes in the pension policy.Chief minister reviewed and discussed the roadmap for 2018 in a specially called meeting on his arrival from four-day vacation. It was decided that government would form a policy for employees who retired from service without promotion, as the matter is pending with the court, state public relations minister Narottam Mishra told reporters in a press conference.Sources in secretariat said that reports from the employee unions have indicated that large number of employees were unhappy over the delay in their promotions.The government has taken no clear steps to justify the delay. In view of the assembly elections scheduled later this year, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also fixed one year task for all ministers and bureaucrats and instructed review of each task on the 5th of every month. The ministers and heads of department will have to submit the progress report every first week of the month.Mishra said that the meeting also discussed issues related to farmers, women and disabled. It was decided that the implementation of welfare schemes must be ensured within the prescribed time period.By October 2, 2018, all the villages in the state would be declared open defecation free (ODF) and the government will also fill vacant posts of tehsildars and their deputies within given time period. The government plans to involve 50 lakh people in the mass plantation drive to be held on July 2, where a target to plant more than 8 crore saplings has been set, said Mishra.Highlighting the efforts made for Dalits and tribals, he said, the government would ensure direct payment of labour and forest produce to them. It was also decided that onion would be included in Bhawantar Bhugtan Yojana from the next season, he said.A decision was also taken to encourage the state government departments to go paperless and follow file tracking system. To encourage self-help groups undertake mining projects, the government will open 250 new mines in the current year."

Spandana is in charge of social media outreach for the Congress.The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya , its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Malviya, though, didn't 'tag' Spandana on Twitter, and the latter wondered if it was because those who follow him on the microblogging site would see her videos about PM Modi.""You didn't want to tag me cos you didn't want people to watch the Modi video pinned on my timeline?"" she said.Spandana also wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on!

Chiru, Principal Secretary, Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business.Speaking at the inaugural of two-day Coconut Festival 2018, organised here by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)- Coimbatore, he said that in tune with Niti Aayog and Central Governments reforms, Tamil Nadu has joined the National Agriculture Market. The State Government is in the process of formalising a separate processing policy. The Tamil Nadu Government managed 278 regulated markets but what they got was mostly copra, he added.Coir Board Chairman C.P. Radhakrishnan said the industry and farmers will benefit if the board related to coconut functioned as a combined unit.The Coir Board had been working on developing coir plywoods. It would soon replace other plywoods, as enough research had gone into it in the past two years. The Board recently managed to bag the E1 certification for export to the European Union and was in the process of getting the E0 certification for export to the United States market.Mr. Radhakrishnan said though value addition per coconut was low in India compared to the Philippines, Thailand and a few other South East Asian countries, the former had managed to double its export. Since his taking over, annual coir exports had gone up from Rs. 1,600 crore to Rs. 3,000 crore. He also appealed to the coconut farmers and entrepreneurs to make use of the various schemes offered by the Coir Board to set up coconut-based value added products. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Vice Chancellor K. Ramasamy said though production of various agriculture crops had doubled in the State, the objective of doubling farmers income still remained unfulfilled.The Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology Director C. Anandharamakrishnan said the institution had taken up coconut as its crop for the year to develop various technologies for tapping and processing coconut. Last year it had taken up small onion and was able to make an impact, especially at a time when farmers faced fall in value.India was among the top three coconut producers in the world but the value it was able to extract per coconut was only around Rs. 30. Indonesia, the Philippines and a few other countries were able to extract up to Rs. 180 a nut because of going in for value added products, said P. Ravichandran, Chairman, CII, Tamil Nadu State Council. This showed that there was huge potential in taking up developing added products and generating employment as well, he added.If the full potential of coconut was exploited, it would be a business around Rs. 35,000 crore, said S. Senthilnathan, Convenor, Agri Business and Food Processing Panel, CII, Coimbatore Zone.S. Narayanan, Chairman, Coimbatore Zone welcomed the gathering."

Nearly 40% of the teachers believed smelling an onion or a chappal was a key first-aid measure . Merely 11% had thought of summoning an ambulance.The eight-month long study covering across 42 schools bares the lack of awareness about epilepsy . Only one in five teachers knew that laying a person on a flat surface and turning him/her to one side was one of the first things to be done when someone is convulsing. What makes the ignorance more worrying is that the first-aid measures for epilepsy and regular fainting, something routinely seen in schools, is the same.The idea for the study stemmed from the widespread reluctance of schools to accommodate epileptic children. We found out two main things during treating children with epilepsy; their parents were hesitant to tell the schools, and secondly, even reputed schools were unwilling to accept such children, said Dr Pradnya Gadgil, consultant paediatric neurologist at Kokilaben Hospital, Andheri, which carried out the study with Samman Foundation, the Indian Epilepsy Associations Mumbai chapter.Epilepsy is the fourth commonest brain disorder, yet its shrouded in stigma. Gadgil said that one in 100 in the population will get a seizure once in lifetime, while one in 200 have epilepsy. Due to the ignorance, people can be scared of seizures as they don't understand what happens and what to do. Children, therefore, are often deprived of a normal life, say going to a picnic or participating in some common activity, she said.Pooja Nandi of Samman said, If a teacher discriminates against an epileptic child, it would make the childs life miserable. Seizures can manifest in different ways such as the child blanking out for few seconds in class. Such cases even end up getting labelled as learning disability, she said. The silver lining was that after awareness sessions, 94% of teachers said an epileptic child could go to a normal school."

To add a dash of spice to the battle, revenue minister Umashankar Gupta shot back that he, too, sold pakodas before joining politics and doesnt see anything wrong in it.At 11 am on Wednesday, state Youth Congress president Kunal Choudhary sat in front of the state PCC office in Bhopal alongside a statue of former PM Indira Gandhi to fry pakodas as his supporters flavoured it with slogans. Educated youth asking for employment, Youth Congress activists shouted.Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah promised to generate 2 crore jobs a year for the youth. Now, after four years of his government, the Prime Minister is asking us to fry pakodas. There is no shame in frying pakodas, but it is shameless to make promises and fail to deliver, Choudhary told TOI.The Youth Congress sold palak (spinach), potato and onion pakoras to passersby saying, The educated youth has been insulted. Have parents given education to their children so they have no dreams? Have students toiled to get engineering and MBA degrees to start a pakoda enterprise?Since Tuesday, the Youth Congress has held such pakoda protests in 90 towns and cities across MP, including Sehore, Rewa, Panna, Chhattarpur, Indore and Bhopal.Senior BJP leader Umashankar Gupta hit back at Congress, saying: There is no shame is making and selling pakodas. I used to sell pakodas and fried snacks to earn my livelihood before joining politics. I have seen qualified engineers working as labourers. There is no shame in generating self-employment.BJP MLA from Bhopal Madhya, Surendra Nath Singh, said that Congress and some pseudo-intellectuals failed to understand PMs pakoda example. The PM never asked engineers to sell pakoda. It was for unemployed youths who have no way to earn. It was a motivation for generating self-employment but some pseudo intellectuals, politicians and media twisted the debate, alleged Singh.BJP leaders felicitated pakoda sellers in Bhopal, Sehore and Ashta to blunt Congress protests."

That said, falling onion prices, after tomatoes, support our call that inflation risks are overdone, said Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch . According to Gupta, the MPC will see through the coming jump in inflation, growth and credit in mid-2018 as they are driven by base effects.Even without the central bank raising rates, lenders cost of funds has inched up as deposits slowed down and credit grew at a one-year high. Several large lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have hiked their bulk deposit rates. Private lender Axis Bank has also hiked its marginal cost of lending rate ( MCLR ) following an increase in cost of funds.According to DBS Bank chief economist Taimur Baig, growth has largely bottomed out, but India has yet to benefit from the synchronised pickup in global demand. The combination of fiscal challenges and rising oil prices would make the RBIs policy path a tricky one this year, in our view. Given Indias high debt and fiscal deficit, it may not be prudent to be on the sideline until inflation pressure becomes excessively high which, in turn, means the balance of risk is beginning to shift toward eventual policy tightening, he said.One of the factors that strengthen the case for a more hawkish regime has been the Union Budget , which unveiled a wider than expected fiscal deficit for the next year. But economists feel that the slippage is not enough to warrant a move to higher interest rates.Nomura economist Sonal Varma said, While the Budget is a slight disappointment relative to our expectations, it is not a game-changer in either direction  positive or negative. We expect a prolonged pause on monetary policy, including at the upcoming February 7 meeting, although the RBI may flag upside risks to inflation. She added that Nomura is yet to assess the impact of the government decision to hike minimum support prices (MSPs) on inflation and monetary policy outlook. The government has promised to increase the MSPs for crops by 1.5 times in the Budget.Benchmark 10-year bond yields have risen more than 80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since July  the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis, due in large part to worries about a more hawkish RBI."

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away? Or sacrificing his close aide, responsible for his rise as a leader, takes some courage?To this Ramya replied: Single Meaning plz ! Share it with those who have understood. If TOP means Tomato Onion Pakoda sorry Potato for @narendramodi, POT can also mean Potato Onion & Tomato for @divyaspandana Think Good!!!"

However, economists expect that the central bank would move to a more hawkish stance from the current neutral stance in the wake of growth bottoming out.We continue to expect the RBI to persist with its slightly hawkish pause in its Wednesday policy, from February, to err on the side of caution. That said, falling onion prices, after tomatoes, support our call that inflation risks are overdone, said Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch .
