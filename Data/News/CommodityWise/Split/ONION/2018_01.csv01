Vehicular movement often gets choked in this street as onions are spread for sales, occupying the road. As the road becomes narrower, vehicles are forced to move in snails pace, creating bottleneck for traffic movement.The corporation has been trying to shift the market to Mattuthavani vegetable market, but the traders are showing stiff resistance to vacate the place. The vegetable market too was functioning near Meenakshi Amman Temple before it was shifted to Mattuthavani.A civic body official said that the traders are reluctant and do not even turn up when they are invited by higher officials for talks. TOI had carried a story on 11th February on the delay in shifting various markets to the outskirts of the city and highlighting the problems due to them.On Tuesday, Madurai city corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar visited onion market and conducted an inspection. He found large quantities of onions encroaching upon the road, which was then cleared by corporation officials. Sekhar strictly warned the traders to restrict the sales to inside the shops. The commissioner also instructed his sub-ordinates to keep an eye on the market and not to allow traders on the road.Honorary president of Onion Merchants Association PMK Selvaraj said that corporation authorities have been urging them to not to hinder traffic movement, which most of their members are following. They have been also asked to get licenses for the trade. The traders will discuss it with other members of the association, he added.Earlier, Aneesh Sekhar inspected Mattuthavani vegetable market and took stock of encroachment and solid waste management. He urged the sellers to limit themselves to the space earmarked to each of them, as many of them were found to be encroaching public space. The sellers were also asked to chop the vegetable remains, so that it can decay quickly.The commissioner also visited New Bangajam Colony, a residential locality in Zone Three of Madurai Corporation."

The PM on Sunday said in an address in the state that farmers are his ""TOP"" priority, and explained that by ""TOP"", he meant ""tomato, onion and potato"".Ergo, the Karnataka Congress today tweeted asking him questions on unemployment, using similar acronyms and giving new expansions to existing ones.""Mr. Modi, isn't your TOP priority to create Jobs? But your government is NDA - Not Doing Anything!"", tweeted the Congress party's Karnataka unit.NDA is, of course, a reference to the government at the Centre. It actually stands for 'National Democratic Alliance' and is a coalition of parties headed by the BJP About Modi's ""TOP"" comment, the Karnataka Congress got into a smidgen of trouble yesterday and on Sunday.What happened was that the Congress social media head and Karnataka unit member Divya Spandana asked referring to Modi's comment, ""Is this what happens when you're on POT?""The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya, its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Spandana then wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again""."
5b1665bc9855b75cf6a8d529,Choked city must shift all markets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/choked-city-must-shift-all-markets/articleshow/62868010.cms,2018-02-11,"MADURAI: Almost all cities are as a rule congested during peak hours in the morning and evening. However, Madurai is unique in that it is congested round-the- clock, even at midnight. Majormarkets and commercial hubs operating in the heart of the city keep it humming with traffic all through the day, leaving the city congested. Madurai is the market for the entire southern Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Kerala. In fact, some of the markets are over a century old -- the central vegetable market was started 115 years ago -- and so were the other markets for fruits, flowers, onion and provisions like foodgrains. A century ago, they were started on a small scale with just a couple of shops which quickly grew in proportion.Markets apart, commercial establishments mushroomed in the city over the period, turning every street into a hub of some product or other. One would find serene residential buildings used as shops or for stocking the products. For instance, the famous house at West Masi Street, where Mahatma Gandhi changed his attire to that of a common Indian peasant during his visit in September 1921 is an outlet of a handloom store, and most of this house now lies in a dilapidated condition.The popular demand is that the markets must go out of the city and be stationed on the outskirts. As the demand grew louder, there were efforts to move out major markets, and some really materialised. The central vegetable market, which used to operate near Meenakshi temple on the old prison premises for over 115 years, was moved to Mattuthavani during 2010-11. Ahead of the shift, the flower market which was operating close by was moved to Agricultural Marketing Committee campus in 2006.However, Madurai still reels under congestion because other major markets like fruit market at Yanaikal, fish market at Karimedu and the onion traders at East Marret Street are yet to be moved out of city. ""The wholesale markets have to move out of the city. Most of the wholesale traders stock their goods inside the city. For instance, 80 trucks come inside the city to transact sugar alone"", says Madurai Lorry Owners Association president C Sathiah.Some of the associations have moved their establishments anticipating this situation. The grains market at Sikkantharchavadi by was established by Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2012. ""Though most of the grain merchants moved their warehouses numbering 250 to the outskirts, the sales happen here because traders feel that they may lose business if they go out. When the entire market moves out, the business too will move out eventually. The issue here is, there is little pressure from authorities to move the markets outside the city"", opined the chambers senior president, S Rethinavelu.The proposals to move fruit market and fish market are in the pipeline with places identified at Mattuthavani and Virattipathu respectively. Most of the works have been completed for fruit market but the fish market ran into trouble. ""Local people are opposing the proposal to move the fish market"", quipped L Sundaram, president of Karimedu Commission Fish Vendors Association. Though the vendors who moved out of the city have no big complaints, they feel that staying inside city has got its own benefits. ""The retail sale of customers buying flowers at dawn or dusk dwindled because they have to come a long distance. We used to enjoy this last leg of sales, when customers pick flowers on their way home"", said A V E Kesavan, a flower merchant.There is also pressing demand from traders to create adequate facilities on these market premises which were moved out. ""We still dont have any cold storage to preserve vegetables and adequate room for maneuvering trucks. The original lot of 27 acres allotted by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa when she assumed charge first in 1991, is yet to be put to use"", said P S Murugan , president of Mattuthavani Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association.For the common commuters inside the city, it will be a great relief if markets are moved out. ""It is very difficult to negotiate the traffic congestion in Madurai because we have to traverse through these markets and commercial hubs. ,"" B Rabikraja from Ismai lpuram added."

At Perambur in Chennai, where he grew up, he used to go scouting for eateries offering these dishes. After completing a catering course two decades ago, he decided to open an eatery in Trichy , his hometown, to serve the unbeatable idli-vadacurry combo.Over the years, he set up eateries at different places in the city. But it was only last year that he got a real breakthrough. Aanand Catering , which he opened at Periya Kadai Street , is now a big draw in the locality. Though my eatery had a slow start, customers loved what I served and through word of mouth the dishes became popular, Aanand said.The idli-vadacurry combo was the most sought after. Some people even come to my place from other areas for takeaways, he said. One idli costs `5, while vadacurry costs `15 if eaten there and `25 for takeaway.Apart from that, onion adai, mushroom biryani and millet khichdis are also popular among customers.I am very particular about serving hygienic and healthy food, said Aanand, who is now 43. This is why he does not serve parottas. I decided against serving parottas even though I know it isnt the smartest of business moves. I dont want people to eat food items that can be harmful to them, he said.Between 50 and 70 people visit Aanand Catering daily. On weekends, there are extra customers because I serve mushroom biryani on Saturdays and vegetable dosai on Sundays, he stated.Aanand, who also did a stint as a football coach at Campion Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School a few years ago, said it was with a heavy heart that he stopped serving adai aviyal at his eatery. It was one item that was as popular as vadacurry over here. But as coconut prices increased, I wasnt able to afford aviyal  this remains a big regret, he said.On his future plans, Aanand says, I want to rent a place out and start a restaurant soon  Im confident that I will be able to achieve this dream by the end of this year."

(Representational Image)The district deputy registrar (DDR) has issued showcause notices for suspension to directors of five wholesale market committees in Nashik for allegedly failing to pay onion farmers. The notices were issued after an investigation by Nilkanth Karhe, DDR, Nashik, revealed that about 20 traders operating in the markets had allegedly duped 1,500 farmers to the tune of Rs 5 crore.Karhe said, in all the cases, traders had paid farmers through cheques. However, when deposited for encashment, the cheques bounced. It was revealed that the traders did not have sufficient balance in their accounts, he said. Further investigation revealed that the traders in question were operating without depositing the mandatory security deposits, while the market committees had turned a blind eye, added Karhe.The notices were issued to the board of directors of the market committees of Manmad, Malegaon, Yewala, Umrane and Devala for their alleged role in the scam. The final order will be passed after a hearing on May 11, he said.Payment through post-dated cheques have become a norm in almost all wholesale markets of Nashik, since demonetisation, in 2016. Infact, the district collector of Nashik had talked about setting up special branches of public sector banks to help farmers encash the cheques faster.Traders, while issuing the cheques, ask farmers to deposit them after 15 to 30 days. Only a handful of traders prefer to transfer money through electronic means and even that faces technical roadblocks like bad network etc. Almost two years have passed since demonetisation, yet most of the traders in wholesale markets still prefer to deal in cheques.Hansraj Patil, youth president of farmers body Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, said what was a necessity during the cash crunch has now become a common instrument of duping farmers. Over the last two months, most of the traders have issued post-dated cheques, which have bounced. They say they have faced losses in business and hence could not maintain necessary credit in their banks, he said. Patil added that the farmers body had received numerous complaints about such incidents and took it up with the DDRs office.Patil, demanding compulsory cash or same day electronic transfer of funds, said necessary instructions should be issued to market committees to make preparations for the same.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The latest being Poonachi or The story of a black goat (Context).We meet at The Parks Mist restaurant for lunch. Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"
5b1786489855b75db2e7a0aa,Onion prices dive on heavy influx,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/onion-prices-dive-on-heavy-influx/articleshow/63084518.cms,2018-02-27,"RAJKOT: Heavy arrival of onions before Holi festival triggered a drastic fall in the price of the commodity leading to shutdown of Bhavnagar Market Yard, considered to be one of the largest market in the country after Nashik in Maharashtra. Onion price on Monday nearly halved to Rs 150-170 per 20kg from Saturdays rate of Rs 350-300 per 20kg. Farmers refused to sell their produce at such a low rate.The average daily arrival in Bhavnagar market is 1.5 lakh bags (50kg each). During the November to April season, an average of 25 lakh bags to 30 lakh bags come for auction at the marketing yard. This season, onion was cultivated in 24,800 hectare against 27,000 hectare last year.D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar marketing yard, said, One of the main reasons for the drastic fall is heavy influx of onions from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the domestic market. Earlier, onions from Gujarat were going to southern and northern states but now southern states get onions from Maharashtra, while northern states are covered by the onions from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.According to market yard authorities, on Saturday, there were 1 lakh unsold bags and on Monday 80,000 more bags arrived for auction creating an imbalance in demand and supply. G Ramani , former secretary of Mahuva market yard in Bhavnagar, said, Sudden arrival of huge stock in the market led to drastic fall. Till last week, because of marriage season farmers did not get labourers to bring the commodity to the market yard. Also, with the Holi festival during the weekend followed by marriage season again, farmers want to sell off their produce to get more cash ahead of the festival. This has led to fall in prices.However, former chairman of Bhavnagar Market Yard Bhikhabhai Zazadia feels the fall was a mere correction in prices. The price was very high even after the season started in November. Price of Rs 300 to 400 per 20kg is the price for Diwali season. When the new season starts in November, price falls, but this year it remained high till February. So, there was a sudden fall which was bound to happen.Farmers, however, disagreed with Zazadias argument. Ramji Mangukia, a farmer of Tana village of Shihor Taluka in Bhavnagar, said, Considering the input cost of seeds, pesticides and labour we cant afford to sell onions at this low price. He had come with 98 bags (20kg each) of onion.Deepak Malani, chairman of Amreli APMC, said, Even white onion price was down because of fall in export demand. There are few dehydration plants which have the monopoly in deciding price of white onions as it is mainly for export, while red onions are for local consumption."

The price of small onion skyrocketed to Rs. 180 per kg in the retail markets in Salem district by last year end.The district experienced widespread rainfall a few months ago and the farmers taking advantage of the same raised onion crop in a larger area. With the harvest season in full swing, the wholesale markets of Leigh Bazar and Shevvaipet Paul Market, and the eleven uzhavar santhais in the district have been receiving bulk stock of small onion from the villages in the last few days.According to S. A. Anand, a wholesale onion trader of Paul Market, the markets in Salem district have been receiving bulk stock of small onion from Chitradurga, Davanagere and Kollegal in Karnataka. Moreover, the farmers of Rasipuram and Vennanthur too have been supplying the small onion to Salem markets.At present, the wholesale markets in the city have been receiving about 20 tonnes of small onion per day. The wholesale price of small onion has been ranging between Rs. 7 and Rs. 14 per kg. The retail price in the uzhavar santhais ranged between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20.The wholesale markets have also been receiving Bellary onion from Karnataka and Maharashtra.With the arrival of more stock of small onion and Bellary onion, their price was expected to go down further in the days to come, he said."

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

In the citys famed Chala market, vegetables prices are at a low  cabbage - Rs. 18, carrot - Rs. 26, thundan green chilli  Rs. 20, brinjal - Rs. 20, nendran  Rs. 44, Rasa kadali - Rs. 30, snake gourd - Rs. 30, onion - Rs. 20.The price of Thundan mulagu , which had climbed to more than Rs. 400 a few months ago, was Rs. 25 on Saturday, while shallots was available for Rs. 36, down from Rs. 120 to Rs. 140 sometime ago. A wholesale vegetable trader said there was indeed a slight increase in prices owing to the hike in transportation charges, but there was no discernible impact in the market, as vegetable prices were very low owing to good production. If the transportation cost earlier was Rs. 2.5, today it is Rs. 3, he said.Prices were unlikely to increase for a month or two, but would go up again if farmers did not get the desired returns and failed to grow another round of vegetables. A retail trader in the market said provision prices too were stable. Tuvar dal ( sambar parippu ) cost Rs. 80 a kg and sugar Rs. 37, down Rs. 1 from Friday.A wholesale provision dealer said rise in fuel prices was usually reflected in the cost of provisions, but it was perhaps a bit too early to say the prices would not rise. We may be able to know how things go when the next truckload arrives, in a couple of days.Mohammed Rafeek, president of the Chala main unit of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said petrol did not matter much but diesel price hike was hurting the traders badly. Vegetable prices were stable, but those trading in other commodities were absorbing this increase in cost. Even parcel services will increase their charges now.Mr. Rafeek said price revision by oil retailers was being met without much protests because it was not a festival or wedding season and families were focussing on school reopening. Had that not been the case, there would have a been a huge brouhaha and the authorities would have taken a lot of heat."

The WPI data showed prices of pulses contracted an annual 24.3%, while those of vegetables rose 15.4% during the month, slower than the 36.7% rise in the previous month. Onion prices remained stubborn, increasing nearly 80% in February but lower than 127% in the previous month.Available trends suggest a pick-up in prices of some cereals, edible oils and milk was offset by a continued correction in prices of onions and tomatoes in the current month. Moreover, average crude oil prices so far in March 2018 remain lower than the trend for the previous month. However, an unfavourable base effect for crude petroleum and natural gas, and fuel and power is likely to push up the WPI inflation in March 2018. At present, we expect the average WPI inflation to rise to 3.9% in FY2019 from around 2.9% in FY2018, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at credit rating agency ICRA.With both retail and wholesale inflation recording a decline in February 2018, the MPC is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged in the upcoming policy review in April 2018, she added."

Nearly 20,000 tons of white onion is lying at farmers end.White onion is dehydrated and exported in European countries. Out of the nearly 100 dehydration plants in Mahuva, 70 are in dysfunctional condition. Currently, farmers get Rs 60 to 70 per 20 kg, however, their production cost is Rs 140. According to farmers, they are booking losses in the prices for the last three years as a result of which the production this year has reduced by 25% compared to last year. This year, the production of white onion is nearly 45,000 ton, which was 60,000 ton last year.Chairman of Mahua market yard Ghanshyam Patel said, White onion is only exported and there is very little domestic consumption. The owners of dehydration plants compete with each other and sell onions at lowest price in the international market, which is US $900 to US $1200 per ton. However, the onions from other countries fetch between US $1,500 and US $1,800. We want government to fix minimum export price (MEP) for onion for the benefit of farmers.India exports 40% of worlds requirement of onion and its the second biggest exporter of onion after America, which sends out 45% of its produce. The export business of onion is centralized in Mahuva and white onion of Nashik also come to dehydration plants here.Former president of All India Dehydration Vegetables Association Vitthal Koradia said, We export 50,000 to 60,000 tons per year, but since last 2-3 years, we have over stocked because the prices are low. Last years stock is also lying in the cold storage and nearly 25,000 tons is unsold for which we are searching market. Our 70% plants are non-functional because they have no capacity to bear more loss.Traders wants government to implement pre-Goods and Service Tax (GST) policy for export. Before the implementation of GST, we used to get 7% transportation assistance, which has now been reduced to 3%. As a result, the transportation cost is increased. Traders who have huge stock are also paying interest on finance, rent and electricity bill of cold storage. We are also facing tough competition from China and America."

He found the man haggling with an ambulance driver to get his dead childs body to the graveyard. Pasha saw the father send the body off and then head in his direction. He wanted to know if there was a canteen nearby where he could have a meal. The man hadnt eaten all day, he said, hoping to save the money for his childs treatment. It was that encounter that led to the initiative Doh Roti  started by Pasha and his friend Fayaz Ahmed about two months ago.Along with a group of volunteers and help from well-wishers, they make and distribute 400 meals (rice and dal) and 300 rotis to relatives of patients atHospital,Cancer Hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center.The duo first began distributing meals to about 300 people every day near IGICH. Later, they met Mysurus Body Miyan Ayub Ahmed (who has been performing the last rites for unclaimed bodies, for the last twenty years in Mysuru), and Azhar Maqsudi (who feeds the hungry in Hyderabad in a similar initiative). With help and advice from them, Pasha and Ahmed scaled up and Doh Roti was started.(BM wrote about Ayub Ahmed on Feb 13, 2017 - Call him Body Miyan.)Pasha, who runs a hotel in, says: We took a room in Bilal Masjid to cook the food. Now we are a group of 25 volunteers. Every day, we cook between 10 am and 1 pm. After prayers, we begin the distribution. In the first round, relatives of patients at Jayadeva hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center get the meals. Then, we go toand distribute there.The groups aim, he says, is to ensure that nobody sleeps hungry. Hunger has no religion, he adds.Arul Subramani, who runs an NGO for those infected with HIV, volunteers with this group.Weve been friends for a long time so it was easy to make this possible. We cook about 35 kg of rice every day. We also need about 12 kg of onion and tomato, 3 kg of other vegetables; this we usually get through contributions. A small food company here gives the 300 rotis. Each meal costs us Rs22, he explains.Sometimes, demand overshoots supply, and they have to replenish before heading for Kidwai, but its all taken care of.Ahmed, who co-founded the initiative, saysis a hospital hub. Patients come from various parts of the state and country for treatment and they stay on. While the government provides free food for patients, their caretakers have to fend for themselves. Not everybody can afford to eat out three meals. This is why we want to help, he explains.Luckily for them, theres plenty of help available. Their initiative has inspired others to open their hearts too. Ansar Khan, also a volunteer, tells how. I buy the vegetables from a shop in Madiwala. One day, the woman from whom I buy in bulk got curious and asked me why I needed so much every day and I explained to her our work.
