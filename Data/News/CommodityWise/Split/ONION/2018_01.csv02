Though the production figure of 127.95 lakh tonnes during 2014-15 remains the best for the State, performance during 2017-18 was significant as it signalled the stabilisation of the foodgrain production at about 110 lakh tonnes. Since 2011-12, this has become the pattern, except in two years (2012-13 and 2016-17) when the State was in the grip of acute drought.During the northeast monsoon (October-December) last year, the State received 40 cm rainfall against the expected 44 cm, recording a deviation of 9%, which, in meteorological parlance, was considered normal. As for the receipt of Cauvery water, the deficit was around 72 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) till the end of April. Against the overall due of 189.5 TMC, the State realised about 117 TMC.In recent years, a discernible pattern in the foodgrain production of the State has been the increasing share of millets in the total production.Ten years ago, millets accounted for not more than 25% of the overall production. But, now, they constitute at least 33%K. Ramasamy, Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, attributes the farmers performance to adoption of technology and growing awareness of crop diversification. No longer do many farmers in the Cauvery delta want to raise paddy alone, Prof. Ramasamy points out.Also, there is the tendency of some farmers in the delta, who own pumpsets, to share groundwater with needy ones, of course for a charge, the Vice-Chancellor says.In the western region of the State, agriculturists in the belt from Palladam to Udumalpet have a flexible approach. When they get water through the Parambikulam-Aliyar canal, they use it for raising paddy. On other occasions, they switch to drip irrigation for producing onion and maize.Acknowledging that the State does not any longer struggle to touch the 100-lakh-tonne-mark in foodgrain production, S. Ranganathan, general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, cites a host of reasons including the governments schemes of subsidy and incentives. In the last few years, the allocation for micro-irrigation has gone up manifold.He emphasises that the authorities should intensify their steps towards weaning the farmers in the new delta areas away from their paddy-centric approach, which was an offshoot of the commissioning of the Mettur dam in the mid-1930s.Expressing concern over the fast-depleting groundwater in the region which covers Pudukottai district and parts of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur, Mr. Ranganathan wants the government to educate and motivate the farmers to opt for two crops of pulses and one crop of cotton."

Farmers are getting a price of Rs. 12 or below as businessmen getting cold feet about purchasing as the demand dropped. The average price for onion in the local market in the State is Rs. 25 to 30.Why the sudden drop in the prices of onion which reached Rs. 160 in the middle of last year? Arrival of large quantities of onion during the harvesting season is said to be the reason for the drop.Manikandan, an onion farmer in Cumbom valley, said that he had left with no option but to sell it at the market prices. If not sold it now, large quantity would be lost as the rains would cause rotting.He said that lack of storage facilities and the possibility of rotting prompted him to sell the produce at the low prices which would not cover the production cost. The main reason is the tendency of vegetable farmers to cultivate a particular crop which got high price in the last harvesting season.All the farmers preferred onion cultivation as its prices were at a high during the last harvesting season. The farmers fearing further price drop brought the produce to the market. This caused the prices to drop further.However, marketing sources said the prices would pick up slowly once the market is flooded with onion."

The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.A major onion grower of the district Nivrutti Nyaharkar said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility."

It is a lifestyle that encourages the redesigning of resources to prolong their life cycles. The goal is for no trash to be sent out.Vandana K, a minimalist, defines the zero-waste lifestyle as ""sending the least possible waste to landfills and not forcing juvenile rag pickers to collect your unsegregated garbage."" According to a report by the Ministry of Environment and Forest in 2016, about 62 million tonnes of waste is produced in India annually, 5.6 million of which is plastic. The report also underlines that 43 million tonnes of waste is collected, out of which 11.9 million is treated and the rest 31 million is dumped in landfill sites. Amid this urban lifestyle, these women  Deepa Ratika Deshpande, Monika Khanna Gulati and Vandana K  have chosen to declutter and lead an eco-friendly, no-rubbish lifestyle.Homegrown organic seeds and soapnut plantVandana, 28, is a south Delhi resident who works as a freelance writer. She started to consume cautiously, upgraded to minimal consumption and has now produced a small jar of trash in the last six months. Deepa, 35, is a sustainable life coach and zero waster staying in East of Kailash.Monika, a graphic designer, is a mother of two sons and has a family of five practising minimal consumption. She says, ""In a family of five, we produce only 250 gms of trash in a span of 3-4 weeks."" Monika is an avid comopositer at Nirvana Country, Gurgaon.Homemade cleaning solutionsRatika Deshpande, a 17-year-old resident of Palam area, lives with a family of seven members and decided to practice minimal living. ""She tells us what to do and we follow,"" says Ratika's father. ""There is always an environmental friendly option to everything we use, we just need to opt for those,"" clarifies Ratika. These women say that the six Rs  Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, and Recycle  of sustainable living, are the key elements they have adopted to reduce garbage. We find out more about their lifestyle choices and the alternatives they've adapted to.Mooncup and cotton padThese women choose to make their beauty products at home to avoid throwingout plastic waste.For moisturising, she recommends coconut oil. ""The soap nut (ritha) costs me Rs 70-80 per kg. I use it as a hair cleaner and it lasts for about three months, much more economical and healthier than a branded shampoo,"" she says.Vandana KWe make hot oil at home for my grandmother's joints. For bathing, oil and clay paste is used by my entire family.Deepa doesn't use any bath and body products. She says that the only product she uses is a tooth powder and a bamboo toothbrush. In place of sanitary napkins, they use moon cups and cloth pads.Deepa composting dry leaves and garden wasteApart from compositing, they also make snacks and masalas at home. ""It saves packaging waste and I always know what's going into my body,"" she says. Ratika adds that the snacks they cook and the products they make at home are multipurpose and since the ingredients are basic, they hardly cost anything.She buys groceries from local markets in the cloth bags she stitches to avoid packaging waste. ""Everything you need for sustainable living is a one-time cost and their lifespan is always very long,"" she says.She grows vegetables on her terrace garden. ""Raw leaves and water is my usual breakfast.

But the delicious snacks the shop has been serving all these years have won a lot of admirers for the 55-year-old woman. The eatery which has many loyal customers is located on West Adaiyavalanjan Street in Srirangam.Ask one of her regular snackers what they love to pick first from the shop and the answer is likely to be Tirumaal vadai. That is one item which my customers never get tired of. Within minutes of preparing the vadais, they get sold out. Most of those who come to my eatery tell me that ours is the best vadai they have ever tasted, says Shagunthala proudly. The specialty vadai is made of black gram and pepper. Besides this sought-after snack, the eatery also has a dedicated following for mint and onion pakoda.Asked how she learnt to make Tirumaal vadai, she said, It kind of tastes like vadais that we get as prasad in temples. I just made my own version of it. According to her, at least 500 customers come to her eatery every day. This is the reason why I make sure I dont take leave and my shop is open throughout the year, she said.Open from 4.30 pm to 8.30 pm, the other snack varieties at Shagunthalas shop include medhu vadai, masala vadai, potato bonda, chilli bajji, plantain bajji apart from the sweets adhirasam and boli. While adhirasam and boli cost Rs 5 apiece, four pieces of the rest of the items are available at Rs 10.Shagunthala credited much of her eaterys success to her husband. Though I run it, my husband helps me a lot. Hes the one who prepares the dough for all the items. He never gets tired, she said. The Srirangam-resident said she was immensely satisfied with the fact that the prime reason to start the eatery had been fulfilled. I started it so that I could provide good education to my children. My son is now working abroad and my daughter is leading a happy married life. This is all I wanted, she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her business, she said, No, not at all. Its tough to manage this place itself. If I get greedy, Ill ultimately be the sufferer in the end, she said."

The arrival of summer onions has increased to 40% of the total arrivals. Also, there has been an increase in arrival of onions in other markets. This has led to a drop in demand from Nashik .The price trend is expected to be downwards for the next two-three weeks considering the huge arrival of onions. Farmers cant store kharif crop as its shelf life is less than a month. Hence, the prices are expected to drop to Rs 750 per quintal, said an APMC official.The minimum and maximum wholesale prices were Rs 700 and Rs 1,080 per quintal, respectively, on Wednesday, when around 20,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.The drop in the wholesale prices reflected in the retail market where the prices have dropped from Rs 40 a kg to Rs 20 a kg in a month.In a bid to stop the fall in prices, the Union government had removed the minimum export price on onion last month. However, the prices continued to decline.Meanwhile, the harvest of summer onions is expected to pick up in the next two weeks. The late kharif harvest is expected to continue till Mach-end while summer harvest till April-end."

But an audience with the 75-year-old farmer of T Kalathur in Perambalur district reveals that it is his singular effort undertaken with a lot of passion in the face of acute water shortage.Mohanakrishnans feat is that he has been growing and selling nearly a thousand varieties of herbs, medicinal plants and trees, many of them rare, on 15 acres of his ancestral land for the past 40 years. While most of these are organically grown, he has also been cultivating onion and cotton for livelihood.Here is a list of the trees he has been growing  Ven Naval, Aathi, Thiruvodu, Vengai, Karungali (used for making temple caskets), Kadukai, DEDE tree (for making natural colour), Mattipal (making frankincense) and Laxmitharu (medicine for diabetic). The herbs include Aathandai, Kundumani, Athi Mathuram, Thaya plant (for sugar), Insulin plant, Ranakalli (for kidney ailments), Milakarani (medicine for poisonous bites), Arockya Patchai, Onan Kodi, Melkathikgai, Mul Nangai, Poonai Meesai, Thazhuthalai (knee pain). ll of them are on the verge of extinction, says Mohanakrishnan.Since his ancestors were practising Ayurveda, he had initially thought of following the tradition. However, he changed his mind later and decided to grow the herbs for commercial purpose. My grandfather as well as my father practised Ayurvedic medicine. When I was thinking of becoming an Ayurveda doctor, I realised that it will not help me earn a decent income. That changed my mind and I started concentrating on nurturing all types of medicinal plants, herbs and trees. My sons M Mahendran and M Muralikrishnan are helping me out, he added.He has spent several days crisscrossing the state in search of rare medicinal plants and herbs and on the foothills of Pachamalai and Kolli hills. He had also visited these hills many times with college students to help them identify rare herbs. Mohanakrishnan has also addressed many workshops conducted at Agriculture University in Coimbatore and several colleges across the state to create awareness on the importance of herbs, rare medicinal plants and trees and how those should be safeguarded.On the business front, many people do visit his farm at T Kalathur to buy rare varieties for the preparation of medicines. However, he says his dreams to make it big have been hampered by water shortage. He had donated an acre of land to the government to establish a farm pond, which was now providing water to many farmers. Water is the main constraint for nurturing plants. If the state government extends a helping hand, I can grow more plants which would ultimately benefit our people. If I get a loan to establish water sources or to market the plants commercially I will be able to expand the farm in a big way, he said."

According to market sources, the retail onion prices are likely to increase to Rs 20/kg in a couple of days if the auction continues to take the hit due to the strike.The crash in the wholesale onion prices and farmers strike have altogether led to a drop in supply at Lasalgaon APMC, said Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the APMC.Earlier, the average wholesale onion prices had crashed by almost 65% from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 18.A farmer spends Rs 900 for a quintal on onions as cost of cultivation and if the produce fetches anything below this means huge loss.Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop, having a shelf life of five months. Harvesting of summer onions was over in April and most of the farmers have stored their produce with the hope of getting better prices. The onions stored by farmers cater to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif crop in the second half of October."

Among other vegetables whose prices have suddenly registered a sharp hike in two days include onions, cauliflower and potatoes.Surinder Bindra, general secretary of the fruit and vegetable merchant union at Vallah market, informed TOI on Saturday that the vegetable supply had come down to nearly half in two days of the farmers strike, which had resulted in hike in the vegetable prices, ranging from Rs 5 to Rs 20 per kg. He further said onion supply had suffered the most. As against the arrival of nearly 20-25 truckload of onions every day, not a single truck has arrived in the past two days. As a result, the onion price in retail has reached Rs 25 per kg from Rs 13 per kg, Bindra said.Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, a conglomerate of around 130 farmer outfits, had announced a 10-day strike from June 1 to 10 in support of their demands.Another vegetable wholesaler Pal Singh stated that farmers boycott had started showing its impact in Vallah. He said the situation could worsen if the farmers boycott continued for a week or so. Another wholesale vegetable seller Balwinder Kumar said that vegetables, including cauliflower, tomato, cabbage, spinach and peas, have registered a rise between Rs 7 and 11 per kg.Meanwhile, supply of green fodder for animals have also been severely affected in Amritsar district, forcing dairy owners to give wheat straw mixed with choker (powdered animal feed) to the cattle.

The construction work was taken up in 2015 and was completed a few months ago, S Vellayappan, president, Trichy Wholesale Onion Traders Association, said.The land was said to be bought by the association in the 1990s. While only 78 wholesale onion traders are functioning in the corporation-run shops on the Sub Jail Road in Gandhi Market, the private market has 101 shops with facilities to stock large and small onions. Though the market is spacious and furnished with basic amenities, the approach road merging with Chennai-Trichy bypass apparently has a narrow entry which could cause a bottleneck on the stretch. Close to 145 heavy vehicles, including from Maharashtra, Perambalur, Namakkal, and Thuraiyur, will come to the facility to trade large and small onions. The market will supply onions to as many as 10 central districts here.After state ministers Vellamandi N Natarajan and S Valarmathi opened the facility in the presence of traders representatives on Sunday, wholesale onion traders said that around 78 wholesale onion traders operating from Gandhi market for now will be relocated to the private market in a months time. With the market being opened, the public has sought the traffic police department to ensure that heavy vehicles are not parked over the Chennai-Trichy NH service road causing bottleneck at the Palpannai junction where two national highways merge."

As many as 101 shops will be available at the private onion market having 40ft roads, toilets and retiring rooms for loadmen inside the complex.Gandhi market has been a burden for us in unloading the onion produce and divert the same to other districts. Since we had adequate land registered with our association, we established the private market on our own with various facilities, said S Vellayappan , president, Trichy Onion Traders Association.As the construction works were completed a few months ago, onion traders planned to open the market on Sunday. The relocation of onion traders currently occupying corporation shops on Sub Jail road will be completed in a week.The shifting by 78 onion traders will be a huge relief to the district administration to decongest the Gandhi market. However, the private market which will be occupied exclusively by onion traders has raised concerns among road safety activists.The private market with a narrow entrance is situated on the service road. The district administration as well as the onion traders should ensure that the vehicles visiting market are parked inside the complex and not on the service road, said M Sekaran, member, road safety council. Since the private market is situated close to the Palpannai junction where the Trichy-Thanjavur and Trichy-Chennai national highways meet, Sekaran had also sought the traffic wing to not entertain heavy vehicles approaching the service road in the wrong direction.As the private market set to commence operation from next week, both the traffic police department and the onion traders have assured that heavy vehicles would be strictly made to park in the private market so vehicle movement is not disrupted."

Petrol , too, has reached an all-time high of Rs 78.91 a litre in Kolkata and is inching towards breaching the Rs-80-a-litre mark, but it is the hike in diesel price that has the transport sector more worried.I have tracked diesel prices since the last three decades and not seen anything like this, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association president Tushar Kanti Sen said. On Sunday, diesel price in the city increased 26 paise to hit Rs 70.12 per litre.This may have a direct impact on inflation in the short term, economist Abhirup Sarkar said. The worry is that the price of essentials may see a sudden spike, he added.Economists fears are not unfounded. Bus operators have barely waited for the panchayat poll results to be declared before pressing for a hike in fares again.Truck operators have called an emergency meeting for an imminent strike as they will be hit the hardest by the diesel price hike. Subhas Bose, general secretary of West Bengal Truck Operators Welfare Association, said: All India Motor Congress is scheduled go for an indefinite strike from June. But we might need to call the strike much earlier.Tapan Bandyopadhyay of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said, Operating buses have become completely unviable. If the government does not raise fares immediately, the private bus trade will go into a coma. Fares were last revised in September 2014 when diesel price was Rs 54/lt. Now, the situation is such that we dont even need to call a strike for our demands, he added.The diesel price hike is expected to have a direct impact on the prices of food items. Bengal imports coconut from Kerala, medicines from Mumbai, onion from Nasik and textile from Gujarat and Punjab . The fare for a 12-wheel trucks Kolkata-Mumbai round trip is Rs 1.5 lakh. The diesel price rise this May alone will increase that amount by Rs 12,000. It will obviously have a ripple effect on everything, said Bose.Oil PSUs are estimated to have lost about Rs 500 crore on absorbing higher cost resulting from the spike in international oil rates and fall in rupee against the US dollar during the nearly-three-week hiatus because of the Karnataka assembly polls. The bad news is that diesel prices will travel north further to match current international prices. The benchmark international diesel rates during this period have climbed from US$ 84.68 per barrel to US$ 90.28 per barrel. Also, the rupee has weakened to Rs 67.27 per US dollar from Rs 66.62, making imports costlier, explained transport economist Tarit Dasgupta.There is also a strong demand for bringing petrol and diesel under the purview of GST. This would have reduced the fuel price considerably. But the governments have treated fuel price as the biggest source of revenue. This is why a number of cess and taxes are imposed on the fuel to make it costlier than what it should be, said a logistics farm official."

Many eateries in the city provided them early morning (sehri) and evening meals (iftaar) before and after the fast (roza) on Thursday.Eateries in areas like Sabzibagh and Ramna Road prepared variety of dishes, including chana, pakoda, potato and egg cutlet, bread pakoda, onion and brinjal fries, imarti, fruit salad, for devotees to break their fast in the evening.We began preparing the meal from 3.30pm on Thursday and continued till the time of sehri in the wee hours on Friday. We are open 24X7 during the holy month to serve those who live alone in the city, Md Mokhtar, the staff of a small hotel on Ramna Road, said and added mostly boys and girls living in hostels came to eat food at the hotel during Ramzan.Another restaurant owner at Sabzibagh said, I start preparing sehri from 2am so that the food gets prepared on time. I make sure the ingredients used in the process are pure and healthy. Items made of milk like shaahi tukda, doodh lacchha and sewai are popular among customers as they make them feel energetic for the rest of the day.While some devotees are trying to eat healthy by consuming food cooked at home, those staying away from home are finding it difficult to look for healthy food options to break their fast.Gulfashan Ehsan, a postgraduate student of a Pune-based college, said, I am glad my summer break has started during the month of Ramzan. It is important to have healthy food after breaking the fast, but my hostel canteen does not provide hygienic food.Working professionals rued that they did not get much time in office to have proper meal during iftaar. According to Anam Ahsan, a dentist by profession, My patients are my first priority. I break the fast with a khajoor (date) and some water and take my meal once I reach home.Imbesat Imam, a working mother, told TOI, I keep my food simple and conserve energy as much as possible.

Incredible that the Rohingya Muslim refugee should express such optimism when all that he had in his claustrophobic shack as the iftar meal were slices of water melon for himself, his wife and three children to quench their thirst, and afterward a humble meal of rice and vegetables and a cucumber and onion salad.At iftar on the first Friday of the holy month of Ramzan, the family ate in silence under the glow of the white light that highlighted the claustrophobic interiors of their plastic and bamboo shelter. As the sun went down, the same scene played out in the other tents at Kalindi Kunj, where 48 Rohingya families were trying to come to terms with their already burdened lives facing, on April 15, another trial by fire, literally, when their huts were destroyed by a blaze.Some time earlier, around 6pm, men, women and children had all gathered at the new camps lone tap near the entrance, some to wash pots and pans, others to freshen up after a hot, harsh day of fasting. Mohammad Salimullah, who used to run a small shop at the camp that was lost to fire, surveyed the crowd. We have just one water tap for so many families. There always are queues here and the water is not enough for everyones use, he said.On Friday, TOI could sense during its visit to the new camp that amid the trauma of the fire and the financial losses, the families were stoically forgetting their overwhelming challenges and injecting some degree of normalcy in their lives through fasting and praying as if life was routine. The dismal camp site with its wild growth of shrubs and muddy ditches seemed to reflect their fate, but then the refugees seem to have accepted that uncertainty has become a part of their life since they fled Myanmar to escape persecution.There are 25-odd tents in the camp now, each home to three-four families and there is a constant fight for space. The recent storms have added to the misery of the families, leaving them holding dearly on to their possession in their tented home  perhaps wondering how much more they would have to suffer.Their most precious possession appeared to be their refugee document. Ahmed, who works at a graveyard in the vicinity, told TOI that when the fire burnt his shack to the ground, his biggest anxiety was the loss of the UNHCR document establishing his refugee identity. But relief showing on his face, he flashed a brand new card given by the UN body for refugees, and said he hoped to get back on his feet soon. A few houses away, Saida Begum remembered her home in Rakhine in Myanmar, of how they were forced to flee to Bangladesh first and then travel to India.After their simple iftar meals, the men headed for the makeshift mosque  a bamboo, tarpaulin and tin structure where the only relief came from a single desert cooler in the corner  while the women began preparing dinner. As night fell, the air grew thick with mosquitoes. The families would eat and sleep early to wake up before dawn in preparation of another day of fasting  and another day of struggle."

The stretch then runs with onion and wheat fields on either sides and reaches Vrindavan Gardens. The kids from the shanties nearby are often seen playing on this narrow road which struggles to even make space for two cars when they pass each other.The residents in the area say they often have to speed up their vehicles to avoid sliding to a side.Natasha, an engineering student living in a nearby housing society, said, It is quite common that the side mirrors often brush past when two cars pass each other on this narrow road. There have been minor accidents too. The people residing in the housing societies nearby are of the view that to widen the road, the Zirakpur municipal council (MC) needs to acquire land from the person owning the fields on both sides.The MC has to pay him, to widen this narrow stretch that runs till Bollywood Heights housing society, said Vinod Raina, a resident of Vrindavan Gardens housing society. The road was dark back then and it is still so, he rued. We have approached the MC a number of times but to no avail.Natasha too expressed concern about going out for a walk in the evening. Not only does it seem unsafe for women, it is actually dangerous for anyone in any age group, she said.Things have not improved due to absence of any strong RWA in the area. Residents of a few nearby housing societies have also been involved in disputes with their builders, thus leading to neglect of other issues. The executive officer at Zirakpur municipal corporation, Manbir Singh Gill , said, The electricity poles will soon be fitted with advanced LED lights. The procedure is in progress. When asked about the narrow road, he said, We will look into the possibilities and decide upon it. Land, there, is quite costly and we are working on it, and he said that the executive engineer who was assigned these works has been replaced by a new person and hence the delay."

It was later taken over by Khed Sinnar Expressway Limited (KSEL). While work on nearly 109 km stretch has been completed between Nagar and Nashik, non-completion of work on the Pune stretch for over 57 km has delayed opening of the highway.Delayed compensation to farmers and unwillingness of villagers to hand over land for construction of bypasses are the reasons for the work being carried out at a snail's pace since 2014, stated officials. The project is likely to be completed only by 2019.With disbursement of funds delayed in Pune district, the work on 28.5 km stretch out of the 57.5 km is pending, according to NHAI officials.The Pune-Nashik stretch consists of five bypasses -- Khed, Manchar, Kalamb, Narayangaon and Alephata -- and Khed ghat realignment, which is yet to be completed, the officials said.The state government has disbursed compensation amount of Rs 721.56 crore to the land acquisition officer. However, only Rs 540.37 crore has been actually disbursed. Farmers are not allowing construction work due to non-disbursement of full compensation amount, said National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials. The issue was discussed at a highway review meeting attended by Union Mminister for road transport Nitin Gadkari recently.Another amount of Rs 53 crore, disbursed by the government, was deposited by the land acquisition officer in court due to various litigations. Due to the delay in disbursement of the amount, villagers have opposed the acquisition.It was decided that the amount will be disbursed within a month as directed by Pune guardian minister Girish Bapat,the official said.Another sore point has been the issue of transfer of land from Directorate of Onion And Garlic Research (DOGR), Rajgurunagar, to NHAI.The delay in transfer of land is hampering construction of grade separator at Khed. Recently, the institute had requested for shifting of the alignment of highway in front of ICAR institute but it was denied on grounds of safety. While DOGR has sought compensation for the said land, NHAI stated that if the land belongs to the Central government, no compensation will be paid."

Earlier, all the trade unions had locked horns with the district administration over the move to shift the congested market to the integrated vegetable market complex in Kallikudi.The agriculture marketing and agriculture business department has been distributing applications to allot shops for wholesale traders in the newly-built integrated market. As announced, the district administration will be implementing the ban on entry of heavy vehicles carrying vegetables to the Gandhi market area from June 1.On Thursday, three major trade unions, DMKs Labour Progressive Front (LPF), VCKs Labour Liberation Front (LLF) and CPMs Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), erected their respective flag masts at the integrated market signifying their indirect approval for the relocation. Establishing a flag mast of a trade union in the integrated market locality is like labourers giving No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Gandhi Market relocation. Labourers may have felt job insecurity since their reluctance to move to the new market facility may push the traders to employ local people at the new market, K Suresh, district secretary, Communist Party of India (CPI), said. Peeved at the traffic congestion recurring in the Gandhi market, local people have for long been demanding the relocation.Being a major trade union with most labourers enrolled in the onion market, the flag mast of LPF in Kallikudi integrated market was seen by officials as a positive development. Our intention behind establishing a flag mast at Kallikudi vegetable market is to ensure employment for existing labourers of Gandhi market even after the relocation, R Sampath, district secretary, CITU, told TOI. Most of the trade unions, including the communist-backed ones, had been protesting the relocation of Gandhi market since early 2016."
5b1b443e9855b76d57038bf9,Here’s how night soil improved yield,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heres-how-night-soil-improved-yield/articleshow/64039638.cms,2018-05-05,"Sometime in November last year, a tempo drove into the Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) campus on Pune-Nashik Highway. To the surprise of researchers at this centre, it was carrying sacks filled with a kind of manure that they had never worked with before. Over the next few weeks, this substance was tested for efficacy; eventually, four six square metre plots were readied on this massive campus, with the idea of growing onions using different manures available with the institute, including the one that had just arrived.A good hundred days later, on Friday, May 4, 2018, the researchers harvested the plots to find startling results. The newly acquired manure had given the highest yield of the lot, beating both organic compost and chemical fertiliser. The material that won is night soil  or human faeces  excavated from two separate toilet pits in Ambegaon and Khed.The plot with organic manure gave an output of 18.22 kg, while the one enriched by chemical fertiliser generated 24.7 kg of onions. Another plot  which contained a mix of fertiliser, organic manure and night soil  gave out 21.81kg. But the plot pumped with only night soil plot yielded 26.87 kg of onions, beating all the other three. Boosted by the success of this newfound material, the premier research institute run by the Central government will now carry out several tests on soil, onions and the manure itself, to ensure that it is safe in all aspects for further usage.The idea, according to Dr Major Singh, director of DOGR, came from Ayush Prasad, an IAS officer who is posted as sub-divisional magistrate in Khed, located 50 km from Pune. The bureaucrat was posted in Osmanabad during his first stint, which was when he thought of the idea of making use of human waste.In Osmanabad, we were faced with the challenge of building toilets under the governments open defecation free (ODF) programme. While we were convincing people to build toilets, yet another issue was at hand  making them use the loos that were already completed. There was also some inertia among locals about using toilets, said the 29-year-old bureaucrat. Prasad explained that faced with multiple challenges, he came up with the idea of incentivising the use of toilets, by utilising the night soil collected in pits connected to the latrines. However, he had no way to formalise the plan back then.In October 2017, when he was transferred to Khed, Prasad got in touch with DOGR scientists, who carry out extensive research on onion and garlic crops. He had already teamed up with Jayant Deshpande, state coordinator of UNICEF, who had done extensive research on the subject as well. First, Prasad got the district administration to identify toilet pits that were full and needed to be emptied. Next, he got the night soil picked up and delivered to DOGR, where scientists picked it up for tests.Ayush Prasad (second from left) is spearheading the effortScientists at DOGR explained that while this was their first experiment with night soil  and also that of any government body in the country  the results are very encouraging. This is very first time in India that scientific research is being done with night soil. Its yield seems to be far better than other manures. In the next few weeks, we will carry out further tests to ensure that the produce is safe for consumption, as also test the soil for the effect the manure has on it, among other checks, said Dr Singh. His team members, Dr Amar Jeet Gupta and Dr A Thangasamy, are equally confident that the night soil is by far the best manure they have come across so far.While scientists at DOGR are back at work to establish that the produce grown using night soil is safe for consumption, the state coordinator for UNICEF has already compiled data to start collecting the manure from toilets across the state. From the data we have compiled so far, there are around 1.44 crore toilet pits in Maharashtra, most of which have been dug up to build toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. It takes around seven years for a pit to get filled up if the toilet is used by a family of five. Going by this, we will be able to take out night soil from 5,636 pits every day. A single pit gives out some 70 kg of manure. This way, we will be able to generate 1,400 tonnes of night soil every year, said Deshpande.Deshpande explained that the process of getting night soil is quite simple. Once a pit is full, most families start using the second pit built along with the toilet. The full pit needs to lie idle for about a year, and get exposed to the atmosphere for a few days after that. Nature takes care of the rest. What you end up getting after all this is fine material that resembles tea powder. It has no foul stench, as most would think. All one has to do is use it as any manure on crops, Deshpande elaborated.With everything looking good so far, Prasad has already pinned his hopes on commercially exploiting this material, which is readily available in droves. Since he also holds charge of the tribal development department for Pune district, Prasad feels that the new manure will generate employment for the underprivileged. We are working on the idea of forming selfhelp groups that can identify pits in their areas. The pits can be emptied and manure packaged after some basic treatment, said Prasad, who on Friday presented the concept to Adhalrao Patil, a Member of Parliament (MP) from Shirur.Prasad believes that once the material gets a green light from DOGR, it will not only help the government promote the use of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, but will also arrest the degradation of soil and ground water due to rampant use of chemical fertilisers. It will further address the issue of faecal management that the government is working on next, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, as all the pits will get emptied and the material in them will get used entirely. Most importantly, if we can restrict the use of chemical fertilisers and use night soil instead, we will end up saving a lot of foreign exchange that goes in purchasing fuel to manufacture them, said Prasad.MP Patil, who saw that night soil harvest was the best as compared to other manures, has asked Prasad and his team to make a detailed presentation. I can take it up in the Parliamentary standing committee, of which I am a member, which can then make representations to the agriculture ministry. I am certain that the concept will succeed. The only challenge I foresee is getting public participation, considering the stigma around the night soil. But, we can always work on this, Patil concluded."

It is one of the desired destinations for food enthusiasts for five decades.At least 250 people visit the eatery every day for their samosas and vaazhai poo vadai. The snacks are aptly served with tasty mint chutney. In fact, the vadais and samosas are prepared non-stop at the cart since they are immediately sold out once placed on the tray. Both vadai and samosa are priced at Rs 5 per piece.Mohamed is the third generation owner of the food cart, which was launched by his grandfather 50 years ago. ""Once I was handed over the cart, my first target was to experiment with the snack items that were served. I brought a twist to the conventional samosas by using vaazhai poo and onion as stuffing instead of the normal potato and onion,"" Mohamed said, adding that he chose vaazhai poo because of its health benefits.Since both wheat and maida flours are mixed in equal proportions for making the dough, the crispiness is very good, said the 50-year-old. ""The mint chutney, which is served with the snacks, is loved by everyone,"" he said.Though the cart is operates only from 5 pm to 8.30 pm in the evenings, work starts at 5 am for Mohamed. ""I go to Gandhi Market and purchase vegetables since I use only fresh ingredients and never use leftovers,"" he said. The preparation for the stuffing begins at 10 am and goes on up to 3 pm.When asked on why he restricted the menu to only two varieties of snack items, Mohamed said that he didnt want to take the risk and compromise on quality. ""I have only one helper and if I get greedy and add more snack items, to increase profit, I would end up losing my customers since it is impossible to maintain the same quality,"" he stated.The cart owner also said that he had no plans of expanding his business. ""I believe in minimalistic lifestyle. And its no different when it comes to my business too,"" he said with a philosophical note."
