Subsequently, we identified a godown where the goods were stored and kept a vigil, he said.Soon after the truck laden with the syrup bottles came out, the narcotics team stopped and searched it, the ADG added.The printed price on the syrup bottles led to an estimate that consignment was valued at Rs 61.44 lakh. But each syrup bottle is sold at Rs 300 in black market, thus escalating its value to Rs 1.92 crore, Kapoor said.The narcotics police also found 145 sacks of onions and seven sacks of potatoes in the truck.Truck driver Mohanlal Pathak, 54, a resident of Ravidas Nagar, was booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The driver told the interrogators that the he was paid a meagre sum to transport the consignment to Siliguri in West Bengal.We are in the process of ascertaining modus operandi of smugglers. Prima facie, it appears that the branded syrup was procured at godown through legal channels from Himachal Pradesh based manufacturing company. But they were being pushed into the back channels, Kapoor said.The cough syrup, which is often misused by addicts to get high due to the codeine content, is believed to be supplied by the dummy firms in the state through back-channels to Kolkata and Bangladesh , where the demand is high.In September 2017, Madhya Pradesh's drug controller's office had suspended licences of eight pharmaceutical wholesalers of Ujjain for a brief period, after a probe revealed that over six lakh bottles of codeine based cough syrups were sold by them to a dummy firm in Bhopal.According to United Nations Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC), codeine is a narcotic drug and causes addiction when used in large quantities over a period of time. Cough preparation containing chlorpheniramine maleate, an anti-histaminic, in addition to codeine phosphate, have been widely abused in certain areas of east and north-eastern states.Empty bottles of codeine phosphate cough syrups of different brands are often found in public and touristy places, a UNODC report said."

Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother.

Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop.

If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool.

We want to use this week to draw attention to the rich culture and food heritage of South Asia,"" said Romail Gulzar, who launched the concept in Leicester in the East Midlands region of England.""This triangle-shaped delicacy is said to originate from the Middle East and was eaten by travelling merchants. It is likely that this is how the tasty parcels made their way to other parts of the world including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh,"" said the editor of Pukaar News, a Leicester-based news service.Birmingham, Manchester, Coventry, Nottinghamshire and Radlett have come on board with the idea, which involves a range of activities including samosa-eating contests, pop-up samosa shops and tastiest samosa awards.The proceeds from the sale in Leicester are aimed at two charities -- mental health charity LAMP and Care of Police Survivors (COPS) -- dedicated to helping the families of police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty.""We want to encourage people all over the UK to buy or make their own samosas this week and sell them at work and school to raise funds for their local community or charities.""If you're feeling competitive, you could offer a prize for the best samosa, we think this could be the start of something really popular,"" said Pakistani-origin Gulzar, who migrated to the UK from Dubai.In 2016, he founded the ' Leicester Curry Awards ' to celebrate the hundreds of curry houses in the city with their roots in the Indian subcontinent.While he believes the world's best samosas are to be found in Delhi, he is determined to bring some of that flavour to the UK with the samosa week, set to become an annual event.""We want to encourage people to experiment with this fried snack, traditionally stuffed with spiced potatoes, onion and peas, but it can have meat and other options too. You can have vegan samosas as well,"" Gulzar said.Some of the winners of the National Samosa Week's prize draw will win tickets to the Leicester Curry Awards 2018, to be held in Leicester on April 22 where over 30 of the city's shortlisted restaurants will compete for the top prize."

Those who have registered for Bhavantar will get the benefit, too.Officials said the decision to exclude these three crops from Bhavantar was taken after the Centre announced benefits under the scheme for Kharif crops. The Centre is yet to decide whether to include Rabi crops, barring wheat and paddy, under Bhavantar.

He incorporated Vikram Global Commodities Private Limited with its headquarters at APMC Yard, on January 25, 2011. He and his wife, Sunitha Acharya, were directors of the firm, which had an authorized capital of Rs 5 crore and paid up capital of Rs 3.96 crore.A civil engineering graduate from BMS College of Engineering, Bengaluru, Srinath claimed that he learnt the rudiments of the commodities business in Singapore, where he worked for some time. He returned to India in early 2000 and began dabbling in agri produce exports.Srinath was born and brought up in Mysuru. His father Rama Rao , originally from Doddaballapur, 40km from Bengaluru, shifted to Mysuru and later to Bengaluru, a police officer said.A chance meeting with a distant relative, LIC agent and JP Nagar resident Narasimha Murthy, provided Srinath an opportunity to scale up his business. Impressed by Srinaths presentation of his agri produce export business, Murthy invested some money and got huge returns. Murthy immediately got his friends and relatives to invest in Srinaths business.Police said the other two accused  Sutram Suresh, a former sports journalist and resident of Malleswaram, and KC Nagaraj, a resident of Dommalur  are LIC agents who were introduced to Srinath by Murthy. Prahlad, a classmate of Srinath and resident of AGS Layout, too joined them.Srinath designated his four fellow accused as Wealth Managers. Police said Murthy targeted middle class people to invest in the firm, while Sutram brought in high-profile individuals, including sports personalities, doctors and engineers. The investments mobilized by these two run into several hundreds of crores. Prahlad and Nagaraj could only get investments of Rs 5 crore and Rs 4 crore, respectively, a police officer who is part of the investigation said.As investments grew, Srinath opened his firms branches at Yelahanka New Town and Banashankari in Bengaluru, and also in Chennai. A friend, Ashokan Vaithilingam, helped him run the commodities trading business from Chennai.Srinath floated Cargo & Logistics Management (India) Private Limited, which was incorporated with the Registrar of Companies in Chennai on May 25, 2012. The firm is headquartered at Dr Natesan Salai Extension, Ashok Nagar, Chennai. We are verifying the details of the Chennai firm, a police officer said."

Onion is selling for between Rs 3.50 and Rs 8 a kg at the Ahmedabad agriculture produce market committee (APMC), but is fetching Rs 20 to Rs 25 a kg in retail.At the Mahuva APMC , the biggest market yard for onion trading in the state, the price is between Rs 6.5 and Rs 15 per kg. However, at APMCs far from Mahuva, the situation is much worse. For example, at Visavadar APMC, onion is selling at Rs 1.25 to Rs 2 a kg.Farmers are forced to give their produce to villagers for free. Gordhan Paghdal, the sarpanch of Kuba (Ravani) village in Visavadar, said, On Thursday, Gordhan Dobariya, a farmer from the village announced that the onion crop in his field would be available for free. Many villagers went to his field and took as much as they could carry.The sarpanch said Dobariya was not even getting the cost of labour invested, which was around Rs 2 per kg. He thus decided to give it away for free. The Paghdal said several farmers in the village who were growing onions earlier have stopped doing so.Pratap Sardasiya, a farmer, says, Apart from the sowing cost, we have to pay for labour to harvest it, which is around Rs 2 per kg. We also need gunny bags, which cost Rs 30 for a 50-kg bag. The farmer also has to take his crop to Mahuva, and pay Rs 4 per kg for transport. If the farmer gets Rs 6.25 per kg, he is incurring a loss.Ghyanshyam Patel, chairman of Mahuva APMC, said, Onions that can be stored for five or six months are selling at a premium and only poor quality onions, which are wet, are selling for cheap. Low-quality onion cant be kept for more than 10 days.Ramesh Dhameliya, a farmer from near Mahuva who has 30 bigahs of land, said he has stopped sowing onion because he doesnt get a remunerative price. We are not even getting Rs 5 per kg but retailers are selling the crop for more than Rs 30 per kg. The government should regulate the price and ensure that farmers get good prices, he said."

Customers flock to his shop for the special delicacy keeping it busy all day.For 15 years the shop has been selling a range of savouries like sattur sevu, regular mixture, seeval and murukku. But the shop came to be known for its pakoda and was christened as Therku Vaasal Pakoda Kadai.The proprietor of the shop G Devakumar , a graduate, who took over his fathers business, says they make pakodas with same combination of ingredients like any other shop. But what makes it special is the way it is prepared. We do not buy gram flour in the market, instead we purchase quality Bengal gram and prepare the flour. To add up taste and make it healthy, we use only groundnut oil, he says. They also add cumin seeds and pepper while making the flour and while preparing the pakoda, a little ginger and chili paste is added to make it spicy and enhance the taste.One more reason for the popularity of the delicacy is that it is kept hot. They do not prepare and store it in heaps the entire day, although several kilograms of pakoda are sold every day. The delicacy is prepared fresh in small quantities and served hot from 7 am to 10 pm on any given day.One kilogram is sold at Rs180 and the sales starts from as minimum as 50 grams at Rs9. People who pass by, especially the elderly, would ask the pakodas for Rs5. We cannot say no to them, so we happily serve all types of customers, says Devakumar.His uncle D Thangaiah was the first to start a snack shop 30 years ago under NMR Subburaman Bridge at South Gate junction. Then, he went to start a separate shop in Vilangudi. Two of Devakumars relatives too run similar shops in the same locality.G Senthilkumar from Villapuram, a regular to the shop says his children love the pakoda from the shop. The pakoda can retain its crispiness and taste for at least one week, when kept in air tight container. But he prefers to buy it regularly as soon as it is taken out of the pan. It is our regular side dish with lunch. It goes well with any kind of kuzhambu. I also buy it whenever I visits my relatives settled outside Madurai, he said.Not only locals, but people who have settled abroad also get his snacks parcelled when they are in town. It is convenient too as the shop is located on the way to airport, says Devakumar."

My father was in this business and I grew up watching him cook. And when my husband needed financial help, I decided that I would open the eatery on my own and earn well through it, Saraswathi said.She stated that even before opening the eatery, she was clear that she wouldnt try anything fancy but only stick to preparing food items that shes known for. I know Im a good cook, but it doesnt mean every item I prepare would be good. Hence I decided to focus predominantly on only four dishes -- ravai dosai, adai, idli and dosai -- and customers proved that variety is not the only thing they are after, Saraswathi stated.Adai, which is provided along with aviyal, is the in-demand food item at the shop, while rava dosai is the second in the preference list of the customers. Both are served with sambar and two types of chutneys. Most of the compliments I get from the customers are that the food tastes similar to how their mother would prepare  this is the one which gives me immense satisfaction, she added ecstatically.While adai and onion adai are priced at Rs 25 and Rs 35 respectively, rava dosai and special rava dosai cost Rs 30 and Rs 35 respectively. Though the shop is usually open from 6 pm to 11 pm every day, sometimes, it gets closed earlier due to the food getting over soon due to heavy demand. For business sake, I could prepare more dough and increase the quantity, but it cant be done without compromising on the quality which I would never allow, claimed the Srirangam resident.She also said that idli, which is available at Rs 5/ per piece, is a hit among children especially because podi is given as an accompaniment. Saraswathi said, Even podi is prepared at my house. I sometimes feel I could earn even more if I sell podi packets alone because they in huge demand at my eatery.Saraswathis son, R Vedanarayanan , has been taking care of the logistics at the eatery, while one cook and two waiters are there to assist the mother-son duo."

The labourers claimed that the private onion market had employed newcomers for minimal wages instead of providing employment to the labourers associated with the onion traders in Gandhi market for three decades.Recently as the 4 acre private complex to house 101 wholesale onion traders was inaugurated over the service road of Chennai-Trichy National Highways, the private market of late is said to be used for stocking large and small onions. Though a few traders from Gandhi market have been using the new facility, instead of employing usual and existing workforce employed for daily wages in loading and unloading onion stocks, the private market had reportedly employed a new set of labourers from Ariyamangalam for minimal wages.It is said that, on Friday morning, new labourers were employed reportedly for cheaper wage against the wage of Rs 6 per onion sack (55kg) provided for existing labourers. Upon hearing that new workforce was given jobs in the new private market, labours attached to DMKs Labour Progressive Front (LPF), VCKs Labour Liberation Front (LLF) and CPMs Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) laid a siege to the premises.By employing a new set of labourers, our job security is under threat. Citing low wages, the private market is keen on abandoning us as the cheap workforce is available, G K Ramar, deputy secretary of CITU said. Subsequently, as labourers assembled near the private onion market, police personnel intervened the situation and insisted the upset labourers to solve the dispute amicably through peace talks. We have planned to approach the district administration to safeguard our job security. New private onion market should not employ a new workforce, Ramar added."
