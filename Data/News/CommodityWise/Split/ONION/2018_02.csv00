The prices have decreased from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 21.In the retail market, onions are being sold at Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg following the fall in wholesale prices.The minimum and maximum prices at Lasalgaon APMC on Monday were Rs 400 and Rs 861 per quintal, respectively, when around 8,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.The harvest of summer onions is in full swing and that has led to rise in supply. Also, the demand for onions have reduced because of the ongoing holy month of Ramzan. All this has led to decline in prices, APMC officials said.Usually, farmers prefer storing summer onions, as it has a shelf life of five to six months, with a hope of getting better price later. But there is a vast section of farmers who need money and are bringing their produce to the APMCs, the official added.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, Onions with inferior quality or which cant be stored are being brought to the APMCs. The poor quality onions are fetching low rates. This is the major reason behind the fall in prices.Holkar said the wholesale prices would either prevail at the present rate or will slide further till June 15, after which the prices would increase.Last month, the central government roped in the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd to procure onions in a bid to stabilise prices. But the prices continued to drop."

A time when the devout fast from pre-dawn to sunset. It is also when the citys quaint areas  the bylanes off Mohammed Ali Road Bhendi Bazar and the heart of Bohri Mohalla  come to life with mouth-watering foods. BT went to the most popular of these spots  the bustling and beautiful Minara Masjid gully. Head here by 7 pm to catch the buzz, sights and sounds that it is so known for. And take your appetites along. The brightly-lit lane has little stalls on either side dishing up rolls, kebabs, baida roti, rich haleem and khichda , chilled firnis and, of course, piping hot malpuas, drizzled with thick cream. Heres more...Right at the entrance of the lane is a little makeshift stall with a huge handi or cauldron of khichda. This is a specialty  made of delicious, slow-cooked meat and lentils and garnished with thin slices of garlic, birasta (fried onion), mint leaves, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Its said to infuse energy in those who are fasting to last through the day! You will also find a lighter and creamier version of the dish  the Hyderbadi badaami haleem  here.There are several finger foods to tuck into. Try the Chicken 65 (a fiery import from Andhra Pradesh), garam samosas, masala aloo, and more, with some naan.When youre here, reserve your appetite for kebabs, kheema, boti, bheja fry and other skewered fare, hot off the sigdi and made on a large, iron tawa. These dishes must be had steaming hot, with dollops of tangy mint chutney, onion and mint leaves.An unmissable part of your gastronomic trail is the malpua and it deserves special mention. It is essentially a large pancake-like sweet, made of egg, maida, sugar, saffron and milk. The round, sweet malpua is best had hot, straight from the kadhai, with a lavish dollop of thick cream or malai. Making it is also quite an art! First the eggs are beaten and charoli nuts, sugar and saffron are added to this. The malupa maker then swirls a generous portion into the smoking kadhai and deep fries it in ghee. If you want to have a small portion, ask for a single or then have the double and rabdi varieties.You cant leave here without a round or two of cold firni . You can also end your repast with sandan  the steamed sweet that looks like an idli, soft shahi tukda, cold fruity milkshakes, black currant and dudhi halwa and the mithai-centred flaky phool khaja."

But since the fuel prices have gone up, the costs of farming activities have increased.Diesel prices have shot up by 39% in the past two-and-a-half years  from Rs 51.40 per litre on September 30, 2015 to Rs 71.45 per litre on May 21, 2018. And what has compounded the woes of the farmers is that the transportation cost of carrying the produce to the markets has also gone up.The farmers lamented that the cost of production has already increased due to rise in fuel prices and it is bound to increase more if the fuel prices rise further.There is no alternate to diesel motors for cultivation during power failure. At present, 85% of the farmers in the district use tractors for ploughing the fields. The ploughing rates of tractors have increased by 30% from Rs 1,200 per acre last year to Rs 1,600 per acre this year due to rise in fuel prices, Nivrutti Nyaharkar , an onion grower, said.According to him, the transporters have hiked their rates to transport their agriculture produce to Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) by tractors and other vehicles.Transport cost increases if fuel prices go up. This also affects the production cost of the farm produce. Kharif season is now around the corner and the rise in fuel prices may also lead to rise in the cost of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, fungicides, among others, Manik Patil , divisional president of a grape-growers association, said."

Add black pepper powder and three drops of lime juice. Consume the mixture thrice or four times a day; consume honey with onion extract regularly. This is one of the home remedies against the deadly Nipah virus (NiV) doing the rounds on social media While researchers are yet to find a cure for the virus, messages on the power of Indian herbs has caught the attention of social media users, especially those on WhatsApp.These home remedies should be condemned outright, said Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, a consultant physician. Nipah is a serious infection involving the brain and it causes encephalitis. Such patients need immediate hospitalisation and intensive care. Most patients require artificial ventilation until the virus subsides.Kakkilaya revealed only one antiviral drug has proven effective so far. According to newspaper reports, the Kerala government has procured 2,000 such tablets and has placed orders for another 8,000 tablets.Dr Edmond Fernandes, CEO, CHD Group, also rubbished the home remedies. Let alone any home remedy, there is no treatment for NiV, he said. He urged the public not to believe such messages and refrain from circulating them.The messages circulating on social media, especially WhatsApp and promotion of alternative forms of medicine to cure NiV must be ignored, Fernandes said. Any development of illness during such times is best attended to by the medical community only.Ayurvedic doctors , too, claim there is no treatment as yet for NiV. Any medicine has to satisfy certain criteria to be released in the market. There is no treatment for NiV in Ayurveda as yet, Dr Gautham Alva of Alvas Ayur Care said.The first known case of Nipah transmission to human was reported in the late 1990s. So far, around 600 such cases have been reported across the world. The previous two outbreaks reported in the country  Siliguri in 2001 and Nadia in 2007  saw a fatality rate of 68% and 100% respectively. The average mortality rate in these 600-odd cases is between 50% and 70%.According to the Union ministry of health, 11 of the 13 confirmed cases of Nipah in Kerala have died."

Social welfare organisations have sought the metal shops causing frequent bottlenecks in Sub-Jail Road to be moved closer to Sidco complex, Ariyamangalam for ensuring smooth vehicular movement.Sub-jail road is an arterial one-way stretch connecting Madurai Road and Palakkarai with Gandhi market and Vellamandi Road and is dotted with onion as well as metal traders on either side. Despite being one-way, the stretch is prone to traffic congestion. While haphazard halting of city buses on the road is stated as one of the reasons, the other was cited as encroachment by placing machinery and metal rods by welding and metal shops. Since the 78 wholesale onion shops situated on the same stretch will be moving out of the Gandhi market to their own facility near Palpannai within a week, residents have sought the streamlining or relocation of metal and welding shops on Sub-jail Road.If the district administration is particular about decongesting Gandhi market and adjoining localities, relocation of metal and welding shops on Sub-jail road is inevitable. Such shops can be moved to the city outskirts, perhaps closer to Ariyamangalam Sidco complex, N Ramakrishnan, founder president, MGR Nalpani Mandram told TOI. Sources said that close to 70 metal and welding shops on Sub-jail road. When contacted, a senior official with the civic body said that the move to relocate metal traders would involve multiple stakeholders."

Besides, Thanneerpandhal on Thanjavur Main Road near the market has always been one of the hotspots of unsanitary conditions as organic waste dumped here attracts stray cattle to feed.Unable to monitor the spot round-the-clock, corporation officials urged a private shop near Thanneerpandhal a few days ago to extend their CCTV coverage to monitor the spot where vegetable and fruit waste were frequently dumped. A private shop agreed to help us monitor Thanneerpandhal spot to identify people dumping waste and penalise them heavily. Subsequently, we erected a hoarding mentioning that the spot was brought under CCTV surveillance, an official with the Ariyamangalam zone of the corporation said.After installing the hoarding, officials claimed that no waste was dumped in Thanneerpandhal locality. Usually, we would collect at least 250kg of fruit and vegetable waste from Thanneerpandhal per day but after erecting the hoarding, no wastes were dumped here, the official added.Corporation officials said that emulating such measure to cover other vulnerable spots would be considered based on long-time feedback."

After purchasing the land earmarked for stone quarrying, the individual, who had obtained permission for stone quarrying, had started the preliminary works for mining stone from the land.If stone quarrying is started in this land, it will seriously affect the 150 acres of cultivable lands surrounding the upcoming quarry and the adjacent Aayakaranthai irrigation channel. Since these cultivable lands are feeding the families of more than 500 farmhands now, stone quarrying should not be allowed. Hence, the permission given for stone quarrying should be cancelled, said Mr. Gurusamy.The petitioners also alleged that the individual had encroached upon the adjoining road, connecting Pambukovil Sandhai, for establishing the stone quarry in his land without getting mandatory permission from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.Free house sites soughtA group of people from Gunaramanallur near Tenkasi, all daily wages labourers, submitted a petition to the Collector seeking free house sites as all of them are living in either rented house or in thatched houses built temporarily on poramboke lands.

Sections of the traders have been opposed to moving over to Kallikudi.The market complex has been built at a site purchased by the Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association as early as 1991. However, the association began construction of the complex only about three years back. In fact, the association expedited the construction process after it became clear that they would have to move out as the market at Kallikudi was coming up. The complex has 90 shops and modern amenities including parking areas for lorries and visitors.Association members indicated the onion traders would move over to the new market over the next few days.The wholesale onion market in the city is a hub for Bellary and small onions trade in the region and caters to retail traders from Tiruchi and neighbouring districts. Over 75 shops are situated along the narrow Sub-Jail Road, which was opened for traffic in 2009 after being closed for several decades. The shifting of the shops is expected to ease traffic congestion on the Sub-Jail Road and the Vellamandi Road and Thanjavur Road intersections.The complex was declared open by State Ministers Vellamandi N.Natarajan and S.Valarmathi in the presence of A.M.Vikramaraja and Ve.Govindarajalu, president and general secretary, respectively, of the Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu.Meanwhile, the Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations has urged the city police to ensure that the lorries transporting goods and vehicles of visitors coming to the new commercial complex at Ariyamanglam were not parked on the narrow service lane leading to it. M. Sekaran, president of the federation, also urged the police to ensure that the lorries did not go in the wrong direction towards Ariyamangalam junction while returning from the complex. The vehicles should necessarily go up to Senthaneerpuram to take the U-turn and should not go on the wrong side in the service lane to avoid the detour, he said."

It may be noted that Mr. Siddaramaiah had contested from Chamundeshwari and Badami and won from the latter by a small margin against B. Sriramulu of the BJP. Soon after the victory, people of the taluk were expecting him to visit Badami, however according to the district Congress, Mr. Siddaramaiah could not come as he was busy in the formation of the coalition government.Addressing presspersons here, he said that he is grateful to the people of Badami for making him win and giving chance to serve. He said that he would meet with the local leaders and officials on the development project that could be implemented in Badami. To a question that the Congress has sidelined him, Mr. Siddaramaiah refuted it saying that the party has made him leader of the Congress partys legislative council.Mr. Siddaramaiah said that decision of inducting any MLA into the Cabinet was the prerogative of the Congress High Command. As far as I am concerned, for me every Congress MLA is close me. However I dont have full authority to decide on who should be inducted into the government, the high command takes the final call, he said.On several Congress legislators expressing dissatisfaction after being denied Cabinet Berth, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that it was common in any coalition government.Since it is not possible to induct many MLAs of one party into the Cabinet in the coalition government, dissatisfaction is bound to happen. However within the available seats, the Congress has tried its best to give representation to all castes and communities, he said.Earlier in the day, he visited the house of Rajappa Jalageri, an onion farmer of Jammanakatti village who committed suicide on May 25 after incurring loss. Mr. Siddaramaiah paid his family Rs. 5 lakh cheque from the district administration and Rs. 1 lakh in his personal capacity. The district Congress unit also offered Rs. 15,000 to the family."

Puthur and Kallikudi, respectively, in the district under the Supply Chain Management Scheme which seeks to improve marketing linkages for farmers and reduce post harvest losses of vegetables and fruits.The two new markets would be supplied by processed banana and onion from the 10 primary processing centres (PPCs), which are coming up in the district. Five PPCs each are being built for banana and onion in the district.The processing centres would have necessary facilities for handling, processing and sorting or grading of banana and onion and are to be provided with necessary machines.The PPCs in turn would get supplies from 59 collection centres at the village-level where banana/onion growers are being organised into farmers interests groups (FIGs). Each PPC would have six collection centres. The FIGs would also come together to form Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), which would be vested with the responsibility of managing and operating the PPCs, said Collector K. Rajamani after inspecting the construction of the storage godowns under the scheme at the Manachanallur Regulated Market recently.The primary processing centres for banana are being established at Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Arasalur, Pidaramangalam and Thiruchendurai and for onion at Manachanallur, P. K. Agaram, Uppilliyappuram (South), Thuraiyur and Thathaiyengarpet.The PPCs are expected to become functional by October after installing of machinery.The Supply Chain Management scheme is being implemented with an allocation of Rs. 28.66 crore in Tiruchi district.The scheme is being implemented at a total investment of Rs. 398.75 crore in 10 districts in the State.Officials of the Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business said steps were being taken to establish linkages between farmers producers companies, which would be running the PPCs, and traders so that farmers are able to get a good market and return for their produce. We have identified the FPOs to run the PPCs and the members of the organisations will be provided necessary training, said R. Kailasapathy, Deputy Director, Agri Business, Tiruchi.J.

K. Bellubbi, has held the Union government responsible for their state.Addressing presspersons here on Tuesday, he said that while onion prices have dipped to Rs. 800 per quintal in the market, prices never went below Rs. 1,500 per quintal during 10 years of the UPA government when Sharad Pawar was the Union Agriculture Minister.But today, the prices have gone too low in the market that the onion farmers are either dumping the commodity on the road or simply leaving it in their farms itself as they are unable to recover price of even transportation to the market let alone cost of cultivation, Mr. Bellubbi said.Claiming that a farmer is spending around Rs. 1,200 on producing each quintal of onion, he demanded that the Centre come to the rescue of farmers by announcing a Minimum Support of Price of Rs. 2,000 per quintal.Of that, the Centre should pay Rs. 1,800 while the State government could add Rs. 200 in the MSP for the farmers. This would help the farmers to earn some profit, he said.Mr. Bellubbi accused the Union government of only rendering lip services by doing nothing really for the welfare of farmers.In the last four years, Mr. Modi has only talked about farmers issues but never took any decision to help. They are upset and angry to the extent that if BJP national president, Amit Shah goes to meet the farmers, they would not hesitate even to thrash him, he said.He said that even the Pejawar seer has also expressed his unhappiness against the Modi government for not meeting promises such as bringing back black money from foreign banks. Stating that he would give a fortnight to the Union government to meet the demand of announcing Rs. 2,000 per quintal MSP for farmers, he said that the protest would be intensified if the demand is not met. Later in the day, he along with the party workers staged a protest by dumping onion on the road at M.G. Circle."

Oxidative stress is the condition when the damage, due to the toxic form of oxygen molecules, exceeds the capacity of the body to repair such damage.It is a paradox that oxygen, which is essential for life, becomes the cause of aging, said Prof Rizvi.In human body, most of the oxygen is consumed by the brain. Therefore, it is the brain that becomes more vulnerable to oxidative stress. With increase in age, brain cells degenerate leading to diseases and loss of brain function, he said.Through experiments, the research team analysed a host of biomarkers of aging, including pro-oxidants, antioxidants, mitochondrial function, expression of genes, and apoptosis cell death.The results of the AU study conclude that fisetin can protect the brain from damage induced by aging.The study was carried out on rats of different ages and also on those which were chemically induced to age faster, said Prof Rizvi.Fisetin was given to rats of old age and the effect was compared with the younger ones. Fisetin-treated old rats were protected from brain damage.Among all anti-aging strategies being explored, caloric restriction is the most promising which, in common terms, can be defined as less food intake.Caloric restriction has been effectively tested in small organisms like fruit fly and earthworms. The strategy becomes difficult to implement in humans where several ethical issues are involved.Scientists have stumbled upon a class of compounds which mimic the effect of caloric restriction. With the use of these compounds, known as caloric restriction mimetics, the body feels like it is food restricted without the need of eating less.According to Prof Rizvi, fisetin works as a caloric restriction mimetic in showing its anti-aging effect on rats. Scientists are hopeful that compounds exhibiting caloric restriction mimetic effects will prove to be good anti-aging drugs, he said.Several experimental drugs are being tested in Prof Rizvis lab for possible anti-aging effects. Although an increase in human lifespan may not be possible, it may increase the health span, Prof Rizvi added."

KarthikeyanThe prices of shallots (small onion) shot up in the wholesale onion market in Dindigul  one of the biggest in the State  on Friday due to poor arrivals and slump in production.Continuous rain in major shallot producing centres in Karantaka has damaged the standing crop, leading to a fall in production.The wholesale price of shallot shot up to Rs. 50 a kg from Rs. 20 a kg in the last 48 hours. In retail markets, the price of shallot hovers around Rs. 60 to Rs. 65 a kg, depending on quality and size. The arrivals slumped to less than half of normal quantity, said traders.Any short supply automatically leads to a jump in the price of shallots, said V. Rajendran, a wholesale trader. If the trend continues, the price will go up further.Arrivals from Theni, Pollachi, Coimbatore, and Mysuru in Karnataka is almost nil due to heavy downpour during the last week. At present, onion farmers at Sengurichi, Gujiliamparai, Vedasandur and Iyyalur in Dindigul district and Thuraiyur in Tiruchi district alone are supplying to the wholesale market.Normally, the market gets regular supplies from Andipatti and Cumbum in Theni district, Udumalpet in Tirupur district, Tiruchi and Mysuru in Karnataka.

Arrivals are around 5,000 to 8,000 bags a day and three to four truckloads during peak season.Several godowns in the wholesale market are empty. Exporters too have stayed away due to high procurement price. Above all, the fresh shallots are wet and, hence, they have limited shelf life and unfit for exports. However, traders hope to sell them domestically.Heavy rain in western parts of the region will certainly affect arrivals to the market in the days come, they fear. Increase in arrivals of domestically grown shallot alone will stabilise supply and price, they say."

(Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Bee Basket, a start-up, is all set to promote the keeping of Trigona  a special type of stingless honeybee.Bee Basket, a Pune-based start-up that is working towards the promotion and conservation of honey bees, is planning to take the sting out of the bee. Amit Godse, founder of Bee Basket, is all set to promote the keeping of Trigona  a special type of honeybee that, he says, is stingless.An avid apiarist, Godse has been at the forefront of relocating hives in urban areas without exterminating the bees. Over the years, mass extinction of bees  the most important pollinator in nature  has become a major cause of concern for agriculture. Bees carry pollen from male flowers and deposit the same into the female flowers during the course of their feed. Pollination is a crucial step in the life cycle of seed formation. Dip in the population of bees, Godse said has posed a major challenge in fruit formation of crops like onion and for fruits like mango, pomegranate etc.In the urban areas, bee hives often come up in the ledges of homes or at multi storied buildings. Such hives, often cause more concern than joy for residents, who employ professional bee keepers to take down the hives. More often than not, the relocation of the hives lead to a complete destruction of the bees, as they are either killed or smoked out.Godse added that the idea of sting-less bee keeping in urban areas came to him to during the course of his work as a hive locator. Trigona, is the most common indigenous form of bee available in the country. Such bees normally hive at cracks of buildings or other dilapidated structures, he said. Such bees do not sting. They bite but that too rarely, he added. The best part about these bees, Godse said, was that they require almost no maintenance and do not migrate from their boxes.In a single box, about 10-15,000 bees can be accommodated, which can be kept for pollination in rooftop gardens, kitchen gardens or on ledges of balcony grills. Unlike other bees, which requires tending, these bees do not require any maintenance. Once in three or four months the boxes can be opened to check population, he said. The honey production of these bees, Godse said, was low but the honey they produce is supposed to have extensive medicinal properties.Bee Basket plans to start commercial operations by mid-February. Initially, the services would be to promote bee keeping as a hobby. Various training programmes are also being organised to raise awareness about the services. Godse also plans to start hire-a-pollinator services.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

She comes from a long line of super cooks  her great grandmother, her grandmother and her mother just to mention a few. Her husband and two sons are good cooks, too. Sneha believes that with women going out to work, it is time for men to enter the kitchen. Her husband and sons and she take turns to cook  a fine arrangement. It leaves her a lot of time for other activities.There are many demands on Snehas expertise. Very often, people call and ask for advice. It must be said in her favour that she gives it unstintingly. Chandra is one such person who often seeks Snehas help. She refers to Sneha as SME (subject matter expert) which is apt.Chandra and a group friends congregated at Snehas house for dosas. The aroma of sambar was all-pervasive. Everyone was in raptures over the pan-fresh, paper-thin, crisp dosas, served with onion sambar, coconut chutney and chutney powder. Chandra went home and profusely praised the food she had eaten. Her daughter asked, Why dont you get the recipe from Sneha aunty?Promptly, Chandra phoned Sneha and asked for the recipes. First, the sambar, said the master chef and went on to explain how it is made. Evidently, Chandra was sitting down at her end with notepad and pen. Just to be sure I have all the ingredients I need... And reeled them off. So far, so good, averred Sneha. Be sure to get the special small variety onions as they make the sambar more flavourful, she cautioned. Remember to garnish with coriander last and season with mustard seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, and curry leaves.Now the chutney. Grated coconut, fried gram dal...Is that right? Perfect! was the encouraging reply. Ill let you know how I fare, said Chandra. Blithely, she set off on her dosa expedition.True to her word, she called Sneha a day or two later. How did everything turn out? What about the sambar and chutney? Sneha wanted to know.(She had packed some chutney powder for Chandra earlier.) The sambar and coconut chutney tasted different, said a despondent Chandra. Why? What went wrong? Sneha wanted to know.I dont know! Did you follow my instructions about the onions, garnishing and seasoning? Yes, and I even added ginger and garlic to the sambar.Did I instruct you to add ginger and garlic to the sambar? Sneha sounded aghast. No, you didnt. I thought you forgot to mention it. The expert was rendered speechless. And you said the chutney needed just ginger. But I thought adding garlic would improvethe taste. And did it? Sneha couldnt keep the sarcasm out of her voice.Then she relented and asked, What about the dosas? They were fine. You didnt add ginger-garlic to the batter? Sneha teased. Keep things simple.That is the secret of good cooking, she advised."
