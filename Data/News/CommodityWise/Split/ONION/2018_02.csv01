They forgot that it was the two youth leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani who brought the foot soldiers which compensated for the lack of cadres in the Congress. (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal New Delhi) The showing in Gujarat made the Congress complacent. They forgot that it was the two youth leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani who brought the foot soldiers which compensated for the lack of cadres in the Congress. (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal New Delhi)The interesting fact about the BJPs victory in Tripura is not that the CPM lost one of its last two bases of power. It was the annihilation of the Congress which gave a decisive signal. Rahul Gandhi must have known the game was up. That is probably why he was with his naani in Italy rather than facing the music in person in the Northeast.The excuses given by the Opposition for the BJPs victory were the usual ones. That the BJP threw money around, were communalist etc. The facts are much more mundane. Rahul finds it difficult to focus on any political chore for a week at a time. Amit Shah, on the other hand, is relentlessly active, fighting election after election. In elections, you need cadres that can work around the clock and leadership which gives them important guidance. The contrast between the two party presidents is telling.The showing in Gujarat made the Congress complacent. They forgot that it was the two youth leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani who brought the foot soldiers which compensated for the lack of cadres in the Congress. People join the Congress to get tickets, not to work hard at the grassroots to spread the political message.The penny may have dropped for the other parties that the Congress is not reliable. With its new Hindutva ideology, many opposition parties will be wary before joining it in a coalition. The Trinamool Congresss Mamata Banerjee has already signalled that she wants a Third Front. This would be a coalition that someone like Mr Asaduddin Owaisi can join with a clean conscience. He will not be comfortable with a party boasting of its pucca Brahmin leadership.This may also be the attitude of Mayawati and the BSP, as well as the Yadav parties.It is a whole year till the general elections. One should never take any election for granted. The one loss the BJP suffered was in Rajasthan. In Madhya Pradesh bypolls, the Congress retained its seats; the BJP did not lose any. Add to that the triumph in the Northeast even as the Opposition was trying to connect the Nirav Modi scandal with the Prime Minister because of the similar name. The public is not that stupid. It ignored the bank fraud.For the government, the economic news will improve as the year goes by. The GDP growth rate is already above 7 per cent. Inflation is under control, but you never know whether another onion crisis would break out. The big challenge is jobs. As I have argued before, there can only be few formal desk jobs. There are other opportunities to earn livelihoods  roji. The pakodawala does not have a job but he earns a livelihood. The government has to show that opportunities to earn livelihoods are being created. As the economy is largely informal and services-oriented, most livelihood opportunities will be informal. NITI Aayog needs to clarify the situation.The things that could go wrong for the government is the behaviour of its MLAs and MPs. Power may or may not corrupt. It definitely makes politicians in power arrogant. The attacks on the statues of Ambedkar and Periyar show that while Narendra Modi wants sabka saath, many BJP members are still stuck in a Brahminical state of mind. You may beat people up for gau raksha but then dont expect them to vote for you.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2d54ba9855b723c6f45a30,Farmers across 100 villages grapple with crop diseases,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmers-across-100-villages-grapple-with-crop-diseases/articleshow/63020464.cms,2018-02-22,"PUNE: The recent, untimely rain and hail has not just destroyed crops but is causing an attack of various pests and diseases on the states rabi harvest.A report of the state agriculture department said over 100 villages had reported diseases on crops, particularly wheat, ragi, jowar, grams, maize and sugar cane, causing loss to farmers.The report, which is based on the agricultural situation in Maharashtra till February 16, stated that several divisions, including Nashik, Pune, and Aurangabad, experienced thunderstorm and unseasonal rain recently. Pests like Gram pod borer or Helicoverpa and other diseases have struck the gram crop in as many as 11 villages across Dhule, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon. The incidence of pests and diseases on gram has also crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) here. Crops like wheat, gram, jowar, maize have been affected by diseases and pests in this division.An economic threshold is the insects population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.In Pune division, gram crop in 32 villages across Ahmednagar and Solapur has been attacked by such pests currently. Here too, the incidence has crossed the economic threshold level. Crops such as wheat, gram, sugar cane and maize are expected to cause financial losses to growers due to pest attacks, the report said.Various rabi crops in as many as 19 villages in Latur, seven in Amravati and 41 in Nagpur, among others, are facing a similar situation due to the rain and hailstorm, with the incidence of pests and diseases crossing the threshold at these locations as well.Director of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited Amit Naphade , told TOI that whenever there is a variation in weather  sudden change from cold to warm, unseasonal rain, or no rain in the monsoon months  the incidence of pests and diseases on crops increases.Such changes are ideal for pests and diseases to flourish, since the crops weaken at these times and become susceptible to pest attacks. Most districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and some in north Maharashtra, are facing increased pest attacks following the recent unseasonal rain, with between 30% and 60% wheat crop getting destroyed not just because of rain but pest attack and diseases, said Naphde.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district of Akola said that had the unseasonal rain and hail not affected the region, crop health and production would have been 100% this rabi season. But now, various pests are hounding the crops, he said.Buldhana farmer Milind Pachpande said that between 25% to 50% of onion crop in his field is facing pest attacks. The onion crop is close to rotting in many areas, he said."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year.From Rs 3,150 per quintal at the start of the month, onion prices in Lasalgaon, Indias largest wholesale onion market, have come down by nearly 50 per cent to sell at Rs 1,650 per quintal on Wednesday.The steep fall in prices, which has affected farmers, is being blamed on the glut in the market from major onion producing centres as well as the $ 700 Minimum Export Price stipulated by the government which has made exports unviable.Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year. The government, in order to regulate the domestic market, decided to set up a Minimum Export Price of $ 850 per tonne to ensure that the bulk of the crop was diverted to the domestic market.However, with an increased supply in the domestic market, prices began to flounder. During the start of January, the modal price for onion in Lasalgaon was Rs 3,150 per quintal. It has since been on the decline and hit its lowest mark for the month on Wednesday.While this price is substantially higher than the Rs 600 per quintal witnessed during the same period last year, farmers had been complaining that the government was trying to regulate prices when they had a chance to earn money.Earlier this month, a delegation from the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) had met Minister for Marketing Subhash Deshmukh asking him to lobby with the centre for removal of MEP. Their contention was that the MEP, which is the benchmark price below which no shipments can take place, and is meant to increase domestic supplies, was making exports unviable and would pinch farmers as excess production of onion would hit the local markets this year.The Central government on January 10 brought down the MEP to $ 700. Farmers, however, continue to be angry.The government has moved in when it is our time to make some money, Keshav Kakad, an onion farmer from Niphad, said.Maharashtra, which contributes nearly 35 per cent of the total onion in the country, harvests onions thrice a year from October to May. The kharif and the late kharif crop called Pol and Rangda is harvested from December to March. However its yield and storage quality are not very good, forcing farmers to dispose the crop quickly, creating a huge glut in the market in January and February. The high-quality rabi product marked by a higher yield and longer storage capacity is harvested in April -May and can be sold at a relatively easy pace till October.Due to seasonal variation in production the months of October, November, December and January are known to be the time when onion prices reach a high, while in March, April, May and June, the prices dip. However, due to the recent climatic changes in Maharashtra, prices appear to have been thrown out of gear. The farmers and traders of Lasalgaon believe that the rule of free market should be applicable with demand and supply dynamics determining the prices of agricultural commodities.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president M Thyagarajan , who is a tomato trader, said, Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads. Yield from the first crop of the year (December  January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8. Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017."

Over the years, tricycles have rolled their small tyres into the transport arena and developed as one of the major means of logistics of goods and associated services in Madurai that has put restrictions on heavy trucks and mini trucks to use the city roads.Madurai, with major markets located within the city, has hundreds of trucks ferrying goods to and from the city. But the restrictions on trucks come in handy for the tricycles, which take the role of filling that last link of supply. They are the preferred mode of short distance transportation for traders as the men with the vehicle do the loading and unloading, which is included in the service.Goods like food grains, pulses, fruits, onion and infrastructure materials like steel and cement are being transported in tricycles, which can easily carry around half tonne, round the clock. They are spread across various pockets in the city, including congested commercial areas like Marret and Masi Streets. They transport 1,500 tonnes of goods on any given day.While over 10,000 tri-cycles were ruling the city roads a decade back, the emergence of mechanised mini load vehicles scaled the numbers down to 4,000 at present. However, their earnings are not affected much. We earn anywhere between Rs300 to Rs1,000 a day. If luck is on our side we can earn up to Rs2,000 on certain days, said K Muruganandam , a tricycle puller. Most of the men were from drought-prone Ramanathapuram and parts of Sivaganga districts, who had shifted to Madurai at least couple of decades ago. They mostly stay in congested places like Sellur, Avaniyapuram, Jaihindpuram and Perungudi.According to M S Murugan, AITUC Madurai district general secretary, the load men and the vehicles have evolved over the years. While those who have the education to apply for a driving license graduated into mini load vehicle drivers, the illiterate stuck to the physically demanding job. It is not an easy job for a novice to take it up on a fine morning and earn like the veterans. While most of the load men own a tri-cycle, which costs Rs18,000, some take it for a rent of Rs25 a day, he said.The wages are being fixed after talks with Madurai District Load Men, Van Auto and Unorganised Workers Welfare Association and Tamil Nadu Food Grains Merchant Association. Association secretary S V S S Velshankar says, We prefer tricycles for short trips, since the charge for motorised vehicle would be higher. Mini trucks are given a thought only if the distance is more than 15 km.President of Madurai Groceries and Retail Dealers Association G Palraj said that it is a crucial mode of transportation for grocery shops in the city, since most of them require only a few bags of stocks on day-to-day basis. The trucks are useful only if the goods weigh more than half tonne.Since the vehicles cause traffic congestion in the city, police banned tricycles 17 years ago. The load men protested, which led the police to change their stand and instead streamlined them, says Murugan. The tricycle pullers were issued licenses and specific parking places were allocated to them so that it did not affect the parking of other vehicles, he said."

Civil works to club the 500 shops on the ground floor into 250 shops are under way. Earlier, the traders were hesitant to move to the new facility citing inadequate space. Authorities said that they were expecting at least 100-150 traders initially to occupy the integrated market.The over century -old Gandhi Market, which is a commercial hub of at least 10 districts in the central zone, was expanded last during the pre-Independence era. Situated in the heart of the city, the market also happens to the epicentre of frequent traffic congestion. Earlier, to decongest the market, Trichy district administration, at an estimated cost of Rs65 crore, took up the construction of an integrated vegetable and fruit market on 9.7 acres on the city outskirts at Kallikudi in 2014. The works were apparently completed in mid-2017. Even though the facility was formally inaugurated last year, it was lying unoccupied owing to the resistance from traders in the existing market to shift their business. Authorities said that the agriculture marketing department recently obtained the administrative sanction form agriculture department to make the required structural modification in Kallikudi integrated vegetable market to address the demand of the traders for more space.""After completing the ongoing works, we would invite traders to occupy the facility. We expect 100-150 traders who are operating on rental space, will make use of the modified facility,"" an official source with agriculture marketing department said. Sources added that the structural modification works are expected to conclude in a month.Traders alleged that they were not consulted during the construction works of the integrated vegetable market complex. Stating that the whole episode, including expenditure incurred to modify the facility would have been avoided, if they were assured of adequate space in the new facility. ""We do not have any issues in moving to the new market. Our concern is that we need adequate facilities for shifting our base. Traders who are operating from rental shops in Gandhi Market may shift to the new place. It has also got practical difficulty, our sales and profit would remain intact only if all of us stay nearby,"" N Saravanan , secretary of Onion and Potato wholesale dealers association in Gandhi Market told TOI.It seems that even the traders do not have many options as the efforts made by the traders to construct their own market went in vain owing to the high cost of land in city. Authorities claimed that making a few wholesale traders to occupy the refurbished integrated vegetable market post completion of the works would invite other traders in Gandhi Market to shift to the new facility."
5b2d77ec9855b723c6f46563,Weighing scales go for a toss in floating market,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weighing-scales-go-for-a-toss-in-floating-market/articleshow/62650456.cms,2018-01-26,"The floating market of Patuli, inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday, threw up a weighty problem within the first 24 hours of operations. None of the weighing scales of the 228 hawkers on the 114 boats is working properly. Since the boats are rocking at the slightest movement or the hint of a breeze, items are showing different weight readings within seconds. This has left the buyers and sellers a harassed lot.Funnily enough, no one had taken this unexpected problem into account when the market was inaugurated. The issue with the weights became apparent only on Thursday morning, when business at the market started in full earnest. As soon as the boats swayed a bit, the reading of the scales  both manual and electric  kept changing. The greater the weight of the goods being measured, the higher the difference in reading.A couple of physics professors we spoke to explained why this was happening. The mechanics of any weighing machine works on the laws of gravity and inertia. And the weighing machines need to be levelled properly on the surface where it is standing. Since a boats surface is never still, the machine is never at the same level, said a physics professor from St Xaviers College. When the boat is bobbing up, the weight shows greater than actual, and when the boat is pitching downwards, the weight shown is lower than what it should be.This mismatch in weights soon led to some dissatisfaction among the customers on Thursday morning, with some of them even refusing to buy the goods. The weight of goods Im paying for is not right. How can I buy anything? asked Samaresh Nath, a retired government official. Bapan Sardar, a potato and onion seller was bewildered with his malfunctioning electric weighing machines. He said, I never anticipated this would happen. Now I think I will have to buy a new machine.There are three probable solutions. The first would be to place the weighing machine on the axis of the boat. If you join two pointed ends of the boat with an imaginary line, that line would be the axis and its the most static position on the rolling boat, said a physics teacher. The second would be to tie the boat as tightly as possible to stop it from moving. The third would be to use a crane scale weighing machine, the kind used on big fishing boats. Those machines give a correct reading even on a moving boat."

It is not to be revealed right now.I dont know if it will be turbulent. But maybe, it will have some political implications.Farmers are annoyed and unhappy that the government is no longer acquiring their produce on Minimum Support Price. The dues of acquisition of pulses have not been paid for a long time and the recently introduced Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana denied MSP, which they deserve. There is a lot of discontent over the way prices fluctuate and the way Bhavantar calculations are being made. Prices of soyabean went up after Bhavantar payments were stopped. Farmers feel betrayed that the government has not stood by them. The onion crisis was also the same  prices shot-up soon after the governments acquisition from farmers was over.Gujarat is different in different constituencies. I did not pay much attention to it though the situation there is as good or as bad as Madhya Pradesh. Rural Gujarat is, of course, worse than Madhya Pradesh.Well, if Congress plays its cards right, there is a fair probability that it will form the next state government in Madhya Pradesh.I will certainly contribute in whatever way I can. I will be active in bringing all the factions of the party together.I have seen massive machines being used to extract sand from the river, which is a violation of National Green Tribunals (NGT) order. Whenever we arrive at a village, the sand mining is immediately stopped. Two or three days after we leave, it resumes. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been formulating new mining policies and promising that sand mining will be handed over to the village panchayats. But so far, no government order has been issued to that effect.I can tell you that standard of education still remains very poor. There is a huge difference between enrolment and attendance in government schools. Teacher absenteeism is a common phenomenon.It was a hype and facade that the BJP created. At that time, state government funds from the NDAs central taxes were a pittance. They gave us just about 28% of central taxes, which now is 42%. Because of increase in the central tax collection, devolution to the states has also increased. States now have more money for power and roads. Water was never a problem during my tenure. However, because of the bifurcation and creation of Chhattisgarh, all power generating plants went to the new state. They became power surplus and we had none. During the UPA regime, the Centre started giving more funds to the state for construction and maintenance of national and state highways.A: Only one. Narmade Har."

Onions are currently being sold at Rs 40 to Rs 45 in the retail market. Last week, the prices touched Rs 50 per kg.""Onion supply is adequate. The wholesale price is hovering around Rs 3,500 per quintal. So there is no reason for the price hike.

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Maintained jointly by teachers and students from classes VI to VIII, without affecting their classroom sessions, around 50-60 kg of vegetables of nine plant varieties are harvested at the school every week and supplied to the school kitchen for the noon meal scheme.The school has classes for standards I to VIII and a student strength of 140, of which classes up to standard IV are taught both English and in Tamil medium. Vegetable cultivation being done on about 0.25 acres within the school campus.Started in September 2016 with the personal interest of 42-year-old teacher S Elavalagan and subsequent cooperation from fellow staff, the green project expanded the acreage of horticulture crops from just 5 cents to 0.25 acres. Teachers along with the students would engage in vegetable plantation and also in maintaining existing plants. It is the self-interest of 57 students studying from classes VI to VIII that allowed the acreage of horticulture crops to expand. Parents are also supportive in the move as they willingly send their wards to school even on Sundays, S Elavalagan told TOI.With seeds obtained at free of cost from Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru, through good Samaritans , the school has planted about 18 vegetable varieties of which nine varieties render substantial yield on daily and weekly basis.Belonging to the small onion belt of Tamil Nadu , the school last week cultivated small onions within their campus and new vegetable breeds such as carrots, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. For the last one year we have been cultivating and harvesting tomato, ladies finger, bitter gourd, snake gourd and broad beans. Most of the yield will go to the school kitchen for preparing noon meals for the children and the surplus, on rotational basis, would be provided free of cost to the families of students who actively maintain the crops, Elavalagan added.The school with as many as seven teachers including the headmaster perhaps could have made revenue by selling the surplus vegetables to the shops, but instead preferred to plant green thoughts among students by giving harvested vegetables to students as a pat on their backs.M Guru, a class VII student, said that the green activity in school has motivated him to pursue farming in future and said that his parents were happy about their ward spending quality time in farming. My father migrated from agriculture even though my grandfather was a farmer. Completing my studies, I will certainly take up farming since it has become my passion, said Guru, spotted watering the vegetable plants on the school campus on Sunday.Another student of the school, R Kalaiselvan said that he feels relaxed while watering the plants rather than playing cricket with his friends. On an average, each week, at least 5-10 children are taking home surplus vegetable for which feedback from their houses is positive as the vegetables are grown organically."
5b2d9c4c9855b723c6f47498,Pazhankanji and Chayakkada are the new burger and cafe in Kerala,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pazhankanji-and-chayakkada-are-the-new-burger-and-cafe-in-kerala/articleshow/62403024.cms,2018-01-08,"There was a time when a restaurant meant something with a stylish sounding English name, with a menu full of variants of North Indian dishes or Chinese fried rice, noodles and chicken. Even the less fancy restaurants tried hard to make the ambience as posh as possible; the more western, the better was the mantra. Also, teens and 20-somethings preferred to be seen having pizzas and cold coffees, and naadan delicacies were restricted to toddy shops, which are not everyones cup of tea.Cut to 2018. Take a drive around Kochi or Thiruvananthapuram city and you can spot at least a dozen restaurants and coffee shops, nay, chayakkadas, where everything  from the restaurant name to the dishes to the dcor scream a combination of innovation, quirkiness and naadan like never before. Thaninaadan is even better than naadan is the USP, and the dishes offered would perhaps be the best and healthiest picks from the kitchens of mothers and grandmothers from across Kerala. And gorging on the kanjis, pothichorus and chutta meens (fried fish) would be the selfie generation in their 20s and 30s. We explore this new food culture which has been sweeping across Kerala:As far as the youth now are concerned, the priorities are taste, health and the ambience, apparently. Dishes like kanji and kappa were traditionally considered poor mans fare, but when offered in a funky setting with tasty accompaniments, sell like hotcakes.Idli is served with non-veg curries while there are exclusive outlets like Dhe Puttu which offer innovative puttu varieties. At Pappadavada , pazhankanji is served in a chatti, with kappa, pickle, chammanthi pulisserry, curd, onion and chilly with fish curry. Minu Pauline, who runs the hotel, says, College students arrive in groups to have pazhankanji. At times, families come in to give their children a taste of pazhankanji while those older happily have it daily. This extends to desserts as well, where ilayada, kozhukkatta and even kinnathappam have replaced ice cream and pastry in these food joints.At Cinema Caf, Kacheripady, visitors sit in a world of Malayalam cinema, literally, while they munch on aval (beaten rice) or sip guava juice. Old and rare film songs play in the background while old and new film posters fill the walls and tables. People come here to get a feel of home, says its founder Nandakumar. My family members prepare the food and so half are daily customers, who know this kind of food wont harm their stomach. Malayalam film lovers get the best of both  homely food and cinema.Anoop Anthony of Njettila Vattayila , renowned for its pazhampori-beef curry combo, agrees. Youngsters today care for the ambience along with the food. Selfie spots are in plenty here. We have also printed age-old Malayalam proverbs on table tops, many of which are new to the youngsters. They lap them all up.Foodie Jay Menon attributes it to the new food culture in the State, where people are willing to travel even long distances for good food. I come down from Mumbai every month to have beef fry in Kerala. Also, people just got tired of the same kind of tastes. The freshness and variety of naadan is lacking in fast food.Not many knew about dishes like maniputtu or Ravuthar biryani, both made exclusively in Muslim houses, until they made an entry into the naadan restaurants. There are umpteen such dishes. We have a dish called kozhi kidathi porichathu which is actually my mother-in-laws recipe. We also have kanalil chutta kozhi which is chicken cooked on charcoal, says Nidheesh, founder of Arippa.Malabari dishes, once the monopoly of Kozhikode restaurants, have made a steady inflow into the rest of Kerala with the naadan restaurants re-introducing them with idiosyncratic names like veerappan chicken fry and thinnal thoofanakunna chicken fry, both specialties of Adaminte Chayakkada There are students and youngsters who eat out almost every day, and for how long can they have greasy food? We have daily customers for pazhankanji, who come in around 10 am and order it. It keeps them energised and hydrated for the entire day. All our traditional dishes suit our climate actually, says Minu.The same is the case with Aavi, where youngsters and even celebrities are the takers for kanji, says Ranjith Menon, its general manager. Everything is cooked in steam here and people seek them out. For lunch too, our pothichoru, which has fish fry, thoran, omelette, chammanthi and rice packed in a vazhayila (banana leaf), gets sold out by 1.15 pm, he says.Nidheesh attributes the new-found love for homemade food to a basic fact  we cant be bothered to cook elaborately anymore. Think of something like appam and meen molee or kappa and meenkari. Sure, they were daily fare for our grandmothers, but who makes them at home anymore? he asks.Since cooking at home daily is not an option, restaurants are becoming a necessity, says Devan, a Kochiite and foodie. We seek out restaurants which offer home-cooked food. Many of these new joints like Binnammas are run by a family, who cook the food themselves and thats why we opt for such places, he says."

Picture by Animesh SenguptaJamshedpur: Potato prices in the steel city rose sharply from Rs 10/kg on Saturday to Rs 15/kg on Sunday registering a 50 per cent hike in a single day. In Ranchi, tuber rates went up marginally from Rs 10 to Rs 12.""I have been buying potato at Rs 10 per kg for the past one year. Its price remained the same even when onion was selling at Rs 50/kg around four months ago. I was quite surprised by the sudden hike,"" said Subodh Chaudhury, a Tata Steel employee who stays at Bistupur.Sonari resident Rita Sharma said she was also taken aback by the hike. ""Every year, some factor or the other causes potato prices to go up gradually. This was for the first time that its rate jumped from Rs 10 to Rs 15 in a day,"" said Sharma.Shopkeepers are, however, selling the new variety at Rs 12/kg to Rs 13/kg since it's demand is much less compared to the old variety.While the hike has pinched the pockets of consumers, potato sellers justified the rise. Shopkeeper Awadhesh Kumar Shao said they had no option since the price of the item at the wholesale market had spiralled. ""Customers prefer the old variety of potatoes which was in short-supply. Sensing this, the wholesalers raised the price of a 50kg packet from Rs 300 to Rs 450. We had no option but to increase the rate,"" Shao, who runs a shop in Bistupur market, said.On an average, 10 truckloads of potatoes come to the steel city from Bengal every day. On Saturday, only five trucks came. On Sunday, only four truckloads of the tuber were unloaded at Krishi Utpad Bazar Samiti at Parsudih from where its sold to city retailers.Wholesaler Rajkumar Shah said prices have gone up because traders have started stocking the item in cold storages having bought it directly from farmers. ""The stock of the old variety in cold storages has finished and traders are now filling the cold storages with the new produce. They would soon release the fresh stocks and sell it at higher prices,"" said Shah. He hinted that prices would spiral further in coming months.In Ranchi, the wholesale rate of the new variety ( laal aaloo), which was priced between Rs 700 and Rs 850 per quintal on Friday, is now selling at Rs 800-Rs 1000. Similarly, the old variety (sada aaloo), which was priced between Rs 500 and Rs 600 per quintal, is now selling at Rs 700 to Rs 800.In the retail market, prices have gone up by Rs 2 for both the variants. ""I am selling the old variety at Rs 12 compared to Rs 10 last week. Lal aaloo, which was Rs 10, is now being sold at Rs 12 to Rs 13,"" said Vijay Kumar, a prominent seller at Harmu market."

This year, farmers of 60 villages of Reamal, Tinkbir, Malehipada, Taranga, Tuhilamal, Budhido and Naulipada gram panchayats of Reamal block had taken up onion cultivation.As the climate was favourable, farmers had taken seeds from the agriculture department and used timely compost.

It would also help us realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to double farmers' income by 2022.""The minister's letter also mentioned that Bihar happened to be the third largest vegetable producer and fifth largest fruit producer in the country. It also says that 80 per cent of the Makhana in the world is produced in Bihar.It is not the first time that a demand to include more items in the agriculture export promotion policy has been made. Earlier this month, the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, too, had come up with a similar demand. The BCCI too had sent a letter to the Union minister sharing details of various products and their speciality on the basis of which the request was made."

But there is an unlikely candidate this time, mangoes. Several factors seem to have ganged up to create such a situation.The APMC yard here has turned into a virtual trash bin as the fruits are rotting, but there are hardly any buyers. The furious growers are throwing the mangoes into the drains and on the roads. Among the reasons for the price crash are excess production and fall in demand from the middlemen.The rates have fallen to as little as Rs 10-12 a kilo for the Badami variety. The other varieties of mangoes are priced at Rs 4-5 a kg, down from Rs 100 a few days ago.Varieties like Sendur, Rasapuri and Neelam have no takers. Buyers purchased 240 quintals of Badami mangoes at Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. Other varieties (740 quintals) sold at Rs 500-600 per quintal. Even tomato is commanding a better price than mangoes, say the growers.Many lorry loads of mango are returning to the market as some buyers are sending them back due to excesssupply. Earlier, these buyers, mostly juice producers, used to fall over each other to buy both ripe and raw mangoes. However, this time, the buyers are imposing conditions on what they want.Nipah scareThe scare of the spread of Nipah virus through mangoes has discouraged retail consumers from buying them and so, the demand has crashed. Besides, there is a glut in production in Kolar, another major production centre.Many growers have left the mangoes to rot on the trees as they dont want to spend on the labour for plucking in the current situation."
