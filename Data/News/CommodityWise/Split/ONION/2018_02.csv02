It can be consumed raw, cooked, dried or roasted. Besides being used as a food, it has a variety of medicinal properties too.Onions have been known to mankind since prehistoric times and have found mention in religious books like The Bible and The Koran. The medicinal properties of the herb have been described by the early Ayurveda exponents like Charak (in Charak Samhita) and Sushruta.In Chinese medicine, Onions have been used to treat cough, bacterial infection and breathing problems. Ancient Americans used wild Onions to treat cold, cough, asthma and to repel insects. In modern medicine, it is used to lower blood sugar, tackle cardiovascular problems, prevent hair loss, urinary disorders, tooth ache etc.In India, the largest Onion-producing state is Maharashtra, all though it is also grown widely in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.In Bengal the production of Onions is not encouraging. The total cultivable area for Onions here is 0.3 lakh ha and production is 5.4 lakh tonnes whereas in Maharashtra the total cultivable land is 5.2 lakh ha and production is 65.3 lakh tonnes.However, realising the importance of Onions, Bengal has now started research and development at various agricultural science centres and universities to try and increase production.A full-grown bulbCultivationClimate and soil: The Onion is basically a cool season crop. But it can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climates. The best performance can be expected in mild weather, without extreme cold, heat or excessive rainfall.In order to meet consumers rising demand, to minimise import from other states and to stabilise the price of Onions, Bengal is now cultivating the herb during rainy season (kharif) as well as during rabi season. For this, various new varieties of Onions are being developed.Onions can be grown in all types of soil such as sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and heavy soil. But the best soil for it is sandy loam with good drainage and moisture-holding capacity. It cannot be grown in alkaline or low lying marshy land.Varieties: Onions can be broadly divided into two groups  Common Onion and Multiplier Onion. The Common Onion group includes the typical bulb Onion whereas the multiplier Onion forms smaller bulbs. In this article we shall focus on growing Common Onions.It is important to select the right variety of Onion as per the season. Varieties suitable in the kharif season are Bhima Dark Red, Bhima Super, Bhima Raj, Bhima Red and Bhima Shubhra. For the rabi season Bhima Shakti, Bhima Kiran and Bhima Light are more suitable.Planting: Common Onions can be grown by raising seedlings in a nursery bed, by broadcasting (sprinkling seeds) or drilling seeds directly in the field. It can also be grown by planting bulbs directly in the field. As Onions are mainly planted using the transplanting method, production of healthy seedlings require a well-maintained nursery. This will ensure better seedlings.Prepare a nursery bed of 3m length and 0.6m breadth and raise it to a height of 15-25cm. Spare a distance of 70cm between the beds as you would need it eventually for deweeding. Generally a well-drained, fertile, loam to sandy loam, loose and friable soil, rich in organic matter is preferred for such a nursery bed.Onions, peeled and choppedSeeds are sown in lines, 4-5cm apart, in rabi, and 5-7cm apart in kharif settings. Sowing should not be done more than 2-3cm deep and after sowing, the beds should be mulched with dry grass or straw to maintain and preserve the required soil moisture.As and when there is lack of moisture in the bed, water it using a sprinkling can. After germination, the mulching material should be removed and when required, the nursery should be protected from heavy rains during kharif season.To protect seedlings from direct sun rays, partial shade should be provided. The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in six to seven weeks in kharif and eight to nine weeks in rabi seasons. Two to three days before uprooting the seedlings, ensure light irrigation. Onions can also be grown by direct seeding.In the next edition we shall discuss methods of irrigation and harvesting the herb. Onions are prone to attacks by weeds and so weed management shall be discussed too. To be continued"

In fact, two consultants backed out of the project as they insisted a vegetarian restaurant would never survive in a place like Salt Lake.Not only has Haveli thrived over the years but ironically, on weekdays we are packed with Bengali customers! says his young daughter Neha Bagla, who has now taken over the reins and is celebrating the restaurants 18th anniversary.The multi-cuisine vegetarian restaurant, next to CK Blocks Tank 9, turns 18 on April 18 but the festivities have begun four weeks in advance. So for four weeks now they will be serving cuisines of four different Rajasthani cities.The cuisine of every city has evolved based on the ingredients that are readily available and the preferences of its people, says Neha.Till Saturday its Jaipur week. So try the Pyaaz Ki Kachori, Sogri Ki Bhujji (a dry item made of the grated radish flower) and Bajre ki Khichdi. Despite its name, this khichdi is no shade of yellow. The bajra (pearl millet) gives it a greyish-white colour and the watery dish tastes even better with ghee and jaggery.The Jaipur thali.The star attractions of all cities (clockwise from above left)- Pyaaz Ki Kachori of Jaipur, Mirchi Vada of Jodhpur, Bharwan Alu Gravy of Jaisalmer and Sohan Halwa of Udaipur. Pictures by Shubham PaulOn Sunday will start Udaipur week, says Neha. This is a city that has many Jains, so the food will be sans onion and garlic. Save the Khasta Kachori Chaat in the starter section, all dishes here are quite light. Even the Rajasthani stapleDal Baati Churma has been replaced with Dal Gajra Ro Baati Sang Churma that uses the lighter grain gajra instead of wheat. The star dish of Udaipur however is the sticky dessert Sohan Halwa.Jodhpur is a spicy city so brace yourself for Mirchi Vada, says Neha, whose ancestors are from the Jodhpur-Udaipur region. The vada is made of stuffed big green chillies and relished with Lehsoon Ri Chutney (garlic sauce) or Keri Ri Lungi (a green mango puree). Also save space for Bajre Ka Khichdo and mind you, khichdo is not khichdi.Unlike khichdi, khichdo is not watery. Its dry and youll feel granules of bajra in your mouth, says Neha.The fourth city Jaisalmer is known for its tandoor items and so the must-have is the spicy tandoori dish Bharwan Aloo Gravy. Every menu gets a customised drink along with the meals and Jaisalmer gets Kairi Ro Pani, a sweet-and-sour mango and tamarind drink that also helps digestion.The four weeks will offer various kinds of rotis along with the main course such as Missi and Jowar Roti. Made of corn, the crispy, yellow Missi Roti has a sweetish tinge and so goes well with sour curd-based items like Gatte Ki Sabji.Jowar Roti on the other hand is a light and healthy option and goes well with pulses.While one can pick dishes from the a la carte menu one can also go for the thali, that includes every item on offer for a particular city. The thali costs around Rs 550, after an 18 per cent discount.Brinda Sarkar"

Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker.

We are looking at compressing the supply chains and creating appropriate climate infrastructure for natural preservation of TOP,"" Badal said.A sum of Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for this scheme.Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), agri-logistics processing facilities and professional management will be encouraged under this scheme, she added.Food Processing Secretary J P Meena said the key features of the scheme will mostly likely be ready by April.The vegetable clusters are already mapped in the country and need to work out backward and forward linkages for FPOs keen to take advantage of the scheme, he added.The 'Operation Greens' is similar to the 'Operation Flood' launched in 1966 which was the world's biggest dairy development program of the government."

As for the Operation Green for onion and potato, the entire institutional mechanism would have to be worked out by the NITI Aayog along with the states. So is the situation with regard to the MSP for several other agri commodities. While the NITI Aayog and the states would bear in mind the farmers' interest, the institutional mechanism would surely strike a balance between remuneration to the growers as also the impact on the retail prices. So, the immediate fear may be an over-reaction and the RBI should not get influenced while fixing the REPO (policy lending) rates in the coming week.""In so far as the stock market is concerned, it is a healthy correction which was overdue.""A lot of froth and unnecessary exuberance had gathered around the stocks, particularly in the mid-cap space and there was no justification while matched against the corporate earnings. In fact, one of our earlier papers had cautioned about wild fluctuations in the market in 2018 in the backdrop of head winds like rising crude oil prices, revenue implications of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) roll out and other pressures on the fisc,"" said ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat.The paper said, as is well recognised by the Union Budget, creation of jobs on a massive scale is the need of the hour.""While the government has realised this fact, it is time the RBI joined the initiative by ensuring that the growth which seems visible, should be encouraged by at least not revising the interest rates upward, if at all the present macro situation does not favor any reduction."""

I have requested assistance from the Government of India for the same,"" he said in a representation made to the Union Minister.To ensure that cooperatives are able to function effectively, the chief minister demanded for increase in the quantum of concessional refinance which National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) provides from the current 40 per cent to 75 per cent of the ground level disbursement.""This will help us to provide timely and needy credit to small and marginal farmers,"" he said.To ensure farmers get credit at lower rate, the chief minister said that the government should raise the subsidy from 2 per cent to 3 per cent on crop loans for cooperatives.With regard to minimum support price (MSP) of crops, Mr Kumaraswamy asked the Centre to consider C2+FL formula while fixing the price instead of current A2+FL formula.He also suggested the central government to fix MSP for horticultural crops like tomato, onion and potato.Among other demands, the chief minister demanded the Centre to give a special financial package of Rs 2,477.26 crore for losses incurred by arecanut and coconut growers in the state.Coconut has been affected in 1.37 lakh hectare and arecanut in 95,352 hectare and the total loss is pegged at Rs 9,909.6 crore in the state, he added.""The state has prioritised farmer welfare in all its programmes and simultaneously initiated concerted efforts to achieve the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022,"" the chief minister informed in the meeting.The state has been perennially affected by drought with six out of last eight years being declared as drought years and farmers have endured adverse effect of severe successive droughts, he added."

A much anticipated June visit was canceled because of a ""scheduling conflict,"" according to Cloakroom owner Andre de Moya, who gave a brief tour of his club on a recent weekday night.Daniels is scheduled to be here for the club's ""Official Grand Opening."" Four years ago, the Cloakroom's building - then on one of K Street's seedier blocks - collapsed, sending customers and nearly nude performers into the streets, and the club shut down. It reopened this spring and now sits among high-priced condominiums and trendy restaurants.A touch of class appears to be what de Moya is banking on. The club website makes no mention of the ""Make America Horny Again"" tour that Daniels launched in January in South Carolina, days after news reports surfaced that Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to silence her during the 2016 presidential campaign - an attempt to keep her from talking about her alleged relationship with Trump. (Trump has acknowledged the payment but has denied the affair.) For its Washington, D.C., audience, the Cloakroom teases a show more tastefully titled ""All Things Revealed.""Which is just what audiences anticipate from a woman who has made her living performing, writing and directing pornographic films. De Moya was coy, though, about what to expect when Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, shows up to perform two shows each night on Monday and Tuesday.De Moya declined to say whether there would be any special arrangements when the country's most polarizing pole dancer takes the stage. It would be like ""any old night,"" he said, but they ""just happen to have Stormy Daniels here.""Though ""here,"" as de Moya added, is ""pretty close to the White House.""Tickets for the shows have been on sale on the club's website: general admission is $50 for entry to the main floor, and comfy leather VIP-level seating is $100. As for the 12-guest skyboxes, which offer aerial views of dancers turning somersaults on poles below? For $3,500 per show, they come with added enticements such as bottles of champagne, truffle popcorn and ""Dark and Stormy Shots.""The Cloakroom - which bills itself as a multilevel adult entertainment venue - is, by all appearances, more upscale than the last place Daniels performed when she visited the area, at Fantasies Nightclub and Sports Bar in Baltimore, a squat concrete building about 15 minutes from the airport.The cover charge at that event in April was $15 for early arrivals. The menu offered deep-fried fish nuggets and chicken wings served with ""G-string onion straws."" And while the Cloakroom has scheduled a 6 p.m. Daniels performance to accommodate summer work hours, on her first night in Baltimore, Daniels didn't appear onstage until after 10:30 p.m.A succession of house dancers entertained a restive audience of regulars, strip-club first-timers and journalists until Daniels sashayed onstage as a sequined Little Red Riding Hood.She performed in heels that were modest by the standards of the night - a reminder, like the 1980s dance music, that Daniels, at 39, is a senior figure among strippers. As the crowd broke into chants of ""Stormy! Stormy! Stormy!"" and some showered her with bills, all things were revealed, as Cloakroom promises they will be this week.It was all over in about 10 minutes.Or so it seemed, until Daniels crawled along the bar with a man carrying a purple bucket walking beside her. Strip-club newcomers were transfixed, tucking bills into her thong. One man pressed Daniels to join him on his bar stool. She declined. ""I'm not doing lap dances tonight,"" Daniels told him.Is that what visitors should expect when Daniels comes to Washington, D.C.?""No,"" said de Moya, who was willing to offer some idea of what not to expect: At the Cloakroom, performers are not allowed on the bar.""This is a high-class gentlemen's club,"" de Moya said as neon-blue lights shone on a topless dancer nearby. ""You can quote me on that."""

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

The Centre had introduced the export incentive at 5% for onions only in July as a measure to help boost price realisation for the growers.Now, with the current increase, onions enjoy one of the highest incentives for agro-exports. This timely intervention would help the farmers who have recently harvested their produce and who have sowed/ recently transplanted their seeds, expecting better prices, the government said explaining the decisions rationale.Tamarind, wild honeyIn a separate decision, the Centre also raised the minimum support price (MSP) on 23 Minor Forest Produce (MFP) items including tamarind and wild honey and introduced MSP for 17 new items.The items whose MSP has been revised include forest produce covered under the scheme that was introduced in 2013-14.In view of the general cost escalation on all fronts, the question of revision of MSP of the MFP items had been under consideration of the Government for some time, the government said.Some of the items that have seen an increase in MSP are tamarind (with seeds) from Rs. 18 per kg to Rs. 31 per kg, wild honey (Rs. 195 per kg from Rs. 150 per kg), Karanj seeds (from Rs. 18 per kg to Rs. 19 per kg), Sal seeds (from Rs. 12 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg), and Mahua seeds (from Rs. 20 per kg to Rs. 25 per kg).The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) also approved increasing the MSP for fair average quality (FAQ) of milling copra to Rs. 9,521 per quintal for the 2019 season, from Rs. 7,511 per quintal in 2018, and the MSP of ball copra to Rs. 9,920 per quintal for 2019, from Rs. 7,750 per quintal in 2018."

For his entire lot of the vegetable fetched him only Rs. 1,974.50, or Rs. 0.55 per kg.Mr. Patel is not alone as thousands of garlic and onion farmers in Gujarats Saurashtra region find themselves in deep distress because of the steep drop in the prices of their produce. Gujarat is one of the top producers of garlic and onion with extensive sowing in Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Amreli, Junagadh, and Kutch districts.We are forced to sell garlic from Rs. 20 to Rs. 80 per 20 kg in APMCs, said Premjibhai Senjalia, a farmer from Rabarika village in Amreli district. Average price is about Rs. 50-70 per 20 kg, that means Rs. 250 to Rs. 350 per quintal.Due to the extremely low prices, Mr. Senjalia said he was yet to sell the approximately 50 quintals of garlic lying harvested in his house. I had garlic in 10 bigha land and production is about 50 quintal. I have stocked it because there is no one willing to buy thanks to lower prices, he said, adding that thousands of farmers in his district had also held back on selling their harvests.In most APMCs in the State such as the ones at Rajkot, Gondal, Mahuva and Jamnagar the prices of both the commodities have been hovering below Rs. 100 per 20 kg, pushing farmers into distress as they sell at a loss.Across the region, garlic and onion growers are selling at a loss, said Virji Thummar, a Congress legislator from Amreli district. They dont even realise their basic costs of labour and inputs, he added.Bhikhabhai Markana, a farmer from Kalavad in Jamnagar district, harvested about 40 quintal of onion from his 2 bighas. He sold 23 quintals at the Rajkot AMPC at Rs. 40 per 20 kg, fetching him Rs. 200 per quintal.My cost including labour, inputs like seed, fertiliser and irrigation is Rs. 12,000 for the two bighas of onion and I would sell the produce for about Rs. 8,000-10,000 at current market price, he said, reflecting the plight of the regions farmers.Sacks of unsold garlicBalubhai Ahir, a garlic grower from Khirsara village in Rajkot district, told The Hindu that more than two lakh sacks of garlic were lying in farmers houses in about a dozen villages in Jetpur taluka.Not many farmers have sold the stock because of low price, they are not getting even peanuts, said Mr. Ahir. Average cost to grow garlic is Rs. 12,000 per bigha during its four-and-a-half month crop cycle and average yield is 7-8 quintal. If sold at current price of Rs. 70-80 per 20 kg...a farmer would realise about Rs. 2,500-3,200 per bigha, a loss of at least Rs. 8,000-9,000 per bigha."

Wholesale prices of onions are subdued at present because of the increase in the arrival of the fresh crop at the mandis, it said.Rewards under the scheme are payable as a percentage of realised free-on-board value and an MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties, including the basic customs duty.In recent weeks, farmers have been blocking highways and dumping onions as the prices have slumped to about Rs 1 per kg in the wholesale markets even though it takes around Rs 8 to produce a kg of the bulb crop.

Haryana is giving highest price in the country of sugarcane to the growers, the CM claimed.Khattar said that girdawari was being conducted in the state to assess the damage to crop due to hailstorm in different parts of Haryana this month. Compensation on account of damage to crop due to fire had been distributed by the respective deputy commissioners. Letters have been written to all the DCs directing them to give details of the remaining such cases so that compensation could be disbursed to those left out, he added.To remove shortcomings in the girdawari conducted manually by the department concerned and enhance accuracy to assess the damage to crops due to water logging, rain, and hailstorms, it had now been decided to set up an online portal, Khattar said. A farmer would have to give details concerning his crop and area under cultivation on this portal, which would be double checked by agriculture and farmers welfare department and revenue department so that he did not face any problem while getting claims from insurance companies and banks, the CM said.While referring to the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana, the chief minister said that potato, tomato, cauliflower and onion were now being covered. If any farmers got price less than the minimum support price for these crops, the state government would cover the price deficit for farmers, he said, adding that 18,000 farmers cultivating 48,000 acres had so far register themselves. He said that besides the government and the concerned departments, it was also the duty of MLAs, even of the opposition parties, to make the farmers aware in their respective areas of these schemes so that maximum people could benefit.Soft loans from cooperative banks were being provided to farmers on 0% interest rate, the CM said. Apart from this, compensation amounting to about Rs 890 crore had been distributed to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanaduring the last three years in Haryana, of which Rs 229 crore had been given to farmers of Sirsa alone."

Though it has only been a month since Devi started to sell the evening snack thattu vadai set at her roadside stall in Nandhi Kovil Street near Teppakulam, it has already become a favourite among many. Thattu vadai set is a delicious twist to the traditional thattais or ellu adai (a crispy snack made with rice flour and sesame). In Thattu vadai, vegetables and chutney varieties are stuffed between two small thattais. The stall is open from 4pm to 8.30pm every day and caters to around 50 to 100 customers daily.According to Devi, she had no plans of starting the food stall, but her daughter and son-in-law gave her the idea to help her overcome boredom at home. She then zeroed in on making thattu vadai set after a similar venture by a man at Small Kammala Street proved to be successful. ""I initially had no idea on how it should be done. Later, my daughter showed me YouTube videos and I learnt by watching them,"" she added.Devi prepares two different chutneys for thattu vadai set -- raw mango chutney and peanut chutney -- both of which have tamarind, onions and chillis as accompaniments to the main ingredients. She then smears the chutneys in two thattai sets respectively and between them, she stuffs beetroot , carrot, raw mango, onion and coriander , all in raw form and serves them to the customers. ""The preparation is very easy. For now, Ive been preparing thattais myself but if demand is more, I get it from the snack shops and then make thattu vadai set. As days go on and I get more familiar with this, Ill stop purchasing thattai from others,"" she told TOI. Four sets of thattu vadai set are available at Rs 20.Devi said that she was proud of the fact that only within a months time she has got several loyal customers. ""Though there are a couple more thattu vadai set stalls, the dish is still not very common in Trichy and is pretty popular in Salem. So people are finding my snack relatively new and are loving it,"" she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her food stall in the future, she said she would be introducing kaara pori (spicy puffed-rice) from this week.""The initial response has been so much better than I had anticipated. Ive to make use of this and start introducing new dishes so that my customer base widens,"" Devi said exuding confidence."
