These officials are trying to project the crop insurance scheme as the Centre's contribution. I vouch that this is a travesty of truth,"" she said. ""The Centre is trying to showcase the scheme as its own when it pays only 20% of the liability while the state bears 80%. I am telling AIC officials the state will withdraw its deposits with AIC if they continue with such misinformation. We can very well bear entire liability if we can pay 80% of insurance premium,"" she said.State officials pointed out that Bengal was the only state where farmers didn't have to pay crop insurance for rabi crops other than potato and onion . The state government pays its own share and also the beneficiary's share, which adds up to 80% of the insurance premium.The Centre uses the PMFBY tag by paying only 20% of the premium share. According to state officials, the CM has introduced a crop insurance scheme called Bangla Fasal Bima which is aimed at covering rabi crops, with the state bearing the entire cost of the premium. ""Now, when the CM has mentioned it, beneficiaries under PMFBY are likely to be transferred to the Bangla Fasal Bima scheme,"" a state official said.The CM also listed government bounties in the agricultural sector. ""We have abolished 'khajna' (land rent) on agricultural land. The owner of agricultural land doesn't have to pay a mutation fee to get it registered. We are giving farmer pensions to 1 lakh beneficiaries and have increased monthly pensions from Rs 750 to Rs 1,000,"" she said."

He later ploughed the field with a tractor.At the Vinchur sub-market of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is the countrys largest wholesale market for onions, Maruti Gund was offered Rs 191 per quintal on Wednesday. Upset with the low price, he took the crop back to his farm and ploughed over it.He also tried to sell the produce in the wholesale markets of Ahmednagar and Pune, but he had to spend a lot in transport. When the onion prices started crashing, I sold 47 quintals in Ahmednagar and got Rs 300 per quintal. But I had to spend Rs 200 per quintal on transport, gunny bags, labour cost and other expenses. In the end, I was left with Rs 100 per quintal, he said.Gund then sold 25 quintals of onions in the wholesale market at Pune, but got the rate of Rs 290 per quintal. The quality of summer onions I sold there was very good but nevertheless I got a paltry rate, he added.After all these efforts, he decided to again go to the nearest APMC. He still had over 50 quintals of onions in storage. After I got just Rs 190 a quintal, I took 30 quintals and dumped them on my farmland. At least, I will have good manure and I would not have to spend on fertiliser for the next crop, said Gund.He added that he will similarly be dumping the remaining 20 quintals of onions on his farm. When asked, Gund said, Government should compensate the losses or give grant considering the base rate of Rs 2,000 per quintal to farmers. It should compensate the losses of onion farmers, who have sold or yet to sell, accordingly.On governments ex-gratia of Rs 200 per quintal for onion farmers, he said, We feel it is a mockery of farmers. This will not solve a problem of farmers and we will also not accept the ex-gratia amount. We feel it is a mockery to farmers, he said."

The summer crop, harvested in March and April, has shelf life of about six months. Usually, the last batch of the summer crop reaches the market in mid-October, after which, the kharif onions takes over.This year, farmers stocked on the long-lasting summer crop hoping for a better price later. However, low demand and glut in the market brought prices crashing down. Even the fresh kharif crop is getting low rates at present. On Monday, kharif onions were selling at a minimum price of Rs2 per kg and an average of Rs5 per kg.The average wholesale onion prices have crashed by 91% in the past two months from Rs21.51 per kg on October 17 to Rs2 per kg on December 24. This occurred as supply exceeded demand.Farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of transporting their produce to the market. To add to their woes, stocked onions have begun sprouting with the drop in minimum temperatures.How will farmers survive if they get such a low price? We should be able to recover our costs at least, if not make some profit, onion farmer Kuber Jadhav said, recommending that the government announce minimum support price of Rs20 per kg for onions.APMC officials said farmers prefer storing onions in a bid to get better price for their produce. The current arrival of summer onions in the market is the farmers storage, which is about six months old. Moreover, the fresh kharif crop has also started arriving in the market, causing huge drop in demand for the summer onions.On Monday, minimum wholesale onion price was recorded at Re1 per kg and maximum wholesale price was recorded at Rs3.91 per kg at Lasalgaon APMC. Average wholesale onion price was Rs 2 per kg. Totally, 12,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday.Upset with the low prices, farmers from Nashik district had sent the money earned through the auction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis."

The factionism has gone. The drinking water problem is under control after Ravi Krishna helped us to build a water purification plant and sourced water from a borewell, said K Harischandra, a villager. But all our hopes have been dealt a blow by this years drought, he added.While the sum assured is Rs 40,000 per hectare, each farmer gets only Rs 2,990 per acre, despite losing his entire crop. Many of the farmers do not have any information about the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, a crop insurance scheme.I invested around Rs 15,000 per acre by taking loans, but the yield was only one sack of groundnut per acre. None of the agricultural officers visited us and we dont have any knowledge about the insurance scheme, said B Muniswamy, a farmer who lost his groundnut crop due to the drought in the kharif season.When TOI visited Kapatralla, some farmers who have not migrated seemed curious about the visitors. They wondered whether help had arrived. Onion crop in 10 acres has dried up. I suffered Rs 20,000 loss per acre, said Golla Rangamamma, a woman farmer of the village.A Hariprasad, manager of Andhra Pragati Grameena Bank at Kappatralla, told TOI how they have disbursed ?8.38 crore loan to around 971 people this year for kharif and rabi crops, to farmers from four villages, including Kappatralla, Jilledubudakala, Madhapuram and Obulapuram.Each loan is renewed for most farmers. We fix the premium, when farmers take crop loans for weather-based insurance scheme. For groundnut crop, the rate is Rs 900 per hectare. We have processed around 675 claims under the scheme. The insurance company has settled claims for 2017-18 where Rs 2,990 was given per acre. Under PM Fasal Bima Yojana, for crops like cotton and onion, around 29 farmers got registered, Hariprasad said.But farmers alleged that insurance companies and agricultural officers have failed to do proper assessment, leading to less insurance amount. Kurnool district collector S Satyanarayana added that the insurance amount was paid to the consumer as per the assessed damage of the crop by assessors of the insurance company."

It is shocking that religious prejudices can rob children of their fundamental right to food in a secular country like India. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that a nutritious and hearty mid-day meal can reduce dropout rates in schools along with checking malnutrition among children.Given that India is home to 48.2 million malnourished children with stunted growth, the careless disregard towards the menu of mid-day meals reveals the establishments apathy. Eggs are highly nutritious. Further, a boiled egg cannot be adulterated in any way, making it the perfect component of welfare schemes. Add to this the fact that five million eggs reportedly crack or go bad in India owing to the lack of adequate cold storages and the absence of the protein from mid-day meals seems more senseless.The purpose of the mid-day meal scheme is to provide nutritious food to students and address the problem of malnutrition. The government should ensure that no prejudice stands in the way of this.Sujit De,CalcuttaSir  The task of deciding the items on the menu for a mid-day meal should lie solely with the nutritionists or public health experts. The human resource development ministry or any private agency contracted by it to serve mid-day meals should not have a say in what the children will eat. It has been reported that Akshay Patra, the organization which provides mid-day meals to over 1.76 million children in 14,700 schools, has deliberately kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for its own religious beliefs. But according to the agency, the meals it supplies comply with the norms of the HRD ministry.The government must remember that its decisions affect a vast number of people critically. The least it can do is set up a commission of experts to determine food items which will provide the highest amount of nutrition to children from underprivileged families.Sukhamay Biswas,CalcuttaSir  Akshay Patra has been praised for the nutritious, clean and hygienic food that it serves to children as part of mid-day meals. The controversy around the inclusion of eggs, onions and garlic is needless, especially since the eggs that are mass-produced these days in factories are often laced with antibiotics. Worldwide, there has been a shift in consumption patterns towards plant-based food and beverages. These are widely believed to be more natural, sustainable and healthy. Akshay Patra should be allowed to continue running its well-managed programme.H.N. Ramakrishna,BangaloreFlavours of BengalSir  Bengalis have always taken pride in having a nuanced palate. But time  and the Green Revolution?  seems to have tamed their taste buds. A plate of pulao served at a famous Bengali establishment convinced me of this. The short-grained, sweet and sticky variety of rice known as gobindobhog that was synonymous with pulao has been replaced in most places with the long-grained basmati. No one can deny that basmati is flavourful, but can it ever replace the taste of parboiled rice with mangsher jhol? The ubiquitousness of basmati is killing the vibrance of Bengali cuisine.Sanchari Mukherjee,CalcuttaParting shotSir  Amitav Ghosh should be congratulated for winning the coveted Jnanpith award. He has the rare distinction of being the first Indian writer in English to bag the prestigious prize. Ghoshs writings paint vivid pictures on a wide variety of themes like travel, the unique problems of the diaspora, post-colonialism, postmodernism, eco-criticism, history, memory, time, political struggle, communal violence and loss, among other things.Ghoshs research is always deep and illuminating and his books like The Shadow Lines and The Hungry Tide tug at the readers heartstrings. The award that he has just been given is well-deserved indeed. One expects many more enriching books from Ghosh.Dileep D. Anand,Alappuzha, Kerala"

Each farmer will get a subsidy of Rs. 200 per quintal, up to 200 quintals of their onion produce.The subsidy is applicable to farmers who have sold produce between November 1 and December 15 this year in the agriculture produce market committees. The decision will not be applicable to the Mumbai APMC. Altogether, Rs. 150 crore will be directly transferred to farmers bank accounts.The Opposition, meanwhile, termed the package as a mockery of the plight of the farmers. This amount comes down to Rs. 2 per kilogram. Will the government explain the logic behind providing such little help to farmers? Nationalist Congress Party State president Jayant Patil said.Onion production in the State takes place in three seasons: kharif, late kharif and rabi. According to government officials, the onion produced in kharif and late kharif seasons cannot be stored for too long, compared to that produced in rabi season.While the total onion production in the State till now is estimated to be around 75 lakh quintal, the agriculture market committees received around 41.23 lakh quintal onion in November.With such a huge supply, the prices have naturally dropped. The onion belt of the State, especially north Maharashtra, is suffering. Todays decision will help to bring relief to farmers, an official said.Last week, as a mark of protest, an onion farmer in Nashik had sent his paltry earnings to the Prime Ministers Office. The PMO had asked for a report from the State government."

""The decision will be applicable in the case of all onions sold between November 1 and December 15 in all the APMC markets except Navi Mumbai. The maximum relief will be given on 200 quintals of onion sold for a farmer, which means the distressed farmer will at least get Rs 40,000 amount in their account,"" said a senior official from the marketing department.Onion farmers have been protesting since November over the low price their produce has been fetching.The average rate of kharif onions in the market was between Rs 750 and Rs 850, compared to between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,300 last year.Several reasons have been given for the crash, from hoarding of summer onions to reduced demand from nearby states like MP and Karnataka. In the 45 days from November 1 to December 15, 75 lakh quintals of onion were brought to AMPCs across the state. Farmers who sent these onions are eligible for relief.The farmer fraternity said not many had sold onions between November 1 and December 15 since the prices were crashing. A farmer from Ahmednagar district , Shreyas Abhale, had sent a money order of Rs 6 to CM Devendra Fadnavis after selling 2,657 kg of onions at a rate of Rs 1 per kg at the Sangamner wholesale market. He had said that after adjusting market expenses, he was left with only Rs 6.In a related development, over 300 onion farmers staged a three-hour sit-in agitation at the Nampur Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Satana taluka of the district on Thursday. The farmers were unhappy that the traders were not giving them sale receipt after buying the produce at a paltry amount of Rs 1 per kg."

The think-tank has also suggested replacing the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), which was recommending MSPs, with an agriculture tribunal.The report comes at a time when agrarian distress has become a politically potent issue with state governments vying with each other to write off agriculture loans, ignoring the fiscal implications.On Wednesday, Rajasthan became the latest state to waive farm loans.

The department also does not have a full-time secretary for three and half months now.State agriculture minister and senior BJP leader Pandurang Phundkar passed away on May 31. Ever since his death, Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil is handling the additional charge of the department. Amid rumours of State Cabinet expansion, the party has not appointed an independent minister for this department.Similarly, agriculture department secretary Bijay Kumar retired from his position in August. Ever since the departments additional charge is being handled by Eknath Dawale, secretary, Water Conservation and Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS). The government is yet to appoint a full-time secretary for the agriculture department, one of the most crucial in the upcoming general and Assembly elections.Both the departments are working very well. None of the schemes are being derailed, no funding has been stopped. It is true that the department does not have an independent minister and secretary. But there has been no dearth of funding for farmer-related projects, said a senior minister. When asked about the cabinet expansion or re-division of cabinet portfolios, he refused to comment saying the Chief Minister has the authority to take the call.Maharashtra was in the middle of controversy recently after a farmer named Sanjay Sathe sent Rs. 1,064 earned from selling onions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to highlight the low returns on the crop. Following record-break onion production, farmers have been complaining of low returns on the sale of their produce. Up to July, the State has recorded 1,417 farmer suicides. Despite the Chief Ministers assurances, the farm loan waiver scheme announced in June 2017, is yet to reach its target.This government is not serious about the agrarian sector and the 50% of the population which is dependent on farm sector.

Not only did the initiative ensure that the farmers got paid adequately for their produce by eliminating middlemen and absorbing transportation expenditures, the Pratishthan also made onions available to consumers at a fair price.Kondhanpur farmer Balasaheb Chorge, who had harvested 1,500 kg of onion, was one of beneficiaries.The approximate input cost for medium quality onion for me was Rs 5 per kg. Buyers at the Pune Market Yard were only offering Rs 3-Rs 5 per kg. The best case scenario was no profit and the worst was actually suffering a loss. I would also have had to incur an additional expenditure of Rs 2,700  to transport the produce, pay the commission agent and porters, and the market yard levy, Chorge told TOI.However, the Pratishthan workers bought his produce for Rs 8-Rs 10 per kg, depending on the quality.The Pratishthan helped many other onion farmers from around Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar earn about Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kilogram of onion. The onions are now being sold directly to the consumers from an empty plot in Sahakarnagar.Credit goes to Rahul Mane and Prasanjit Fadnavis, who, under the guidance of senior labour union leader Balasaheb Fadnavis, bought over 30-tonne onion from 35 farmers in Sangamner , Rahatwadi, Darade, Vaphgaon and others.Prasanjit said, We noticed the farmers were getting very low prices  Rs 2 per kilogram  though the consumers in the city were still paying nearly Rs20 per kg for onions. My father, Balasaheb Fadnavis, suggested we help the farmers by buying the produce directly from them and selling it at the same cost to consumers. We bought the onions for Rs 10 per kg and sold at the same cost while bearing the transport and logistical expenses ourselves.According to Prasanjit, the farmers were able to save the costs of brokerage, transport, labour, cess and taxes, thus earning greater profits.Balasaheb Fadnavis said, Two years ago, I had gone to an onion farm and saw that the farmer was not harvesting the crop due to poor prices. That time, I had bought the entire 200-300 kg of onion and sold it for him. This year, I suggested Mane and my son take up this initiative.Shivaji Jarande, another farmer said, Mane and Fadnavis bought my produce for Rs 8 per kg and the entire amount is my profit.Mane added, We are getting bulk orders from many big residential societies and are hoping to bring in another 10 tonnes of onion for direct sales."

The simmering discontent among farmers gained political traction in 2018.Various opposition parties have been raising their voices against different issues to suit their electoral needs but they showed unanimity in expressing their solidarity with the demands for better crop remuneration and farm loan waivers during the November 30 farmers' rally in the capital.At the same rally, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had said: ""The voice that is reverberating now across the country is of the farmers who are in deep distress and crisis.""For the first time, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be fought on issues revolving around rural distress, said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who is credited with bringing over 200 farmers' outfits under one banner -- the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).""There has always been agrarian distress in the country. However, it never got an occasion to become a principal factor in the elections. The BJP's defeat in the Assembly polls, coupled with the newly-achieved unity among farmers, has ensured that farm distress would take a centre stage in the 2019 elections,"" Yadav told IANS.He termed the BJP regime led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""the most anti-farmer"" government in the history of the independent India because of its ""unsympathetic"" treatment of farmers in the past four-and-a-half years.Many videos throughout the year went viral on the social media, featuring angry farmers throwing their harvest and milk on the roads in the absence of remunerative prices.Amid protests, the government increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for certain agriculture commodities. However, the farmers found this not at par with their demands and expectations.Also, poor procurement of commodities owing to inadequate numbers and delay in the opening of purchasing centres by the government agencies forced the farmers to make distress sales.In the case of vegetables, while the retail prices hovered between Rs 20-30 in major cities, the prices received by farmers for semi-perishable commodities such as potatoes and onion slumped to Rs 1 per kg.The Agriculture Ministry seemed ""ineffective"" to create a redressal mechanism, activists said, though it came up with three procurement plans. Notably, Union Minister and Senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari had in June this year acknowledged that there was agrarian crisis due to surplus crop output and sought action to address the problem.And yet, the BJP-government failed to take corrective action by analysing the demand-and-supply situation, said Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and Lok Sabha member Raju Shetti, who quit BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over farmers issues' last year.""The government has been quite aware of the farmers' issues. However, it did not take required action to ensure remunerative prices for farmers and the procurement of their harvest was ineffective,"" Shetti added.Noted agronomist Ashok Gulati said there was ""lack of understanding"" and ""lack of vision"" in the current BJP regime. He said the government did not carry out the required market reforms but resorted to just slogans and announcements.""Even after the Mandsaur firing episode, the government did not act,"" he said.Any government needs a smart agriculture minister for effective implementation of schemes, he added.Interestingly, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh chose to attend a Yoga session with Baba Ramdev in Bihar two days after the Mandsaur firing."

Many farmers have been residing at the yard, hoping for sale of their produce one day, and alleged that sale of onions was stopped the past week.Protesters said assurances given by officials had remained on the paper as onion stocks, accumulating in the yard, were not being moved. A farmer, who had brought 400 bags from Kadapa district, said he had been selling 1-2 bags for Rs. 100-150, just to earn enough to feed himself and stay at the yard.Others alleged a nexus between middlemen and officials and urged the State government to act.If this continues, we will not have enough money to cultivate the next crop and will have to resort to the extreme step of ending our lives, they said."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Sharif Khan, 45, from Baldara village in Baran district of Rajasthan found his name was listed on a loan waiver scheme three days before a rally by the PM on November 6. The waiver was announced in August but my name was not on the list till November. I have two loans of Rs 2.5 lakh in total but was only eligible for a waiver of Rs 25,000. I went to the BDO and was told I would not even get that money. Instead, I could take Rs 25,000 worth of fertilisers. I told myself, at least I am getting something, Khan said.Formulas to waive farm loans are not uniform across states. Rajasthan, for instance, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings and harvest volume. Others have fixed limits for the amount to be waived.Khan is among thousands around the country who have been stumped by the fine print in waiver schemes. Many farmers across India who TOI spoke to said the hastily put together and poorly executed approach will not solve systemic problems.Waivers cannot be a longterm solution. If the government gives minimum support price according to the market rate, that will be the biggest remedy, Khan added.In Wasadi village of Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Balwant Patilba Nikam, a marginal farmer with less than an acre, explained his situation. I received Rs 12,000 as protsahan (encouragement) from the state government in the runup to loan waivers. Under protsahan, small loans of up to Rs 15,000 are waived. My loan was Rs 12,000. But I needed money for production in the next season, and I ended up taking another loan. The government has to help us out of the debt trap. Partial waivers or small loans waivers alone wont help. The government should help us look at alternatives like poultry farming in addition to cultivation, Nikam said.More than 1,500 km away, in Thiruppurambiam village of Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu, 55-year-old V Anandan said he hadnt gained much from the waiver or the AIADMK governments process.Sometimes, farmers say, the loan process itself is faulty. I spent Rs 1.25 lakh to grow paddy on my 4.5 acres. According to the norms, and my eligibility, the cooperative society should have given me Rs 1.02 lakh as loan. But they sanctioned Rs 25,000, which was waived by the government. I had to bear the rest of the production cost. In future, if I do not have the money for the sowing season, I will have to apply for another loan, Anandan said.The Swaminathan Committee in 2004 had recommended farmers be allowed to fix the price for their produce on their own (cost of production plus 50% as profit), keeping local factors in mind. Waiving loans wont help, particularly when the loan is only a fraction of our expenses, Anandan added.Pandit Kerba Patil, 46, who has a farm in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, had taken a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh three years ago. Floods destroyed his crop.I could not pay the instalments on time. This continued for two years and the interest went on increasing. Ultimately, I had a debt of Rs 2.5 lakh, he said.When the state government announced the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana in 2017, Patil managed to get Rs 1.5 lakh, his original loan amount, waived. But now, Patil must clear the accrued interest of Rs 1 lakh before getting fresh loans. I have been farming since I was 6 years old. Being debt-ridden for the first time was harrowing, he said.In UPs Ujhaiya Fakirpur village of Mainpuri district, two Dalit brothers Upendra and Bablu, faced a similar dilemma. They had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh in 2013, but even after a waiver of Rs 1 lakh in 2017, they had to pay Rs 1.8 lakh.Upendra said, When we heard about the loan waiver, we contacted our village lekhpal. Months later, we were informed Rs 1 lakh has been waived from the principal amount. But when we reached our bank, the manager said we had to pay the interest of Rs 80,000. So we paid Rs 1.8 lakh in total.Others have had their loans waived and carry a clean slate, but they too say waivers are not the longterm solution. One of them, Mubarik Ali, in Guleli (Bareilly), had borrowed Rs 1 lakh on his Kisan Credit Card, against which he had repaid Rs 20,000. The outstanding amount has been waived and paid directly to the bank. It was impossible to get another loan till the earlier one was repaid, so this has been a relief. However, the government must focus on three things: crop insurance, better irrigation and subsidised seed and fertilisers. It will reduce our cost. If the entire crop is insured, there will be no need for a waiver at all, Ali said.Farmers are also compelled to take loans, even when they dont want to, as their produce does not get proper prices, said Nivrutti Nyaharkar in Vahegaoin village, Nashik. Nyaharkar, an onion grower, had borrowed Rs 1 lakh six years ago. Within seven months, he was to pay Rs 1.32 lakh. Despite my willingness to repay I could not, as my produce wasnt getting good prices. Moreover, input costs kept increasing. For two years, bad weather affected the harvest, Nyaharkar added. Thankfully, my loan was waived off. But next year ... I may face the same set of problems again.(With reports from Shoeb Khan in Ajmer, Vincent Arockiaraj in Trichy, Syed Rizwanullah in Aurangabad, Rahul Gayakwad in Kolhapur, Priyangi Agarwal in Bareilly, Arvind Chauhan in Mainpuri and Tushar Pawar in Nashik)"
5ce588bfe8e3fc56af40ce5a,Bad egg: Mid-day meals that only feed political goals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/bad-egg-mid-day-meals-that-only-feed-political-goals/cid/1679148,2018-12-18,"An egg a day keeps the doctor away. Eggs are among the most nutritious food items and contain almost all the nutrients required by growing children. This explains the long-standing demand to include them in mid-day meals, which is the primary  and, at times, the only  source of nutrition for close to 10 crore children. Given that India is home to a third of the worlds malnourished children, the importance of nutrient-rich items in the meal cannot be emphasized enough. Yet, time and again, religious and caste considerations of the majority  or should it be minority given that some estimates show only 23 per cent of Indians are actually vegetarian?  are allowed to come in the way of a childs health. It was recently revealed that an NGO contracted by the Centre to provide mid-day meals in 12 states kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for religious reasons. This is disturbing. But more worrying is that many state governments in a secular country have been influenced by similar concerns. The fundamental right to food also involves a right to choice, and surveys show that both parents and children in the states that do not serve eggs in mid-day meals are eager for its inclusion. What, then, explains the governments reservation against incorporating a non-vegetarian item? There are allegations that it is the result of pandering to influential caste groups and private contractors like the one in question. But such appeasement seems innocuous before more sinister influences of caste equations. Children from the scheduled groups  those who need it most  are reportedly given insufficient quantities of food, served last and asked to sit separately for mid-day meals.Yet, these biases are far from the only reasons behind the inadequacies of the scheme. Food procurement for mid-day meals is increasingly being centralized, wiping out traditional local diets  often more nutritious than the rice and pulses that are served  like various kinds of millets. Worse, the scheme is being used to replenish State coffers. For instance, in 2017 the ministry of human resource development directed that pulses for the scheme would come from the buffer stock of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation. In other words, help the Central body exhaust produce that it was unable to disburse. There are also directives to use fortified nutrients and packaged food on the pretext of making mid-day meals more hygienic. This opens the scheme up to private players. In the end, the scheme benefits a myriad stakeholders but one: children."

But without any inquiry, the state government officials in their report stated that my onions were blackish and of low quality. It is false and officials are misguiding you.""""I hope you will understand that if authorities can lie to you, what challenges a common man would be facing in government offices,"" he said in the letter sent from the local office of India Post.Almost every onion grower was facing the same situation of low rates and the state's ""apathy"" towards it, Sathe claimed, and requested the prime minister to find a solution to it.Notably, authorities of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) had said last week that the report submitted by the district deputy registrar office to the state government was ""false"".No official of the district deputy registrar office had met the APMC authorities in connection with the farmer's case, they said.Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for about 50 per cent of onion production in India.The Lasalgaon APMC in Nashik is the country's largest wholesale onion market."

Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday asked the officials to take precautionary measures for Phethai cyclone keeping in view the experience during the Titli cyclone. The government expected involvement of every employee and official. The machinery had to respond at lightning speed and work with dedication. The departments had to work in coordination to restore normalcy, he told officials during a teleconference.Cyclones had become a routine affair. The State had already faced Titli and Gaza when the government could assess the possible loss in advance. The landfall and heavy rainfall could be forecast exactly. Phethai was the third one in a row.The loss could be minimised with better planning and preparedness. Making an estimate and assessing the possible loss was necessary as it would give a fair idea of resources on hand. It would help mobilise the resources such as electricity poles, he said.Mr. Naidu recalled that the property loss was more during Titli, which uprooted thousands of trees and electric poles. The government had to struggle to restore power supply immediately. New electricity poles had to be erected at many places. Hence, arrangements should be made in advance to restore power supply and transport facilities. The power supply and road connectivity could be restored easily if the power saw machines, electricity poles etc necessary material were kept ready.The Revenue, Electricity, Panchayat Raj and Roads and Buildings departments should work in coordination. The NDRF teams should be deployed in advance. Rice, dal, oil, potatoes and onion should be procured. Emphasis should be on drinking water and food, he said.The people should be involved in relief measures through awareness on their duty in disaster management. Every village had to be alerted. Relief and rehabilitation measures need to be taken up. One force for each village should be readied."

It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."

The scheme is implemented by the Union Food Processing Ministry, that has a corpus of Rs. 500 crore and aims to aid farmers in times of price fluctuation in tomatoes, onions and potatoes. The State is considering seeking transport subsidy for onion growers to sell especially stored onions in consuming States and working on ex-gratia grant to compensate affected growers.Onion prices have come under pressure because of the arrival of stored onions as well as fresh kharif crop. The wholesale price for stored onions is lower owing to poor quality, while the kharif crop is fetching around Rs. 10 per kg, as per official data.In November, 50% of the onion that arrived in wholesale mandis in the State comprised stored onions. The price quoted was between Rs. 3.50 and Rs. 4 per kg, which has created unrest among farmers, a source said.There is higher quantity of stored onions in the State as farmers had increased area under the crop during the 2017-18 rabi season in anticipation of better prices, the source said."

The students had to use separate entry and exits and use separate wash basins and utensils.Objecting to this, a section of students contended that it amounted to discrimination. Upper caste households in India would usually have two entrances  one for the upper castes and the other for the impure lower castes. A mess in IIT-M is now having the same system. This mess has two separate entrances  one for vegetarians and the other for non-vegetarians. Not just that  separate wash basins and separate utensils as well. What started as a demand for pure vegetarian mess has become full-fledged untouchability, a student posted on Facebook.It is vacation time and only postgraduate and research scholars are occupying the hostels at present. A student said that the Himalaya complex (one of the hostels on the campus) has six mess halls. Students from different hostels dined in the mess where notices were put up to segregate students based on their food choices. More than 300 students were allotted to the mess.To avoid mix-upHowever, Sriram K Kompella, students general secretary said, It is not like people are not allowed to enter the vegetarian mess. Only that no non-vegetarian is allowed in it. Non-vegetarians can still register and enter the pure vegetarian mess. He contended: We believe and respect the lifestyle choices of vegetarians and are trying to ensure that theres no mix-up either in the kitchen, wash area for utensils and the dining region.According to him, separate entry and exits help to keep track of who registered for which mess and ensure those who hadnt registered for the mess did not dine there without paying the fees. The institute requires students to register every month afresh and they can change their food choices.We are not tracking who eats what or their caste. The segregation is purely on the basis of their food choice. There is no discrimination based on their choice of food either, argued an official.The notices were removed later in the evening. Secretary of hostel affairs Nihal K, issued an explanation stating that the posters had been found in the RRC mess, Himalaya. The caterer has been instructed to remove the poster immediately upon its discovery by mess monitoring committee.Caterers actIt was the act of the caterer and there was no directive by the committee, the note read, adding that in due course of time action will be taken on the caterer after an enquiry. The note said two entrances were provided to the mess to make the passage to each counter easier and not restrict passage from one to another or differentiate students in any capacity, and apologised for the inconvenience.The monitoring committee is a team of students that takes care of the issues in the mess and reports to the hostel affairs secretary. The final decision on matters will be taken in consultation with the Dean of Student Affairs and the Chairman of the council of wardens."

Earlier this week, the foundation submitted a letter to the government stating that it had started supplying hot milk to select schools. It added that it plans to extend this to all the schools it caters to in a phased manner. Earlier, children were served cold milk. However, the foundation did not respond to the issue of onion and garlic in meals in the letter.S.R. Umashankar, Principal Secretary, Department of Primary and Secondary Education, said the department has sought a report from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) on whether the nutritional value of food will be affected by the inclusion of onion and garlicThe foundation provides midday meals to 4.49 lakh students studying in government and aided schools from five districts in the State."

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

The market at Kalamna is dubbed to be the biggest in Asia in terms of size.Farm goods have been traditionally sold in market yards governed by Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs). The yards are dominated by middlemen, who buy the produce from farmers and further sell it to traders. In turn, a commission is deducted from the amount paid to farmers. Over a year ago, the state government did away with the old system. The agents at APMC now have to charge the commission from the buyers, instead of farmers.However, parallel markets soon emerged at smaller centres throughout the region, say agents. The operators take advantage of the grey area in the law. The commission rule is only applicable to the formal markets run by an APMC.An APMC market is registered and the area is defined by a boundary. Middlemen at Kalamna say that those in the unregulated markets continue to charge commission from farmers, and not traders. Since such markets do not come under any regulator, like the APMC, the operators here have a free run. Several complaints have gone unheeded. A complaint was even sent to the department of agriculture marketing, but there was no response, say the agents at Kalamna.This grey area increases the losses for farmers when there is a crash in prices, as it is happening with onions, said agents. As much as 5% commission is charged on onions, which is a big sum with depressed prices.The traders prefer the parallel markets, where they do not have to shell out any commission. The presence of more traders there also attracts farmers to such markets since the produce can be sold faster, and payments are made in cash, explained a Kalamna agent.Such markets have cropped up in interior areas of places like Tiroda, Wardha, Amravati Chandrapur and other areas, said Mohammed Afzal of Afzal Trading at Kalamna.As against last year, the rates of onions have come down by more than half. The current rates are in the range of Rs300 to 360 per 40kg. This comes to Rs9 a kg in the wholesale market. It was Rs1,400 per 40kg or Rs35 a kg on the same day last year. There is no major change in the arrivals at Kalamna market, despite all the hype about overproduction, he said.Even as an overall glut in the supply has led to crash in onion rates, the presence of parallel markets is adding to the farmers woes, said Ilahi Baksh of Saurashtra Trading Company at Kalamna, which deals in onions and potatoesThis has reduced volumes in the legal APMC run markets. It is because both traders and farmers prefer informal markets, he said. Onion growers do not depend on markets near the production centres like Nashik or Dhule alone. They also come to Nagpur, where they have to depend on these markets, added Munsif Bhai of Saurashtra Trading."

The Telegraph file picturePublic health experts on Thursday wrote to the Centre seeking termination of the contracts of a non-government agency that they said provided midday meals to schoolchildren across 12 states but kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for religious reasons.The agency their letter to the Union human resource development ministry referred to is Akshay Patra, which provides midday meals to over 1.76 million children in 14,700 schools.The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (Peoples Health Movement) and the Right to Food Campaign have expressed concern that the agencys decision to keep eggs out of its meals reflects a religious diktat.In their letter, they have highlighted that the ministrys guidelines on midday meals, issued last year, specify that no organisation supplying the meals should use the programme to propagate any religious practice.The health groups have argued that the inclusion of eggs can help children from the economically disadvantaged communities, who on average show a higher prevalence of under-nutrition and stunting than children from non-disadvantaged communities.The practice of keeping eggs out uses a religious preference to deny a high-nutrition-value food to children who would otherwise eat them, Sylvia Karpagam, a public health physician in Bangalore and member of the Abhiyan, told The Telegraph.Akshay Patra, in a statement emailed to this newspaper, said its freshly cooked meals are in compliance with the nutrition norms prescribed by the HRD ministry.A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on the issue of eggs, onion or garlic.In their letter, the health experts have cited the nutritional constituents of eggs and stressed that the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, recommends at least three eggs a week for children. Parents, civil society and children in several states have demanded eggs, the letter said.What were fighting for is the right of local communities to exercise their own food choices, said Vandana Prasad, a paediatrician, community health expert and member of the Abhiyan and the Public Health Resource Network.Members of the Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign said the immediate provocation for the letter was the agencys refusal to introduce onion and garlic in its midday meals as demanded by the Karnataka government.They said the standoff between the agency and the Karnataka government highlighted the position of rights-based campaigns that midday meals should be locally prepared and culturally relevant, and not provided by agencies that limit food on the basis of religious beliefs."

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.

His transportation cost, meanwhile, was Rs 2,430.Its the onion farmers hoarding their summer crop that are in distress since the fresh crop is fetching better rates and has created a glut, explained minister of state for agriculture Sadashiv Khot.

Only one demand which comes, again and again, is that MSP should be 1.5 times the cost of the C2.""...I am in favour of enhancing the income of farmers but to enhance the income by only giving them the price by government, which is not reflected in the demand of the society can have very adverse fiscal implications because many a consumer would not be able to buy such produce and it will end up in mounting public stocks,"" the noted agriculture economist argued.""Cost of such stock and interest thereon will rise, so it becomes so costly,"" he added. Further, if MSP is too high compared to open market price, the export will suffer and the country will become attractive for import from many countries.According to Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), C2 is the most comprehensive definition of the production cost of crops as it also accounts for the rentals on owned land and interest on fixed capital assets over and above A2+FL.The Swaminathan Commission was tasked with finding solutions to the problems faced by farmers. The commission submitted five reports between December 2004 and October 2006.Chand also said he expects that the country's farm production will increase by about 4 per cent in the current fiscal.The agriculture sector growth has been very good in 2016-17 and 2017-18. In one year, it was 6.3 per cent, in the other year, it was 3.4 per cent.""Even this year(2018-19) in the second quarter, it is 3.8 per cent which is not a bad growth for the agriculture (sector). Maybe at the end of this year, we will have agriculture sector (growth) something close to 4 per cent,"" he remarked.Asked why onion prices are crashing and farmers are not getting good prices for their produce, Chand said, ""If you do not have a storage capacity for onions then you will find that this kind of things will happen.""Noting that our agriculture production has changed in the last 10-15 years but our markets are not evolving, he said, ""new production scenario is a scenario of surpluses ... markets should now prepare themselves to handle surpluses.""That will not happen if regulations are not changed, if the infrastructure is not built, we will keep crying about these things,"" Chand insisted."

Till December 3, onion was sown over an area of 12,191 hectares, or just 50% of the area sown in the same period last year. Till December 3, 2017, onion had been sown on 24,200 hectares in the state.Figures released by the states agriculture department reveal that in the rabi season, on average, onion is sown on 46,400 hectares in the state. This year, the acreage is just 26% of the average, or 12,191 hectares.Officials said that onion is mainly cultivated in Bhavnagar district and other parts of Saurashtra. This year, sowing in Saurashtra is yet to gather pace. Officials said of the 12,191 hectares sown, 10,900 hectares were in Saurashtra.Ghanshyam Patel, chairman of the Mahuva market yard, said there is not enough water in Saurashtra this year and farmers hence chose not to sow onions. The acreage sown with onions is not likely to gather momentum as the first week of December has passed.Apart from their water woes, farmers in 2017 did get remunerative prices for their crop and this may also have kept them from growing onions. Patel said that farmers last year did not even recoup the basic costs they incurred.Meanwhile, at the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee yard, onions were selling for between Rs 5 and Rs 11 a kg, depending on quality. In the retail market in the city, onions are selling for Rs 25 a kg.Gordhan Patel, a farmer in Visavadar , said, This year there is hardly any onion cultivation in the region as people are moving to other crops or are not sowing any crops. I have three bighas of land but because of no water this year, I decided not to sow a commercial crop. I will sow a fodder crop, which will help me feed my cattle and will also bring in some money.Sources in the Mahuva market yard, the states largest yard for onions, said that this years crop will start arriving by December 15.

The court thus upheld conviction of a 22-year-old farmer from Nashik in the April 2014 case.Justice A M Badar, who passed the judgment on November 28, set aside his conviction under a charge of raping a girl aged under 16 but held him guilty under Section 376 for rape and also under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act ( Pocso ).The convict had challenged his August 2015 guilty verdict and a 10-year sentence for the crime committed in a field owned by his father in Nashik district. The prosecution said the girl was in need of a job and had agreed to work on the field. The convict took her along with younger children on his motorcycle to the field where he forced her inside a hut and allegedly raped her.The accused denied the rape or sexual assault charge. His defence was that two other girls, whom the survivor allegedly confided in, falsely implicated him for not having paid them for incomplete work on an onion plantation. A hostile public witness failed to prove the spot and other key witnesses were not examined, said the defence.Justice Badar said the girls testimony inspired confidence and required no other corroboration, but noted the presence of medical corroboration in her case too. He said she was competent to testify and had given rational answers. Her version that a witness forced her to allege rape cannot be construed to mean she was compelled to make a false allegation, as argued by the defence.There was no evidence to show she was over 18.The court therefore maintained the conviction for rape and under Pocso Act but reduced the sentence to seven years imprisonment."
