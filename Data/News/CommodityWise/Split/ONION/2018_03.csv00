They carried a bunch of withered onion crop which they said were damaged by a pest which they did not know. They showed it to the district collector at the weekly grievance day meeting held on Monday. Viswanathan told reporters that the farmers submitted a memorandum explaining the present state of the crop and had appealed to the collector to grant them genuine compensation.Farmers had raised small onions on 500 acres in and around Narasinganpettai near Thuraiyur. However, the pest had left nothing even for their domestic use, he said. This apart, farmers from Sellipalayam, Sengattupatti, Renganathapuram, Periyammapalayam, Ammanpalayam, Maruvathur and Keeranur have also raised small onion on around 2,000 acres in and around Thuraiyur. Their crops had also been affected by the pest.Only 10 days are left to harvest the 60-day crop. Farmers had spent Rs 20,000 per acre to raise the crop, but they have lost them during the harvest stage. So, the government should do the needful to give compensation of at least Rs 20,000 per acre, he added. The district collector had instructed agriculture officials to visit the fields and file a status report, the farmers who met the collector said."

I picked up brushes and have never looked behind. Since then, I have switched over to many other art forms. But, miniature art is something I hold dearest, says Mr. Venkatesh, who received the Rashtriya Gourav Samman-2018 in the field of art, in New Delhi last month.Hailing from an agricultural family of Chinadoddigallu in Visakhapatnam district, Mr. Venkatesh is now doing his B.

His father Suri Babu is a farmer while his mother Satyavathi is a homemaker.Guinness recordMr. Venkatesh made an entry to the Guinness Book of World Records last year.His miniature replica of the Empire State Building which he made with toothpicks made its way into the Guinness Book as the smallest toothpick sculpture.I had taken a single toothpick and sliced it into four vertical layers to make the 18 mm tall replica of Empire State Building, Mr. Venkatesh says.Not only this, his miniature replica of Eiffel Tower was widely appreciated by art lovers.It took me three-and-a-half hours to carve the miniature Eiffel Tower out of a pencil lead. I used a surgical blade to carve the lead of 4B and 2B pencils to make the 1.2 cm-tall and 4 mm-wide Eiffel Tower. I made a paper model of the tower too. It is 64 cm in height and 28 cm in width.

We are meeting local demand through stocks.According to onion traders, prices of onions have slipped to Rs 6 per kg to Rs 10 per kg as against Rs 15 per kg a month ago. On October 16, onion prices touched Rs 21 per kg.Traders said prices were dampened due to a sudden jump in supplies in local market from Maharashtra and producing centres around Indore like Khandwa.Maharashtra is one of the leading suppliers of onions to Indore.The daily supply of onions has dropped to about 50,000 bags (1 bag weighs 60 kg) as against 1 lakh bags around a month ago at Choithram mandi.Radheshyam Kushwah, an onion dealer said, This is the season when new onion comes and also remains in demand. But supplies have been very limited since past a week. There are stocks of old onions but demand for that is very less.Traders said prices for old onions have also slipped to about Rs 3 per kg to Rs 7 per kg.They said onion prices are unlikely to improve in coming week because production is high and supplies are also abundant from producing centres.Goud said, We are using onions from stocks but that is not going to last long also the demand in the market is for new ones."

Waivers dont reach many due to lack of documents and Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts.Punjabs example has shown that tenant, small and marginal farmers dont get the benefit of loan waivers. Many farmers dont have land titles and necessary conditions for the direct benefit transfer of government aid. Similar cases have been reported from UP as well, said an agricultural expert who drafted the roadmap for Punjab on loan waiver.Tenant farmers till 34% of the total cultivable land in Andhra, 25% in Punjab, 21% in Bihar, 17% in Odisha, 14% in Bengal and 15% in Haryana. The number of tenant farmers has risen in recent years owing to migration of people from rural to urban areas, said a senior official of NITI Aayog.While political outfits compete to win the hearts of farmers, reforms which could have addressed their woes skip the agenda of governance.NITI Aayog reached out to all state governments with the model land leasing law, which could have provided recognition to tenant farmers to access benefits and loans. Yet, only MP and Uttarakhand could adopt the legislation so far, the official added.ALSO READ | Onion farmer from Maharashtra sends meagre earnings to PMOIronically, tenant farmers face the fury of weather in times of unseasonal rains and hailstorm while the compensation cheques announced by the government reach people living in cities as land-holdings are in their names in official records, the NITI Aayog official added.In the absence of lease documents acceptable in government records, tenant farmers continue to be out of the formal credit access and farm subsidies, and access loans from moneylenders at exorbitant rates, said the official. While the farmers are the backbone of Indian agriculture, it seems nobody is really bothered about their problems, he added."

While Madhya Pradesh has introduced it only for foodgrains and oil seeds, Haryana has taken it up on an experimental basis for perishables.Notification issuedGoing by the volumes, Karnataka is the first State implementing the new system in a full-fledged manner for perishable commodity like onion, said Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission chairman T.N. Prakash Kammaradi. As per the KAPCs recommendations, the Karnataka government issued a notification on November 27 announcing the scheme for onion in the markets of Gadag, Bagalkot, Dharwad, and Belagavi districts from November 28 to December 12. Under the new system, the government has fixed the support price level for onion at Rs. 700 a quintal and the Price Deficiency Payment level at Rs. 200. This means that farmers get cash benefit of Rs. 200 if the onion price rules around Rs. 500 in the market. As the maximum benefit level is fixed at Rs. 200. The scheme is expected to cost Rs. 50 crore to Rs. 75 crore, which would be used from a revolving fund.The Price Deficiency Payment system is being implemented with 16 conditions that include getting verification regarding crop details from a committee of top officers at the entrance of the APMC, selling only to registered traders, verification of the quantum of produce by officials of weights and measurements, keeping track of onion-laden vehicles that go out of the APMC yards, and noting down their destinations, etc.According to Dr. Kammaradi, the new system is one of the options for quick response during price crash. It will take a minimum of one month under the conventional market intervention scheme of direct procurement by government as various clearances will have to be obtained. But it is possible to begin the scheme within a day under the Price Deficiency Payment method because the State has already introduced a digitalised system of collecting real-time data of arrivals and prices in markets, he said.Also, under the conventional direct procurement scheme, disposing the procured crop is an issue as it has to be stored till there is a demand for it in the market.Bailing out farmersOnion price has crashed in wholesale marketsPrice Deficiency Payment system will apply to markets in Gadag, Bagalkot, Dharwad, and Belagavi districts from November 28 to December 12"

One of these, say some traders, is the recent cyclone that hit southern parts of the country. They say that since huge quantities of onion are being transported to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala from Karnataka, the transportation was hit owing to the cyclone in these regions. The onion which was supposed to go out of the State, remained in Karnataka. Due to this, the prices dropped significantly.Other traders say that production being higher than the requirement has also led to a sharp decline in the market price.According to sources, while a quintal of onion was being sold at around Rs. 2,000 till a fortnight ago, it is now being sold at around Rs. 1,200 per quintal.The traders at Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) here say that the lower quality of onion which was actually sold for at least Rs. 800 per quintal, is now going for Rs. 300 per quintal.The traders and the farmers both admit that sharp decline in the market price results in loss only to farmers as they are the final stakeholders.Meanwhile, other traders believe that the situation is temporary as the market will pick up within a fortnight and prices will be stable enough to help get a better price for the farmers."

This is one reason why she chose the BSP.I initially considered contesting from other parties part of the Maha Kutami, but was told that they would offer me ticket from a reserved constituency, if such possibility emerged from the seat sharing adjustments. I felt uncomfortable about being reduced to my immediate identity, and decided to join the BSP. It is like homecoming to me, Ms. Sujatha, who teaches Sociology in Sathavahana University, says.Having been a fellow with UNHRC and Forum-Asia, and conducted international workshops, Ms. Sujatha says the tokenism associated with being Dalit woman has always troubled her.Identity issuesI would be constantly reminded that I was on these forums owing to my identity. Even if one has potential to speak on other issues, one is reduced to representing ones immediate identity, she rues.She, however, chose Chennur owing to the presence of more Dalit voters there, numbering over 80,000, and also because she had worked there on caste and land issues earlier.Ms. Sujathas decision to enter political fray is rooted in the persecution she reportedly faced from the State agencies, during her fight on Dalit issues. She is fighting three cases slapped against her after questioning atrocities on Dalits.Most prominent was the complaint filed over an open letter she had written to the DGP questioning the decision to ban film critic Kathi Maheshs entry into Hyderabad.Bridging the gapBesides, her constant engagement with Dalit communities since formation of Telangana as separate State, over various atrocities, brought home the painful fact that all demonstrations and protests aside, justice is always encapsulated in having to approach the elected representatives and official machinery, however much hostile they were.It fuelled my desire to fight elections and bridge the gap between government and the movements, she said.Strong voiceBorn in Suryapet of Nalgonda district, Ms. Sujatha began her activism as student, with Vakapalli sexual assault case, and went on to fight displacement at Polepally, illegal quarries at Karimnagar, and Polavaram Project. During Telangana movement, she emerged as a strong voice for separate State, through her writings.Poor representation of women in legislatures too bothers her, and through her contest, she hopes to take womens participation in politics beyond agitating over onion and gas prices. Chennur is highly displaced area with huge unemployment and wanting in basic facilities, she says and vows to focus on women and youth if elected."

But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."

And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

This profit comes only if the produce commands a good price in the market. The farmer has urged Mr. Modi to intervene and help farmers get higher profit."

The decision was taken by the All India Vegetable Dehydrate Manufacturer Development Association, that begins direct procurement from farmers on Thursday at Mahuva.The members of the association have had old dispute with commission agents over the commission they charges.Secretary of the association, R K Seta said, We had asked the commission agents to reduce commission from currently 3% to 2%. We had been doing consultation since last two and half months but there was no consensus. For farmers to get reasonable price for their produce, and save our procurement cost we have decided to procure it ourself directly.Mahuva is one of the biggest onion production, trading and dehydrating hubs in the country. White onions from western Indian states comes here for dehydration.India supplies 45% worlds onions. There are nearly 300 registered commission agents in Mahuva market yard who procure onion from the farmers in open auction.The arrival of onions has just started and will continue till March. The commission agents charges 3% commission and give 19 days credit to the purchasers.There are two type of purchasers one is trader who purchases red onion while dehydration unit owners buy purchase white onions which is only for export after dehydration.The commission agents have been demanding reduction in payment cycle to 12 days from 19 days.The meeting was held between agents and buyers in market yard where chairman of the market yard proposed 15 days payment cycle which was rejected by the buyers.Chairman of Mahuva Market yard Ghanshyam Patel told TOI: The traders or buyers say that onion is unregulated farm produce so it can be produced from the farmer. It is illegal to procure from the farmers directly outside the market yard.This year onion was cultivated in 24,000 hectares in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts. The current price of onions is Rs 100-130 per 20kg for red onions and Rs 150-180 for white onions. According to market experts this year the production is expected to go down by to 25 percent due to insufficient rains."

Democracy and rule of law are under attack. We have to fight this onslaught on our institutions, otherwise history shall never forgive us, Singh told reporters here. Singh rejected Modis allegation that the UPA government was remote-controlled by the Gandhi family.Manmohan Singh said: This is absolutely incorrect. The government (UPA) was run in a manner that the party and the government were both on one platform. I feel this was the reason for the success of our government. There was no difference of opinion between the government and the party.Tearing into the Modi government, he said: Our nation is going through extremely challenging times for the last four and a half years. National security is imperiled, women are unsafe and marginalised and weaker sections face persecution. Farmers distress is all pervading and the youth are suffering from acute joblessness. The common man is suffering from rising prices, notably prices of petrol, diesel as well as cooking gas.The unwitting and ill-conceived demonetization and a flawed GST, coupled with tax terrorism have dealt a body blow to organised and unorganised sectors, the noted economist said.Singh accused the Modi government of building a false narrative a day to justify the demonetisation disaster. The plain truth is that demonetisation is a monumental failure of epic proportions. None of the stated objectives of demonetisation has been achieved. Neither was the Rs 3 lakh crore of black money confiscated as claimed before the Supreme Court on November 10, 2016 nor was fake currency checked. Stated objectives of ending terrorism and Naxalism have totally floundered, he said.Notebandi was a deliberate and designed attack"" on the savings of small and medium businesses, farmers and homemakers, he said, pointing out that 120 poor people lost their lives in bank queues as a parallel market to convert old notes into new ones flourished under the watch of Modi government.The Modi government came to power on the promise to usher in transparency and end corruption. But we have only witnessed corruption peaking under Prime Minister Narendra Modi . The acts of omission and commission in Rafale deal need a thorough investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee, the former PM said.Asked how Congress was reduced to ruling just four states, Singh said, The Congress party does face problems. Those problems, particularly what happened in 2014 elections, the ability of the opposition to mislead media and through media the public at large about so-called corruption in the UPA regime. I think we were not able to carry connections with the public in conveying ourselves in 2014.But since then, people have seen through Modis promises, he said, adding: I think people now recognize that a large number of promises made by the BJP turned out to be hollow.Labour Bureau data shows only a few thousand jobs were created or added every quarter and the promise of achhe din proved hollow, he said, demanding to know why the Labour Bureau Survey for October-December 2017 has not been released.Over 2.8 lakh youth with MBA/LLB/BE/PhD applied for 738 peon posts in February this year in Madhya Pradesh and the state could create only about 17,600 jobs every year. The maximum number of people in India, who ended their life due to unemployment, belong to BJP-ruled MP. Between 2005 and 2015, there has been a 2000% increase in suicides in MP due to unemployment, he said.Attacking the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government on Vyapam scam, e-tender scam, onion purchase scam, dal purchase scam, agriculture pump subsidy scam, he said that proper investigation and accountability are the first casualties in MP. Farmers are in great pain all over India, including MP. Between 2004 and 2016, MP saw nearly 17,000 farmer suicides,"" he said."

Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

5ce6c73fe8e3fc56af415142,Mistress of spices: Mallika Basu,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/mistress-of-spices-mallika-basu/cid/1675612,2018-11-17,"Masala is published by Bloomsbury Source: Mallika BasuShes a communications professional with a busy life in London, with her two kids and British-Peruvian husband. She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices.
