Yes, in this good old new city of Calcutta, where malls, coffee shops, nail salons threaten to beat down all oddities into a global sameness, these cries can still be heard. They rent and then dissolve into the skies, add flavour.Of course, they are all different pheriwalas or pedlars, but because one rarely gets to put faces to those voices, in my head those cries always emanate from a single entity  faceless, mysterious.Daaab. Daab chai, daaaab, is one of the earliest cries of the day. (Daab means tender coconut.) The clear shout slices the sleep off the morning in one fell swoop. So what if you havent heeded the cry? It continues to linger in the air, impossibly itinerant, till the thirst begins to bubble over.So you are ironing your clothes and thinking daab. You are chomping dry toast and thinking daab. You are looking for your spectacles and thinking daab. And just when you cannot take it any longer and at the cost of getting late for work you dash down the stairs to claim your daab, he is gone. Poof! Like he was never there.Daaab. Daab chai, daaaab, is one of the earliest cries of the day. (Daab means tender coconut.) Image: The TelegraphIt reminds me of something my grandmother told me. Many years ago, as a little girl in Dhaka, she would be woken from her sleep in the pre-dawn hours by a faraway voice. Day upon day it sang the same song: Kaya re bhai kaya/Jaal bunechhe maya/Je matite jonmo/Shei matitei milai kaya. The deep philosophy about mortality, attachment and existentialism would tug at my heartstrings every time Dida sang it to me. She and her siblings woke up early one day determined to identify the Voice. And what did they see? The form of a man riding off into the blurry morning on a bicycle.Sometimes I think the pheriwala inhabits our consciousness and days like Didas invisible man, like an outer inner voice. As the day ripens in the city, the pedlars voices return. Mid-morning it is Ka-goj. Purano ka-goj (meaning, old newspapers), or Lohaaa lokkor. Lohaaa lokkor (meaning, scrap iron) or Chaaabiwala  that would be the keymaker. Towards afternoon you hear  Sheel katai. Sheel katai.The content of the cries is really elemental. It is the rendition that makes them stand out. The way the syllables are broken. The way the vowels are pulled out, dragged along. The way the pauses and sound effects are woven in.The sheel-nora is a variant of the mortar and pestle  sheel is the mortar and nora, the pestle. To approximate the perfect grind on the turmeric or onion or ginger, it is imperative that from time to time the mortar is worked upon by a professional. A sharp instrument is used to pockmark it. That is the service on offer here.In many areas you can still hear, Jyanto katla, magur, koi... Live freshwater fish. In some other neighbourhoods, Chul-kapod-bashon. In exchange for hair  it is measured out in glasses or steel tumblers  and used clothes and old utensils, pedlars offer brand new steel utensils.Not every word of every cry can be deciphered always. But you can tell what is what from throw and timing. For instance, just before winter and during it too, there is the odd clang-clang of the dhunuri or the quilt-maker. The sound comes from the sitar-like thing used to fluff the cottonwool stuffing of legacy quilts.I remember a time when post-school hours, a raspy voice would sing out, Doi chai, doi, or Cakeman. The bhaanrs or earthen pots of reddish yoghurt came with ice-cream spoons and tasted of the earth. Cakeman carried a tin trunk on his head filled with cream rolls, chicken patties and pastries with thick pink icing.In the world of pheriwalas, the auditory performance plays out according to some unwritten rules. These are mindful of the tempo of human life, urban existence. In the evenings, except for the rare cry of bel phul (mogra flower), it is mostly a medley of odd bells and rattles.The rattle signals the rare advent of the madari with cavorting monkey on leash. The jangling of bells could be the dosa-idliwala. And by way of a wrap, there is the siren ting-ting of the ghoti goromwala.Ghoti means pot and gorom, warm. This pedlar carries with him a roundish contraption with a lamp burning in the centre. Its many deep pockets contain peanuts, jhuri bhaja  impossible to translate  chips and more. He mixes up the savouries, warm from the heat of the flame, and adds finely chopped onions, green chillies and tangy aamra before serving it all in paper cones. As he awaits the next customer, he lets out a short, sharp cry  Ghoti gorom."

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

Consequently, the retail prices jumped, and in the national capital New Delhi, the price hit Rs. 40 a kg, before the Union government reviewed the price and availability of onion and asked the Delhi government to make onion available through its public distribution system outlets as was done in 2015 when prices had spiked.Has supply dropped?Government data show production of onion has fallen marginally during the 2017-18 crop year that ended June 30. The third advance estimates say onion output is likely to be around 22 million tonnes during the reported period, lower than 22.4 million tonnes in 2016-17. However, compared to the average production of the past five years, it is about 12% higher.Traders point out that the supply of onions in the Lasalgaon market mainly dropped owing to a drought-like situation in parts of Maharashtra, where the onions Kharif crop is likely to be lower. However, they are hopeful that as the arrival from neighbouring Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh has started picking up, prices will moderate. Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC, says supplies are gradually rising, and on October 31, the average wholesale price of the onion was around Rs. 10-11 a kg. Onion price surged only for a couple of days in mid-October but later as the arrival increased the price has dropped. However, those selling in the retail have kept the price up only to derive more profit..., he says.Traders and the government hope prices will moderate in the coming days as the supply is expected to improve as soon as the harvest begins in the onion-growing areas of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan.Why this recurring volatility?In India, onion prices are extremely volatile. While the production in the country over the years has been rising, sharp price spikes are experienced almost every alternate year. The key reasons for severe and frequent price shocks are attributed by agriculture experts to production fluctuations and changes in the nature of demand.The growth in onion production has risen from below 5.5 million tonnes till 2002-03 to nearly 20 million tonnes in recent years. Experts point out that the annual growth rate of above 13% in onion production since 2000-01 is phenomenal and no other food crop in the country shows this type of growth in the recent years.However, domestic and overseas demand for onion seems to be outpacing growth in supply, points out Professor Ramesh Chand, a member of the NITI Aayog. He says the per capita demand of onion has increased from 4 kg in 2002-03 to more than 13 kg in recent years. This growth in per capita demand for onion reflects a mind-boggling change in preference of Indian consumers for onion. It also implies that the effect of spikes in onion price on household budgets is getting heavier. It looks strange that increased availability is associated with the increase in price volatility rather than providing flexibility to absorb small shocks in supply, he says.What is in store?The price trends of onion over the years show that high prices prevail only for a few months and the excessive volatility can be managed through appropriate mechanisms. Professor Chand says a multi-pronged strategy involving technology, extension, public stocks, and market intelligence is needed to address excessive volatility. Stocking by public sector parastatal like the NAFED will also keep a check on exploitation and market manipulation by private trade, besides price stabilisation, he adds.Vikas Vasudeva"

As tea at the bus stand was always in demand, they set up a tea shop and later started serving vadas also, he said. The founders had always been proud to remind their customers that they established the shop in the year when the Tamil movie ``Pathinaaru Vayadinile, featuring the late Sridevi as heroine, hit the screens  1974.So, what is special about the vadas made in the shop? It is in the quality of the urad dhal, pepper, rice flour and quality of oil used to fry it. The golden brown vadas, like doughnuts, are fried through and crispy on the outside. Though the shop also sells other varieties like keerai vada, paruppu vada and onion vada, it is the urad dhal vada that most customers prefer as the main snack.A vada is sold at Rs 6 with coconut chutney prepared from freshly grated coconut as an accompaniment. On an average, the tiny shop sells as many as 2,000 urad dhal vadas a day and the number goes up on chilly days. They make 60 vadas per round as customers wait in queue for their freshly fried ones. ``The freshness is what makes these vadas extra tasty, said A Simon, who dropped in for a bite while waiting for his bus.Tile:What is famous: Urad dhal vada, keerai vada and milk bunWhere : In tahsildar cross street near Anna bus stand (Find out from her)Cost per vada: Rs 6Timings: 5.30 AM to 8PM"

So, its a good idea to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger food. Source: `www.cucinamiabynatasha.com`I love how the festive season in India stretches for so long. In Bengal it starts with Durga Puja and in other parts of the country with Dussehra. Once that is done, the countdown to Diwali begins and then theres bhai phonta or bhai dooj.It goes further on to the New Year for some communities. So its a long time before people are back to normal life! And this means parties, celebrations and more eating and drinking. And lots of hosting! Heres a guide to make you shine as the host at your festive celebrations.DECIDE ON DECORYou do not need to spend a fortune to decorate your home to reflect the festive spirit. Diwali is all about light. So simple diyas and tea lights around the house can create magic. Pair those with fresh orange and yellow marigold and you have a gorgeous traditional look.The entrance to your home should give a positive first impression. Do it up with floating candles and flowers in a large bowl of water or a simple rangoli on the floor adorned with diyas.For me, the dining table is always the highlight as food is an integral part of any party. I love doing up the table based on the occasion and theme. At my own Diwali party in Bangalore, I added a south Indian touch with banana leaves, flowers from the local market and classic earthen diyas. All for less than Rs 200!PREP IN ADVANCEWe all host parties and get-togethers because we want to share these happy moments with our loved ones. However, most of the time, the host ends up running around and getting stressed during the party. This would not happen if you organise yourself and also reduce the number of unnecessary tasks.Choose a menu which you can prepare a day in advance. Dishes which have to be made or assembled just before serving are a complete no-no.For garnishes like fresh herbs, lime wedges and other fresh ingredients, prepare them just before the party and keep them ready on a tray in the service area of your kitchen. That way you dont have to go rummaging around in your overcrowded fridge for the dhania while the hot food is waiting to be served.Use disposable crockery and cutlery to reduce washing up. These days you get lovely bamboo and paperware which are eco-friendly and look nice as well.Ice, ice, baby! How many times have you been at a party getting your drink from the bar, only to be told Sorry we are out of ice! There is nothing more putting off than a warm drink, be it a whisky or a cola. Do remember to start stocking up on ice cubes a couple of days in advance so that will be one big job out of the way.Sweet potato chips www.cucinamiabynatasha.comSWEET POTATO CHIPSGet healthy and gourmet with these oven-baked sweet potato chips.Ingredients4 sweet potatoes2tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperChilli flakesMethodPeel the potatoes and cut into chips.Steam half-way.Heat the oven to 180C.Combine the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.Bake on a baking dish or tray for about 30 minutes, tossing in between till crispy.Serve warm with any dip, sauce or chutney.Minted pea hummus/ beetroot hummus www.cucinamiabynatasha.comMINTED PEA HUMMUS/ BEETROOT HUMMUSWhen the classic hummus bores you, you revive it by adding vibrant colours and veggies! You can use either peas and mint, or beetroot in this recipe for some gorgeous hummus.Ingredients1 cup chickpeas (boiled)2 beetroots, cut in large cubes, or 1 cup of boiled peas and some mint leaves1tbsp tahini2 garlic clovestsp cumin powderJuice of  lemonChilli flakesSalt and fresh pepperToasted pine nuts or walnuts for garnishMethodSteam the beetroots/boil the peas or bake in the oven.In a blender, blend together the boiled chickpeas, beetroot/peas and mint, tahini, garlic, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and 2tbsp of water till you get the right consistency.Garnish with toasted nuts and seeds. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil just before serving.GET THE MENU RIGHTIt is incredible how much food gets left over at parties and then the host family ends up eating the same thing for the next couple of days or distributing it to neighbours and domestic staff in the justification that they are not wasting food. Well, why not just make less of each with the idea that if one dish finishes there will always be something else to eat.In my opinion, the appetisers or finger food and the dessert should be the main focus. The main course could be very light or just a one-pot wholesome dish for those wanting something more. People are hungry when they arrive. So they tend to load up on appetisers.A good idea is to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger foods which people can have while playing cards.Try out some healthy appetisers like sweet potato chips with beetroot/pea and mint hummus or curried peanut dip which you can make in advance. These are regulars on my party menus by popular demand. You can also make them for your post-Diwali visits or bhai phonta gatherings as, by then, people are really done with all the heavy eating of the season.So go on, get cracking to make your festivities super special.Wish you all a shining and enjoyable Diwali!The dining table can be a highlight; decorate it in the traditional way with diyas, flowers and banana leavesCurried Peanut Dip www.cucinamiabynatasha.comCURRIED PEANUT DIPThis is a new addition to my recipe stash with an interesting desi touch of spices, peanuts and coriander.Ingredients1tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion chopped1tbsp garlic, mincedtsp coriander powdertsp turmeric powderRed chilli flakes to taste2 large carrots, finely chopped cup toasted peanuts4tsp fresh lime juice1tbsp soy sauce1tsp brown sugar1tbsp crushed peanuts (for garnish)1tbsp chopped fresh coriander (for garnish)1tbsp crumbled feta cheese (optional)MethodIn a pan, heat some oil and cook the onion and garlic.Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and red chilli flakes.Add the carrots with salt and pepper and saute until carrots are half-cooked.Add in the toasted peanuts, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.

5ce746b3e8e3fc56af41853d,A moveable street feast in Calcutta,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-moveable-street-feast-in-calcutta/cid/1673726,2018-11-03,"A walk down a sidewalk in Calcutta is like walking down a buffet line, writes Christine Kaaloa on her food blog, Grrltraveller. The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E. Chandran Swami's south Indian food stall Prasun Chaudhuri*9.30am  Crossing of Princep Street and Ganesh Chandra AvenueE. Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan. There, lying on the soft grass, he reads leisurely the days news. It is a stale serving this, but thats how he likes it.Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba Prasun Chaudhuri*2pm  Ganesh Avenue and Mangoe Lane crossingWhen we reach Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba, there is already a large crowd around the tandoor. About 40 people, including several cab drivers, are milling around. The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says. During winter months he sells nalen gurer sandesh and rasogolla.Sunirmal Bose, a 65-year old office peon working at a travel agents office, is one of Bablus oldest and most regular customers. I am a big fan of his malpua and labanga latika, he says. During Vijaya Dashami, I take a whole lot of these home.Every Saturday, Bablu leaves for his village. A sweet end to a mixed week."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityJHANSI: An agriculture scientist at Banda University of Agriculture and Technology has come up with a high-yielding variety of onions that can be preserved for a much longer period. Its gestation period is also much less than the normal variety. According to Dr RK Singh, associate professor of the university, who has developed this new onion , this variety gets ready in just 80-83 days as compared to 110 taken by normal varieties. The yield is also 300-350 quintal per hectare against 250-280 for normal varieties which is almost 20% higher.Besides, it can be stored for two and a half months in normal temperature without getting sprouted whereas normal onion starts getting sprouted within a month. It can also be preserved in cold storage for up to 80 days, which is almost four times higher than the normal varieties staying power.As per Dr Singh, he had started his research more than a decade ago in Nasik where he was posted in National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF). During his initial research on this special variety, he had named it Line-883. After he was transferred to Banda, he saw good feasibility in Bundelkhand of testing it. I got good results in the past two years, he said. Discussing some more positive points of his new variety, Dr Singh said that it was quite tolerant to local diseases. The new breed has a growth of 50-55cm length with a bulb of diameter of 5-6 cm. It requires less water and gives best results in Kharif crop . Some local farmers have already started using the seeds and have got very good results. As per farmer Ram Singh (49), the new seed is boon for farmers of Bundelkhand. Singh, who has been awarded by Union agriculture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat for his earlier outstanding results, said: The new seed developed by Dr RK Singh is indeed very good and is producing good results in local climatic conditions."

The new variety is virtuous enough to help the farmers improve earnings as it has smaller gestation and a longer preservation period than any other regular variety of onion.It may be recalled that the agriculture scientists of BUAT had developed a dark red variety of onion which had proved to be a boon for onion growers of Bundelkhand region. Associate Professor, BUAT, Dr RK Singh calls this new variety Line-883. ""The crop of this variety gets ready in 83 days instead of 110-1120 days taken by regular onion varieties,"" said Dr Singh.He added that the yield is almost 20 per cent higher than the regular onion crop with 300-350 quintal per hectare as against 250-280 for normal varieties. ""We have tried to address the preservation issues as well. Usually, onion stays just for a month and gets sprouted at normal temperature but Line-833 can be preserved for over two and a half months without sprouting both at normal temperature and cold storage.Dr Singh has been conducting his experiments with the seeds of Line-833 in Bundelkhand region for the last two years.Before this, he had actually started his research on the new variety while being in Nasik National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) a decade ago. Elaborating on its positives, Dr Singh explained that it took lesser time to grow as compared to the regular varieties. ""This is ready within 80-85 days against traditional 100-110 days of onion crop. Moreover, its level of endurance and resistance to disease is much higher than other onion varieties,"" he said.On his decision to introduce this variety to Bundelkhand onion growers, Dr Singh said was best-suited option for them as Bundelkhand was water deficient and the new variety grew to require a lesser amount of water while giving best results in Kharif season.However, he added that its seeds were used by over 400 farmers of different regions and states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka, on trial basis with exemplary results. Moreover, 15 farmers of Banda district have used the seed of Line 833 and got very good output, said BUAT authorities endorsing the variety. Explaining the technical aspect involved,Dr Singh claimed that in Bundelkhand region the sulphur content in the soil was higher than normal. ""Sulphur increases the activity of soil. For Line-833 sulphur rich soil is best suited so it will give outstanding results and can be a boon for Bundelkhand framers,"" said Dr Singh."

Interestingly, the same produce is being sold at Rs. 22 and Rs. 18 respectively in the retail market.An increase in the arrival of stocks from the Rayalaseema region, particularly from Kurnool district, is said be reason behind the drop in the wholesale price, which is expected to take a further plunge in the coming weeks, as harvesting is in progress in Maharashtra. At present, about 1,600 tonnes and 2,000 tonnes of onions are arriving here every day.Farmers bring their produce here from faraway places. Since they cant take back the produce owing the logistic expenses, the middlemen are playing foul game, observes K. Srinivas, secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sanghams district unit.The State government should initiate measures to stabilise the price and protect the farmers. Only middlemen are being benefited from this price fall, as the end users are paying much higher than what farmers are getting in return for heir produce, he pointed out."

We are coming out with a wide range of Ready to eat and Ready to reconstitute food products. Research to ensure that these products have nearly one-fourth of calorie requirement for the day is under way, besides ensuring Recommended Dietary Allowance requirements of essential minerals. These products will benefit those children in the group of seven to 15 years.CFTRI was inaugurated in 1950, and we are celebrating our 68th Foundation Day this year, said the chief scientist. Lauding the generosity of then Mysuru maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, who donated the Cheluvamba mansion, for the institution, Subramanian said, It was his foresight that ensured Mysuru city got a national institute. Today, CFTRI is considered the home of food science and technology in India.Subramanian went on to add that baby food was among the earliest innovations of CFTRI, which today houses a whopping 17 research and development departments. We have since rolled out many other innovations such as parboiled rice, spice oleoresins, energy foods, spirulina cultivation, etc, he added.More recently, CFTRI played a crucial role tending to the nutrient needs of flood-affected victims of Kerala and Kodagu. We prepared 15.6 tonnes of food in six days, and dispatched 55,700 meals to Kerala, Subramanian said.A carbonated beverage plant, in addition to the upgrading of the existing animal house facility and the ragi mudde machines are among the recent innovations of CFTRI. Subramanian pointed to the jump in CFTRIs rank from 32 in 2017 to 16 this year in Scimago Institutions Ranking  Scimago ranks are a measure of the impact of scientific studies and research.Schoolchildren were awarded certificates for achievements in a wide range of science competitions organised at schools in association with CFTRI. Besides students, retired employees and those who completed 25 years of service at CFTRI were also feted on the occasion.On Open Day, CFTRI throws open its doors to the public and students, in order to allow them to get a peek of the activities at the institution. It is also a way of showing the public how the exchequers money is spent. While the campus was open to the public from 10.30am to 1pm on Monday, the premises will be open to public from 2.30pm to 6pm on Tuesday.CFTRI director KSMS Raghavarao, Defence Food and Research Laboratory (DFRL) director Anil D Semwal and CFTRI chief scientist K Venkateshwaran were among those present.Meanwhile, DFRL director Anil D Semwal who inaugurated the Open Day celebrations at CFTRI on Monday, said that there was a need to educate the public and stakeholders about the importance of research carried out by their respective organisations. Research that CFTRI and DFRL pioneered in the 1960s and 70s are being conducted by private firms now, who are claiming it to be new. It is necessary that we raise awareness about what we do to prevent a loss to the exchequer, said Semwal, citing the example of dehydrated onion powder, which he said CFTRI had developed long ago.

The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

During Diwali , onion stock drops as the new crop does not reach the markets. Besides, onions have not yet reached the harvest stage in many fields. Another reason may be water scarcity in various districts because of less rainfall this monsoon.The official said the stock of old onions, which reached the market around April, was also dwindling. We need both the old and the new crops as the demand is high during this period. Besides, use of chemical-based fertilizers farmers by the farmers in soil for years are also affected the quality of the crops, he said.The biggest onion market in Lasalgaon of Nashik district is also reporting dipping stocks over the last eight days, with just 10,000 quintal being the average supply per day. Nashiks kharif onion production is set to plummet drastically by about seven lakh tonnes or 78% following drought-like conditions in parts of the district. Over 60% of the total kharif onion acreage of 52,517 hectares in the district has dried up, with scanty rain this monsoon.Indersen, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said hoarding of onions by middlemen was triggering an artificial shortage and price rise.Yakub Pathan, a retailer in Wakad, said the stock of old onions was down to 50%. The retailers prefer to buy old onions because the new crop tends to rot fast, he said."

But still they would be booking losess as the production cost is around Rs 140 per 20 kg. We have last years 10,000 tonne stock. Ten dehydration plants have declared bankruptcy because they had purchased huge quantity of stock from farmers in previous years but they didnt get the expected price in the international market.Farmers said that the dehydration unit owners are selling their produce at cheaper rates in the international market to remain in the competition. As a result, they are unwilling to give the farmers adequate price.There are 100 such plants in Mahua and nearly 50 plants are dysfunctional for the want of orders. India exports 40% of worlds requirement of onion and is the second biggest exporter of onion after America, which sends out 45% of its produce.According to farmers, their production cost is Rs 140 per 20 kg and since last two years, they are booking losses.Himmat Patel, a farmer from Talaja, said, This year, the yield is expected to reduce because area under sowing was much less due to last years experience. Moreover, irrigation water is also not available. Farmers cant afford to book more losses now and government should intervene.Farmers who didnt sow white onions also didnt sow red onions instead.D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar Marketing Yard said, This year, production of red onion is expected fall by 25% because of non-availability of irrigation water. However, its early to say that it would result in price rise in the retail market because we dont have proper figures of the crop in other states."

All chef Mithilesh Tembe had to serve his guru, chef Ranveer Brar, was some finger-licking food.Tembe, executive chef at the 1BHK restaurant in Oshiwara, Mumbai, faced his toughest challenge ever when he had to prepare a meal for Brar, who has taught and honed his culinary skills.Memories, laughter and, of course, food filled 1BHK on Sunday evening as Brar arrived to celebrate International Chefs Day.Tembe started out as an expert in French cuisine, but he began trying his hand at Indian food after being trained by Brar. The food he served Brar, though, was not geographically limited. And it was a spread that would make the guru proud.Charred brocolli with rose harissa, Thai style sweet and sour fish, chickpea hummus with green chilli theecha and poi, prawns chil pil with steam bao, Goan fish curry with red boiled rice and chicken dhansak with brown onion pilaf. For dessert, Brar had creme brulee.Brar was well impressed by his student. The food created by Mithilesh was very expressive. The idea of adding a thecha to the hummus was very interesting, as was serving garlic prawns with poi bread. It was boundary-less and bold food, something that I always stand for, he said.In particular I loved how the Goan fish curry came out, nice consistency. The dish that stood out for me the most was the charred broccoli with rose harissa, he added.Recalling the beautiful evening, Tembe thanked Brar for visiting his restaurant. He said Brar had taught him the mantra of being a chef, which is not just making beautiful food ...its about the humility that you carry it with.Theres one thing, though, Tembe need not be so humble about  the creme brulee he made on Sunday night. Brar said it was the best hes had so far.Charred Brocolli with Rose HarissaThinkstockIngredients Broccoli  250gm Processed cheese  50gm Curd  150gm Ginger  10gm Garlic  10gm Cumin powder  3gm Chilli powder  4gm Cream  50gm Cardamom  5gm Garam masala  2gm Mustard Oil  10ml Almond Flakes  25gmRose Harissa Sauce Red bell pepper  60gm Pomace oil  25ml Rose water  15gm Lemon  15gm Dry red chilli  20gm White vinegar  12ml Honey  5gm Raw garlic  6gm Rose flower  1 Extra virgin olive oil  30mlMethod: Cook broccoli in salted hot boiling water till its fork tender and allow it cool down in ice cold water.
