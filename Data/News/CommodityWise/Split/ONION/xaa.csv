While he was happy with the yield 4.5 tonnes per acre the farmer was disappointed by the market price. He decided to wait it out, only to see the prices tumbling down.He is staring at a loss of Rs 4.5lakh, Kadhiresan told TOI. With a total yield of 45 tonnes, I was expecting about Rs 40/kg. When traders initially offered Rs 20/kg, I was waiting for it to go up to at least Rs Rs 35. However, after more stocks began to arrive in the market, including a variety from Palladam and Mysore that can not be stored for long, the price first dropped to Rs 15 and went down to Rs 13/kg. I am ready to sell it for at least Rs 25/kg to break even.Like other small onion farmers in the district, Kadhiresan now plans to offload some of the stock if prices dont go up after Pongal.Small onions are cultivated on 4,500 acres in Coimbatore, said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association S Palanisamy.Many farmers are getting offers as low as Rs 7 to Rs 8/kg, which will not even cover the cost of seeds, said DK Ramaswamy, another shallot farmer from Thondamuthur. It is almost like throwing away the stock.The farmers say small onions are an expensive crop to cultivate. While the seeds cost about Rs 22,500/acre, fertilizers, biofertilizers and the labour push the expense to Rs 70,000/acre, onion farmer TN Karuppusamy, who cultivates on five acres, said. I finally ended up selling some stock for Rs 13/kg. The trader has promised to give me some more money once he sells the stock at a higher price.Many shallot farmers have taken loans for cultivation, said Palanisamy. They are facing debts, for which they can not even pay the interest. The government should fix a minimum support price, he said.

It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.

""The amount will come in two tranches during rabi and kharif farming. In Bengal, there are many small and marginal farmers who own less than an acre. The cash support will be calculated on their landholdings based on the Rs 5,000-per-acre formula,"" the CM said.Target beneficiaries will be able to apply for the cash support from February 1.Banerjee's New Year gift to farmers will be a political weapon for Trinamool MPs. Banerjee has been taking on the Modi government, pointing to farmer suicides and falling prices of crops such as onions.

The produce reaching the market is not getting sold or getting low price from traders, who still have stock to clear.Nashik traders send onions to New Delhi, Bihar and other states in North India, West Bengal, and the North East states. They prefer to transport by rail rather than road as it is cost effective and quick. While it costs Rs 5 per kg to transport onions by road, it costs only Rs 2.5 per kg by the Railways.The traders claimed that at present, they are getting one rake (each with 40 wagons) once in two-three days, though they have sought three rakes a day, considering the huge supply of onions from farmers. A delegation of Nashik traders led by the chairman of the state agriculture commission, Pasha Patel, discussed the issue with Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari a couple of days back.Railway is an effective means of transportation. About 1,600 tonnes of onions may be transported at a time through one rake. While there is demand of three rakes a day, onion traders are getting only one rake after every two-three days, Patel said. He claimed that during their meeting, Gadkari spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal , who has assured them that more rakes would be sent. The railway minister has assured Gadkari that immediate steps would be taken to increase the rakes in Nashik, said Patel.According to him, traders do not buy fresh onions from farmers till their stock is cleared. Hence, there is need to increase the transport of onions by rail and adequate rakes must be made available for the purpose, Patel added.About 2 lakh quintals of onions are auctioned a day in district APMCs during peak period. Sohanlal Bhandari, president of Nashik district onion traders association, said that recently, there was huge arrivals of onions in Agriculture Produce Market Committees. Ideally, Nashik traders need 20 rakes a week, he said. Recently, we had urged the railway administration to provide us more rakes, but it did not. This affected our despatch of onions during the peak period. We want railway administration to provide rakes as per our demand, said Bhandari.A railway official, requesting anonymity, told TOI that they had provided rakes whenever they got a demand. He claimed that the railways had provided 700 wagons from Niphad and Kherwadi stations in the past one month. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest wholesale onion market in the country, said that wholesale onion prices may increase by Rs 200 per quintal if traders are able to despatch their consignments by rail on regular basis.Availability of rakes on regular basis will help traders to increase onion procurement and that may result into rise in wholesale onion prices by at least Rs 200 per quintal from the present level, said Holkar.

2019-01-03,"A man from the small African nation of Ivory Coast has made a big impact on his housing complex at Uniworld City in New Town. At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

2019-01-04,"The New Year is always looked forward to with hope, whatever the conditions might have been the previous year; 2018 has been a mixed bag, both globally and domestically.Globally, the growth rate in 2018 was high, particularly in the United States. But strong signs of a trade war emerged, dimming hopes of faster international trade. Britain is passing through the pangs of separation from the European Union. Domestically, the first quarter growth rate was high. But signs are not good for the balance of the year. The rupee underwent a severe shock as crude oil prices rose, and abated after a fall in oil prices. While prices fell, agrarian distress accentuated.Indias growth rate in 2018-19 is forecast at 7.4% by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). But it looks to be a touch-and-go situation. More likely, it will be slightly lower. Looking ahead, 2019 may not show any substantial rise in the growth rate. Even though the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has stabilised, much will depend on the pickup in the investment rate.The international environment is not that conducive for growth in our foreign trade; this will have an impact on our exports and, therefore, growth. Perhaps the growth rate will be between 7.2% and 7.5%. Though this may be the highest growth rate of any country, it falls short of our requirements.Going ahead, what are our major concerns?Investment ratioIn the final analysis, the growth rate depends on the investment rate and the productivity of capital or its inverse incremental capital-output ratio.The incremental capital output ratio is a catch-all expression. It depends upon a multiple number of factors such as quality of labour, which again depends on education and skill development levels, and technology, which is constantly changing. For ensuring a sustained high growth, we need to raise the investment ratio and keep the incremental capital-output ratio at 4. The Gross Fixed Capital Formation ratio has fallen from 35.8% in 2007-08 to 28.5% in 2017-18. The journey to raise the investment ratio is not going to be easy. Animal spirits must be revived. A tranquil political and economic environment needs to be nurtured.Banking systemAn important factor affecting economic growth is the condition of our banking system. Non-performing assets (NPAs), including stressed assets, as a proportion of loans of public sector banks stood at 16.7% as of March 2018. As many as 11 public sector banks are under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). This restricts the lending abilities of these banks. Added to this, the non banking financial company (NBFC) system is also under stress. This is partly a reflection of the stress in the banking system since most NBFCs borrow from banks. Recapitalisation of public sector banks will partly solve the problem. It is not clear at this point how much it will help in adding to lending capacity.Some have advocated providing more capital to banks outside the PCA framework as that will increase their lending capacity immediately.Today, banks are responsible both for short-term and long-term lending. Their inability to lend affects the availability of working capital as well as capital expenditures.The decision to pump in more capital to public sector banks must be completed soon. The growth rate in the industrial sector will depend on how quickly the banking system comes back to normalcy.Employment growthThere is a great concern about the inadequate growth of employment. Honestly, we do not have satisfactory employment numbers. The employment data in the organised sector are reliable. But the employment in the informal sector is much larger. One question that is asked is that if growth is around 7%, why is there no corresponding growth in employment? We need to keep two factors in mind. Growth can occur either as a result of increase in investment or because of better utilisation of existing capacity. It is growth which is led by new investment that leads to a significant increase in employment. But growth caused by improved efficiency of utilisation of existing capital can lead only to a marginal increase in employment. Much of the growth seen in the last few years is of the latter variety.Second, the increase in employment seen in the period between 2004-05 and 2009-10 was because of the rapid growth of the information technology (IT) and financial sectors. The IT sector has slowed down. The financial sector is under stress. Employment in these sectors was visible and educated entrants into the labour market found ample opportunities. The IT sector growth rate is not likely to pick up significantly as this industry is undergoing many structural changes. The revival of the banking system depends on a number of factors. Thus, even from the point of view of employment, the key factor is the pickup in investment.Indias external sector has grown and is well integrated with the rest of the world. Indias trade in goods and services as a percentage of GDP has grown to 42% of GDP. Therefore, what happens in the rest of the world affects Indias growth very much. Indias balance of payment situation has been comfortable since liberalisation. However, there are vulnerabilities as seen in September-October 2018, when the value of the rupee suddenly plummeted when crude oil prices rose and there were simultaneously capital outflows. RBI intervention and the subsequent fall in crude prices have restored the value of the rupee. In April-November 2018, Indias exports of goods grew by 11.6%. However, we need to note that exports growth was 5.2% (2016-17) and 9.8% (2017-18). Strong growth in exports is a must if we have to keep the current account deficit (CAD) at a manageable level.The forecast for world trade and output is not encouraging. There are too many uncertainties which include an intensification in the trade war. Along with export promotion, we also need to contain some of our large imports. A watch on Indias CAD is critically important if we have to achieve growth with stability.Agrarian distressThe future growth also depends on the performance of agriculture. Agrarian distress is widespread. Strangely, the fall in prices of agricultural products is in one sense a reflection of our success in raising output. Some years ago, the concern was a rise in the price of pulses to abnormally high levels. But today the picture is reversed. Thanks to increase in production, prices have fallen. Similar is the case with respect to vegetables, particularly onion. The need of agriculturists is income in current prices. The solution to the fall in prices lies in government intervening in the market and buying off the surplus over normal levels. The market will then automatically take prices to the normal level. The important requirement in this context is not only the financial capacity of the government to procure but also adequate physical arrangements to procure and store. The procured agricultural products can be sold by the government in later years when output is low or utilised in any safety net programme.Loan waivers are at best short-term solutions. The fundamental problem is one of increasing productivity and enabling farmers to achieve increased output and better prices. There is also a basic weakness that we have to address. The average size of landholding is so small that any amount of increase in productivity will not give adequate income. Farmers have to think in terms of consolidation of landholdings so that they can get the benefits of larger size. Small farmers will also have to think in terms of higher value-added products like vegetables. A combined attack to increase productivity, consolidate landholdings and improve marketing is needed to assure farmers of better income.Thus there are five concerns as we stand at the beginning of 2019. These are: raising the investment ratio; putting the banking system back on the rails; employment generation through better growth; enhancing export growth to contain the CAD; and removing agrarian distress by increasing productivity and consolidation of small landholdings. These issues need to be addressed comprehensively, if we have to achieve sustained high growth.C.

2019-01-05,"Its that time of the year when the heart calls out for something hot and sour. Time was when I would make a detour to the Pandara Road Market on my way back home from somewhere or the other and pick up two or three bowls of hot and sour soup from one of my favourite restaurants, Ichiban. Winter evenings are just right for the soup, which is, yes, hot and sour, and full of the good stuff  little pieces of fatty pork, nice plump shrimps, tender chicken, and a host of veggies.Wide assortmentSo, when the temperature dipped some nights ago, my heart sang for something suitably hot to placate the spirit and the body. I have tried out most of the Chinese restaurants in and around East Delhi. This time I thought I would order some dishes from a place called Dragon Noodles  a seemingly popular Chinese restaurant with outlets in Indirapuram and Vaishali.I placed my order through Swiggy. I asked for a plate of stir-fried Chinese vegetables (Rs. 180), shredded chicken in black pepper gravy (Rs. 210), roasted lamb in spring onion sauce (Rs. 230), mixed Thai basil fried rice (Rs. 170) and chicken Chinese chop suey (Rs. 180). There was hot and sour soup on the menu, too, but I am a bit finicky when it comes to this hearty soup  and like the Ichiban version more than what the others offer. So I decided Id try out the other dishes instead.And I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I had my dinner, for the dishes were, indeed, rather nice. Chinese takeaway can be awful, and I live in fear of being presented with lamb in a thick red sauce, or chicken in a gelatinous white one. But I found the food had been cooked well, and each dish had a sauce that tasted different. The stir-fried veggies were deliciously crunchy, and the Thai basil fried rice was aromatically flavoured and topped with everything from shrimps to chicken.I enjoyed my chop suey, which had crunchy noodles with chicken in a light sauce. I had the pepper chicken but thought would eat the lamb with spring onions at lunch the following day.Piquant sauceThe chicken was in a pleasantly piquant sauce. The pieces were soft, and had infused in the flavours of the black pepper. I mixed it with my fried rice, and had a satisfying meal. The next day, though, my lunch was a bit of a surprise. I got some hot rice cooked at home, and mixed it with what I thought was the lamb. But every now and then, I got the feeling I was eating chicken, too. That was when I discovered that our (wo)manager of the hearth had thought the chicken and the lamb  with similar looking brown sauces  were two plates of the same dish, and heated them together. So I ended up eating shredded chicken and roasted lamb in black pepper gravy and spring onion sauce. And it wasnt half bad!Dragon Noodles gives me hope. One day I am going to try out its hot and sour soup, along with a dish called Dragon cottage cheese with spinach .But if anything has to be heated the next day, I am going to supervise the proceedings. Or maybe not.

2019-01-05,"Fall Armyworm, an invasive pest, has destroyed about 15,303 hectares of maize crop in the district, Collector K.Rajamani said here on Friday. He said a report had been sent to the government in this regard.The crop has been raised on 15,379 ha in eight taluks, including Pullampadi, Manachanallur, Thuraiyur, Uppilliyapuram and Vaiyampattai, and the pest has destroyed almost the entire cultivated area. Fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda) was first reported in the country a few months back in Karnataka and Telangana, following which the Indian Council for Agricultural Research sounded an alert. The pest spreads fast and attacks have been reported in Karur and Tiruchi districts. Farmers in Tiruchi district have been demanding compensation for the damage.Speaking at the monthly farmers grievance day meeting, Mr. Rajamani said based on demand from farmers, steps were being taken to get compensation from the government as a special case.A sum of Rs. 1 crore had been released as an initial allotment to the district for being disbursed as compensation to farmers whose coconut trees were damaged during Cyclone Gaja. The compensation had been disbursed to 1,121 farmers in Tiruverumbur, Srirangam, Manapparai and Marungapuri taluks. The government also made an initial allotment of Rs. 1.68 crore for being disbursed as compensation to farmers whose horticultural crops were damaged in the cyclone. The money would be deposited in the bank accounts of the affected farmers within the next few months.Agriculture crops on about 228 hectares and horticulture crops on 2,331 ha had been damaged in the cyclone and the district administration sought Rs. 2.21 crore to be disbursed as compensation for damaged agricultural crops and Rs. 3.41 crore for damaged horticultural crops.Steps would be taken to get the remaining sum and disburse the compensation to all affected farmers soon, he added.Speaking on the issue, R. Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, sought adequate compensation for maize farmers, whose crops have been damaged by the pest attack, and small onion (shallots) growers whose crops have been damaged due to frost. As per an earlier announcement by the Union government, compensation can be given to all crops if the loss was more than 33%, he said.P. Viswanathan, president, Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam, demanded sanction of Rs. 25,000 an acre for farmers whose maize and small onion crops have been damaged.Earlier, a cross-section of the farmers staged a demonstration in front of the Collectors Office condemning Karnatakas attempts to build a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu.Responding to a plea from Puliyur A.Nagarajan, president, Farmers Wing of Tamil Maanila Congress, Mr. Rajamani said that a causeway would be built soon across the Kollidam river at Mukkombu to enable villagers and farm workers on the North bank of the river to cross over.He also disclosed that Annawari certificates would be issued to farmers in cyclone affected areas by tahsildars to enable them get their bank loans rescheduled.

2019-01-05,"Its that time of the year when the heart calls out for something hot and sour. Time was when I would make a detour to the Pandara Road Market on my way back home from somewhere or the other and pick up two or three bowls of hot and sour soup from one of my favourite restaurants, Ichiban. Winter evenings are just right for the soup, which is, yes, hot and sour, and full of the good stuff  little pieces of fatty pork, nice plump shrimps, tender chicken, and a host of veggies.Wide assortmentSo, when the temperature dipped some nights ago, my heart sang for something suitably hot to placate the spirit and the body. I have tried out most of the Chinese restaurants in and around East Delhi. This time I thought I would order some dishes from a place called Dragon Noodles  a seemingly popular Chinese restaurant with outlets in Indirapuram and Vaishali.I placed my order through Swiggy. I asked for a plate of stir-fried Chinese vegetables (Rs. 180), shredded chicken in black pepper gravy (Rs. 210), roasted lamb in spring onion sauce (Rs. 230), mixed Thai basil fried rice (Rs. 170) and chicken Chinese chop suey (Rs. 180). There was hot and sour soup on the menu, too, but I am a bit finicky when it comes to this hearty soup  and like the Ichiban version more than what the others offer. So I decided Id try out the other dishes instead.And I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I had my dinner, for the dishes were, indeed, rather nice. Chinese takeaway can be awful, and I live in fear of being presented with lamb in a thick red sauce, or chicken in a gelatinous white one. But I found the food had been cooked well, and each dish had a sauce that tasted different. The stir-fried veggies were deliciously crunchy, and the Thai basil fried rice was aromatically flavoured and topped with everything from shrimps to chicken.I enjoyed my chop suey, which had crunchy noodles with chicken in a light sauce. I had the pepper chicken but thought would eat the lamb with spring onions at lunch the following day.Piquant sauceThe chicken was in a pleasantly piquant sauce. The pieces were soft, and had infused in the flavours of the black pepper. I mixed it with my fried rice, and had a satisfying meal. The next day, though, my lunch was a bit of a surprise. I got some hot rice cooked at home, and mixed it with what I thought was the lamb. But every now and then, I got the feeling I was eating chicken, too. That was when I discovered that our (wo)manager of the hearth had thought the chicken and the lamb  with similar looking brown sauces  were two plates of the same dish, and heated them together. So I ended up eating shredded chicken and roasted lamb in black pepper gravy and spring onion sauce. And it wasnt half bad!Dragon Noodles gives me hope. One day I am going to try out its hot and sour soup, along with a dish called Dragon cottage cheese with spinach .But if anything has to be heated the next day, I am going to supervise the proceedings.

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: For the next few days, Ramilia Maidan in New Delhi is going to be a saffron citadel and Delhi BJPs virtual camp office. Beginning Sunday, the next three weekends will see three grand events on the sprawling grounds: Bhim Mahasangam, a meeting of the citys scheduled caste communities on January 6; a two-day convention of national leaders, elected representatives and state office bearers on January 11 and 12; and Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20, when party leaders will address the youth.Senior party leaders claimed Bhim Mahasangam will be a unique event in which chef Vishnu Manohar will break his own record by preparing 5,000 kg of khichdi in a single vessel. Manohar had entered the Guinness Book of Records with a 3,000-kg khichdi event in Nagpur in October 2018. The oversized vessel Manohar used at the Nagpur event has been retrofitted for a bigger quantity of food and transported to Delhi. Gas stoves will be installed on a 15ftx15ft platform constructed close to the dais.We have collected over 10,000 kg of rice and lentils from about three lakh SC families in the past few days for the dish, disclosed Ashok Goel, media convenor, Delhi BJP . The rest of the ingredients  tomatoes, garlic, onion, salt, etc  have been arranged by the party. We will set up distribution points on the ground and a team of 1,000 people will serve the dish to people attending the meet.The party is expecting over 25,000 people at the event. The idea is to bring all sub-castes of the SC community under one roof and deliver the message of unity in diversity. The party leaders will elaborate on the work the Modi government has done for the community, said the head of media and IT cell.The bigger challenge for the party workers, however, is the organisation of the national convention on January 11 and 12, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and top leaders from different states. More than 12,000 delegates are expected to attend.Apart from the main event area from where the top leaders will address the delegates, we are also setting up separate lounges for the Prime Minister, national president and the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states, said a party leader. There will be two separate halls where the members of the national executive and other delegates will be served food. Arrangements are also being made for the PM, Union ministers and CMs to discharge urgent administrative work from the ground itself.BJP has formed 24 teams to look after the travelling arrangements, local transport and accommodation for the delegates and manage the logistics, work stations and internet connectivity, sound and LED screens and well as the internal and external beautification of the venue. Over 80,000 city youths are expected to participate in the Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20.

2019-01-06,"The Karnataka governments midday meal programme in schools has run into controversy with one of its NGO partners in the mammoth welfare exercise, International Society for Krishna Consciousnesss subsidiary Akshaya Patra Foundation (APF), refusing to include onion and garlic in cooking.Following this, the State government has not yet signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to continue the programme with APF that supplies food to 4.49 lakh students in government and government-aided schools through its centralised kitchens in several cities.In Bengaluru alone, it provides meals to 1.83 lakh students across 1,212 schools.In November, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education directed the foundation to include onion and garlic in the noon meal and start supplying hot milk instead of cold milk to the students. While the foundation has started supplying hot milk to some schools on a pilot basis, it has categorically said it will not add onion and garlic.Why does it matter?An official of the State Food Commission said it had received complaints about students skipping the midday meals as they did not like the taste of the food without onion and garlic, which are an integral part of the food culture among most communities.Children skipping meals is worrying because malnutrition is a serious issue. According to the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS) data for Karnataka (2015-2016), 36.2% of the children below the age of five are stunted, while 26.1% are wasted. The survey also reveals that 10.5% of the children were severely wasted, while 35.2% are underweight.The Central Food Technological Research Institute has sent a report to the Department based on its earlier research findings that both onion and garlic were found to enhance the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from grain.But the institute has stated that during its survey across 270 schools in Mysuru district between January and May 2017, it found the average calorific value of the meals supplied by the APF was more than a school-cooked meal. The APF has said in a statement that its cooked meals are in compliance with the nutritional norms prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.What is the governments stand?Principal Secretary S.R. Umashankar said a final call would be taken after considering the feedback from students and teachers. The APF has had a series of meeting with several stakeholders, including officials of the State Food Commission and the Education Department. The government will have to either accept the dietary norms of APF or make alternative arrangements for supplying food.Are health activists worried?Around 145 health activists, experts and citizens, who are part of the Right to Food Campaign and the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, have written to the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Chief Minister, stating that children are eating less as they find the food bland.Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher who is one of the signatories, argued for cooking culturally appropriate food in de-centralised kitchens.Activists have also demanded that eggs be served as part of the midday meals as it is a good source of protein. They want the contract with the APF terminated, and meals prepared by self-help groups and other community-based organisations in accordance with nutritional norms and cultural practices, using fresh local produce.Veena Shatrugna, a clinical nutritionist and former Ddeputy Director of the National Institute of Nutrition, said, Normally, phytates and oxalates found in vegetarian diets precipitate iron and zinc and prevent their absorption from the gut. Onion and garlic appear to enhance absorption of these minerals. This is significant, she pointed out, because around 50% to 70% of children in India are anaemic.Tanu Kulkarni

Rajangam said the menu planned by the Akshaya Patra Foundation did not meet the nutritional needs of the children.It had completely avoided egg from the menu. The food would be prepared without using ingredients such as onion and garlic, he said.The food was tailored for a particular strata of society.It had not taken into account nutritional needs of rural students, he said.Scrap agreementUrging the government to scrap the agreement, Mr. Rajangam said the Education Department should continue with the existing mode where food was prepared at its central kitchen at Lawspet and served in government schools.As per the agreement, the Karnataka-based non-governmental organisation had planned to take over the midday meals programme from the department.The organisation was planning to roll out the scheme from the beginning of the next academic year, he added.

2019-01-07,"In the quiet hours before lunch, two women worked side by side in an airy kitchen. One, a chef, cleaned fresh red snapper filets with a sharp knife. The other, a filmmaker, pointed her camera into a large pot of simmering vegetables.What would you say this is, low heat or medium? Tuleka Prah asked, setting the camera aside.Low heat, said 38-year-old Touty Sarr, who runs the kitchen of a popular cafe in Dakar. She turned to her daughter, who was watching her cook. This one, if you put it on high, it would all get dry. Thats one of the secrets.Senegal was Ms. Prahs fifth destination since her project began in 2012. She hopes to show the care and skill that goes into African dishes, such as South Africas fried dough amagwinya and Kenyas kachumbari, an onion and tomato salad.The idea, at its most basic, is to present the food how people who love it would love it, Ms. Prah said. Its like a database or a digital vault where people can open the drawer, see recipes, see some ingredients.Born in England to a Ghanaian father and a South African mother, she lived in six African countries during her childhood, including Namibia, Kenya and what is now South Sudan. After finding no reliable recipes online for Ghanaian dishes and no photos that made the beloved food look appetising she started My African Food Map.Cuisines of a continentShe celebrates the cuisines of a continent often marred by negative stereotypes.Africa is often associated with poverty, with hunger, with failures of food in a political and nutritional sense, said James C. McCann, chair of the history department at Boston University and a specialist in African environmental history and cuisine. Its an area of the world that has not been covered by the food craze.Other culinary historians, chefs, and foodies are fighting such stereotypes. Some, like author and professor Jessica Harris, have studied African and diaspora cuisine, exploring the roots of foods taken far from home by slavery. Others, like Fran Osseo-Asare and her Ghanaian-focused project Betumi, investigate the foods of a single country.The internet was the democratisation of African food writing, said Osseo-Asare, who said she has blogged about African food since the 1980s. When the internet came, you didnt have publishers as gatekeepers that could stop you from getting your work out.Unique among prominent bloggers, Ms. Prah takes an almost pan-African approach.I always feel like I am from the whole continent, she said. I can find myself in different aspects of different countries I visit.The best outcome is when people say, That is our food, that is our dish, she said, remembering her work in Kenya. I was extremely happy when the first comments I got on YouTube were, Oh, this reminds me of home.To find authentic recipes and skilled chefs, Ms. Ms. Prah asks everyone she meets in a country  hosts, cab drivers, shopkeepers and strangers  about their favourite foods. She met Ms. Sarr this way, through friends of friends.I learned from my grandma. I used to follow her everywhere, said Ms. Sarr, who wears her stiff white chefs uniform every time she cooks, even at home, because it makes her feel more professional. And our grandmas, they think that taking time with the food gives it more flavor. So I take time, too.She said she became a chef after money ran out to pursue her dream of being a doctor.By smell, sound and tasteShe dropped garlic into sizzling oil, then stepped back as Ms. Prah moved close to the pot to film. The two women orbited each other, artists collaborating over the pot burbling on the stove.Ms. Sarr said she cooks by smell, by sound and by taste, but Ms. Prah wrote her steps down in order, recording a recipe for others without the guidance of grandmothers and mothers at their side.After two hours, the platter was ready.Ms. Prah snapped a picture, and then another, before putting her camera aside to try the dish.Its really good, she said.
