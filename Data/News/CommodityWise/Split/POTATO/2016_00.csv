Much to the dismay of many who were planning to let their hair down on New Year's Eve, the Kochi cops recently announced that they will have none of this party business, (it's western culture, after all!) and issued a string of unfounded rules, all in the name of making celebrations ""more family-friendly"" and sanskari . No mercy for ""ahankari"" hipsters here, in God's Own Country. So what if all they want to do is just let some steam off and well, enjoy what's left of the year in the way they deem fit. The cops, who seem excited to play poopers this year, have pretty much made Kochi city feel like a boarding school, say the livid revelers. While the public is obviously feeling outraged, the cops have no plans whatsoever to relax their rules. Even as they turn a deaf ear to the ones who are young ones who are crying hoarse about their 'right to party', Kochi Times catches up with Arul B Krishna: District Commissioner of Police, to understand why his squad is hell bent on ruining this party.We, the police, aren't stopping you from partying. We aren't asking the public to shut inside the house on New Year Eve. We want to spread the message of responsible celebration in Kochi. Let us usher a party culture where families too can enjoy. We aren't stopping anybody, but we want people to be responsible and avoid drugs. You ask any family man in Kochi, if he prefers to party in the city on New Year night, he would say 'no'. Because he considers it not safe. We want to change that perception.While studying the reasons on the increased incidents of crime on New Year's Eve, we found that the DJ parties are providing conducive environments for drug abuse and also molestation. I have seen many instances, where women who faced abuse during such events, refused to open up. So what we felt is that everybody has the right to party, not just those who love to get intoxicated and make mischief. I know that the youngsters would not take it in the right sense but it is a request from our side to provide a safe New Year celebration to all. Let me add that this is not a rule but advisory in nature. There are hoteliers and DJs, who have come forward to co-operate with us, understanding the spirit.It has to be noted that there are no restrictions for house parties, and we are only concerned about the parties happening in public places.We spoke to a few people and we found that the dark room psychology works well in dim lights. Darkness conceals identity and also decreases inhibitions; as a result, it may lead to crimes. The liberating feeling amid darkness has been observed among a lot during dim light DJ parties.We know that while making these rules stricter, some might have already planned drug parties in isolated areas. We have a very dedicated Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) team to track them down.Our Pink Patrol team will be doubly active on New Year eve. We will be posting 1500 policemen throughout the city, at hotels, Fort Kochi and even on the roads, to ensure safe celebrations. Women can access the Pink Patrol by contacting 1515.We aren't being strict; instead we are actually forced to do this due to the increased amount of drug being pumped into the city. We have got strong intelligence inputs from the excise and from our sources that a huge amount of narcotics is being brought into the city, particularly for this New Year Eve parties. A pinch of drug that starts off as a mode to have more fun can become an addiction later.In the past one year, we had 1,300 cases on NDPS and we have arrested 1,700 people just from the Kochi city area. The use of narcotic substances and drug abuse have become very rampant. We are strictly trying to implement the laws on drug abuse. Also, we went through the records of 2014, 2015 and 2016. Around the same time last year, there were 29 accidents and two deaths reported during this period. Those who lost their lives were innocent people, who were hit by the intoxicated party-hard kinds.This year, from December 23 to 26, we caught more than 200 people for drunken driving. If this trend continues, the number of cases will cross thousand by December 31.Considering all these instances, we have come up with a strategy to ensure zero accidents and zero incidents.Meanwhile, Kochiites react to the decision:'Those who proclaimed freedom are now enchaining us'Festivals are to celebrate. Celebrations are very important to have a calm and peaceful society. What if tomorrow, the government gives us orders on how to celebrate Onam, Christmas and even Eid? It is like restricting the freedom of human beings. I guess, for the ruling party, the New Year begins at 10 pm not at 12 am! The leaders who once proclaimed freedom are now enchaining us. This is all because of the poverty in thoughts and attitude. If they have to make the rules stricter, they should do it in places where there is blood shed for political gain, and not on anybody's freedom to celebrate.'The duty of police is to ensure public safety and not restrict their freedom'I am not a party freak but I believe everyone has the right to celebrate New Year in their own ways. The more the police try to clamp down, the more the public will try to break free. These stricter rules will annoy the public and the number of house parties will increase. This would also create disturbances in the neighbourhood. I think the duty of police is to ensure safety and security of the public and not restrict their freedom. New Year is a universal celebration and I am totally against controlling one from celebrating it in their own style.'I hope they don't take away our right to scream when the clock strikes 12'We all have the freedom to express and enjoy. New Year Eve is looked forward by many with a lot of hope, expectations and dreams. If we can party responsibly, then no one can stop us. I wish the government could give us some positive news in addition to imposing rules. We are already depressed due to the impact of demonetisation, now I hope they don't take away our right to scream when the clock strikes 12.'The authorities are trying to crumble the society by curbing all means of fun'When the restrictions increase, the tendency to break away from it also go up. Will the crime rate reduce just because the rules are made stricter? Most of the Malayalis only party during New Year and now due to this last minute restrictions, I guess we will have a dull New Year this time. The authorities are trying to crumble the society by curbing all means of fun. Guess we will end up being boring couch potatoes who can't party or enjoy."

Since these heavy metals have the tendency to accumulate in the body, their levels will keep on increasing over the years.Spinach or Beta vulgaris with Paneer or potato, Amaranthus (bhaji) with lamb kidney, and pickled Deccan hemp (Gongura) are among the top favourite dishes in Hyderabad. A substantial quantity of leafy vegetables that arrive in markets in Hyderabad are sourced from the farms along the river Musi.A joint study by researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) and the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRDA) revealed that the total concentration of these heavy metals was as high as 550.97 mg per kg of spinach and 493.34 mg per kg of Amaranthus. High levels of metal contaminants were also found in other leafy vegetables collected from the farms. Research studies conducted earlier also showed high concentration of dangerous metal pollutants in leafy vegetables grown in the region.The research team that included G Anil and ES Priya suggested that samples should be collected at regular intervals for assessment and monitoring of the levels of heavy metal contaminants along the river Musi.The mid-river course of the Musi is notorious for several types of pollutants including pharmaceuticals and pesticides. They enter into vegetables and fruits through a natural process called bio-accumulation. The concentration of poisonous contaminants varies from farm to farm along the Musi. As part of the study, the researchers collected samples from vegetable farms at Edulabad on the city outskirts, Uppal and Nagole.""One should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables including the leafy variety every day for good health. If the vegetables contain high levels of contaminants, one will end up consuming four to five times more than the daily permissible limits, which vary from just 35 micro grams in case of cadmium to 10 mg in case of manganese,"" said Dr M Khaja, clinical toxicologist.Toxic FoodLeafy vegetables found contaminated in city: Spinach, Amaranthus, Deccan hemp (Gongura)Heavy metals amount found in a 200-gram dish made with these vegetables: 110 mgDaily permissible limit set by WHO: 70 mgEffects:Heavy metal poisoning can affect mental health in childrenLong-term accumulation in body can even lead to cancerPrecautionsSoak vegetables in water for a long time and then wash them thoroughly"

58d66662a3d24b1894a664bc,Christmas celebrations across the world,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/christmas-celebrations-all-around/articleshow/56167344.cms,2016-12-25,,The Times Of India,"Now that all of us have already lit up and decorated our beautiful X-mas tree and prepared the lovely gifts let's see how Christmas is celebrated elsewhere. Each country celebrates the festival differently adding their own touch; while many celebrate Christmas today, there are countries for whom the celebrations is in January. From the sweetest, to the weirdest, we list how X-mas is celebrated differently around the world.There are many traditions attached when it comes to celebrating Christmas in Serbia . While one of their traditions involve a girl/ woman collecting water from a well, spring, or stream on Christmas morning, as it is believed to have beneficial powers to strengthen health. Gifts are distributed three Sundays before X-Mas eve. Interestingly, to receive the gift, a game is played where the recipient of the gift is tied up and must hand over gifts to pay their ransom. Logs are also set on fire, as to the traditions it symbolises, the fire that the shepherds of Bethlehem built to keep Jesus warm after he was born.In Venezuela, one can relive their childhood every time Christmas is around. In Caracas, it is common to travel to church for morningservices on roller skates. Roads are cleared to provide churchgoers a safe passage. Many even tie pieces of string and dangle them out of the window so, if they oversleep, passers-by will be able to take support of the string whilst waking them up.In Iceland, there are 13 Santas, who are believed to have come down from the mountain one by one, 13 days before X-Mas. Depending on a child's behavior they leave presents. If the child has been good a present is left for them, however, if the child has been naughty, then a rotten potato is left. It is also believed that one by one the Santas leave after X-Mas, the last one leaving on January 6. Austria has a little scary, way of celebrating the festivities. In Austria they take to the streets to celebrate Santa's terrifying evilcompanion, Krampus. Several people gather at the Hollabrunn Market Square, where over 100 Krampus impersonators are present to scare onlookers. It is said that the German folklore states that Krampus beats naughty children and then puts them in a woven wicker basket on his back. It's certainly not a merry X-mas!In Australia the festivities come only in July. While they do celebrate X-mas on December 25, but the place is comparatively hotter, than other places. Hence they celebrate it with pomp in July again when it is the coolest. Christmas in July does not replace the real Christmas in December, it's enjoyed as an extra celebration. It's also traditional to enjoy a barbecue on the beach on the big day.While we all expect Santa Claus to come and hand us our gifts, in Italy the gifts are handed by Befana, the Christmas Witch. Also the presents are usually distributed after the New Years' Eve. It is said that the kind old Befana distributes presents and is depicted riding a broomstick whilst carrying a bag filled with sweets and gifts, and enters homes through the chimney."

But it did not, despite a drop in prices in the wholesale market. If the wholesale market price dip was due to less demand in the retail market despite adequate supply , this did not reflect in the retail prices. For example, prices of Chandramukhi potatos in Kolkata retail markets stand at Rs 20-22 a kilogram when the government deadline for taking potato out of the state cold storage was December 8. It held true for retail prices of winter vegetables as well, when they were supposed to dip a little during this time of the season. For example, a piece of cauliflower is priced between Rs 8 and Rs 10 a piece in the wholesale market, but the same vegetable is selling for Rs 20-Rs 22 in the retail market. Similarly , eggplants, which are available in abundance during winter, are priced at Rs 11 a kg in the wholesale market, while they cost Rs 22 per kilogram on the retail shelves.The contrast was contrary to the perception that the price of perishable goods would nosedive due to demonetisation. Though the rates did crash by almost 7580% post-demonetisation, they soon soared and remained consistent towards the higher range. ""The drive seems to have had only a marginal effect on the prices of vegetables in retail markets, where the rates have gone down by merely 5-10% after the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" said Prabhat Kumar Das , organising sec retary of the Federation of Traders' Organisation and member of the chief minister's task force on price of edibles. This has surprised the state agriculture marketing department, whose minister Tapan Dasgupta, recently made the rounds of some markets to find out the reason for the constant rates. Even families, hoping for a respite albeit temporary , seemed disappointed with the veggie prices remaining high. ""I had hopes a slash in prices of edibles will be the only silver lining to the demonetisation drive but even that did not happen. The prices have stayed on the steep side,"" said Kakoli Dhar, a homemaker in Lake Town So what is the reason for the price mismatch between the wholesale and retail prices? State agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta blamed it on aggregators and retailers, trying to make up for loss in trade volume, by keeping the prices steep. ""Middlemen in the wholesale markets control the rates. A decrease in supply and increase in demand works in their favour. We are trying to weed out such elements so that the common man do not have to shell out more,"" said Dasgupta.The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), under the finance ministry , did not rule out a price rise after an immediate slump due to demonetisation. The reason, it said, the producer at the first point of the supply chain might withdraw due to the liquidity crunch, leading to less sup ply , pushing prices up.Some traders alleged several unscrupulous elements were keeping the prices up by resorting to dishonest means. ""Within the first week, the prices dropped, but they did not dip further, though supply shrank,"" said the government's task force member. This despite several households shifting to malls and marts to buy edibles with plastic money .Salt Lake homemaker Reema Mukherjee earlier bought 25% of her groceries from the local market and rest from a convenience store. Now, she has shifted to a big store, using her debit card. ""It makes sense to use debit card now. Though I feel the supply in my local market is fresher and I can also bargain there, I am forced to go to the mart now,"" she said."

Acreage under rabi crops are seen higher this year and most of the expansion is seen in the area under potato and garlic.""Industry experts said that better remuneration and timely arrival of winter this year have helped in expanding acreage under vegetables.The agriculture department official said, ""Last year farmers had earned profit in garlic and potato farming, which has resulted in expansion of acreage this year.

While there were certain variations across city markets, the overall price curve continued to slide downwards 10 days after the demonetisation move.Markets across the city witnessed low sales even on Thursday. ""I have barely sold 15kg potato since morning. Normally we sell around 120kg each day. The slump has pushed us into a severe cash crunch,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market Potato prices have witnessed the sharpest dip in the past three days after wholesale prices came down to Rs 11 per kg for the Jyoti variety on Wednesday. ""Based on the grading of the Jyoti variety, prices varied between Rs 11 and Rs 12 at the wholesale markets,"" said Patit Paban Dey, former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association. ""It seems that farmers needed cash to stay afloat and decided to release potato at a lower price,"" he added.""We are yet to receive the Nasik variety of onion. But the prices have come down further. This normally happens when the market is flush with new produce,"" said Shakti Prasad Ghara, a vegetable vendor at the New Market. Prices of seasonal vegetables are also showing a downward trend with supplies increasing at the city markets. ""New produce have started coming in and prices of seasonal vegetables like beans, cabbage, capsicum and carrot have come down substantially,"" said Rajat Laskar, a vegetable vendor at Gariahat Market.Egg prices have witnessed a sharp drop in the past few days, and the fish market is suffering because vendors aren't accepting the Rs 2,000 notes.On the other hand, transporters are worried about the liquidity crunch after the toll tax is re-imposed from November 24."

However, APMC trading did not have much impact on prices of commodities. In the Modasa APMC, around 2,500 quintal of groundnut and cotton were traded and the market opened on a high note . There were fears of reduction in price, but in fact the quality of crops raised prices. Groundnut and cotton fetched prices on par with the minimum support price announced by the government.""At Prantij, which is the biggest market for trading of paddy, price was around Rs 300 for 20 kg; the MSP is Rs 294,"" said C G Patel the secretary of Prantij APMC. Farmers were accepting cheques for 90% of payment. According to market sources, if the entire trading were to be conducted with cash, a marketyard would need at least 2 crore per day, which was not possible because of the recent cash crisis.Mahesh Patel, the secretary of Gondal APMC, said that farmers were not willing to sell their produce if payments were made with cheques; farmers said cheques would take three days to clear. Moreover, they said, they would have to queue up for hours outside banks to withdraw just Rs 24,000 a week. ""This amount is not adequate to meet transport expenses and wages of labourers,"" Patel said. Bhikhabhai Gajeram, the secretary of Junagadh APMC, said: ""Traders in APMC are finding it difficult to purchase."" He said oil millers, whose entire business was conducted with cash, were not willing to pay through cheques. ""Hence when there is no buying, APMC traders are not purchasing from farmers,"" Gajeram said. A B Pandya, the secretary of Amreli APMC, said farmers feared that some cheques may be dishonoured. They were also concerned that traders could cheat them. However, in Ahmedabad, some traders were doing business with cheques . Kishore, an Ahmedabad trader, said: ""We are purchasing onions and potatoes coming to the APMC with cheques and sellers are accepting cheques readily."" At the APMC Jetalpur, against the average of 500 trucks, only 140 arrived for trading. Prices remained constant and there was not much of an impact."

A December devoid of snow threatens the crop of exotic vegetables , which he supplies to hotels in Delhi and other parts of the country each summer. This is not a one-off case. Weather in the hill state has been erratic for quite some time now. The change has been subtle but relentless. Last year, for instance, very less snowfall was recorded in December, particularly in areas like Lahaul-Spiti, which otherwise used to be covered under several feet of snow.For residents of 521 villages of Lahaul-Spiti, this threatens their way of life. Springs emanating from snow deposits are a major source of surface irrigation through gravity kuhls (water channels). The springs are both perennial and ephemeral, getting recharged mainly from melting snow on the higher reaches. There is only one cropping season from April to September or early October when mean minimum and maximum temperatures range approximately between 12 degree celsius to 24 degrees celsius.Suresh Kardo, a resident of Kardang village in Lahaul-Spiti said missing snowfall has become a cause for serious concern for farmers in the tribal district as agriculture is completely dependent on snow, which not only provides moisture to the soil but also recharges water sources for summer.""In the summer, people mainly grow cash crops like peas, potato and cauliflower. Besides, people have switched to the cultivation of exotic vegetable varieties which are supplied directly to hotels and restaurants in Manali and Delhi.These vegetables need plenty of water for irrigation and missing snowfall endangers crop production next summer,"" said Thakur.At Ratnari village of Shimla , apple grower Ashutosh Chauhan is worried about the forthcoming apple season. Missing snowfall will lead to less production as the requirement of chilling hours could not be met. ""Since October 5, the state has not received rain and snow and we do not know how extensively this prolonged dry weather will affect apple production,"" he said.The wheat crop has also been affected in lower Himachal as sowing has been delayed in many areas.People who have sown wheat are facing losses as irrigation facility is not available in many areas.""Himachal Pradesh has been witnessing dry weather conditions for two months. This has affected sowing of wheat, peas and garlic. Even natural water springs are drying up. People are heading to the temple to pray for rain and snow as the cash crop is under threat,"" said Suresh Kumar a farmer from Kullu."

Batting for farmers, he presented a note on farmers' welfare to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent meeting in New Delhi and is also pursuing the matter through his party MPs and senior officials in the finance department.His objective, though not made public till date, is to seek exemption of agriculture income from income tax. It has been made mandatory for all farmers who are holding over five acres to file income tax returns every year. However, KCR who claims to earn about Rs 10 crore per annum by growing vegetables such as potatoes, coloured capsicum, bitter gourd and bottle gourd at his expansive 59-acre greenhouse at Erravelli village in Siddipet district, is not averse to the idea of farmers filing returns.Known as progressive farmer after embracing rain-harvesting and other advanced farm technics in his farm land, KCR has been vocal when it comes to safeguarding the interests of farmers. ""On an average, a farmer sells his crop and gets Rs 5 lakh. He earns this by passing through many risks including cyclones and pests. Demanding tax on his sacrifice would be unjustified,"" KCR is said to have informed the PM. He also asked the PM to announce one-time amnesty exclusively for farmers to allow their total savings to be deposited in banks without any tax burden.After meeting Modi, KCR has intensified his efforts to save farmers from the tax net and asked his party MPs and speci al representatives in Delhi to follow up the matter with Union finance ministry . Finance officials also prepared a report on special conditions in Telangana where farmers faced series of droughts.""Our CM has made it clear that under no circumstances should the farmer be burdened with additional tax. Whatever the farmers are enjoying all these years should be protected,"" TRS MP B Vinod told TOI.KCR is now moving heaven and earth to see that supply of `500 notes reaches the villages where the shortage of currency is acute. He wrote two letters -one to finance minister Arun Jaitley and another to RBI governor Urjit Patel -requesting them to ensure early supply of lower denomination currency.""KCR made a request to allow cooperative banks to accept old notes from farmers and lifting of curbs on payments to ryots at yards.

Tucked away amid hills and forests, the village is situated 60 km from here in the Maoist corridor.However, things changed for better since the implementation of a watershed development project by the district administration during 2015-16. The project has not only led to increase in the tribals' income but also checked migration.""Earlier there was no irrigation facility at the village and we solely depended on monsoon for agriculture. Also, we used to migrate in search of work. But now, the watershed project have given us confidence to grow crop in off-season also,"" said Sadhu, who has cultivated maize and potato on his five acres. This year, Sadhu has earned Rs 2.50 lakh by selling potato, cabbage and maize.Officials said Rs 30 lakh has been spend for the project.

Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change.

The distribution drive, planned outside the UP Legislative Assembly building, is aimed at drawing the government's attention to the acute problems being faced by farmers across the country, exacerbated by the government demonetisation move which had led to a liquidity crunch.Speaking to TOI, BKU's Lucknow spokesperson Alok Verma said, ""Farmers have not been able to sell their potato and paddy produce and the markets are lying empty . To make ends meet, a large number of them were forced to make distress sale of paddy at Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal even though the minimum support price declared by the government is Rs 1,470 per quintal. Now, demonetisation had crippled business further because farmers have no money to buy seeds, DAP , and fertilisers to sow the rabi (winter) crop. They are dumping their produce in the state capital in the hope that the government will take note and do something for them.""Until Tuesday night, 22 trucks-full of paddy and potaoes had landed up outside the BKU office in Lucknow. Verma claimed that potatoes and paddy in excess of 100 quintals will be up for grabs outside Vidhan Sabha.

But in these days of 'conscious eating', another potato is slowly but steadily taking over the mantle of 'favourite'; the sweet potato While most of us usually tuck into piping hot, steamed, sweet potatoes as a tea-time snack, the interesting feature of the tuber is that is lends itself beautifully to cooking, be it sweet or savoury dishes, and is increasingly being opted for as the 'healthier carb'.But, do not be fooled by the word 'sweet'. Sweet potatoes contain a whopping dose of beta-carotene, Vitamin C , potassium and other vital vitamins and minerals. In fact, the nutritional value of this tuber has been ranked as the highest among several other foods.Goa boasts two varieties of sweet potatoes grown locally the brown-skinned, orange variety and the white-skinned variety that is also known as the 'Goa Velha white'. Both are popular and widely available, especially during the winter season.Food blogger Xanti Fernandes e Pinto of xantilicious.com says she finds sweet potatoes to be an excellent alternative to regular cooking potatoes in most dishes as they are a rich source of complex carbohydrates and Vitamin C. Some of her favourite sweet potato-based sweet dishes are bebinca and neureo. ""The sweet potato neureo, or kongancheo neureo , is something I have been eating since I was a child at my Hindu neighbour's home,"" she says.The procedure to make these, Pinto says, can get a bit tricky as the dough, due to its stickiness, needs to be handled between plastic sheets while rolling and folding. And like in most sweet potato-based dishes, the level of sweetness can be adjusted as desired by simply adding a bit of sugar.Homemaker Nirmala Fernandes has fond childhood memories of a sweet dish she would be served at the convent whenever she visited her aunt. The dish consists of parboiled sweet potatoes that are then sliced or cubed, pan-fried with a dash of coconut oil and tossed in a pre-prepared filling of grated coconut and coconut jaggery (ghodd-chun).""Apart from steamed, sweet potatoes, this version is also a family favourite,"" she says.Avid foodie and owner of the popular food blog, 'Hungry? Hog?', Sapna Sardesai says she indulges her family with many different sweet potato preparations. ""Sweet potato kheer, made with sago and coconut milk, is quite a popular traditional dish and a favourite, too,"" she says.Another popular preparation, she says, is the puran poli, which is traditionally an Indian stuffed bread with a lentil filing. ""A stuffing made using boiled and mashed sweet potatoes, a bit of sugarcane jaggery and grated coconut makes for a delicious alternative,"" Sardessai explains.Sweet indulges can hardly get better than this."

By November 25, 55% of paddy is harvested, but only 22% Kharif paddy has been reaped so far. The government is thinking of diverting 100-day job labourers to fields for reaping the crop.Bengal's food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Tuesday said: "" After the paddy is procured, it will go to rice mills . Each entry at rice mill will generate three challans, one of which comes straight to food department in Kolkata. Immediately , the fund will be transferred to the bank account of the farmer through RTGS system. The entire procure ment will be monitored at multiple levels so no corruption creeps in.""He added: ""We have Rs 5,000 crore with the department for procurement. Moreover, we are taking a loan of Rs 1,000 crore from the West Bengal Finance Development Corporation. Besides, the Centre is supposed to give us Rs 2,008 crore this year and Rs 481 crore against last year's due.The state has set the minimum support price of Rs 1,490 per quintal (.1 tonne). It has also set a procurement target of 52 lakh tonne paddy which will yield 41.20 lakh tonne rice. The state's requirement out of the procurement is 32 lakh tonne. Six lakh tonne of rice will be sold to Jharkhand. Rest of the rice will be given to state food safety pool and central food safety pool.The food minister also alerted against a fake job racket in the name of paddy procurement. The racket is playing havoc with the youths in rural Bengal. They are duping job-seekers and charging thousands of rupees in the name of recruitment of civic volunteers by the food department. ""We cannot recruit civic volunteers. Civic volunteers are there with the police department. In case of procurement, the civic volunteers will be roped in from the respective superintendent of police of the district. They floated fake websites and I have ordered inquiry by CID,"" said Mullick.Potato clearance deadline extendedThe Bengal government has extended the deadline for clearing potato stock from cold storage by eight more days.Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta on Tuesday said, ""We have asked all the stakeholders in the potato business to clear the stock immediately.

However, there is little impact of on retail price. Thanks to the middlemen and the last man in the retail market, the price of vegetables remains quite high compared to their prices the same time last year. With the liquidity crunch continuing unabated, there is an element of distress sale at the source (from the field) by farmers. The overwhelming fear that the perishables may not be sold at all is also working behind the price crash.The potato (jyoti variety), which grows in abundance in Hooghly, is sold at Rs 4 per kg soon after its withdrawal from the cold storages. After sorting the potato, wholesale price stood at Rs 7-8 per kg. The retail price should have been Rs 910 per kg after taking into account the transportation and other costs. But the retail price remains as high as Rs 16-22 in most of the markets in the city. Thanks to demonetisation and the resultant liquidity crunch, a stockpile of 8 lakh tonnes of potatoes remained in the cold storages even after the deadline of clearing the stockpile expired on November 30. Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said the potato price should come down after the potato stockpile is cleared. He has set a deadline of December 8 for clearing the entire stock from the cold storages.The price of brinjal, which grow mainly in Hooghly and Burdwan, crashed to Rs 55-60 per palla (per 5 kgs). The wholesale price should not be more than Rs 15 per kg. But brinjal price in the city retail market hovered around Rs 25-30 per kg.Cabbage, which was Rs 35-40 per palla in the wholesale market, is sold at Rs 20 per kg in the city retail markets.The biggest crash happened in tomato prices. Toma toes grow in huge quantity in Bankura and Purulia. The farmers on Tuesday sold it at Rs 20 a palla. The tomato wholesale price at Khatra and Manbazar stood at Rs 6 per kg. But the retail price of tomato remains as high as Rs 20-25 per kg on Tuesday.Uttam Kundu, a wholesaler at Seoraphuli wholesale market, said, ""We have asked farmers to raise Rs 1 per kg against every vegetable so that farmers get some price. But the fear of liquidity crunch is so high that people did distress sale. The market has become a bit unpredictable.""Agriculture marketing department sources said there is a collusion of middlemen and the last man in the market (last retail outlet) that prevented the plunge in retail price.Dasgupta said, ""We are not sitting idle.

The plastic waste generated in the Diamond City will be used in the construction of asphalt roads.The civic body has started a pilot project for constructing roads using plastic waste in three municipal zones namely Katargam, Varachha and Udhna adopting Indian Road Congress' (IRC) guideline for use of waste plastic in hot bituminous mix (dry process). Official sources said the Diamond City generates around 1,600 tonnes of solid waste per day. Out of this, the plastic waste consists of around 10 per cent or 160 tonnes.The entire process is very simple. The plastic waste material above 40 micron and below 90 micron, including items like plastic carry-bags, plastic cups, plastic packaging for potato chips, biscuits, chocolates, etc. are shredded to a particular size using a shredding machine. The aggregate mix is heated at 150c and transferred to the mixing chamber, and the bitumen is heated to 160c to result in good binding. It is important to monitor the temperature during heating.The shredded plastic waste is then added to the aggregate. It gets coated uniformly over the aggregate within 30 to 60 seconds, giving an oily look. The plastic waste coated aggregate is mixed with hot bitumen and the resulting mix is used for road construction. The road laying temperature is between 110c to 120c. The roller used has a capacity of 8 tonnes.""The advantages of using waste plastic for road construction are many. The process is easy and does not need a new machinery. For one metric tonnes of bitumen, around 80 kilogram to 100 kilogram plastic waste is used. Plastic increases the aggregate impact value and improves the quality of flexible pavements. Wear and tear of the roads, rainwater seepage and road durability could be increased to a large extent,"" said municipal commissioner M Thennarasan. Adviser and incharge of road development department Jatin Shah told TOI, ""Plastic waste helps increase the strength of the road. These roads have better resistance towards rainwater and cold weather. """

Only 5,000 crates of pomegranates were supplied by farmers, instead of the regular average of 15,000 crates. In Neera market, the auction of jaggery dropped by almost 50%, with the unloading of about 1,000 boxes as against the daily standard of 2,000 boxes. Meanwhile in Junnar , trade in fresh vegetables, onion, tomatoes and potatoes was down by 40%.Traders and farmers at these local markets have traditionally preferred transactions in cash, and were caught off-guard by the sudden announcement. The cancellation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has affected the payments, while purchases have also suffered. Even prices have dropped because of the low demand for farm produce.Officials in the agriculture produce market committee fear that more time would be required before things return to normal.An official attached to the market committee in Indapur said, ""Pomegranates have a huge market here, and a daylong auction registers transactions amounting to over Rs 50 lakh. This is peak season for pomegranate sales. We were expecting a rise in trade. However, for the last week, it has dropped drastically. Cash crunch forced traders and farmers to suspend auction because of the ban on cash transactions using demonetised notes. The auction finally resumed on Saturday to recover losses.""Local sources said that pomegranates had piled up in the orchards and if not sold soon, will rot, causing losses. So farmers and traders were left with no choice but to go ahead with trade.Soybean is ready for harvest in most parts of Baramati , and growers are likely to face losses if auction is not held.Even auctions of foodgrains like wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and soybean were completely halted for a week. The agriculture produce market committee said that supply of foodgrain dropped by almost 50% in last 10 days, and even traders were not unwilling to auction off their produce at lower prices. The committee was hopeful that action would resume on Monday. Local sources in Junnar-Ambegaon-Khed , which is predominantly known for cultivation of vegetables, said despite a good yield, business has taken a hit.Meanwhile, the government's latest move of increasing withdrawal limits for farmers, to Rs25,000, was met with scepticism. ""Cash is not available at most banks. Farmers cannot spend the entire day standing in queues in banks. Also, there are limited branches of nationalized banks in rural parts so farmers are badly hit,"" said Ashok Banker , a resident of Ambegaon area."

Liquidity crunch and fresh supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have changed the game altogether. The wholesale price of Jyoti variety of potato crashed to Rs 2-3 per kg at markets closed to cold storages across Bengal. However, the crash has a little impact on the retail markets in the city.This year saw the least potato production  9 million tonne  in Bengal compared to earlier years. So, many farmers and middlemen calculated a good price if they managed to hoard a substantial amount of potato. A section of farmers, middlemen and cold-storage owners fudged this year's actual storage to jack up the price. So, when the actual storage was 6.5 million tonnes across 462 potato cold storages in Bengal, it was shown only 3 million tonne. This led to abnormal rise of potato price in both wholesale and retail markets.Potato economy of Bengal is always erratic. It is one of the most risky farming bets. With a contribution of 25% in India's potato output, Bengal is the second-largest producer of the vegetable after UP. ""A section of middlemen and traders speculate the probable price of potato every year, keeping in mind the production of potato and its price in previous years. But things often go haywire when ground reality changes,"" said Shankar Adhikari , an agriculture economist.November 30 was the last date for clearing entire stock. But government found a huge stockpile of potato in the cold storages. Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta extended the last date of clearing the stock till December 8. But even after that the government found a huge stock uncleared. Now that section of farmers and middlemen find it difficult to withdraw the stock from cold storages as the cost overshoots the wholesale price.Paschimbanga Potato Traders Association president Swapan Samanta said: ""Liquidity crunch along with fresh supply of low-cost potato from Punjab has changed the game. Bengal potato now has hardly any buyer. The potato retail price now should be below Rs 8 in Kolkata's retail markets."" Traders are jostling to sell before the new crop arrives in December end, failing which the old one must be destroyed."

But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

As wasted fruits and vegetables fill the area and raise a stink, estimates show that at least 60-70% of the produce is going waste because supply chain has been disrupted by cashlessness. It is the same situation at most mandis that come under Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Markets Board.On Wednesday morning, potato buyer and whole seller Mohammad Salim ordered throwing 25 sacks into the garbage dump. A single sack contains 1 quintal potatoes. ""An average of 20-25 sacks are going waste since demonetisation was announced,"" said the businessman.His son Mohammad Shaan said wastage over the month was to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh. ""We would have sold the produce to retailers at an estimated rate of Rs 5 per kg which means Rs 12,500 for 25 quintals. If the average for 28 days of demonetization period is calculated, our loss stands at Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said.But Salim is not the only one to have run into losses. The mandi comprises 50 buyers and at least 500 farmers in the vicinity. ""Cash and change crunch has upset business across levels. Over 60-70% of the produce is wasted for lack of demand. If this goes on, the mandi will have to close down,"" said Arvind Shukla, vice-president of the mandi's vegetable and fruit whole sellers association.General secretary Irshad Hussain added, ""Many farmers are not able to bring their produce to us because they have no money for transport. Some of the growers are dumping their produce either for peanuts at the local level or leaving it to fate. Even those who can manage are not able to get the cost of ferrying goods as prices have nose-dived.""Explaining the price factor, Saroj Pal, a dealer in tomatoes said, ""In October, a crate of tomatoes (25kg) sold at Rs 700 but a farmer gets only Rs 100 for the same now. Clearly, the rates have come down seven times.""Cauliflower, the cash crop of the past two seasons is making farmers regret. ""A single bud is fetching just 1 rupee instead of Rs 6-8 each last season,"" said Dharmu Lodhi, a farmer from Bangermau.Wastage at the fruit sellers' end was estimated to be around 40-50%. Tanveer Ahmed, who dealt with exotic fruits like kiwis , kinnows and grapes said, ""We dealt with these fruits on a daily basis but there have been just one or two business days in the week. The stock is going waste on a daily basis.""Tomato farmer from Rajpur (MP), Angad Singh said ""Will Modiji pay for our losses?"" Nizam Bhai pyazwale said, ""Many farmers had taken loans... the bid to battle black money is fine but not at the cost of human lives. Steps have to be taken immediately,"" he said.Hand-to-mouth locals are perhaps the only happy ones in the mandi because some vendors are giving away their vegetables free.

I will do it',"" said C V Sheela, one of the nurses. ""She smiled at us when we walked in, chatted with us, and, on most occasions, cooperated. When we were around, she made an effort to eat despite difficulties.She would have one spoon for the sake of each of us and one for herself,"" Sheela added.Her diet included her favourite upma, pongal or curd rice and potato curry, prepared by her cook. There was a team of 16 nurses who were posted in three shifts; Sheela, M V Renuka and Samundeeswari were among her favourites.After a condolence meeting at Apollo Hospitals , doctors, nurses and paramedics described how she was sometimes funny, usually cooperative, and occasionally difficult during her 75-day stay.Jayalalithaa was brought to the emergency room on the night of September 22 in severe discomfort. Four hours later, when her vitals were stable, she woke up and asked for some sandwiches and coffee. ""It had been a long journey for her since then,"" said Dr R Senthil Kumar, senior consultant, who led a team of intensive care experts. When she wasn't too tired, she would chat with duty doctors. She would give tips on skin care and sometimes 'ordered' them to change their hair style. ""She always advised women to give themselves some time however busy they were,"" said medical director Dr Sathya Bhama.She wasn't a fan of Apollo Hospitals' coffee. One day, she told a room full of nurses and doctors to pack up and come to her Poes Garden residence. ""Come, let's go home. I will serve you the best tea from Kodainadu,"" said critical care expert Dr Ramesh Venkataraman There were moments when she was firm. When UK-based Richard Beale gave her a pep talk asking her to cooperate, telling her that in the hospital he was the boss, she weakly gestured to him that 'this state' was her turf.Doctors vividly remember her being spirited when AIADMK won all three polls in Thanjavur, Arvakuruchi and Thiruparankundram on November 22. ""She watched the news on Jaya TV and smiled,"" Dr Bhama said.But everything changed on that fateful Sunday evening. She was watching an old Tamil soap opera when an intensivist (name withheld) walked into her room. Jayalalithaa didn't smile or talk. She seemed breathless. By the time the doctor adjusted the ventilator, the monitors around her had flat-lined. She had. Two days later, when doctors and nurses walked into the hospital, the silence was deafening.

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer. Ani Kumar, who trades capsicum, has even asked farmers not to send produce as he did not have money."

Vegetable prices have remained the same at all the Kolkata municipal markets , even after the shift in sales from the neighbourhood bazars to shopping malls during the initial days of demonetisation. Even the state task force team apparently couldn't get to the bottom of the reason.""There is a huge difference between wholesale and retail prices. We have brought it to the CM's notice. I fear there is a strong retail cartel in the city that has prevented any drop in rates even after wholesale prices started going down. There has also been a slump in field rates,"" said Bengal Vendors' Association president Kamal Dey . The high retail price doesn't quit sync with the supply scene as Bengal, like elsewhere in the country , had a bumper yield this year.Potato prices in the retail market range between Rs 10 and Rs 12 a kg, while its wholesale rate is pegged at Rs 7 a kg. What's more is that cold storages are auctioning the potato stocks at Rs 120-140 for a 50-kg packet, which comes down to Rs2.4-Rs 2.8 a kg. The marginal decrease in retail prices for some items is no match to the price crash during this part of the season. So much so that potato far mers at Tarakeswar are dumping their stocks because the prices they are getting is half the amount they spent on potato seeds for sowing.Other vegetable prices, too, defy the economics of demand-and-supply, with traders at Kolay Market wondering where and how were the perishable items stored to ensure a regulated supply . Prices of vegetables remained similar compared to that last year, even during the first few days of demonetisation. ""There was a fall in demand initially. Most people had to cut down on their daily budget. Retailers didn't compromise on prices even then,"" Dey said.The widening gap has prompted some farmers to shift to cultivating flowers. ""This may lead to a supply crunch, pushing prices up further,"" Dey said, adding the vegetable-to-flower shift could impact the food chain. ""We will start feeling the pinch from February . We may have to pay double for vegetables,"" Dey said."

It has been operating an `anna kshetra' (a place of foodgrain) at Dashaswamedh area for centuries.Said to have been started by Shankar Swami Khichdi Baba centuries ago, the `anna kshetra' is being run by Sanjay Maharaj, a fourth generation member of the family which has been looking after the temple for more than 100 years.Legend has it that Lord Shiva had magically concealed the food items of goddess Annapurna and asked her to satisfy his hunger. It was then that Shankar Swami arrived in Kashi and cooked khichdi (dal-rice and different vegetables) for Lord Shiva and satiated his hunger.""Swamiji would prepare khichdi with donation from pilgrims at a pedestal raised on Dedhsi bridge at Dashaswamedh temple and serve the needy, poor and the homeless. He came to be known as Khichdi Baba,"" says Sanjay Maharaj.He said that Makar Sankranti, also known as `Khichdi', was named after Khichdi Baba.Khichdi is a customary food item prepared on Makar Sankranti. The trend is believed to have been started by Lord Shiva.But Khichdi was introduced to Lord Shiva by Khichdi Baba and this is the reason the festival is named after him, said Sanjay, adding that the place where Khichdi Baba used to cook was given the shape of a temple and the bust of Khichdi Baba and his disciple Harihar Baba had been installed by the family.Sharing an anecdote narrated by his father Rajendra Prasad Maharaj, Sanjay says that during the British rule, a British Army man had sent the then-Khichdi Baba to jail. That very day, the officer's family members fell ill and their condition started worsening. A local then reminded the officer of his behaviour towards Baba and the Englishman released him from jail. The next moment his family members were as fit as a fiddle.That was the power of Khichdi Baba, he says.According to Sanjay, Bhandaras are run everyday from 7am and needy people who throng the temple are served hot khichdi prepared with as many as 10 types of vegetables including, cauliflower, brinjal, potato, tomato, bittergourd, and others.In one round, more than 200 people are fed khichdi. The count crosses 600 almost everyday, he said, adding that on Mondays and Saturdays, the count of people crosses 800 as both days belong to Baba and it is customary to eat khichdi every Saturday ."

Manohar Shardiya, managing director of a cold storage said, ""With a rise in the snacks industry, demand for potato is growing rapidly in the state. Malwa potatoes are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste.

Pronounced 'sha-koo-tee', most tourists find it hard to utter but easy to digest. The curry is prepared with a careful blend of spices, white poppy seeds, fresh coconut and Kashmiri chillies. While it is heavily influenced by Portuguese cuisine, it has managed to retain native elements.Every Goan family has its own trademark recipe for xacuti. While some prefer it pungent and robust, there are those who like to keep the flavours mellow. The dish is usually made with chicken or mutton. Like with most other food items, there's also a vegetarian version. Come the monsoon, the mushroom xacuti , especially the one made using wild mushrooms (olmi), is almost a must-have in all households. But, such is the uniqueness of the dish; it embraces seasonal produce, without altering its own, earthy flavour. Much like the perfect relationship.The final taste of a xacuti depends heavily on how one begins the cooking process. Most versions call for dry roasting of the spices. In a frying pan with no oil, Kashmiri chillies, white poppy seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon, star anise, cumin, nutmeg cloves and a whole lot of other spices roast away until they start emanating a strong aroma. Freshly grated coconut joins the pan, too. The dry roasting brings out a golden tan on the coconut and spices, helping the final product get its deep, rich brown hue. All these ingredients are then ground together into a coarse paste in which the chicken or mutton pieces are then cooked till they are soft and tender.No matter how well you make your xacuti, most veterans in the kitchen firmly believe that it tastes better the next day. The overnight 'pickling' of the gravy makes the meat more tender, the spices more rounded and the consistency perfect to mop up with yet another Goan favourite, the good crusty old pao or a poie.""My mother used to let us have xacuti for breakfast the next day and somehow it would taste even better,"" recalls 54-year-old Alina, adding, ""With warm bread, there are fewer things that can beat that taste!""In fact, more than housewives, it's the taverns that serve some of the best xacuti. Sandesh Goltekar , who runs a hole-in-the-wall bar at Mapusa , says that his trademark xacuti recipe is a family heirloom that was passed down to him by his mother. To ensure his customers' plates are polished and fingers licked, he makes a rock crab xacuti. ""It has all of the goodness of my mother's recipe, but the flavour of the 'gavtti' crab just takes the xacuti to a whole different level,"" he says.While the xacuti is mostly about the protein used, there are also versions that include potatoes. While some may say that this technique is a legacy of the Portuguese style of cooking, some use the tuber to dull the pungency of the dish. A garnish of finely-chopped, fresh coriander leaves gives the dish that much more relish."

In 2015, potato sowing was conducted over 5.19 lakh hectares till December 5. This year, however, 10.17 lakh hectares have been sown by the same date. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.Currently, Gujarat ranks fifth in the country in production of potato. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily. While 23 lakh tonnes had come to the market in 2014, in 2015, that amount went up to 31 lakh tonnes, and to 35 lakh tonnes in 2016.Sowing of the crop picked up over last month, said officials, who reported that at least 5.51 lakh hectares had been sown in the last 20 days alone. If the trend continues, sowing will cross 12 lakh hectares - so far the highest area used to cultivate potato in Gujarat in any year.Mavjibhai Desai, chairman of the Deesa APMC attributes the exponential growth of potato farming to a number of reasons. ""This year, sowing has gone up with Narmada water reaching the northern parts of the state,"" said Desai, adding, ""The big increase in storage facilities has also drawn the attention of farmers to the cultivation of potato.""Desai said that in 2015-16 the top potato growing states - Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - had seen their production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, unlike other potato-growing states, Gujarat had registered an increase in potato production due to higher acreage.Better prices have also attracted farmers to potato cultivation, hold officials in the agriculture department, who said farmers received a good price last year for their yields, and this year, as compared to 2015, potato seed is cheaper and more easily available.In 2015-16, cold storage capacity went up by 6.25 lakh tonnes, with the current capacity at 22.5 lakh tonnes, said agriculture department officials. Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda.Potatoes from Gujarat are sent to Maharashtra and states in South India, and are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Mauritius."

Modi had announced his demonetization plan on November 8.Speaking at the function organized for various projects of Banas dairy in Deesa, Modi said people moving today with big bundles (of notes) will be caught and bank employees who are into illegal activities will be behind bars. ""All will be punished in the near future,"" Modi said. He further said the courts are getting many cheque bounce cases. With the use of digital banking, this problem will also end, the PM said.He called upon the farmers to take up honey farming in their fields along with other crops. This would not only bring about a 'sweet kranti' but even give a good income to farmers.Modi further called upon the dairy's office-bearers to jointly start a research centre for castor and isabgol. This centre should be responsible for research and value-addition to castor and its finished product. He further said that once he had asked Verghese Kurien to value-add to isabgol and Kurien had come out with IsabCool ice-cream. About Banaskantha people, he said that in the past, people from Banaskantha and Kutch had to migrate to Mumbai and Surat in search of jobs. However, once Narmada water reached the region, the farmers of the area had turned the tables on Mumbai and Surat.""Earlier, when I came here, farmers used to protest against me when I asked them to save water, but now the farmers have taken a lead in drip irrigation and the district is the top district when it comes to drip irrigation,"" Modi said.Now Banaskantha is the leading state in potato farming and even cultivation of pomegranate. He even talked about a farmer, Genabhai Patel, who is a leading pomegranate farmer.Congress workers protestOn the Palanpur-Deesa road, Congress workers made attempts to stop vehicles which were heading to Deesa for the Prime Minister's function. A group of workers who were protesting against demonetization even stopped the VIP convoy which was passing through. However, the police immediately swung into action and resorted to a mild lathi-charge. In Palanpur, Congress workers even threw ink on the poster of Prime Minister Narendra Modi."

The sluggish acreage is going to affect production of the early variety (jaldi aloo) that usually reaches the market by mid-November.But this was not expected when Bengal farmers, the second tuber producing state after Uttar Pradesh , had made huge profits in the last season. ""The November chill is ideal for potato farming. But where is the money?"" said potato grower Kinkar Das from Tarakeswar. Kinkar hasn't been able to sow potato seeds entirely in his 2.5 bigha land. ""I sowed in only 1.5 bigha, leaving the remaining for less expensive farming such as brinjals and radish,"" Das said.Gopinath Khanrui from Singur has major stakes this year. Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch. The Punjab Potato Seed Federation has already approached Bengal agents with a request to collect the money from farmers in old currency notes. West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances. ""I have intimated the state government about the proposal and am waiting for the response. I came to know that the Punjab government has endorsed the move.

The district, and especially Deesa, otherwise is renowned across India for bumper production of quality potatoes.Ironically, Genabhai told TOI that he is making huge loses after demonetization. A kilo of pomegranate used to sell at Rs 80 to Rs 120. After demonetization its price has fallen to Rs 35 a kilo. Modi had mentioned the story about the disabled Genabhai of Sarkari Goliya village who had approached him in 2005 with a coconut-sized pomegranate and had also narrated his success story during Modi's Krishi Mela campaign. Since 2005, however, Genabhai has met Modi almost eight times.""Demonetization can bring to an end several malpractices in the agriculture sector. Villagers are feeling hardship now but the wait will finally pay off in the long run,"" said Patel. He, however, also said that prices of pomegranate have dropped from Rs 120 to Rs 35-40 per kilogram.""We are eagerly waiting to tide over this period,"" said Patel. He said that while Modi was calling out for him at the Deesa meeting, he could not approach the stage because of the crowd. ""I am hopeful that more people will join me in pomegranate cultivation,"" said the farmer.Today Patel has 11 hectares of land on which he has sown 11,000 saplings. ""Usually, one hectare's yield gets around Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh,"" he said. His success had encouraged more than 250 farmers in places such as Dhanera, Deesa, Deodar, Tharad and Vavo to grow pomegranates. Genabhai's own village has more than 70% of its farmers growing the fruit. In December and May, traders from Delhi, Jaipur, Nagpur and Kolkata camp in Banaskantha to strike a deal for the fruit. Horticulture officer for Banaskantha district, Jignesh Suthar , told TOI: ""In 2005 the district had 200 hectares under pomegranate cultivation. Today this has grown to 632 hecatares."""

Creating dishes that suit as well as soothe, satiate as well as strengthen the palates of those undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or any other cancer treatment is challenging, say oncologists. But a few chefs and dietitians are trying to rise to the challenge.Last week for instance, a ready-reckoner of nutritional recipes for people fighting cancer authored by Mumbai-based food consultant Gitanjali Gurbaxan was launched in Chennai and is being made available at hospitals offering cancer treatments. 'Fight Cancer with Flavour' talks about strategies and recipes to combat the side-effects of treatment, which can prevent patients from eating healthy. ""Cancer patients often struggle with compromised immunity and body tolerance to foods reduces, cutting down on most nutrients. These patients require more protein than usual as without enough of it, the body has a lower resistance to infection,"" says Gurbaxan.Dr S Subramanian, oncologist and chairman at VS Hospitals , says, ""We see more than 100 patients a day for radiation therapy and an equal number for chemotherapy, and they complain that they just don't feel like eating. We have kept this book at the hospital so patients can get tips on things like how to make soups and desserts,"" says Dr Subramanian. Gurbaxan's book, published by healthcare company Boehringer Ingelheim India, even suggests innovative dishes such as a dahivada or upma smoothie or a chikoo phirni (where one can substitute milk with soya milk or fruits such as custard apple).In Mumbai, macrobiotic chef Shonali Sabherwal says it was when her father was being treated for prostate cancer a few years ago that she understood the importance of nutritional intervention. Apart from her customised cooking workshops, Sabherwal even goes into clients' kitchens and helps them prepare meals that are nutritionally aggressive and appealing to the senses.""Macrobiotics looks at food as medicine. We build immunity through diet. For instance, one of the dishes we recommend to non-vegetarians patients is koi kuku, a slowcooked, completely blended soup made with whole fish including bones, whole grains and vegetables. Every sip is packed with protein and nutrients,"" says Sabherwal.She teaches people what to cook based on the type of cancer they have and the stage. ""For cancer of the pharynx, I recommend soupy broths, blended with whole grains, so the power-packed meal can be sucked in through a straw,"" says Sabherwal.Chemotherapy kills taste, while radiation leaves a metallic taste, says Sabherwal, so she works with herbs instead of spices and draws flavour out of vegetables by methods like slow cooking. ""We use flavours patients are familiar with or relish. For instance, if they like Italian, we infuse the flavour of basil into the dish so the patient can get the aroma of Italian food even though it looks nothing like the original,"" she says.The Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York recently began a study on designing customised diets for patients after assessing why they are not eating enough  whether nausea, difficulty swallowing or depression. Oncology dietitians have made suggestions such as mashed potatoes for those with severe nausea and vomiting; pureed, minced or full-liquid diets for those who have difficulty swallowing; adding olive oil, butter or lemon juice for those who complain of food having a metallic taste; and high-calorie, mood-lifting foods like pumpkin seeds for those with depression."

It was forwarded to the Union ministry of human resource development and then to the Union ministry of finance, which clarified that it did not provide financial assistance. The ministry advised Komal to seek an educational loan via web-based portal Vidya Lakshmi, a single window for students to access information and submit applications for educational loans provided by banks.Unable to do so, Komal sought the help of then-LU vice-chancellor SB Nimse. Komal had somehow managed to pay his first semester fee by then.

Mercurial Mamata is on a ""'s cash clean-up bid.Such is her determination that she was ready to shake hands with her arch rival CPM against Modi. Although the Marxists did not reciprocate, that didn't faze her. Nor did the refusal of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar  she had moved closer towards him in the last few months  to join her, dampen the. Didi immediately widely seen as a reference to Nitish  and reached out to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. She even put aside her anger against Samajwadi Party for betraying her to back Pranab Mukherjee for the post of President, to enlist UP CM Akhilesh Yadav in her campaign.And she has been raising the pitch constantly, demanding a roll-back of the entire exercise when other opposition parties have restricted their criticism to the manner in whichSo what makes Mamata so angry? Social media is flooded with posts saying it's a desperate bid by her to protect her ilk that has been hit hard by the cash clean-up. But, even if one doesn't discount the view, the argument applies to all political parties, including the ruling BJP. Then why is she alone being so edgy?It would be too early to jump to conclusions, because both Modi and Banerjee are moving by perceptions.Fact is, people across Bengal, from auto-rickshaw drivers to the salaried middle-class, hailed Modi's move the day it was announced.They saw it as a sincere attempt to book the crooks, politicians, real estate developers, a section of bureaucrats and professionals, who've been looting their hard earned money with impunity. Even people standing in long queues were ready to bear the short-term pain for the long-term clean-up. The public mood began swinging a week later, when the liquidity crunch hit households.Sales in kirana shops and local bazaars dropped, making households cut their expenditure and go for credit purchases. In villages, small farmers, at the end of the supply chain, have never had enough muscle to keep this credit business going for more than a week.The result has been a shift of business from local markets to malls. It hit the informal supply chain at a time when a large chunk of people in Bengal ekes out a living from this sector. Harvesting has got delayed by a week in Bengal's villages and sowing of the potato tuber has also suffered. Mamata is hoping to tap into this frustration and anger.Moreover, she seems to have got a sanction from a wide range of economists, including Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. Even a working paper prepared by the Tax Research Group of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) under the Union finance ministry shared some concerns.Mamata is thus playing a gamble to find for herself space in national politics, when other opposition parties are not too confident of the outcome in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Nitish already has problems with his ally Lalu Prasad; and, the Yadav family feud in UP has spilled out into the open. Congress too doesn't have the numbers to command the opposition course.Mamata is far better placed. She has decimated the Left, and BJP, though a rising force in Bengal, is still a distant second. Confident of winning at least 40 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections, the Trinamool chief is now banking on the growing public impatience among the farmer, the petty trader and the salaried class to turn the tables on Modi. It's not without reason that Mamata reached out to the city's biggest trading hub at Burrabazar the other day to talk to traders, many of whom voted for BJP in the national and assembly polls.Finally, Mamata sees BJP as her next opposition in Bengal  reason enough for her to up the ante against Modi. Both the leaders, it seems, are looking at a new polarisation in Bengal, and Mamata is doing it her way."

In distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. Since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.But in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.An analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and Delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since November 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. There has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Patna and Guwahati.Wholesale traders in Delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. So, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.As a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding November 8 and the fortnight following it. This should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. But that was not to be.Wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. In all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. In Delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.Onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. Okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. But at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.Onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices. ""This is the rate we are getting at the mandi. The wholesalers are making money, not us,"" said Mangat Ram, a vegetable seller in East Delhi who claimed that his sales had dipped since November 8."

The move has led to cardamom and potato sales from Bhutan to India dropping drastically as Indian traders have been struggling to arrange cash for making payments, informed persons familiar with the developments. Indian currency is used as legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan. Phuentsholing is the main land border entry point between India and Bhutan.Sufficient cash is not available for the export-oriented businesses in Phuentsholing market, according to the persons familiar with Indo-Bhutan border trade. Bhutanese traders ruethey get to withdraw only Rs 2,500 from ATMs in a day which is not enough. Most of the transactions are cash based.The price of cardamom mid-November hit a record low of 700 Ngultrum per kg, which was between 800 and 900 Ngultrum a week ago. Ngultrum is the currency of Bhutan. One Bhutanese Ngultrum equals One Indian Rupee Indian traders have informed their Bhutanese counterparts they would be able to import agro-products only after three months. Some Bhutanese traders have not been able to export any cardamom since November 8. Cardamom export has drastically gone down in Silliguri, which is a major market for Bhutan. If the trend continues the cardamom price will decline further and there is risk that exports from Bhutan will get further affected, according to informed sources.Similarly potato exports from Bhutan to India have also slowed down. Some Indian exporters also paid their Bhutanese counterparts in old currencies. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner. A free trade regime exists between India and Bhutan. Major items of exports from Bhutan to India are electricity, ferro-alloys, carbides, bar and rods, cement, copper wire, semi finished products of iron and non-alloy steel, Dolomite, gypsum, agri products such as oranges, cardamom and potatoes.Meanwhile, Bhutan's mineral exports to Bangladesh has also been affected. While Letter of Credits are being used for payments, transportation has been proving a challenge.Trucks from Phuentsholing and Samdrupjongkhar, on the border with Assam , take minerals until Burimari, border area between India and Bangladesh. Indian currency is required for logisticssupport in this trade which is currently not available in the market.Bhutan has been taking up the issue of currency ban with India ever since the PM's announcement on demonitisation as the Himalayan State is also being faced with the crisis of cash crunch. Nepal and Bhutan, two major recipients of Indian financial aid, have taken up with New Delhi the issue of demonetisation of high-value currency bills and the impact it could have on financial assistance to them.

(Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh)Wholesale vegetable and fruit prices have crashed due to the cash crunch in the market but retailers continue to hold prices to make the best of a situation in which buyers have cut back purchases.Every ahrtiya is ordering one-third of the supplies he used to because of the limited cash available with him. The retailers also do not have enough cash to pay for what they buy from the wholesalers. The cycle is moving on the strength of credit only. Most of us are giving 3-4 days credit, said Amarvir Singh, president of Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Sellers Association, Ludhiana.WATCH VIDEORasheed, an ahrtiya who works in Malerkotlas vegetable mandi that sends vegetables to mandis in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga and a large part of Punjab apart from Jammu, said, Cauliflower is available with me at Rs 3 a kg while potato coming from cold stores is available in the range of Rs 4-5 a kg. You can take a sack full of gobhi at the rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3 a kg from me and I am ready to give 50 kg aaloo in the range of Rs 200-250 a kg. Most ahrtiyas are selling at this rate only. Last week, wholesale cauliflower was priced at Rs 8-10 per kg. Carrot, which was available at 20 a kg, is now priced at Rs 10 in wholesale market and methi and palak are available at Rs 5-6 a kg against the previous rate of Rs 9-10 a kg in most mandis of Punjab.Amarvir said, A box of apple is available at Rs 500 against the previous price of Rs 600. Almost everything is cheap. Retailers are buying it cheap from us. What prices they are selling, we have no idea.The worst hit are farmers who have to sell the produce at dirt cheap prices as there is no point stocking perishable vegetables. We are sending our full stock to mandis as we have no choice. We cant hoard, said Amarjeet Singh, a vegetable grower from Bhurrekalan village of Ferozepur. A few farmers near Hussaniwala are giving a carrot bag of 50 kg for Rs 200 only as they have lost hope of getting good prices and hence are planning to sow another crop in their fields.WATCH VIDEOI was happy with the move of demonetisation but it has affected my own crop, he said.However, in retail market, cauliflower is available for Rs 20-30 a kg, carrot for Rs 25-30 a kg. Potatos are available at Rs 25-30 a kg.It is difficult to go to the wholesale market to buy vegetables. So we have no choice but to purchase from the vendor at his prices. Moreover, we are buying just half a kg instead of usual one kg because of cash crunch, said Kiranjeet Kaur, a housewife from New Model town.Manjeet Kaur, another homemaker, said, I am buying vegetables on credit from my vendor and I pay him after 2-3 days. I have not done this before, but I have no choice. It will take time for the notes of smaller denomination to get circulated in market.Harjinder Singh, a vegetable vendor who sells saag, methi and mooli everyday in Pakhowal road area, however, said, People are giving me cash and my work is going on. Most of them are buying in the range of Rs 50-60. So I am not facing much problem.Rasheed, however, said, We are following a wait-and-watch policy and are hoping that cash will flow in market in the coming few days.

The park should contain a section on current agrobiodiversity and another section on rare, endangered and threatened species (RET). It should also have a genetic garden of biofortified crops developed by natural selection and by breeding such as moringa, sweet potato, amla, tamarind and similar crops, he said.Linking food, nutrition securitySwaminathan stated that the aim of the park should be to help promote Farming System for Nutrition to provide nutritional remedies for malnutrition maladies.

But someday, I will perfect it!I love sea food and I can live on it, especially garlic flavoured prawns; some delicious sea food on a plaintain leaf while sitting on the floor at my home with loved ones. Blissful, really! And an extra spoon of butter maybe? My favourite ingredient has always been butter. It can take your dish to another level of delicious!

(smiles) I was very young when I began to appreciate the art.I would help mother make chappatis, dosas and chutneys too! I continued to follow her recipes for a while, then began to learn from senior chefs at work before I began to experiment myself. Once, I tried a dish with polenta pasta and fish. Instead of using cornflakes as crumbs to cover the meat, I used polenta pasta. It came out well and the crispiness lasted for a long time! I also cooked in a silver foil pouch which caused every ingredient to retain their individual flavours.Experimenting with food can bring a lot of surprises!Heres another tip. You must always have your curd rice cold. Try this: Add Sauteed ginger, small onions, chilli and curry leaves to the curd rice mixture and serve warm. The flavours of ginger and shallot will be different and you will love it!"

Potatoes, which according to quality were fetching wholesale prices between Rs4 and Rs11 per kg, just a week ago, are now being sold at Rs1.5-Rs6 per kg. In the retail market, prices of potatoes have climbed down from Rs18-Rs22 per kg to Rs11-Rs15 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year at this time, potato prices were at Rs8 to Rs10 per kg, but this year it has dropped to Rs1.5 per kg. The potatoes we are getting now are local potatoes, which are from cold storage.""Speaking on the price drop of potatoes, Kishorekumar Lachhmandas Paryani, a trader in APMC, Ahmedabd, said, ""The old stock is being released from cold storages thus leading to the drop in prices."" Paryani said last year's crop was bountiful and thus the amount of potatoes stocked in cold storages was higher than usual.""Old stock will continue to be released for another month until the new potato crop starts arriving,"" said Paryani.Retailers, however, are of the opinion that there will be no further price drop, and that prices have stabilized.Richa shah a homemaker from Satellite said, ""I don't know whether potato prices will remain low in the coming days, and so I have decided to make and store potato wafers, which I usually do on arrival of the new crop."" She was happy that prices of most vegetables have dropped.Farmers in the state had received good prices for their crops in April 2016 despite 15% increase in production.

Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation , as measured by the wholesale price index rose annual 3.2% in November, slower than previous month's 3.4%.The softening in WPI inflation comes close on the heels of retail inflation easing to a two-year low of 3.6% in November. The government revised upwards the inflation for September to 3.8% from the previously reported 3.6%.The move to scrap some high value currency notes has dented consumer demand and hurt industries and there have been demands for a cut in interest rates to boost demand.The latest data showed food inflation slowed to 1.5% in November, compared to 4.3% rise in the previous month. RBI relies largely on the retail inflation measure although it takes into account all price data, while finalising monetary policy.The WPI data showed vegetable prices slid 24.1% in November, while onion prices contracted 51.5%. But some pressure points were visible as wheat prices rose 10.7%, potato 36.9% year-on-year and sugar 31.7% during the month. The fuel, power and light index rose 7% in November, up from previous month's 6.2%.""WPI inflation has come at 3.15% due to subdued food prices. However, we expect the rate to hover around 4% mainly due to firming up of core inflation and a rise in food prices once the base effect weakens. Also the rabi crop will be critical in driving future prices as the present cash crunch has slowed down the rabi sowing especially for wheat,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said."

Even at the Mantralaya  from where Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's administration has been trying to implement Modi's dream in Maharashtra  you need cash for light refreshments.While state officials say all departments will eventually offer the e-payment option, there is no common deadline or even an urgency to make the switch.Mirror correspondents Makarand Gadgil, Yogesh Naik, Lata Mishra and Iram Siddique visited the Government Book Depot and Publishing House at Charni Road, the state's administrative headquarters, the Wadala RTO, the Fort property registration office, SETU office , JJ and St George Hospitals and Mumbai Central Bus Depot for the test drive. They tried to avail different services and make purchases there through e-payments, but were asked to pay cash.At the 'DigiDhan Mela' in Delhi on Friday, Modi appealed to citizens to carry out five digital transactions from January 1 to help the country to move towards a cashless economy.

Saurashtra has less water available this year because it received less rainfall this monsoon,"" said Mahesh Vadodaria , secretary of APMC Gondal, which is among the few market yards prominent for its coriander trade.Saurashtra's 138 dams have just 1,078.25 million cubic metres of water, which is about 42.50% of the 2,537.07 MCM capacity.However, this is still 86 MCM greater than last year. Officials pointed said of the one lakh hectares sown with coriander, around 90%  some 92,000 hectares was in the Saurashtra region.Chairman of APMC Unjha, Gaurang Patel , said that the quality of cumin seed produce will also suffer as this year, as winter has not set in properly. The cumin crop arrives in February and with December almost gone, the good winter needed for a quality crop is missing. Cumin has been sown on some 2.26 lakh ha against 1.9 lakh ha last year.The acreage sown with potato is also at an all-time high of over 1.1 lakh ha, compared 1.07 lakh ha last year, agriculture experts said. In 2015, potato was sown on 51,900 ha till December 13. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected. Gujarat currently ranks fifth in the country in potato production. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily."

The cool weather is not kind to those with joint and bone problems. Though doctors say little can be done to avoid the ill feeling, precautions can be taken to ease it. From keeping oneself warm to making sure one gets enough exercise, inflammation can be controlled if attention is paid.Consulting orthopedic surgeon Dr Rajesh Badiyani said people already suffering from arthritis or other orthopedic disease are more prone to morning stiffness.""For many people winter is welcoming, but for arthritic patients it can be a pain. The weather affects them differently i and it is different from person to person,"" a he said while suggesting that exercising, walking and moving about are the best way to ensure that joints don't stiffen. Dr Prashanth Agarwal , consulting orthopedic, Apollo Hospital , said, ""In some people, frigid temperatures may worsen inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and joint pain, affecting the hips, knees, elbows, shoulders and hands.""Researchers aren't sure why cold weather makes us so stiff and sore, but one the ory , based on a small study , is that inflamed joints swell as barometric pressure drops.The swelling irritates the nerves around the joints, causing pain. ""There is also less supply of blood to the peripheral regions of the body due to which one's joints become stiff, causing pain,"" he said.To keep bones less painful, doctors suggest exercises. Being a couch potato is bad for the joints. Exercises help lubricate them to prevent pain. Walking can reduce joint pain and stiffness, keeping people flexible. ""Exercises can boost a person's mental and physical state. Stretching and exercises with light weights are good, as they strengthen the knee muscles and improve flexibility ,"" added Dr Agarwal.Apart from starting your day basking in the sun, it is also important to include foods rich in vitamins in your diet.""Foods like spinach, cabbage, tomatoes and oranges are rich sources of vitamins and minerals. These vitamins play a vital role in the production of bone cartilage and tissue,"" said a doctor."

But no sooner had the effect of heat and smoke on meat been discovered, than it altered the complete outlook towards victuals.Being a port city and the gateway to eastern India, Kolkata played an important part as a British-ruled state. Metiabruz was the place where Wajid Ali Shah , the last of the Mughal emperors, was placed under house arrest but was granted access to all his kingly pleasures, especially the indulgence in cuisine. It's the marrying of these two cultures that the barbecue started evolving in Kolkata.""Barbecues have always been considered status symbols, something which reminds of outdoor locales, large open spaces,"" says Vijay Malhotra, ITC Sonar executive chef. ""The baganbaris or farm houses of Kolkata's affluent class offered a perfect setting for barbecue; a slice of British aristocracy got imbibed into the social Indian thread.""Winters are perfect for barbecue. The chill makes the fingers go cold but the mere touch of hot food brings warmth, both physical and psychological. Barbecues are best had immediately off the fire, when it is smoking fresh. So, what makes a great barbecue? First, the freshness of the meat and ingredients; second, the quality of heat; and third, the marinade. While the first is pretty obvious, chefs recommend use of wood charcoal and not coke to stoke the fire and also smoke the meat while it's cooking.""Traditional barbecuing requires indirect, consistent low heat and longer cooking times.Having a well-made cooker, grill, or smoker that uses charcoal or wood as the heat source is essenP tial. When it comes to lighting a fire, once can use paraffin wax cubes, a chimney or a charcoal starter torch. To keep things as natural as possible, don't use lighter fluid,"" says Lalit Great Eastern executive chef Madhumita Mahanta.There are various types of ovens available in the market but the popular ones are barrel and drum, offset, and bullet-style smokers. One has to be careful with the cheaper models because if they aren't airtight, unwanted oxygen airflow can cause undesirable temperature spikes.While cooking over the fire is fun, it is the behind-the-scene marinating that is key to a well-made barbecue. Chefs advice marinating at least six hours before the barbecue for meats, and a couple of hours for fish and shrimp. One also has to ensure an acidic medium -such as natural vinegar or lemon juice -in the marinade to break down the proteins and fat for faster cooking.Since ovens don't have a thermostat to control the heat, barbecuing requires care. From the initial searing of the meat at medi um heat to subsequently regulating the cooking process to cook it to the core is the trick to a good barbecue, say chefs. ""One can do a barbecue with different varieties of meat or fish, but it is best not to try them together be cause fish gets cooked quicker than chicken which, in turn, cooks faster than red meat,"" says Route 17 The Stake house chef Sanjay Sarkar.There is another essential ingredient to a great barbecue, and that is a good gathering. A barbecue is a super idea for a party or picnic as it can be cooked outdoors on a rack-over, on open fire or on a special appliance.So, what are you waiting for? The weather's per fect, so crank up the heat and get the meats roasting.Barbecue tipsBarbecues are best done outdoors, though nowadays there are a number of LPG-operated barbecue stations for indoor cooking. But you won't get the same taste and flavour in those barbecues because of the absence of smokeFor outdoors, never set up the barbecue under a canopy or tent. Always ensure that the wind never blows into the barbecue and the person doing the cooking does not face the wind because ash and charcoal splinters will then fly into his face, making it difficult to stand and cook. Wind from any other direction is goodBarbecue essentialsCharcoal grill, wire mesh or racks, skewers and tongs If the meat is being skewered, skewers should be square, rather than round.This will assist in rotating the skewers for even cooking on all sidesIf the cuts of meat are flat, a metal mesh should be used and the diameter of the mesh rods should be at least 6mm. This will ensure good grill marks on the food being cooked and also act as a good medium for transmitting even heat to the meatsAccompanimentsThe typical accompaniments will be a nice jus which can also be used to baste the meat a bit, to impart flavour and keep it moist. A jacket potato with sour cream will go well any day, though mashed potatoes go equally well. Corn on the cob finished on the grill works wonders as an accompaniment. A thick-cut slice of crust bread, buttered and grilled on the barbecue, will mop up the accompanying sauce."

The CM, however, kept mum on the exact number of new districts.While presenting the report card of his government before the party's election committee on Monday, Rawat said, ""We have created new tehsils and blocks across the state in the past two years. Our next step is to focus on formation of new districts.""Rawat added that the creation of new districts was not a ""political experiment"" but was aimed at better governance.""Our government has not created any block or tehsil in a haphazard manner. The new districts will also be carved systematically. All formalities in this regard will hopefully be completed in the beginning of 2017,"" said the CM.Calling the formation of new districts a ""major commitment"" of Congress, Rawat said that the move was delayed as the state plunged into a political turmoil that lasted for months.Rawat was referring to the imposition of central rule in the state after nine former Congress MLAs rebelled against the government on March 18 when the appopriation bill was being passed in the assembly.The CM did not mention how many districts would be formed in the hill state, which currently has 13 districts. The number of districts that would fall under Kumaon division or Garhwal division is also not known.The previous BJP government in the state had recommended formation of four districts - Yamunotri, Kotdwar, Ranikhet and Didihat.The creation of new districts has been a political hot potato with administrators saying that the small state can ill afford to go for creation of more administrative units as it would be a burden on the state's exchequer.Political experts in the state, however, said that creation of new districts will result in better administration at local level which may win brownie points for Rawat in the assembly elections. ""More districts will allow for better governance for local residents. This may help Rawat and Congress win votes,"" said a political analyst on condition of anonymity."

These are A-grade big potatoes that he usually sells at Rs 11 per kg. Had you been five days early, he said, you would have got cauliflower and brinjals too - for free.So what's the catch? Sadly for Prasad, the offer is as unconditional as it is tragic.Like many other farmers here, in the potato belt of Uttar Pradesh that starts near Mathura, about 150 km from Delhi, Prasad has little choice. He can either abandon his crop at cold storages or plough it into the ground as cash appears to have vanished from the market ever since the government on November 8 announced withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as legal tender, rendering invalid 86% of India's currency.A rich crop of potatoes is dumped along the roadside and sacks of potatoes abandoned outside cold storages in the potato belt as farmers are not finding buyers in the mandis.Even if there are some buyers, the rates have crashed, making it uneconomical for the farmers to pay transportation costs and take potatoes to the mandis.Kunwar Raghavendra Singh, former zila panchayat member in Raya, said the farmer is getting a rate of Re 1 per kg.Every year, farmers sow potatoes between October 20 and 30. When the new crop is ready around January end, they sell roughly 20% of the produce in February and the rest is sent to cold storages to be released slowly when the rates get higher.The rates average around Rs 600-800 per katta (a bag of 52 kg). The farmer pays Rs 100 to the cold storage owner for storing his crop. So he gets Rs 11-15 per kg. Prasad, a resident of Sesu Nangla village in Raya, had kept 132 bags in Mansarovar cold storage on Mathura-Aligarh road. ""I am getting no rate right now. For my potatoes I was getting Rs 8 per kg before 'notebandi'.But now it is useless. I have to pay Rs 105 per bag to the cold storage person and then add to it transportation costs. What I would get is just Re 1 per kg in a mandi,"" he said.So Prasad is now selling potatoes to gowshalas. He is getting a measly Rs 50 per bag of 52 kg. ""Rest I will distribute for free in the village,"" he said.Just like Prasad, Nekram of Nagla Amrua village had kept 515 bags of potatoes in Brijwasi cold storage at Raya on Mathura-Aligarh road. He hasn't gone back to claim them. ""I would have to pay the cold storage person for something I cannot sell.What is the point?"" he said. The potato belt supplies to big markets in Jaipur, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Kanpur and Lucknow. With the markets running out of cash, the potatoes are useless.In Sadabad on Mathura-Aligarh road, cold storages have been saddled with thousands of unclaimed potato bags. Pradeep Kumar Singh, owner of Om Sheetgrah , said, ""I have about 5,000 potato bags lying unclaimed. These are farmers who owe me money from before. But what do I do? Everybody is in distress.""The cold storages are shut down mid-November for annual maintenance. Singh ran his facility for an extra month so that he could help the farmers already in distress due to demonetisation But now he has had to dump all the bags outside the cold storage. ""We have dug up a huge pit on the cold storage grounds to dump the produce,"" he said.Just a few kilometres from Singh's cold storage in Khandauli block, farmers have been ploughing their produce in the ground. ""What do we do? We carry these potatoes and vegetables to the market to find no buyers.Even transporting and loading them needs labourers. It is additional cost. We use what we can,"" said Moni Singh of Kharwa village. His neighbour let his cattle out to graze on the dumped vegetables and then ploughed the remaining into the field. ""What else? They are useless,"" he said.Prominent farmer leader and Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti national president Pushpendra Chaudhary said, ""The potato farmers have been ruined for the next two years. The markets would not recover even for the sale of rabi crop. The Modi government should at least write off loans of farmers."""

These five firms have combined sales of nearly Rs 3,700 crore, that is higher than Nestle's Maggi , and a few of these firms are larger than Kellogg 's in India.What about the multinationals?GSK Consumer posted negative sales growth in 2015-16 while Pepsi-Co's food division and Mondelez both grew 4%. Experts and company insiders attributed local players' growth to lower price points, increased distribution and conversion from unorganised market.""We have kept our overhead costs low so that our products remain affordable,"" said Chandu Virani, promoter of Balaji Wafers that posted a 14% sales growth last fiscal at Rs 1,440 crore. ""Also, bringing healthier variants and expanding in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh helped,"" he said.On an average, regional snack brands offer 30% higher volume than multinational rivals at similar price points, especially in highest selling price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10.According to market researcher Euromonitor, sweet and savoury snacks have grown by 26%, highest within packaged food segment between 2010 and 2015. About four years ago, packaged namkeen had replaced western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks as the largest segment within branded salty snacks market.""Domestic manufacturers are increasing their distribution and penetration into rural India and have launched smaller packs at lower price points,"" Euromonitor said in a recent report.The research firm expects the salty snacks segment to surpass biscuits with sales of nearly Rs 35,801 crore by 2020, up from Rs 19,151 crore in 2015.Funding from private equity funds helped domestic snacking firms to expand their reach and market their products more aggressively, experts said.""There has been an impetus on brand building and geographical expansion by these regional firms. Their variants launches have been faster compared to large food companies,"" said Devendra Chawla, president, food & FMCG, at the country's leading retailer Future Group.Prataap Snacks, maker of Yellow Diamond chips, was backed by Sequoia and has filed papers for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise Rs 400 crore.The company, which clocked 35% growth in sales last year at.`758 crore, recently roped in actor Salman Khan to promote its brand. Nearly two years ago, private equity fund Lighthouse Funds had invested Rs 125 crore in Bikaji Foods while WestBridge Capital Partners picked up a 25% stake in DFM Foods that sellssnack foods under the brand Crax.It may be difficult for these domestic players to maintain their growth momentum though as larger rivals are entering their turf with similar pricing and products. Parle Products, ITC and PepsiCo have all launched similar range as smaller regional players in the past few years.""No doubt, regional brands offer better value for money. But as we enter their region and expand our portfolio, their growth rate might taper off,"" said B Krishna Rao, deputy marketing manager at Parle Products."

Farmers in rural MP, it appears, faced lesser hardship.They managed to sow their lands, but with a slight delay due to the cash drought. According to official figures, the area sown this season has increased by 1.7 lakh hectares compared to last year. ""Farmers don't have much to do with cash.Compared to cities, things are better in the villages,"" said agriculture production commissioner Prem Chand Meena.

But small farmers have no option but to struggle,"" he said. The cash crunch has created problems in rural MP. About 15 residents of Sheikhpura village in Sehore are jobless because the tile factory that employed them has stopped working."

In the retail market, onion prices have increased from Rs 10 a kg to Rs 15 a kg after demonetisation."

If the cash crunch led to a drastic fall in price of fish and vegetables in the last few days, perishable items disappeared all of a sudden on Wednesday. A few of the traders who had dared to hoard them sold the items at a premium.""Initially, there was a distress sale by retailers as there was no flow of cash. The system virtually ran on credit. Now, there is a supply shortage and the flow of cash led to the rise of wholesale and retail prices. The trend will continue for next few days till the liquidity crunch is over and supply line is stabilized,"" said Prasanta Khan, a wholesale supplier.The problem in supply line, however, persists. Payment to transporters is still an issue. Moreover, the credit line from the wholesalers to retailers continues to swell. This has adversely affected the market dynamics. Fish wholesalers, on the other hand, could not pay back bulk suppliers. ""The currency crunch has disrupted the entire supply chain,"" said Ankur Modal of Behala fish wholesale market. ""The retailers are not confident of off-taking pricey varieties lest they are not,"" said Amar Das, Fish Merchant Association secretary at Lake Market.The vegetable supply remains steady in most of the markets, yet prices rose significantly.

Old stock that was harvested in April-May is getting exhausted and there has been an unusual delay in fresh arrivals causing rates to rise.Prices at APMC Vashi spurted from Rs 8-10 on October 28 to Rs 10-12/kg on Monday. The supply crunch is gradually reflected in the retail market. Onions are selling for Rs 14-20/kg compared to the pre-Diwali slab of Rs 12-15.On Monday, the bulb sold for Rs 15 in Apna Bazar in Bandra, while shopkeepers in Andheri Lokhandwala charged Re 1 more. In Colaba, the rate at Sahakari Bhandar was Rs 14.50 for onions sold loose and Rs 13.50/kg for bulk packages of 5 kg. In Mulund, however, shops along L B S Marg sold old onion for an exorbitant Rs 30/kg and the new damp crop for Rs 25.Experts at APMC Vashi said 25% of recent supplies were found to be of inferior quality. The Mumbai market revived from a supply crisis on Monday with substantial arrivals from Hubli in Karnataka, besides Nashik. ""We got 225 truckloads which helped stabilize the rising price. Over 50% of supplies came from Hubli, the rest came from Nashik. Prices will come under control once the new crop hits the market by this month end,"" said Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion-Potato Traders' Association.After Diwali, there has been a shortfall in supplies at the wholesale market as the old stock is running out. Due to 'heavy rain' in the onion-producing areas with an extended monsoon, the ripening of the kharif crop was reportedly delayed. ""This year, the old stock became wet and the new crop has been delayed. Prices may rise until the fresh crop hits the market,"" said a trader.Consumers have also been feeling the pinch. The season had witnessed the lowest price at Rs 2/kg in wholesale and Rs 8 in retail with a glut that began during the monsoon. ""We enjoyed a few months with afforda-ble prices, but now onions are becoming expensive again,"" said Nitesh Gurav , a consumer.In Lasalgaon, the wholesale price increased by 22% to Rs 825/quintal on Monday compared to Rs 675 last Friday. The arrival of the new crop has started, but in small quantities. At present, 98% of all arrivals are of the summer crop and the remaining 2% of the kharif crop. It will take more than a month for arrival of kharif onions to be regularized. Jaydatta Holkar, Lasalgaon APMC chairman, said, ""Prices had fallen to Rs 300-350/quintal in September because of the rise in supply. Now, more demand than supply has caused rates to rise ; summer stock is getting over."""

Those who could sell them can't access the money in banks because most of the rural branches do not have adequate cash. The cash crunch has led to a 10% fall in 100-days' work. Potato acreage has taken a hit with funds locked up in state cooperative banks. These are some of the features in rural Bengal that is yet to recover from notebandi. Farmers across the state are all ears for another set of announcements from the PM on December 31, if that hastens a change in the 50-day nightmare.The cash-backed informal trade system has been hard hit in the process. Here are some figures. Man days under the MGNREGS have suffered a decline by a lakh compared to the previous years. According to Hooghly DM Sanjay Bansal , the administration could create 6.73 lakh man days till December 15, 2016 against a high 7.27 lakh man days created during the same period in 2015.It is two lakh less in Malda. A reason for this could be the slump in post-harvesting activities. Plantation labourers in Dooars are the worst hit. Tea garden owners and bank officials gave a report to the Union minister of state S S Ahluwalia at a meeting held in Siliguri. They all urged the minister to come to their rescue because payment has suffered badly due to the cash crunch.Farmers who take loans during this part of the season can't access the state cooperative banks even due to dearth of funds. All the 347 Samabay Krishi Unnayan Samity (SKU) in the district were promised Rs 150 crore to facilitate farming of rabi crops including potato. They have received Rs 47 crore so far. The salaried section in the villages -school teachers, panchayat employees, and other professionals -has run out of cash. In a recent meeting with the chief minister, UBI officials said that they are getting 60% of the assured new currency .These people have to travel to the district town to access funds from ATMs or withdraw cash from bank branches in district town. The Midnapore Municipality hasn't yet paid salaries to its employees.Sources in the banking circle said that there is hardly any money with regional rural banks for disbursement. There are 952 RRBs in the state sponsored by three banks -United Bank of India, UCO Bank and Central Bank. These banks cater to only rural Bengal. UBI as the convenor of State Level Bankers Committee in Bengal, has the maximum number of RRBs followed by other two.According to sources, the daily requirement of all RRBs taken together would be little over Rs 120 crore per day .However, the RRBs are getting only Rs 10-Rs 15 crore daily from RBI currency chests and their respective sponsored banks.""RBI is giving around Rs 8-Rs 9 crore while the rest is coming from the sponsored banks of RRBs. The sponsored banks too do not have much cash in hand. Only district co-operative banks got Rs 500 crore sanction for rabi crop out of which Rs 200 crore has been disbursed,"" added sources. Primary agricultural cooperatives in Murshidabad, can't access the fund they have in nationalised banks because the Centre's ceiling of weekly withdrawal of Rs 24,000. Some took seeds and fertilisers on credit directly from seed companies, but the small farmer could hardly do that. Learning it hard, many have started visiting rural branches after they were told that the Centre might transfer funds for various centrally assisted schemes directly to their accounts."

Other traders, especially farmers, have been severely hit by the non-availability of cash in the market. Sources said sales were down by up to 50% at Azapur Mandi as there was no money to pay to farmers, transporters and labourers.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, accompanied by his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee , will now hold a public hearing at the mandi on Thursday.""Arrival (of fruits and vegetables) itself is down by half as it's impossible to store everything in cold storage. Sales are even lower as people don't have purchasing power,"" said Metharam Kriplani, president, Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders . As a result, he said, the price of fruits and vegetables were down by at least 25%.""The relaxations announced by the central government have made no impact. Transactions worth crores of rupees take place every day; so, raising the daily withdrawal limit to Rs 4,500 hardly makes any difference,"" said Kriplani.A comparison of maximum and minimum prices from the start of the month to now reveals that there is a major drop in the prices of potato, capsicum, bottle gourd, cauliflower and cabbage. Mahender Sanpal, member, APMC, said: ""These are indicative prices, dependent on arrival in the mandi on a particular day and the quality of produce. Retailers are purchasing at usually the average prices and, as farmers are so desperate to sell, those prices have come down.""In east Delhi's Patparganj, Fateh Singh has had to slash prices at his vegetable stall.

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Barring a few minor transactions at the APMC yard, the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has seen business at the agriculture market coming to a juddering halt.The agents have had a hard time making payments to farmers, transport vehicles, porters among others. The closure of the market in Belagavi follows a similar move in Hubballi, and other districts in Maharashtra. On Wednesday, the onion bags that were brought into the market numbered just 300, while about 1,000 to 1,500 bags of potato arrived, while there was no sign of sweet potatoes. Wednesday, which is a market day, usually sees as many 250 to 300 loads of onion hauled in. However, local farmers who brought potato left home empty handed, since there were no buyers.Local buyers, who supply onions and potatoes to hotels and retail stores in the district, were seen purchasing the stock that left over from Saturday, only on the condition of getting Rs 100 and the new Rs 2,000 in exchange.A truck driver from Davanagere, Noorullah said, ""The commission agent has paid me using the demonetized notes, with which I can only refuel my lorry. But, I will have to use my money at hotels and mills.""Balappa Hulaji, a farmer from Mannikeri village, who had brought potatoes to the market said that he couldn't store the onions for long since they did not have cold storage. ""If it is not brought to the market, they will undergo decay. I will get my payment later, but I can at least sell my potatoes here,"" he said.President of the traders' association, Manohar Mungari said, ""The Market may resume from the next week, once the new currency notes are in circulation.""Secretary, APMC, BM Shrinivas said that there were no transactions at the market on Wednesday, since the agents' association called off the auction."

The transporters have refused to carry potatoes any more as the unpaid fuel bills are mounting.With fuel stations refusing any more credit to transporters, there is a chain reaction hitting transportation of potatoes.The retail price of the tuber declined on Saturday following the severe liquidity crunch. But it happened as the retailers sacrificed their margin of profit to facilitate faster offtake of the stockpile. ""But this dip at retail level will be temporary as both the wholesale and retail prices will rise, thanks to shortage of supply,"" Swapan Samanta, secretary West Bengal Potato Traders Association , told TOI.Price of potato (Jyoti variety) at the retail end dipped to Rs 18 from Rs 20-Rs 22 in some markets on Saturday. This was offered by retailers to encourage customers to buy more. However, the crisis will be felt in the retail markets soon because of the shortage in supply . The wholesale price of Jyoti and Chandramukhi was Rs 12 and Rs 22 respectively in Hooghly, the largest producer of potato in Bengal.According to Patit Paban De, member, West Bengal Cold Storage Association , 462 potato cold storages across Bengal still has stockpile of 13 lakh tonnes. Out of this, only 3 lakh tonnes will be used as seeds. The rest should have been out in the market. But sudden liquidity crunch has disrupted the system. Small farmers are not taking out potatoes they had hoarded in cold storages. Traders, particularly, transporters are feeling the heat.In Hooghly district alone, there are 161 potato cold storages which still have a sizeable stockpile. November 30 is the deadline for complete stock clearance. The new crop will be coming shortly. Potato prices have shot up since May as the production had dropped in Bengal, the second largest producer of the tuber.Traders and companies, however, expect the downward trend in the agriculture market to continue in the short term as the harvest season is on and the country is looking at a record khariff crop. ""The smallest player in the entire system, the farmer, is panicking. We expect prices to go down further in the short term,"" said agriculture economist Sarit Basu."

Skirted in the north by Panaji, in the south and west by the Arabian Sea and in the east by St Cruz, the rapidly developing Taleigao has evolved from a quiet village to one of the most sought after residential locations in Tiswadi.With its vast tracts of agricultural land wherein beauteous beads of paddy have cropped for decades, the village served as a granary of north Goa during the Portuguese era and has always been famous for pot-shaped brinjals, sweet potatoes, radish, tambdi bhaji, val, white and green amaranthus.As far as harvest feasts go, the village was officially accorded the privilege by the then Portuguese governor Afonso de Albuquerque to cut the first sheaves of corn and present it to the Almighty on August 21.The Portuguese chose to give the privilege of celebrating the feast to this village first, before the other villages of the then Ilhas de Goa, as a token of their indebtedness to the villagers. Taleigaokars, of the time, had lent their helping hand to famished Portuguese soldiers after they had been overpowered by the mighty troops of the then monarch, Adil Shah. It is said that the villagers would brave the sea and canoe up to Penha de Franca with food supplies to feed them.The harvest feast includes a procession accompanied by a brass band and a colourful ceremonial umbrella which culminates with a high mass at Sao Miguel Arcanjo Church. The celebration also commemorates the Festa da Espiga or Novidade, an auspicious time for the farmers as they're grateful for the bountiful crop for the season.The practice of dhirio was once common on festival days.Another prominent occupation of the villagers is that of fishing. ""Some people do both. To this date the Taleigao market is still run by the village folk be it for vegetables, fish or grain,"" said sarpanch Janu Rosario.Farming was such an intrinsic aspect of the village culture that when on August 21, 1961, the last Portuguese governor Vassalo da Silva inaugurated the Casa do Povo, one of the walls was adorned with a mural by noted artist Antonio Xavier Trindade that captured the agrarian lifestyle of the village. The Casa do Povo earlier houses a post office and the structure is currently in shambles.The parish church is dedicated to Sao Miguel Arcanjo (St Michael, the archangel) and was established in 1544 by the order of preachers called Dominicans. It is one of the oldest churches of Goa along with the Panaji Church, St Catherine's Chapel, Old Goa and St Francis of Assisi Church, Old Goa.The original inhabitants were the people of the Gawda community who were converted to Christianity by the Portuguese, some of whom were reconverted to Hinduism.

Already, in comparison to last week, prices have gone up by 10-20% (see box).Expressing concern, vegetable wholesaler at Galla mandi on Sitapur road Abhishek Yadav said he has stock to last only seven days vegetable left with him. ""Daily purchase of distributors from his shop is around 3-4 quintals but for the past four days it has reduced to 1 quintal,"" he said.Another wholesaler Rehan said, ""We have paid in advance for supply which is stuck midway.

Most strikingly , the data suggests that about 60,000 hectares of agriculture land have been converted for non-agriculture purposes every year in the said period.""About 80% of people engaged in agriculture are in rural areas of the state and their sole means of livelihood is farming. If the trend continues for another 10 years, the state could see a major food crisis,"" said KAPC chairman Prof T N Prakash Kammaradi , who recently submitted the study report to chief minister Siddaramaiah , seeking his urgent intervention to arrest the trend.The report accessed by TOI shows that nearly 113.54 lakh hectares of land was cultivated in 2005-06. This decreased to 101 lakh hectares in 2014-15.But what's more alarming is that most of this decline was seen in areas where oilseed crops and cereals are cultivated.While there has been a 52% decrease in land on which oilseeds like soyabean, sunflower are cultivated, areas where cereals like rice, ragi and maize are grown have shrunk by 13%. Land producing potato, a major commercial crop in Hassan district, has dwindled by 65%.The trend of losing farmland to ur banization has left farmers in the state a worried lot. ""The real estate boom around major cities will lead to a food crisis in the state in coming years. If land is to be used for anything other than agriculture, government's permission must be sought. However, most of our MLAs and MPs are hand-in-glove with these builders. It's they who determine the use of land, resulting in the mushrooming of construction on agricultural lands,"" alleged farmer leader Kuruburu Shanthakumar."

""We forecast demand two months in advance and plan accordingly. But panic has set in among consumers. They want to stock up on daily essentials.

""Earlier, it was 50:50. Now, digital payments account for 80% of our orders,"" he said.The increase in volume of orders was mainly due to new consumers coming online for the first time to shop for veggies. ""Demand for veggies has increased by three times, while for fruits, it has fallen. The average ticket size of Rs 300 is more or less the same, even now,"" said Albinder Dhindsa, co-founder at Grofers. ""Due to less cash available, small merchants are not able to replenish supplies. Finding change for Rs 2,000 note is also an issue, therefore the online rush.""Sales at hyperlocal e-grocers that sell everything from potatoes and litchis to toothpastes and moisturisers, are linked to stocks available at kirana stores and neighbourhood vegetable vendors. Many of them sell online through these websites. Therefore at present, the main hurdle for e-grocers is to bolster their supply chain so that they are able meet the spike in demand.Menon said Big Basket has started hiring more people and buying delivery vans. ""It will take us at least two weeks to get ready for the rush, since new people have to be trained and the vans have to be rigged with chillers and other paraphernalia,"" he said.Grofers, which mainly depends on small merchants who are selling on its websites, has extended a credit line of up to Rs 2 lakh to them. ""The main goal is to help merchants come back online,"" said Dhindsa. ""We have partnered with many brands as well to provide goods on credit to these small businesses."""

It makes a good combination with fefsa-hojri dal (lung and marrow dal) as well. This delicacy can be stored in the freezer and removed an hour before it is to be devoured. But, since the main ingredient for flavour - fresh green garlic - sprigs and pods included which is available only for about two months during winter, kachhu is prepared only during December and January for its authentic taste to remain intact,"" says Rashiwala."

And now, Chennai is poised to get its own such creative retreat. One that will be run completely by women burn survivors.""I wanted to start a cafe where writers, journalists and students can relax over a cup of coffee, read or pen something,"" says restaurateur M Mahadevan of his latest venture. So, Writers Cafe in Gopalapuram will just not have cosy furniture to lounge on but also shelves stacked with books and stationery by Higginbothams, which will also provide e-books on tablets, as well as a room where you can have meetings or get-togethers. Customers can browse through or buy books and are welcome to bring along their tablets or laptops.For the women who run the cafe, it is an opportunity to earn a living. G Parimala, 35, doused herself with kerosene in 2012 after a fight with her alcoholic husband. Suffering 25% burns, she had to undergo numerous surgeries. ""I tried to get a job as an assistant or data entry operator but people see my scars and reject me,"" she says. ""During training I was paid `8,000 and am happy I can work and support my daughter.""M Punithavalli, 29, who suffered burns after a kerosene stove burst in 2015, has a similar story . A former saleswoman, she found it difficult to get back to work. ""My relatives too treated me differently but now I am confident, and my husband is encouraging,"" she says.All the 10 women are part of The International Foundation for Crime Pre vention and Victim Care's (PCVC) Vidiyal project. ""It is a project for burn survivors of domestic violence, which was initiated at the burns ward of Kilpauk Medical College,"" says Prasanna Gettu, founder, PCVC.The organisation provides the women with physical and psychological support. Once they are healed, the women are brought to the centre in Anna Nagar where they go through physiotherapy and psycho-social therapy . ""We address the physical wounds and emotional scars inside them,"" says Gettu, adding that they also try to give the women vision and direction.The women have been training for six months at Winners Bakery. And now Swiss chef Silke Stadler has flown down to train them. The USP of the cafe, which has a confectionery and bakery, will be the Swiss fare. ""We will have dishes like rosti (crispy potato pancake) and flammkuchen (Alsace pizza),"" says chef Karan Manavalan. This is a part of Mahadevan's corporate social responsibility initiative -proceeds from the cafe will go towards Chennai Mission, his charitable organisation.The aim is to reintegrate these women with mainstream society. ""The message is -ditch your sympathy, we need your support,"" says Mahadevan."

Farmers said they have no money to transport the crop to mandis in other places or to keep their produce in cold storage. Since potato is perishable, the best option they had was to distribute it free, they said. They added that they had no money to buy fertilisers and other farm inputs because of cash crunch.BKU district president Sardar Gurmeet Singh said farmers dumped their produce outside the Vidhan Bhawan in the hope that the state government would take note of their plight and address their problem.Since reports of free potato distribution had been published in newspapers on Friday, people came with polybags and handbags to collect the vegetable. However, it also resulted in chaos as large quantity of potatoes was crushed by passing vehicles.People who collected potatoes said the government must provide cash to farmers so that their agriculture produce is not hit. ""I got plenty of potatoes but I am sad because farmers are facing problems due to lack of fertilisers and seeds,"" said Ambhuj Kumar.""We were without food for last two days as we had no cash.

In November 2015, the print was (-)2.04 per cent.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)24.10 per cent in November, saw deflationary pressure for the third consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)51.51 per cent.Pulse inflation continued to rule high at 21.73 per cent in November, according to commerce ministry data.Potato recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food inflation basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.The reading for manufactured articles was 3.20 per cent compared with 2.67 per cent in the previous month. The corresponding figure for sugar came in at 31.76 per cent and that of petrol 5.54 per cent.The WPI inflation for September has been revised upwards at 3.8 per cent against the provisional estimate of 3.57 per cent.The decline in wholesale inflation coincides with a fall in retail inflation, which hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent in November.The monetary policy committee headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel had earlier this month held interest rates steady and said demonetisation of high value currency notes could lower prices of perishables and reduce CPI inflation by 10-15 basis points by December.Even as RBI maintained 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017, it trimmed GDP growth forecast to 7.1 per cent, from 7.6 per cent, for the current fiscal."

However, orange exporters are now being affected by the demonetisation of high-denomination Indian currency notes.Bhutanese orange exporters rue that because of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in India, they are being charged high rates for boxes to pack their oranges in. Transporters are also demanding extra charges if paid in Ngultrum, currency of Bhutan.Orange exporters from Paro have been sending the fruit to India for the past decade. The yield and quality of the oranges this year are high but the demonetisation is affecting the business.A Bhutanese exporter, who wished not to be named, said the exporters have to pay ""miscellaneous"" and ""other unofficial bills"" in Indian currency. As an interim measure, the exporters have arranged with the transporters to pay in Ngultrum (Nu) with the assurance that they will be paid in INR once it is available.Exporters from Bhutan's Gelephu orange depot have been paying Nu 19,000 per truck to transport oranges till the Bangladesh border. But this year transporters are demanding more than Nu 20,000 per truck. The big oranges (meel) are fetching Nu 820 per box and the small oranges (keel) Nu 630 per box.Export of oranges started in November and lasts till February next year. Bhutanese officials point out that if Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA) were in place, Bhutanese trucks would be transporting oranges all the way to Bangladesh and orange exporters would not be paying Indian truckers inflated prices.Besides paying Indian truckers, orange exporters also need Indian currency to pay their labour and for boxes imported from India. Another fallout of the demonetisation process was the record low prices offered to potato farmers this year in Bhutan.India is and will always remain Bhutan's most important and easily accessible market but during emergencies, contingencies have to be in place to go directly to other markets beyond the neighbouring states, and perhaps even other countries like Bangladesh or Nepal, indicated officials in Thimpu."

Since no one was willing, he ended up buying chicken worth Rs 700.""I went to many shops, mainly those selling vegetables, but all declined. Their demand was simple: buy things worth Rs 800, and we will provide change. Not knowing what to do, I ended up at a meat shop and asked for 1kg of chicken, which costs around Rs 110. The seller refused too. Ultimately, I had to buy chicken worth Rs 700, besides vegetables. Since we are just two people in my house, we gave some chicken to our neighbour. One cannot have chicken for an entire week, but now we are forced to,"" Milind said.Aruna Kale, from Vimannagar , said she was facing similar issues.""Banks, whether public or private, prefer giving currency notes of Rs 2,000 stating that they don't have notes of lower denominations. This has led to problems, with only a few willing to give change even after so many days. In my area, vegetable vendors ask customers to buy huge amounts of vegetables and fruits if we want to break this note for change. Why should I buy 6kg to 7kg of potatoes when I don't need it? They have been asking us to spend at least Rs 800 if we want change for Rs 2,000. At last, I was forced to order food from a restaurant for Rs 500 to get change,"" Aruna, who stays with her family, told TOI.A vegetable seller at the Deccan market gave two reasons for this behaviour.""How are we supposed to give change for Rs 2,000 if one buys vegetables worth Rs 200 or Rs 300? If the cash problem and scarcity of Rs 100 notes is bothering people, it is a cause of worry for us too. It isn't a rule, but if one buys things worth more than Rs 600, it is good for us as giving change is easier since new notes worth Rs 500 have been introduced only now and are fewer in the market. One can always stock vegetables and since winter has set, it will not perish easily. Secondly, we have seen news items about fake Rs 2,000 notes already having entered the market. We just don't want to take a chance,"" he said.Sandeep Makode of Salunke Vihar said the crisis has resulted in people spending a lot unnecessarily.""Many shopkeepers now prefer e-wallet payments and don't want to take Rs 2,000.

58d82f02a3d24b75f27746ab,Fidel Castro made revolutionary mark on history,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Fidel-Castro-made-revolutionary-mark-on-history/articleshow/55633888.cms,2016-11-26,,The Times Of India,"Fidel Castro turned his back on a life of privilege to lead a left-wing revolution in Cuba +Castro, who has died at the age of 90 +I'm really happy to reach 80. I never expected it +HAVANA: The son of a wealthy landowner,that endured for decades and was shaped by his political cunning, keen sense of destiny and boundless ego., was at once idealistic and pragmatic, sharply intelligent and reckless, charismatic and intolerant.Critics saw in him a stubborn bully who violated human rights, jailed his critics, banned opposition parties and wrecked Cuba's economy.Admirers saw a visionary who stood up to US domination of Latin America, brought healthcare and education to the poor, and inspired socialist movements across the world.Even before leading the 1959 revolution that propelled Cuba toward communism and onto the Cold War stage, Castro saw greatness in himself.From an early age, he admired history's boldest figures, particularly Alexander the Great, and believed he and his rebels were part of that tradition.""Men do not shape destiny. Destiny produces the man for the moment,"" he said in 1959.Castro toppled the unpopular US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista by uniting a disparate opposition and outsmarting a bigger, better-equipped Cuban military.His alliance with the Soviet Union put him at the center of the Cold War, most notably when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took the world to the brink of nuclear war.He was a global celebrity, his beard, military fatigues and big Cuban cigars making him instantly recognizable.(Castro exhales cigar smoke during an interview.)He owed his prominence in part to geography. Looking to bolster an ally just 90 miles (140 km) from Florida, Moscow helped him build socialism by giving him billions of dollars worth of aid and favorable trade, from oil to tractor parts.But Castro also mined Cuban nationalism and Latin American pride, stirring resentment of US power and influence.He managed to preserve his revolution despite constant US hostility even when Cuba reeled from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, showing the vigor of a man who intended to die in office.Instead, almost killed by a serious intestinal illness, he was forced to step aside in 2006 and he formally handed over to his younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2008.In his final years, Castro wrote opinion columns for Cuba's state media but was rarely seen. His famously long speeches gave way to silence, at least in public, and comfortable track suits replaced the stiff black boots and crisp military attire.On December 17, 2014, Raul Castro cut a deal to restore diplomatic ties with the United States. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro offered only lukewarm support, raising questions about whether he approved of ending hostilities with his longtime enemy.Known by the militaristic title of ""El Comandante,"" in some ways Castro was always replaying the exhilaration of revolt, exhorting Cubans to fight one battle after another, from confronting US hostility to boosting potato production.He survived numerous assassination attempts and outlasted nine US presidents in power, seizing control of Cuba while Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House and stepping down during George W. Bush's second term.Throughout, Castro lectured Cubans.A magnificent orator who instinctively altered his cadence to fit the moment, he re-trod history and delved deep into detail about Cuban independence heroes, plans to ""perfect"" the revolution and the declared evils of US imperialism.Tall and physically commanding, fastidious in his attire, he often built to a crescendo of indignation, gesturing firmly with long-fingered, well-manicured hands.""We shall endeavor to be brief,"" he told the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, then set a record for U.N. speeches by talking for nearly 4-1/2 hours.Castro never allowed statues of him to be erected or streets to be named after him, saying he did not want a cult of personality. Nevertheless, the cult was everywhere. His image and words were posted on billboards and his name was invoked at every public event.Most Cubans, whether for or against him, refer to him simply as ""Fidel.""He was a night owl. He would keep foreign guests waiting until late at night and then summon them for talks. Even his critics would sometimes find themselves oddly charmed by such encounters.Tad Szulc, a biographer, called him ""Cuba's great master of political seduction.""(Fidel Castro, center, and his soldiers make a roadside appearance as they move toward Havana, in 1959)Born on August 13, 1926, Castro grew up as a privileged son on his father's plantation in the eastern village of Biran, where his playmates were children of impoverished workers living in thatched huts with dirt floors. He said the economic injustice he witnessed there inspired a life-long sympathy for the poor.He attended the Jesuit-run Belen School in the capital and then studied law at the University of Havana, plunging into the violent politics of the time and starting his drift leftward.Long-winded, intolerant and - unusually for a Cuban - awkward on the dance floor, he was not embraced by his fellow students at first but eventually emerged as a leader.He took part in an aborted 1947 plan to overthrow Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and was at a youth conference in Colombia when riots broke out and some 2,000 people died.After law school, he decided to run for Congress in 1952. When Batista staged a coup and halted the elections, Castro began plotting armed rebellion.In 1953, he led a raid on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. Dozens of followers died and he, Raul Castro and others were captured and imprisoned.""History will absolve me,"" he declared at his trial.Pardoned in 1955, he went into exile in Mexico where he met Argentine revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara . Together with Raul, they trained a rebel band that in 1956 returned to Cuba aboard an overcrowded yacht called Granma.(Fidel Castro (L) talking with Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.)Ambushed at landing by government troops, only 12 of the 82 rebels on board made it to the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains.Castro denied Batista's claims that he was a communist but decades later he told Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in a book ""100 hours with Fidel"" that by 1952, ""I was already a convinced Marxist-Leninist.""Whatever the evolution of his views on communism, he was determined to throw off American influence in Cuba. When US-supplied aircraft bombed his rebels in 1958, he vowed revenge.""I have sworn that the Americans will pay very dearly for what they are doing,"" he said in a letter to close friend and aide Celia Sanchez. ""When this war has ended, a much bigger and greater war will start for me, a war I shall launch against them. I realize that this will be my true destiny.""(Fidel Castro with Richard Nixon)Washington viewed him as a potential enemy even before his rebel army forced Batista to flee Cuba on New Year's Day, 1959.It took just two years for the relationship to unravel as Castro nationalized swathes of the economy and introduced a broad agrarian reform. Thousands escaped the island, starting what became a bitter bulwark of opposition in Florida.In April 1961, when his military crushed a CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, he declared Cuba socialist and allied himself with the Soviet Union.Moscow put nuclear missiles on the island in 1962, touching off a 13-day superpower showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis.In an Oct. 26 cable to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Castro seemed convinced the Americans would invade Cuba and suggested the Soviets ""eliminate this danger"" with an act of ""legitimate self defense.""Khrushchev felt Castro was advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike and rejected it, telling him he was satisfied with US President John F. Kennedy's pledge not to invade.The Soviets withdrew the missiles and Washington secretly agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, ending the crisis.The United States imposed its trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 and the CIA admitted trying to kill Castro in the early years of his rule.Plots or plot ideas included trying to get Castro to smoke a poisoned cigar and taking advantage of his love of diving with an exploding seashell, or poisoning a diving suit.Castro reveled in his status as an elusive target., not least having a neighbor - the greatest power in the world - trying to kill me every day,"" he said at a 2006 summit in Argentina, where crowds greeted him like a rock star.While the embargo was economically devastating, it allowed Castro to shift blame for chronic economic problems away from the system he built and onto the United States.He cast the fight as a David and Goliath story.Philip Bonsal, US ambassador to Cuba in 1959, later described Castro as a ""phenomenally gifted, erratic and unscrupulous autocrat who 'freed his country from American imperialism' only to reduce it to a satellite of Moscow.""In a country that was prosperous by Latin American standards but riven by inequality and illiteracy and with an unsavory reputation as a brothel and gambling-rich playground for Americans, Castro sought to build a socialist society.His government trained thousands of doctors and provided free schooling, changes that have endured well into the 21st century, even as the state's role in the economy was reduced in recent years.Those gains came at considerable cost to personal freedoms. Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the state's long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibia's independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.After the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castro's communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the ""special period"" for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cuba's economy.Little was known about Castro's personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leader's only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a ""caudillo,"" or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term. ""I am a kind of spiritual leader,"" he said."

He sold them for Rs 12 per kg. A week later, it was a dramatically different situation. The price had crashed to Rs 4 per kg. ""Nobody's picking up the stuff in the mandi now. Nuksan ho raha hai (I am suffering losses). The mandi guys are telling me that with shortage of currency, there's little demand at the retail level,"" he says.Another farmer, Virendra Dahiya, said, he had wholesaled the same vegetable for Rs 15 per kg at the mandi before the stunning currency measure announced on Nov 8 and has now been trading them for Rs 9-10 per kg.Those standing in the long queues before a PNB branch complain that cash comes and vanishes with the speed of a rumour.Currency shortage seems to have caused a ripple effect down the supply chain. And the consequence can be seen at the bottom of the pyramid.Ajaypal, who mainly grows vegetables over 16 bighas of land owned jointly by four brothers, is making adjustments to beat the blowback of notebandi, the term everyone uses to describe demonetization in these parts of rurban south-west Delhi.Another batch of cauliflowers would have been ready for the market in a couple of days. But the 46-year-old Jat farmer has stopped watering the plants. ""That would delay their growth. I want to hold on for a fortnight. Maybe we will get a better price after that,"" he says.A similar tactic to beat the falling rates has been employed by Jagbir Singh, a Jat farmer with 15 bighas of land in Asra, a village located in west UP's Hapur district. ""I will not harvest potato for 8-10 days. Let them stay where they are till the mandi rates improve,"" he told TOI last week.Once he has disposed of the cauliflowers and the radish, Ajaypal will sow tomatoes and peas. Like many in these parts with a cash flow problem, he is relying on the bond of traditional association that gets him seeds and fertilisers on loan. ""That's part of our dealings every year,"" he says. Dahiya says credit is part of every transaction in this urban village poised on the edge of south-west Delhi. ""Yahan to kirayedaar ka bhi udhaar chalta hai (Even the tenants pay you later,"") he says.Part of Ajaypal's land is fallow at the moment. He has just harvested jowar and now is ready to sow wheat. He's behind schedule by about 10-15 days. ""I will plant a late variety of wheat to compensate,"" the farmer says.Normally, at this time about 20 people would have been working in the field, says the farmer. But the delay means there are only two farmhands at work on Thursday after noon.Ajaypal pays them Rs 250 for a day's work. But he is unable to pay them in cash right now. Overall, he owes about Rs 4,000 to his other regulars who are now working elsewhere, he says. How much do the shortage of money and the losses bother him? His feelings are mixed. ""No 2 ke paise ko lagaam lag rahi hai (Black money is being brought under control),"" he says.Life is more difficult for Sharmila Devi, one of two daily wagers still working in Ajaypal's field. These days she carries vegetables home as part of her payment. Call it a form of barter or good old jugaad, adjustments like these keep the wheels turning for the marginal and the marginalized in times of the scarce rupee."

A 10-kg sackful of groundnut that she has earned as wages has ensured her survival as she bartered it for two kg of flour, a litre oil, some chilli powder, salt and jaggery and half a kg of potatoes and onions.""My saheb declined to pay wages in cash citing the cash crunch . Thank the lord that the local grocer is exchanging groundnut and grain that we got as wages for essential commodities so that we can survive,"" says Chauhan.After demonetization , the ancient practice barter system , colloquially called Sata, is witnessing a revival across the state. With cash scarce in villages, people are being paid wages in grain, milk, oil etc and are in turn exchanging this for eatables, provisions and daily necessities like soap, toothpaste, kerosene etc.Usman Hadadwala (65), who has run a grocery shop in Gathoda village of Himmatnagar for 50 years, says barter is preferred to credit. ""People buy oil, flour, spices, soap etc needed for daily use in lieu of 5 or 10kg of wheat, maize, bajra and groundnut that they get as wages. This ensures that the poor and their children do not sleep on an empty stomach,"" says Hadadwala.Rural folk are also using barter to exchange goods for services. In Abhrampura village of Savarkundla taluka in Amreli, barber Haka Mesuriya provides a clean shave and haircut in lieu of milk, grain and vegetables. ""Knowing how cash strapped people are, I do not insist on cash payment."" Here, Haresh Tempowala, is ferrying people in his tempo and is being paid in milk. In Valasana village of Mehsana district, sarpanch Vimla Parmar said people have taken to barter in a big way. ""With no cash in hand, women ask flour millers to deduct 500 to 700 gram of flour as a fee for grinding the wheat and bajra.

The shortage could be compounded by the fact that agricultural Rabi season is set to begin and farmers will require cash credit of over Rs 1,000 crore latest by December 8. Apprehensive of the possibility of currency shortage looming large, the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) has already sent out an SOS to RBI, asking the central body to infuse adequate cash by the end of the next week. The chief general manager of SBI, Partha Pratim Sengupta, confirmed cash withdrawal rate usually shot up in the first week of every month. ""Pensioners gets money in the first week. After the pension gets credited to their accounts, they prefer to withdraw most of it in cash. We hope money supply would go up next week, only then would the situation be under control,"" he said. The RBI, in its latest circular on November 24, advised banks to take appropriate steps to meet likely demands for cash by pensioners. The banking circles feel additional Rs 500 notes, adding up to Rs 450 croreRs 500 crore, would be required to care to customers in the next one week.A top SLBC official agreed that the liquidity situation had certainly improved after the second tranche of the new Rs 500 notes reached RBI but pointed out that the real test would be in the first week of December.""Sowing of Rabi crop has not started yet and farmers will have to start sowing potato by December 10. There is an urgent need of Rs 1,500 crore agro credit in the state, most of which has to be disbursed in cash,"" the official said. He added that SLBC had already briefed the RBI and the central observer about the scene. ""We are in discussion with the RBI. The central bank is also trying to organise more cash,"" he said.The president of All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), Rajen Nagar , also feared that trouble at banks, already grappling with low cash, could escalate at the beginning of the next month. "" Apart from pensioners, both state and Centre will divert a lot of cash to rural economy . There could be shortage of currency in the city,"" he said. Even Bandhan Bank MD and CEO C S Ghosh seemed concerned about the first week of December though he said the scene had drastically improved since last two weeks.An SBI official pointed out that withdrawal had started going up and another official indicated that the it could be 20%25% more in the first week of December.

With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day. The rate prior to demonetisation was between Rs 8 and Rs 9kg. But now with the shortage of the new currency, traders are insisting that farmers accept payment in old notes. And because farmers are refusing, they have slashed prices,"" an official from the market committee said.Farmers said since the auction had been stalled in these market yards for the past one week, they have had to throw a lot of their produce away as they cannot store this perishable item.

The programme was jointly organized by Vidarbha Industries Association and Lemon Ideas.The fast food chain has now become a success story which started off as a few stores present only in urban Mumbai and Pune. Making vadapav a brand, as Iyer puts it, was the intent behind Goli and has now grown to over 300 stores spanning 100 cities across 22 states since 2004.The business model is largely outsourced with aspects pertaining to production and logistics contracted to international companies. Iyer pointed out that the company which manufactures burgers for McDonalds is the same that produces the vadas (deep fried potato cutlet) for Goli.According to Iyer, not only has the product been well received at places outside Maharashtra where vadapav is less common but also in areas where the food is unheard of. ""My business has grown through word of mouth. A customer who loved my food actually opened a franchise in his hometown at Aurangabad,"" said Iyer.Iyer believed that the public might get bored of eating the same deep fried batter coated potato cutlet and thought diversifying the food would make the vadapav more desirable. Iyer said, ""To make it more appealing to our customers we introduced variants like mixed-veg, schezwan, corn and cheese into the mix and it paid dividends."" His stores also offer other items like misal and rolls apart from the staple.Running a business on a scale as large as Iyer's does come with challenges, he said. Maintaining a consistent service quality in every outlet is something Goli is proud of, said Iyer. There is much effort being put in to perfect the service, according to Iyer.Similarly, there are many areas within the entire operation that the company is still working on, said Iyer. ""We are concentrating a lot on logistics and production as demand for our product is steadily increasing,"" he said.Iyer has also received a number of enquires from overseas about opening franchises outside India. However, Iyer said there is still time to consider exporting the brand as there in much work to be done here.

The retail price of vegetables like potatoes has gone down by about 50% though demand remains more or less constant. As a result, apart from farmers, migrant labourers are hard hit by the sudden turn of events. According to traders, 60% of migrant labourers have returned to their home states.Rajesh Yadav, CEO, Agriculture Produce Marketing Community (APMC), Sahibabad wholesale vegetable and fruit market, said that 1,156 quintals of fruits were sold between November 1 and 8 while between November 15 and 22 the figure nosedived to 390 quintals.

I can see a bit of the 'Giffen paradox' in all this."""

They were fed up,"" Obama said as he wished the nation a Happy Thanksgiving , according to the US's National Public Radio ""Fed up"", of course, is a pun on 'feeding'. The joke is that people tend to eat a lot during Thanksgiving, confronted as they are by tables groaning with food.Thanksgiving staples are roasted turkey with a ton of 'sides' that include gravy, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and stuffing - which is a mishmash of shredded cornbread and anything else you want to throw in there. 'Thanksgiving leftovers' usually make up meals for almost a week after the holiday.Obama and wife Michelle serving Thanksgiving dinner at a retirement home.

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read | After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less.

And do you think we can do e-transactions when the mobile internet network is so weak in the village? he added.Consequently, the local grocer, chemist, tailor and gas cylinder seller are all using cash in their daily transactions.Khokh, PunjabNek Singh, who sells seeds and saplings  from potatoes to tomatoes, chillies and onions has not had a change of heart.Few weeks ago, the owner of the sprawling nursery had been critical of note-bandi. Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat.

The blockade of NH2 and NH37  the two lifelines of the state  by the United Naga Council (UNC) in protest against the creation of several new districts is still in place. The supplies brought in by the trucks are likely to ease the situation for a few days, but there is widespread fear that Manipur will slide back into hard times again.Read | Medical emergency in Manipur: 57-day blockade cripples health servicesScarcity of essentials has become a way of life, said a resident of Manipur, witnesses to protracted blockades enforced by different outfits even in the past.Manipur relies on other states for supply of most of its essential needs. But due to the blockade, no trucks had reached the state since December 12.I was stranded at Jiribam over seven days. There was nothing to do and we were uncertain what to do because of the blockade, said Tapas Nath, who brought a truckload of potatoes from West Bengal.Usually it takes just three days for him to cover the distance from Dhupguri in West Bengal to Manipurs capital. This time it took him 10 days. He hopes to return back safely soon, with police escort.The blockade by the UNC against the creation of new districts which it alleges benefits other communities at the cost of Nagas has seen residents scurrying for essentials such as petrol and vegetables. Prices of most items in short supply have skyrocketed.Petrol pumps across the capital have been closed for weeks. The scarcity has spawned a thriving backmarket. The going rate of one litre of petrol, which had reached nearly Rs 300 few days back, is Rs 140 these days.Taking advantage of the gap between the demand and supply of fuel, people have started selling petrol and diesel in black.We received our last supply of fuel several weeks ago. There was such a huge rush of customers that we ran out of petrol and diesel in a couple of hours, said Bikash Thapa of United Brothers filling station at Chinmeirong West.To fill the demand and supply gap ,theres jugaad. Women with plastic drinking water bottles filled with petrol and diesel can be seen doing brisk business on the streets.Most of the petrol available in black market is adulterated. One needs to have good contacts to get pure petrol or diesel, but the price could be a bit higher that the market rates, said Norendra Singh, a taxi driver.Some residents say due to the ongoing scarcity, petrol and diesel are also being smuggled in from Myanmar through the Moreh border, located 110 km away from Imphal.The petrol and diesel coming from Myanmar has a lighter tinge than the ones we usually get in petrol pumps here. We buy whatever we get as theres no choice, said L. Bikram, an auto-rickshaw owner.While petrol and diesel can be purchased at premium, the bigger problem many households are facing is due to the non-availability of LPG cylinders to run kitchens.One LPG cylinder can cost Rs 2000 and more on the black market. It has become difficult to manage day to day affairs at home because of the blockade, complained Sarojini Devi, a housewife at Chinmeirong East.Prices of vegetables like potatoes and onions and cereals and pulses have more than doubled since the blockade began, forcing many households to cut down on their expenses.Travelling both inside and outside the state have also turned into an ordeal. Passenger buses from Imphal to other important towns in Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland have stopped operating from November 29 due to the blockade.Nearly 20 buses carrying passengers to other states used to leave Imphal daily, prior to the blockade. Our business has been the worst hit, said Romeo Singh, an Imphal agent of Guwahati-based Network Travels.The situation is expected to ease for the next few days with the arrival of the trucks filled with goods. But with UNC not in a mood to lift the blockade soon, it seems like a temporary respite for residents."

The new potato crop starts arriving in January in the mandis.Experts HT spoke to were of similar views. The fall in potato prices is more due to seasonal reasons. The production is expected to be more while the impact of demonetisation is limited, said agriculture expert Sachin Bondriya. The potato yield this year is expected to be about 250-300 quintal per acre, about 25% more than last year due to favourable conditions.Manohar Umrao Singh, a farmer who grows potatoes on the outskirts of Indore, said he was watching the prices closely. My crop will be ready in about a months time. However, old potatoes from cold storages have flooded the market and led to price crash.Madhya Pradesh has 210 cold storages, of which 65 are in Indore district.Farmers in Malwa region have been encouraged to grow more potatoes as they are increasingly finding a ready market in food-processing industries and export market in the Gulf. Potatoes grown in Malwa are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. While top-quality potatoes are exported, the remaining are sold in local markets.According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables, including potato and garlic, on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season, an increase of more than 30% over last year."

So was the consumption of salted snacks (like potato chips, namkeen), fried snacks (like samosa, pakora), nuts and dry fruits (like almonds, cashew).The change from traditional to modern diet means that we are now consuming more preserved food, salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and less of fruits, vegetables, milk and dietary fibres. This modification in diet and lifestyle could be the reason for rise in prevalence of asthma, apart from environmental factors, said Dr Raj Kumar, one of the authors of the paper that was published in Pneumonologia I Alergologia Polska.Read: Statutory warning: Shortness of breath may be symptom of heart failureHigher saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sodium, carbohydrates, sugar and preservatives in fried and junk food could be the reason there is a correlation between asthma and such food items, the study says.These food items are also known to lead to weight gain and obesity, which is a known risk factor for developing asthma, said Dr Raj Kumar.Other studies have already established an association of such food items with severe symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis and eczema.On the other hand, the researchers found that consumption of non-vegetarian foods like egg, mutton fish, chicken and beef more than three times a week was high among the healthy individual. So was the consumption of cereals, milk, milk products, non-vegetarian food, fruits and fruit juices."

Officials are visiting the farmers, who gave up stubble-burning and adopted alternative methods on their own, to see the viability of the methods. The agriculture development department highlighted a new instrument made by New Gurdeep Combines, which is fixed at the back of a harvester combine. It trims the stubble into small pieces and spreads it evenly in the field.Nabha sub-divisional magistrate Jashanpreet Kaur Gill visited a farm to witness the technique at village, Ghanudki. Nabha agriculture development officer Jupinder Singh said that a farmer loses 21 kg nitrogen, 5 kg phosphorous, 50 kg potash, 60 kg sulphur, 0.7 kg iron, 0.75 kg manganese, 0.75 kg zinc and 400 kg of carbon per acre by burning stubble.Two farmers Bir Dalvinder and Ravi, who were present on the occasion, said that direct sowing of wheat through happy seeding has helped them retain moisture and nutrients in the soil.The new harvester instrument, that spreads stubble in the field, helps to restore the organic matter. After that, direct sowing is done preferably using happy seeder.Bir Dalvinder said that he had harvested 1 quintal extra yield per acre for two years by direct sowing without burning stubble. Ravi said that even potatoes could be sown after spreading the trimmed stubble in the fields.The experimenting farmers claimed that since the soil gets the organic matter from the stubble, the need of fertilisers and manures also decreased in their fields. Moreover, the above process of paddy harvesting has saved them around `2,000 per acre in the next crop, claimed the farmers. A lot of time is also saved as the sowing is done within hours after harvesting.Under trainee assistant commissioner Sandeep Kumar also visited the farm on the directions of Patiala deputy commissioner. The owners of the agro firm said that the farmers are demanding alternatives to stubble-burning, which motivated them to build such an instrument. Farmers are realising that stubble-burning is depleting environment for future generations, said Soni from New Gurdeep Combines, Bhadson. It costs only `200 per acre extra while harvesting, but a lot of fuel is saved in sowing, ultimately bringing down the cost of production of the next crop, he added.The officers appealed to propagate the method and also assured to bring it up with the government to provide support.

For anything above Rs 10, his collections are through e-banking.Like the rest of Indians, we are not worried about depositing or exchanging cash. All the adults here have bank accounts linked to their Aadhar numbers. As all the transactions at markets, milk cooperatives, shops and even vegetable vendors here are cashless, we withdraw cash only when we have to go outside the village, says J S Patel, a farmer.Read | Surge in cashless transactions will push digital economy, m-wallets will gainEven the local dairy cooperative has stopped making cash payments since the past one year.

Banks are estimated to have dispensed more than 6,500 crore as the currency chests were already in possession of cash prior to the demonetisation move. Six banks have their currency chests in Gurgaon.The shortage of cash is persisting but the banks are managing the situation by rationing the withdrawal limits. Banks have been demanding increased inflow of currency but it is not likely for a few months, Ramesh Chandra Nayak, lead bank manager for the district, said.A majority of the ATMs are still running dry and residents are apprehensive about the situation.There are several banks where there are no queues, but that is because they say they are out of cash. It seems that bank officials are forcing customers to return empty-handed despite having currency with them, Savita Khanna, a teacher waiting to get money from a private bank in Civil Lines, said.The Opposition leaders condemned the demonetisation move on Tuesday. Ajay Yadav, former minister and Congress leader, said that the decision has not been kind towards farmers. Farmers are forced to sell potatoes at 1 (per kg), tomatoes at 2 (per kg) and gooseberry as 3 (per kg) in the markets. They are throwing away their produce, as the market rates are not covering their production costs, Yadav said at the district Congress office in Kaman Sarai.TL Satyaprakash, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG), said the focus is now on cashless transactions. He said the corporation is accepting only cashless payment of taxes, bills and other charges, through point-of-sale machines."

It was better to distribute potatoes free to people, they contended.Patwari, who represents Rau assembly constituency, led about 200 farmers to Rajwada when they and their potato laden tractors were stopped near Manikbag.

This issue will become even more serious over next few days and push essential prices up beyond control.

We are heading towards a major crisis if this situation lingers for another week, said Subhash Chandra Bose secretary of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association.Later in the evening, Mamata announced waiver of agriculture tax that are taken at sabji mandis to give relief to truck drivers. Bose however said that this is too negligible an amount and wont solve the crisis.Sources said that while a few hundred trucks loaded with fish and eggs are stuck at the Bengal  Odisha border, trucks bringing in fruits such as sweet lemons (mosambi), pomegranates, grapes and oranges from Maharashtra are stuck at Jamsola border.

Farmers are unable to pay the labourers who harvest the crops because they have no cash. If these markets go dry the ripples would be felt in the city markets in the next few days, said Kamal Dey, member of the agriculture marketing force set up by Mamata."

The hangover of the Raj, complete with the traditional Christmas spread, is what draws us to this place. Windamere, actually, is like an old country house, David told HT.For the past few years, we have been staying in Darjeeling for a longer period. We arrive before Christmas-eve and leave only in the first week of January, said Pat.Originally from Kiama, 130 km from Sydney, the Gates first visited Darjeeling in 1991. We had read about Darjeeling and Calcutta while in school. So we decided to explore the places. Thankfully, it was Christmas that year. And we fell in love with the way Windamere celebrated  the carol, the entertainment, the dinner... Since then, we have not celebrated Christmas anywhere else. It is homecoming for us, said Pat.She also appreciated the fact that Darjeeling has done away with the use of plastic carry bags.Over the years, we have befriended so many of this towns folks. We visit them every year. Many of them have passed away while many others have moved on, David said with a touch of nostalgia palpable in his voice.There are many tourists who keep coming back to Windamere but the Gates are special. Shubhana Rai, sales manager at Windamere, said, They have become a part of the Windamere family. We look forward to their visit every year. And yes, we try to keep our Christmas celebrations as authentic as it was way back in 1939.The Christmas menu of 1960, proudly displayed, reads, Hors Doeuveres Varies; Cream of Tomato Soup; Lobster Mayonnaise and Russian Salad; Roast Turkey and Ham Croquette Potatoes, cauliflower and garden peas; Christmas Plum Pudding and Brandy Sauce; Pickled Sardine on Toast; Dessert and Coffee.

A daughter-in-law of Uttar Pradeshs first family of politics must drape her sari in the perfect manner. She must be disciplined, speak only when spoken to, and, of course, keep her political ambitions in check.But what if you are Aparna Yadav? People say I am very ambitious; some say over-ambitious. But would they say so if a man was entering politics? asks Aparna, the younger daughter-in-law of Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav.Aparna, who will be contesting elections from the Lucknow Cantonment seat, is making her maiden venture into politics in the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, slated to be held early next year.We are at the official residence of Mulayam Singh, in one of its spacious halls, tastefully decorated with ornate chandeliers, crystal-studded cushions in pastel green and porcelain showpieces. The hall leads into the house where Aparna, 26, lives with Prateek Yadav, 28, and their three-year-old daughter, Prathama. Mulayams elder son and UP chief minister, Akhilesh, his wife Dimple, and their children have recently moved into a house next door.Outside the heavily guarded Yadav residences, the city is abuzz with talk of the power struggle within the family  the recent conflict between the crown prince Akhilesh and his uncle, Shivpal Yadav. In this messy political matrix of the family, the younger daughter-in-law is being seen as crucial: those in the know insist that the roots of the crisis between the uncle and his nephew lie in the political aspirations and ambitions of Mulayams second wife, Sadhana Gupta, Aparnas mother-in-law.Read:Akhilesh and Shivpal will work together under my guidance: MulayamEver since Aparnas candidature was announced by Mulayams younger brother Shivpal Yadav earlier this year in March, mediapersons in the city have been busy speculating over how Sadhana has been wanting a share of the political pie for her son Prateek. Prateek, a fitness enthusiast, runs a high-end gym in the city, and in one of his few interviews, has categorically denied any interest in politics.But journalists and political junkies in the city have not tired of discussing the political aspirations of Aparna, as opposed to her more sober sister-in-law, Dimple .On the campaign trail with Aparna Yadav, Mulayams younger daughter-in-law. Aparna says hectic campaigning makes it hard for her to spend enough time with her three-year-old daughter. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT Photo)Inside the hall, however, Aparna, dressed elegantly, her hair tied in a casual bun, is careful with her words. She speaks favourably of Akhilesh bhaiyya, the development work that his government has done, and foregrounds the need for attending to civic issues both in the city, and in her constituency.Look at Lucknow now. We have cafs; soon we are going to have the Metro, just like Delhi. Lucknow has become a yo-type of city, she says.Destined for politicsSomewhere in the 2000s, Mrs Primrose Pepper, the tall, sharply-dressed teacher at Lucknows Loreto Convent, had a discussion with her students on the subject of reservation, an issue that had taken over the country in 1990. Back then, the government headed by V P Singh had accepted the Mandal Commission reports recommendation of giving 27 per cent reservations to OBCs, and set off widespread protests in colleges across the country.At the discussion, Aparna Bisht, then in class 11, had opposed the decision, arguing that caste-based reservations would only aggravate existing hierarchies, and quotas should instead be based on economic need. I have always been vocal about issues I feel strongly about, she says, recalling this as one of those moments that shaped her political consciousness.Aparna grew up in interesting times  she recalls observing the emergence of new political parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, and her own proximity to these political events owing to her journalist father. I would see all these dharnas, the foreign correspondents who would come to cover these events. I would often ask my father why all this was happening, she says.His answers about the social and political upheaval in UP, it seems, had some impact on her. For her Bachelors degree, Aparna chose to study Political Science, Modern History and English, and pursued International Relations for her Masters at the University of Manchester. England had fascinated me since childhood. And at that time, I really wanted to become a diplomat, travel the world, she says.Read:Yadav family feud: Aman Mani Tripathis arrest a victory for CM Akhilesh YadavBut destiny had other plans. The boy Aparna had been friends with for a few years was the then CMs son [Mulayams son Prateek]. Aparna says she knew she wanted to be with him for life. It was him or no one else, she says. Predictably then, marriage happened. You can tell that life as a young bride would not have been easy  in a candid moment, Aparna says that as a 21-year-old who wore boots and jeans, she couldnt even tie a sari, or cook aloo-mattha (a dish made of potatoes and buttermilk).In time, however, Aparna mastered both, and also carved her own niche in the family. I dont think they had had anyone like me in the family before. But with my feminine energy, I think I have won peoples hearts. The family has opened up to me, she says.Outside of the family too, Aparna worked to brand herself as a champion for womens rights. She is the brand ambassador of a city-based NGOs campaign for womens rights, and has been active in public speaking on related issues. So even as the family patriarch, Mulayam Singh, made headlines with his sexist statements  last year, he said that it was not possible for four men to rape a girl; in 2014, he said boys will be boys..they make mistakes  Aparna has been vocal about her cause. The discourse on violence against women has changed since 2012. Women need to stop thinking that its their fault. We need to question the boys and not the girls, says Aparna. They shouldnt have let the juvenile [one of the accused in the December 16 Delhi gangrape case] go. I support capital punishment in such cases, she says, getting visibly agitated.Learning the ropesAll this while though, Aparna says she was never averse to politics. Politics and social work are two different sides of the same coin; its only Chanakya and Machiavelli who have spoilt it, she insists, adding that this was the right time to enter politics.Those in the know insist that the time was right because Aparna had often broken ranks  the selfie with PM Narendra Modi in 2015; her tweets against cow slaughter and beef-eating; being the only member from the family to attend a function where the PM was speaking earlier this year, and opposing Aamir Khan for his comments about intolerance (after Mulayam supported the actor).The proclivity towards the BJP and the PM, many say, was her way to arm-twist the family into giving her a ticket.Aparnas outspoken behaviour has pitched her in opposition to the elder daughter-in-law Dimple, popular among party workers and often described as graceful, dignified and disciplined.Aparna Yadav says she has always been vocal about issues that she feels strongly about. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT Photo)But Aparna is unfazed by her detractors. I have my own voice, my own opinion, and that will always remain so. But I can also convince people with my feminine energy.You dont have to be like Mayawati to survive in UP politics, she says.Now is a busy time for Aparna  hectic campaigning for the elections is already on. We are on way to a function to inaugurate a road in her constituency.For the event, Aparna has changed into a pale green sari  I can now tie one in like five minutes  and is quite at ease with the somewhat frenzied crowd of young supporters mouthing syrupy statements and slogans about Aparna didi.Read:Yadav family puts up united front at Agra-Lucknow Expressway inaugurationIn her speech, she focusses on the areas civic issues, and also manages to take a dig at her opponent. Darr ke bhaag gayi (she got scared by me and ran away), she says about Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the sitting MLA, and a member of the Congress party who recently switched to the BJP.The war of words has been on for some time  Aparna says Joshi said some disrespectful things about her, and so, she had to respond too  so Rita aunty became thuka hua kartoos (used bullet). I wouldnt say these things, but when someone attacks you , what do you do?, she says.In the messy world of UPs electoral politics, the Yadav bahu, it seems, must learn more than just draping the perfect sari.."

His mother, who is sick, is waiting for him there. Everything hinged on December 7, payday. But his boss offered him demonetised banknotes of Rs 500 and 1,000, citing a currency crunch. Shyamu refused to take the salary, for now.He is one of the 12 lakh workers in the industrial town affected by the demonetisation move that took out about 85% of the currency in circulation, and the resultant cash crunch due to shortage of new notes. As most of banks and ATMs remain out of cash, many traders are banking on agents who have come up overnight and are taking a 10-15% cut to exchange old notes with valid ones. Or, in some factories, the owners have partly paid the workers. Very few have given cheques as either the workers lack bank accounts or the owners do not want the transactions tracked.Only big players such as Hero Group and Trident textiles, where the entire workforce has bank accounts, have paid by cheques or e-transfer.Around 80% of all industry is in the unorganised sector. And 80% of the workers do not have bank accounts, said Badish Jindal, vice-chairman of the National Productivity Council, In some cases, workers who are refusing to accept the old notes or cheques are being laid off.Workers here usually come from villages of UP, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh, and such migrants are 8 lakh of the 12 lakh workers here. Around 4 lakh work in the hosiery industry, while more than 2 lakh in the cycle industry. Other sectors include machine tools, sewing machines and auto parts.Suresh Arora, owner of Arora Fabrics in Sundarnagar locality, said, I could not pay salary to more than 80% of my workers as I could withdraw only Rs 50,000 from my current account. If somebody chooses to leave, he or she can. Around 60% of my workers have already left for their native places in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.Harmohinder Pahwa, director of Nova Cycles, said they could pay only 15% of the 550 workers. We have given cheques to workers who have bank accounts. Since we do not have cash, we will be paying the rest in installments in the coming days.Meanwhile, Arun Kumar, 42, who works in a hosiery firm for the last 24 years, and his family are relying on potatoes alone for meals. He was given the salary in old notes that he refused to accept. He last withdrew Rs 2,000 from his account on November 17."

He has exhausted the three Rs 500 notes he had the day the government scrapped two high-value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.The daily wage earner could not get them exchanged at the nearest bank, which is 7 km away in Bithoor, because of the heavy rush but a merchant in Hingupur agreed to pay him Rs 400 for one note.The scene is no different in cities and towns across the country after the November 8 shock announcement took out 86% of the currency out of circulation. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and ATMs across the country, as the first payday since the recall of the high-value banknotes raised fears of more chaos amid the severe cash crunch.Most government and private sector employees get their salaries credited to their accounts on the last day of the month and millions of people were expected to withdraw cash to meet their immediate needs  such as school and medical fees, newspaper bills, and other sundry purchases. In India, 78% of consumer payments are made in cash, which the government is attempting to change.A penniless Lal, however, has a way out. As he has now decided to do what almost everyone in his village has been doing for a week now - barter grains for goods.He offered the village merchant Pooran Gupta a sack full of wheat, weighing 100 kg, in exchange for vegetables, spices, wheat flour, rice and oil. He has another one at his house that he plans to trade sometime later. The owner of the field they had worked on had given them the wheat in exchange for their labour.This is the only way I can make sure my family has food and lentils with their meals. The children dont understand the problem, we cant make them understand either. They want food and we have to arrange (for food), Lal said.Money is no longer available to us. God knows when we will have work.The daughter-in-law of one of his dead brothers, Meena, is worried about arranging for the wedding of her eldest daughter. Sumans wedding has been fixed to be held on December 20 and the family doesnt have much cash to spend on the ceremonies.Meenas husband has a broken hand and her three children are too young to work. However, unlike Lal, this family has one bigha of land and rice  in abundance after the autumn harvest  would be the medium for exchange. As will be wheat for potatoes, flour, vegetables, cooking oil, spices and even for salt.Families like Meenas have been dealing in rice and wheat as currency in the countryside.I will have to trade the rice even for clothes. How will my daughter live in her sasural (in laws house) if we fail to provide right hospitality to the baratis (guests from the grooms family)? She will be teased for any folly of ours. I cannot jeopardise her dignity, we will do the best we can to arrange funds, Meena said.She has struck a deal with a farmer who would give her ghee or clarified butter, vegetables and flour for the wedding feast. In turn, he will keep one-quarter of the wheat crop the family would sow.To earn some cash, she has started working in households in Kalyanpur, 15 km away from Ghazipur, and will barter the paddy for the clothes from local shops.Gupta, the merchant who has struck some goods deals with the villagers, set a reminder. He said the barter system will not work as the villagers are bound to run out of things to exchange.Cash squeeze has begun hurting me. The number of people for barter is increasing by the day and how long I can barter is the question before me? he asked."

But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."

We want to act as a pressure group for getting the concerns answered, Digmohan Negi, one of the founders of Uttarakhand Ekta Manch Delhi, told HT over phone from Delhi.He said the states languages Garhwali and Kumaoni are still considered dialects and demanded their inclusion in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.Gairsain (which is almost equidistant from Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the state) is yet to be made the states capital, Negi rued.Read: Why Gairsain capital issue a political hot potato in election-bound UttarakhandUttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat addressed the gathering over phone and assured action on the demands.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia assured assistance for celebration of hill festival Uttaraini-Makraini at 40 places and setting up of an Uttarakhand Akademi in the national capital, where thousands of Uttarakhandis are residing.Noted Uttarakhandi singer Narendra Singh Negi recited a song specially written for the gathering through which he exhorted locals to join hands for the cause of the hills. Its only through unity that we can make our voices be heard, he said.It is just the beginning of the fight of the pahadi (community). Were glad we could highlight our concerns on the national level, Uttarakhand-based activist Amit Gusain Pahadi who works for hill cultures promotion, said.I brought my children to witness the gathering and to evoke a sense of belonging (to the hills) among them, Reena Pandey, a Ghaziabad-based homemaker from Uttarakhand, told HT from the capital.Besides keeping a tab on the follow-up of their demands, the collective is looking forward to develop 10 model villages in the hill state with financial and voluntary help of its members.Our focus is on the nine hill districts of Uttarakhand. We will try to develop model facilities like health and education so as to curb migration, Negi said."

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November. The supply dipped to an average of 93 quintals per day from November 9 to November 22. The supply of oranges also dipped from an average of 453 quintals per day to an average of 306 quintals per day, after November 8.However, the supply of guava has remained constant, at 220 quintals per day, from November 1 to November 22."

But one place that seemingly has remained unaffected is Ima Keithel  Imphals iconic Mothers Market.Located at Khwairamband Bazaar, Asias biggest all-women market still has the usual hustle and bustle with women shopkeepers haggling with customers to sell their wares.The blockade by United Naga Council (UNC), in protest against creation of new districts, hasnt had any impact on my business, said Lalita Meitei (60), who has been selling fish at the market for more than 30 years.That is because the fish that she sells comes from local fisheries and the Lok Tak Lakethe largest freshwater lake in northeast India, located nearly 50 km away from Imphal.The market, believed to have been set up nearly 500 years ago, is run entirely by women and sells a variety of wares from fish, vegetables, fruits to traditional snacks and local garments.UNCs blockade, which began on November 1, has led to a crisis of essential items including fuel. It has severely affected businesses in other parts of Imphal Valley and led to a steep rise in prices.But since most of the products sold in the Ima Keithel are locally produced, the market hasnt witnessed a slide in business.Read| Manipur blockade: Black market thrives in the state as fuel outlets run drySince all the products I sell, like honey, puja items, sweets made from puffed rice, sesame seeds and jaggery are produced locally, my business hasnt suffered, said 72-year-old Ibiembi Devi.Prices of certain items like potatoes, onions and fruits which get supplied from outside the valley have, however, seen an increase.Usually the fruits I sell come from other states, but due to the blockade I am selling apples, oranges and grapes which arrived from Myanmar via the Moreh border, at prices higher than usual, said Bimata Devi.Vegetable vendor Thoibi Meitei said prices of most vegetables have increased by 10-20% percent, but the costliest item in her shop was potato, which is selling at Rs 100 per kilogram.Considered the nerve centre of Manipur famed for its matriarchal society, the women from Ima Keithel have led movements against policies of the British in the early 20th century and against excesses by security forces in the state in the past years.While women stall owners at Ima Keithel arent affected much by the economic blockade, the story is not the same in markets elsewhere in the state capital. The past two months have seen their businesses nosedive.In Paona Bazar, located close to Ima Keithel, most shop and business establishments have recorded low sales or are waiting for the blockade to end to get fresh stock for customers.Businesses like mine where we rely almost entirely on goods coming to Imphal Valley from other states have been worst affected, said Bimal Singh, a hardware store owner. Shelves are empty in many shops across the city.The UNC says the creation of new districts hurts the interests of Nagas in the state and benefits other communities. It plans to continue with the blockade of two highways  NH2 and NH37 - connecting Imphal to other states, despite repeated appeals by the authorities to lift it.To ease the situation, the authorities have begun to escort trucks, laden with goods and stranded on the highways, into Imphal under heavy police escort. Several hundred trucks reached the state capital on Monday, raising hopes of fresh supplies being available to replenish stores.The supplies, though, remain sporadic and Manipur is worried about what the future holds. The women shopkeepers of Mothers Market, however, betray no such concern with business being as usual.Read| Medical emergency in Manipur: 57-day blockade cripples health services"

Most of the Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes are being printed in our village. But our queues are no less than anywhere else in the country, said Mahato.We look at the mint wistfully from a distance and stare at the vehicles that leave with the cash to feed the nation.

Constructed in 23 months, the expressway gives the Samajwadi Party government a solid infrastructure to showcase its achievement.The construction of the expressway in record time shows the determination of the CM and will help him in fighting the anti- incumbency factor during the assembly polls, said SK Mishra, a political observer.The hassle-free acquisition of 3,500 hectare land from 32,000 farmers has helped the SP government project a pro-farmer image, he said.A massive agitation by farmers over acquisition of land for the Yamuna expressway led to the BSPs defeat in the 2012 assembly election, Mishra added.But opposition parties have already launched a scathing attack on Akhilesh, calling him a chief minister in a hurry.Read | Yadav family puts up united front at Agra-Lucknow Expressway inaugurationBSP chief Mayawati has said, Instead of focusing on administration, the chief minister is busy inaugurating and laying the foundation stones of projects.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) feels the expressway wont be the magic bullet Akhilesh is hoping for.Rather than the expressway, people will vote on the law and order situation as well as corruption in the state government departments, BJP state chief Keshav Prasad Maurya said.Yashvir Tyagi, a professor in the department of economics at Lucknow University, does not agree with the views of the opposition leaders.The Agra-Lucknow expressway has definitely refurbished the image of Akhilesh Yadav who was at the receiving end due to a feud in the Yadav family. The opposition leaders have often criticised the chief minister for bowing to the wishes of his father, uncle and other SP leaders, but the expressway certainly projects him as a leader who can deliver. The perception that he is a doer will definitely strengthen his image before the crucial polls, Tyagi told HT.The expressway will definitely give a thrust to the economy particularly the rural hinterland. Farmers as well as traders in Agra, Firozabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Auraiyya, Kannauj, Kanpur, Unnao, Hardoi and Lucknow will definitely benefit from the quick movement of traffic, he added.Potato production in Agra, glass industry in Firozabad, agro-based industries in Mainpuri-Etawah, perfume-making in Kannauj, leather business in Kanpur-Unnao, chikankari cluster and mango production in Lucknow will get a boost once expressway connects the rural hinterland with developing urban centres, said Sudhir Pawar, a senior professor at Lucknow University.It takes around 10 hours to transport mango by road from Lucknow to Delhi. Usually, we suffer losses as it is a perishable product. A large quantity of mango is destroyed if the delivery is delayed. Once the Lucknow-Agra expressway is completed, the travel time will be cut down to six hours, said Mohammad Imran, owner of a mango orchard in Malihabad on the outskirts of Lucknow.Shyam Kumar, a perfume trader, said, The expressway will give oxygen to the Kannauj perfume industry. It will not only open a new market but also ensure fast movement of raw material.A senior officer of the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) said the government plans to set up four townships, besides industrial units, along the expressway. The UPEIDA also has plans to develop an education hub along the road link.Agriculture mandis (markets) will be established in Mainpuri and Kannauj. The state government plans to set up information technology investment region (ITIR) and Film City on the expressway."

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

Who knew anything like this would happen overnight, without any preparation? People like us are in deep trouble for the moment. We withdrew money in bulk for shopping but most of the notes are of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 and no vendor or shopkeeper is ready to accept these notes, Manishankar Prasad, a government employee, said.I even thought about postponing the wedding.

So the wedding is still on but the charm has gone, his daughter, Pallavi said.The Centres move has also affected venues and caterers.We can allow people to book the venue up to one year in advance, but cannot decorate it so far ahead. And now, basic things like flowers, bulbs, crackers and batteries are hard to buy as we are short of Rs 100 notes and vendors are not taking any other currency notes. Similar is the case with grocery and dairy products. Wholesale vegetable markets were closed on Wednesday and now we are in a do-or-die situation, Vikram Raghuvanshi, the manager of Bhopal-based Hotel Nandan Palace, said.The price of potatoes has skyrocketed after the Centres announcement. Yes, the prices will plunge back to their normal levels after three or four days but currently the issue is grave as the potato is one of the basic ingredients in wedding food, said Lovepreet Singh, a wedding manager.Others have taken a more pragmatic view of the whole situation.We have a wedding party today. Yes, there are issues with the preparations, but one thing is for sure the prime minister has done a great job. We should understand that this move is for our betterment.

Farmers have no other option but to reduce the prices to sell their produce. The prices of greens have fallen by almost 50 per cent since November 20.The prices of cauliflower, tomatoes, potatoes, lemons, brinjals, carrots, bottle gourds etc. range between Rs 2 per kilo and Rs 8 per kilo in the wholesale market, compared to Rs 10 and Rs 50 that prevailed before demonetization. Lemon, which was being sold for Rs 80 per kilogram before November 8, is available for Rs 5 per kilogram in the APMC market.Farmer leader Darshan Nayak told TOI, ""Demonetization has literally broken the back of the farmers. Reserve Bank of India 's (RBI) restriction on the district cooperative banks is to be blamed for the farmers' plight. There is no new currency with the banks and they are unable to provide cash to their account holders, who happen to be farmers. The dealings in APMC are done in cash. The farmers and the farm labourers are facing serious situation. The farmers have started destroying their standing crops as they are unable to bear losses in taking their produce to the APMC and pay to the labourers.""APMC secretary Nilesh Thorat said, ""Farmers want to sell, but the traders want to bargain heavily due to shortage of currency notes.

As the community prepares to usher in the eight-day festival that begins tonight, we join in the observances.The Jewish festival of lights coincides with Christmas this year, a rarity. Mumbai-based Leora Micah Joseph tells us, 'Hanukkah' means 'dedication'. It refers to the re-dedication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in second century BCE, after the Jews reclaimed it from their Seleucid oppressors. ""When they went to light the temple menorah (seven-branched candelabrum), there was only one cruse of olive oil.

Commemorating this miracle of faith, Hanukkah is hence celebrated for eight days,"" says Leora, an active member of the Mumbai Jewish community.As the sun sets today, the nine-branched hanukkiah candelabrum will burn bright. The nightly hanukkiah lighting is at the heart of the festival. Leora says, ""It holds nine flames; one, the shamash (attendant), to kindle the other eight. On the first night, we light one flame. On the second night, an additional flame is lit. By the eighth night, all eight lights are kindled.""Traditionally, oil lamps are lit, but many Jewish homes light candles. Yet, through the sharing of each other's hanukkiah pictures on chat groups, Leora discovered that many families still own oil lamp stands and follow the tradition of lighting with oil. ""Some of these have been passed down generations, and are old, made of wood, brass or a combination of both,"" she says. This was evident from the myriad hanukkiahs adorning a Jewish family's house in Nana Peth. ""There's a wooden one that my husband's great grandfather, a woodworker, made for his family,"" says the lady of the house. They have quite a collection, with a wall-mounted one that belonged to her husband's grandfather, and another made of brass that was lit by his parents in their family home. The most intricate, however, is a foldable traveller's hanukkiah that they've had for as long as she can remember.Several food preparations are associated with Hanukkah, but it's interesting to note how they differ across the community, merely on basis of the geography and cultural fabric various members hail from. Leora mentions that according to legend, the ancestors of Bene Israel (Maharashtrian Jews) settled in Konkan after being shipwrecked off the coast. Their cuisine has influences of Maharashtrian and Konkan culinary styles, including the use of coconut. ""For Hanukkah, it is customary to have something deep-fried, in remembrance of the miracle of oil,"" says Leora.Going by this, Jews the world over, enjoy different preparations; but latkes (deep-fried potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (round doughnuts filled with jelly or custard) are traditional favourites. However, Camp resident Shalom Cohen, now living in California, associates most Jewish holidays with kaka bawas (a Persian Jewish delicacy), that his mother would prepare. ""My sister and I would wait for the holidays when our mum would make these date-filled cookies. They create a very nostalgic association with Hanukkah,"" reminisces Shalom, celebrating in California this year, with his roommate, who is looking forward to the experience.Leora has fond memories of attending Hanukkah parties at the synagogue when she'd go to spend her winter vacations in Ahmedabad. ""The local community would participate in the hanukkiah lighting, amidst prayers and special songs. This would be followed by fellowship, merriment and gift-giving to the children,"" she recalls.It will be a similar scene at the 95-year-old Succath Shelomo Synagogue in Rasta Peth. Daniel Penkar, synagogue president, informs, ""On December 29, the community will gather here to celebrate. Each family will bring its own hanukkiah and light it with the common hanukkiah of the synagogue. This will be followed by a simple celebration."" The Ohel David Synagogue on Moledina Road will see similar celebrations on December 31.In June, the community was conferred with the minority status by the state cabinet. Maharashtra is the first state to categorise the Jews as a minority group. Of the estimated 5000, over 4,300 Jews reside in the state, largely concentrated around Mumbai, Thane and Raigad area. Pune is home to less than 100 families."

Located in a non-AC, first floor space, Prems surprised me. Blew my brains, rather. With its owner going around serving tulsi and clove-infused water to dosa and idli made of millets, Prems is the healthy, but surprisingly tasty, if not tastier than the original version of South Indian food. The curd rice and sambar rice, but with no rice in them, are mind-boggling. The black rice puttu for dessert was the kicker! This is probably how Obama felt at his $6 meal with Anthony in Vietnam.601, The ParkClassic or contemporary? This is a raging debate that will never end, so a wise young chef decided to put both on the plate. For every dish you order, a classic version and a modern take are served, and the results are extraordinary. Classic shepherds pie with the lamb and potato on one side, and roulade with stuffed lamb on the other. There were mini dosas and desserts, but my favourite was the classic lobster broth paired with a modern lobster bisque cappuccino. Perfect way to end a debate  agree to both sides.Pan Asian, ITC Grand CholaFive courses of dessert.

The highlight is the unlimited amount of tandoor and barbecue starters served with a buffet.We reach the hotel by 8 p.m. and the elevator takes us straight to the rooftop. Stepping into the restaurant, the change in ambience is pretty overwhelming. The rooftop has been transformed into a pleasant tropical space with an earthy dcor. A live kitchen is at work at one end of the indoor restaurant space while on the other end you have the open-sky space with a stunning view of bustling Palayam.Food and beverages manager Anuf Khan arrives as we sit down at the table. He briefs us about the new venture. Starters are our highlight. There are many who prefer dining on starters alone instead of an extravagant buffet. So we decided to go heavy on the starters, says Anuf.Four vegetarian and four non-vegetarian starters are served every day. Executive Chef Joginder Pal Singh chips in between with his expertise on kebabs and tandoors. We have a different menu for each day of the week. The dishes range from North Indian tandoors to popular Arabic kebabs and Thai grills. The main-course menu also changes every day, he says. listening to the Chefs description for a while, we could no longer wait and decide to kick-start the feast.Non-veg platter comes first. Murgh Bada kebab, Mutton Hariyali kebab, Fish Irani kebab and Arabic grilled fish with veggies and mint chutney arrive on a shiny steel plate. Spicy brown chicken, cooked to perfection, sets my taste buds on fire as soon as I take a bite and the Arabic grilled fish with juicy soft fish cubes with a coriander-lemon coat melts in the mouth. But the clear winner is the Mutton Hariyali kebab with exquisitely cooked mutton in a green sauce made of palak and a variety of spices, while the mildly spicy Irani fish kebab stands out for its exotic taste.The vegetarian starters are equally impressive with the delicious Bharwan tandoori aloo, a special dish which involves a thick soft potato rings filled with shredded paneer, leading the platter. Veg seekh kebab and Arabic subzi tikki are the spiced-up bites on the platter while cubes of paneer cooked in Satay peanut sauce adds a sweet touch.Though stuffed with the smoking starters, we decide to try out the main-course as well, starting with a Vegetable pulao, Methi gosht, which is mutton cooked in thick cashew-fenugreek based gravy, and scrumptious gobi in black pepper sauce. Next up is Indian breads. Roti and butter naan, though a little too crispy for my comfort, go extremely well with the moderately spicy red curry and the rich sweet n sour gravy of paneer butter masala.We sign off the evening with a bowl of warm gulab jamun, chocolate pastry with fresh fruits and two big scoops of mango ice cream.Skyye Grill is open from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. on all days of the week. The buffet is priced at Rs. 888 including the taxes. For reservations, call 0471-2333333, 9847030003."

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows. Some buy a couple of acres just outside the city and head there on weekends. An easy, and popular compromise: rooftop and terrace gardening. A tomatos tastier when you grow it on your own.Mesmerised by pancakes: Food videos became big this year, as they got slicker than ever before. Faintly hypnotic and surprisingly relaxing, they easily sliced across geographical and age barriers. Everyone was watching them, though hardly anyone was actually trying the recipes in real life. Among the most popular videos this year were mozzarella stick onion rings, ice cream churro bowls and pizza puff pastry twists, which got a mind-boggling 159,908,933 views.Single origin everything: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla Local artisan produce got better than ever this year, thanks to determined entrepreneurs and an audience that was willing to not just pay for quality, but also educate themselves.Try The Indian Beans Monkey Bitten Coffee, cultivated in the forests of Andhra Pradeshs Araku Valley. Or Blue Tokais roastery, where they simultaneously grind beans, make cappuccinos and hold workshops.Prefer chocolate? Earth Loaf in Mysore, Mason & Co in Auroville and Pascati are creating gourmet, hand-made, organic, locally-sourced, single-origin, bean-to-bar, proudly desi chocolate (phew).Geeking out on coffee: If youre still using capsules, go sit in a corner with your finger on your lips, and think about the impact on the environment. This was the year of responsible handmade coffee. The AeroPress became popular, as did the Moka pot. Need something trendier? Buy and learn how to use the Chemex, vacuum siphon, bee house dripper or filtron cold brewer.A latte a day: Turmeric lattes, coconut lattes, pumpkin lattes... Mornings got a lot more interesting this year. Turmeric lattes, made with almond milk, fresh turmeric and honey, ruled. For the paleo and keto nuts, it was all about bullet-proof coffee made by whipping together coffee, butter and coconut oil. If youre less intense, try a cold brew coffee with coconut, almond or cashew milk.Soup in light bulbs: Unusual platters ruled. We ate cheese on the lid of a wine barrel. Dessert in a flower pot. Breakfast on a spade. Coffee in a waffle cone.We even saw a burger served on a weighing scale!IN: Gin. Also called vodka for grown ups. Watch out for a pink strawberry version as part of 2017s ginnaissanceOUT: Carb-heavy, creamfilled, decadently sweet desserts. Watch a Tasty video instead. Then eat an apple"

However, the residents, who are mostly farmers with small land-holdings have to set up solar fencing and keep a watch over their crops for most of the day and during the nights.R. Nanjan, a 73-year-old retired teacher who has lived in the same Hatti or Badaga village since he was a child, says that he first saw a gaur inside the village only two years ago. He said that the animals, particularly the wild boar and gaur, were eating vegetables, like beetroot, carrot and potatoes grown in the village.Similarly, R. Hemavathi and A. Shanthi said that they were incurring huge losses, firstly because of the low yield this year due to a lack of rains, and also due to the animals, who were eating all their crop. Though they are losing money due to crop loss, the villagers have no animosity towards the animals.Around 10-15 years ago, the animals had enough forest cover, and more water. They did not need to come into the villages to get food. But now the area has become home to many plantations and resorts, and forests have been lost over a period of time, said K. Mahalingam, another farmer who believes the Forest Department should pay for solar fences to be put up around the village."

The initial cost, including seeds, urea and pesticide, comes to Rs.18,000 per acre. The cash crunch has prevented me from carrying on sowing operations, Surjeet Singh, of Phul village in Bathinda, told The Hindu .Mr. Surjeet Singh has sown wheat on the rest of his seven-acre land.With each day passing, problems are getting aggravated. Most transactions are being done on credit, so my ability to buy inputs has become limited. I have to buy whatever traders offer me on credit.Patience is running out. If this [the cash crunch] is not sorted out soon, the government will face the wrath of farmers, he said.The data from the Agriculture Ministry show that till December 2 this year, the total area under the rabi crops stands at 415.53 lakh hectares, against 382.84 lakh hectare this time in 2015. While wheat has been sown on 173.93 lakh hectares, against 152.56 lakh hectares last year, the area under pulses has risen to 112.95 lakh hectares from 99.83 lakh hectares last year. The area under oilseeds has risen to 70.7 lakh hectares from 64.21 lakh hectares.Satnam Singh of Beru village in Patiala expressed the same concern. Wheat sowing should ideally be done between mid- November and the last week of the month. But sowing on my land has been delayed by a week. This means the quality of my crop could take a hit, resulting in a lower yield.Many other farmers of my village have been spending long hours in queues in front of banks and ATMs  the crucial time we should spend on our fields, he added.Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has recently said demonetisation has not impacted the Rabi crop sowing, citing the increase in the area under wheat and pulses, the main crops.Noted agricultural policy analyst Devinder Sharma said: If farmers and the people continue to face difficulties caused by demonetisation, the government will face the consequences. It is now becoming clear that demonetisation is aimed at rescuing the banking sector, not at unearthing black money."

Among the new varieties, which are set to be released, AICRP C-28 variety was the one to be watched due to its distinct features, he said.The new variety, which is a 125-day crop (around 15 days more than traditional variety) will give an yield of around 40 tonnes/acre unlike traditional variety, which gives around 30 tonnes. This is a heat tolerant and pest-resistant variety whose tubers will be bigger in size, he said.He said it would take at least a year to introduce the variety to the farmers.Potato is cultivated on around 33,000 hectares in the State and Hassan alone accounts for 12,000 hectares.He said that the Station is in the process of producing seed of potato locally to prevent the practice of importing them from north India, which was expensive."

Besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.Traders pleaTo improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. Mr. Seth, who is also the joint secretary, Automotive Parts Merchants Association, added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. For those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. He pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. Many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. The main market areas in Bengaluru city were also impacted. APMC yard in Bengaluru is known for its cash payments. Only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer Bengaluru. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. In the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.Business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. As per the estimates of the Karnataka Hosiery & Garment Association (KHGA), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. The association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than Rs.50000 for daily business needs. The government should soon bring Rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, KHGA.In Kolkata, Anupam Boral, Proprietor of a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises (GSE), said the shortage of Rs 100 notes is also hurting business. For instance, Boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute. Though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" On other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, Boral said, I am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between Rs 800 to Rs 1500. The shortage of Rs 100 rupee is crippling us. Even if I avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of Rs 2000 denomination.""In Coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi in Coimbatore, went to the bank on Thursday morning to draw Rs. 30,000 from his Cash Credit (CC) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only Rs. 10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another Rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. How can I manage a week with Rs. 10,000?The castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in Coimbatore city. We usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. But, there are so many restrictions now and I had to draw money from the bank. I have this account for nearly 40 years. We should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. However, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw Rs. 50,000 from his CC account. He had drawn Rs. 10,000 last Friday and was allowed to draw another Rs. 40,000 on Thursday. There is no clarity on the issue. Some banks allowed the industries that have CC account to draw Rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said V. Sundaram, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.The plight of small scale industrial units in Hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. Cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. Since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry leaders Ravindra Modi and V. Anil Reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. Since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.Though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says K.Koteswara Rao, Convenor of All India Forum for Small and Medium Industries. He expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M.

If he is unable to find out the status of the dog, he may need to receive a vaccine on 60th and 90th day after the dog bite.4. The wound should not be sutured and no anti-microbial ointments should be used.5. Anti-rabies serum should be given if the bite is close to the spinal cord or neck.Misconceptions:1. Not taking bath for a week as water can cause hydrophobia.2. Some believe applying cow dung to a dog bite will cause better healing.3. Dietary modifications like not eating tomatoes, milk, dhal and potatoes will improve the effectiveness of the vaccine.4. Another incorrect practice is applying turmeric, chillies, salt and ghee to the wound."

I have a line of credit with the moneylender, said Prem Singh Pawar, 64, military-man-and-clerk-turned farmer.About Rs.10,000 is due but that will remain (in our accounts)and well adjust. I have not had a problem with getting wheat seeds. This assertion seems to be borne out by data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture. As of November 11, rabi crop had been sown on 146.85 lakh hectares compared to 126.71 lakh hectares at this time in 2015. Wheat had been sown/transplanted in 25.72 lakh hectares as opposed to 18.65 lakh hectares last year.Palpable crisisBut the crunch of readily-available cash is palpable. In the towns main vegetable market where, apart from fresh produce, seeds, pesticide and fertilizer are traded, private traders are furious. Sales of pesticides and fertilizers are down 50 per cent, said Ashok Gupta, 30, a trader, Nobody is buying anything and our stocks are fast approaching the expiry date. They will be useless in two weeks.Mr. Gupta said his business was heavily dependent on cash, but added that he occasionally deposited some savings in his bank account. This year, he saw customers shifting to the Haryana Seed Development Corporation store  a State-run store three doors away  that was accepting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. We got a call from the Agriculture Department asking us to accept these notes, said Ajit Singh Gulia, who runs the store.But I spend a few hours after lunch everyday to deposit these notes, he said. The State-run store stocks at least eight varieties of wheat and has a steady stream of buyers. Customers who take more than five sacks (roughly 40 kg a sack) and bring old notes must deposit a copy of their photo identity.Definite lullThe vegetable market, meanwhile, was bustling with deals being struck on tomatoes, cauliflower and potatoes, but Inder Prakash Gupta, general secretary of the vegetable traders association, said there was a definite lull.We have long relationships and can handle the lack of money for sometime, the farmer-cum-moneylender told The Hindu, but added that nearly 40 to 50 people were losing about Rs.15 to Rs.20,000 per day."

It was clean and dry, warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and there was plenty of work on the local farms. But now, even this bare-bones way of life is threatened.The family, along with another 242 cave-dwelling households dotted around the capital of Bamiyan province, also called Bamiyan, could be forced to move soon. They are whats left of around 10,000 families who have been relocated over the past decade as part of the local governments programme to protect the unique man-made grottoes that it hopes will transform Bamiyan into a global tourist destination once Afghanistans war with the insurgent Taliban, now in its 16th year, is finally over.The couple moved here from neighbouring Maidan-Wardak province because they believed it was a stepping stone to a better future.We had no money and my husband couldnt get a job, Marzia said as she breastfed her baby. We left because we were poor.But 12 years later, they are still living in the cave, along with their five children aged from 10 months to 8 years, including 6-year-old Freshta who hasnt been the same since a land mine exploded close by her four years ago. Her mental development stopped.Destroyed by timeAny original features, such as the brightly-coloured geometric murals that were painted by the monks who created these caves, are long gone. Theyve been destroyed by time, the elements and the wear-and-tear of hundreds of years of habitation, including the fires that residents build for cooking and heat.Life here is difficult, Marzia, 30, said. Water must be fetched from a nearby stream, and a 9-volt battery charges a solar panel that provides light after dark. Cooking is done on a stove fuelled by a gas bottle. They have installed a door and a step up into the one room that all seven members of the family share. Smaller caves outside are used for storage.On the rural outskirts of the city, amid the rutted fields where the provinces main potato crop is grown, the cave-dwellers do what they can with their meagre resources, determined that the next generation will have a better life. As Shia Muslims of the Hazara minority they have suffered historic persecution, but they have also benefited from immense largesse from international charities and governments.Amid an intensifying Taliban-led insurgency, Bamiyan is a haven of peace, as the Shia Hazaras have successfully kept the war off their territory since the end of the Sunni Talibans regime, under which they were persecuted and much of the provinces Buddhist heritage destroyed. A proliferation in recent years of all-covering burqas and hijabs among the local women attests to a growing concern about the war as it spreads elsewhere in the country.High ambitionFreshta Ahmadi runs a school for 25 children aged 4 to 9 years old, who gather in the living room of her familys three-room cave home six days a week to learn reading, writing and mathematics. Freshta is 18, in her last year of secondary school and hopes one day to become a doctor. She has been running the cave school since 2012 with money donated by Parsa, an Afghan charity.These children are from poor families, their fathers are itinerant workers, farmers, or refugees from other poorer areas, she said. Their circumstances dont dampen ambition, however the children, mostly girls, stand in turn at the whiteboard, complete a few exercises in front of their classmates, then reiterate their plans for a future as doctors, police officers or engineers.Bamiyan is probably best known as the site of two massive Buddhas, one 55 meters tall, the other 38 meters tall, that were carved into the cliff face above the modern city between the 4th and 6th Centuries and which were destroyed by the Taliban at the urging of al-Qaida in early 2001, in a defiant show of extremist power and hubris ahead of the attacks on the United States on September 11 that year.UNESCO has classified the cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley as a world heritage site representing Buddhist and Islamic religious and artistic developments from the 1st to 13th Centuries.

We accepted initial couple of days inconvenience as our contribution to fight against corruption. But now the situation is fast changing, people need swift access to their own money for their daily needs, said Sangram Keshari Rout, a resident of Sahidnagar of the city.The scene across the city looked similar to situation witnessed after any disaster. People would keep waiting nearby ATMs for our hours. Once they would spot a vehicle coming for cash replenishment, they would lose no time to form queues before ATM counters. Almost all localities of the capital city witnessed similar sights.Small traders were worst hit as the demonetisation announcement made their business to nose-dive. I usually sell potato and onion worth Rs. 10,000 everyday and it goes up to Rs. 15,000 on Sundays. However, I have not touched Rs. 3,000 today, said Pratap Swain, a trader in Unit-I market, of the city.Many grocery shops in colony areas have remained closed for past three days. If I will open my shop, my customers will request me to sell commodities on credit. I might face difficulties in recovering the money. It is better to keep the shop closed for a few more days, said Manua Das in Baranga market.Identical situation prevailed in almost all districts of the State. Consumers have cut down their volume of daily purchase while saving precious cash for emergency situation."

Normally, potatoes here sell like hot cakes.There is hardly any wholesaler or agro commodity trading house to buy potatoes in this area. Most of the farmers have been forced to sell the produce at rates almost less than the actual cost of production, Najaib Gill, a prominent potato grower on the outskirts of Una town, told IANS.He said this is the season when potatoes grown in low hills of the State, mainly in Una district, command monopoly in the markets of north Indian states of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Delhi.He said there is a huge demand for the potatoes in the plains.Since the production (in the hills) is optimal and the demand is high in the plains, we are not getting adequate prices as the traders say they have no cash in new currency notes, he added.Potato is one of the major cash crops grown in the lower and mid-hills of the State. Una district alone harvests potatoes on 700 hectares.The States potato yield was around 200,000 tonnes in 2015-16, while estimates this fiscal put the produce at 195,000 tonnes, according to the Himachal Pradesh Economic Survey for 2015-16.Besides Una district, the table potato is also cultivated in Bilaspur, Kangra, Mandi, Shimla, Solan and Kullu districts.The Lahaul Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district is known for producing virus-free potatoes that mainly find a market for plantation.Sarvjit Singh Dogra, state Agricultural Produce Market Committee Secretary in Una town, told IANS that a 50-kg bag of potatoes is fetching between Rs 400 and Rs 425 in Una, while it sold for around Rs 800 last year.Currently, potatoes are being retailed at Rs 30-35 per kg across the country.Growers are facing many hardships. Many are being forced to accept old currency notes.For more than a week there was no bulk buyer for potato. Finally, we have decided to sell the entire produce at almost half the rates by accepting old currency notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, said a farmer, requesting anonymity.He said if the government could allow use of old high denomination notes for purchasing seeds, it should also be liberal with the growers for accepting the banned notes for their produce till the new currency is in full circulation.Field reports say most of the farmers have delayed the harvesting of the potatoes till the prices spike again.Last week, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh expressed concern over lack of enthusiasm among the traders during centuries-old Lavi Fair, synonymous with trade in traditional items like hand-knitted woollens, farm implements and dry fruits as well as horses, yaks, sheep, at Rampur town, some 130 km from the state capital.The fair too was hit hard by the demonetisation decision.Its unfortunate that this year the trade fair was hit by the demonetisation of currency notes. People showed less enthusiasm during the fair as compared to previous years due the Centres decision, the Chief Minister said at the fairs closing ceremony.Himachal Pradesh annually earns Rs 2,500 crore from the cultivation of vegetables, while horticulture generates more than Rs 3,200 crore annually.-IANS"

Compare this with prices just a month ago, when tomato was retailing at Rs. 30 a kg. While a good yield over the last one month has normalised supply, tomato growers have now been affected by the post- demonetisation cash crunch.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and in case of tomato, even to Kolkata.Supply of tomatoes to Tamil Nadu was affected during the Cauvery crisis. Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato grower from Nukkanahalli in Kolar disitrct, and added that farmers were suffering huge losses.Vegetable prices have also been crashing: a kg of beans is now selling at Rs. 14, onion at Rs. 16 and potato at Rs. 26. The prices took a hit over the last two weeks. This is despite the fact that November and December usually see vegetables retailing at higher prices in Bengaluru.The prices have come down by over 30 per cent in the last week alone, said a senior official heading the vegetable procurement section in a leading retail chain.Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms, said that another reason for the falling prices has been falling retail sales, indicating lower consumption of vegetables, creating a high supply and low demand cycle.However, procurement officials fear that the supply-demand cycle may soon be reversed if the cash crunch continues for a longer period, affecting crop patterns.Now, vegetable growers are resorting to distress sale. But they are not being paid for their produce immediately, further worsening the cash crunch. If this affects sowing this season, then we will soon stare at low supplies and skyrocketing prices, the official said.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to markets"

So much so that Tipu is part of the folklore in the area, he said.Criticising the disinformation campaign against Tipu by the BJP and the Sangh Parivar, Dr. Dwarakanath said there was enough evidence to prove that the the ruler was a true nationalist and a patriot, as evinced by his dogged opposition to the British rule.

It communicates to the farmer directly from the field, informing him about the status of the crop and its input requirements to achieve a targeted yield.The system simulates crop growth in response to weather and soil parameters and also generates an agro-advisory that is sent to the farmers mobile by SMS. It can be applied to multiple crops.Using sensors, the solar-powered device collects real-time data on the maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, precipitation, soil moisture content, wind velocity, and wind direction.The data are sent to a central server through a modem and run through a simulator to generate the advisory.According to V.S. Santhosh Mithra, Principal Scientist (Computer Applications), CTCRI, the system is expected to assist policy-makers and planners in tackling market risks emanating from unexpected production and fall in price. If the production can be estimated in advance, precautions can be taken to avoid such risks, he explains.By pooling the data from devices installed in different fields, E-Crop can be used for accurate crop forecasting at the local, regional and national level.Forecasting with the help of satellite data has limitations owing to problems in capturing images or poor resolution of pictures.Reliable forecastsBy collecting data directly from the field, E-Crop eliminates the problem, resulting in more reliable forecasts, Mr. Mithra says.The advisory is expected to give a boost to precision farming and help farmers resort to optimum application of agricultural inputs to maximise production.The first unit, currently undergoing field tests on sweet potato, has been found to generate real-time data with more than 90 per cent accuracy. The CTCRI is preparing to test the device on rice crop."

The community, which has remained loyal to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the years, has suffered close to 100 per cent fall in business. The office-bearers of at least three merchant associations in and around Burra Bazar said the BJP will pay dearly for demonetisation.There was hardly any customer in the first week. Business dropped by 100 per cent, said general secretary of the Posta Bazar Merchants Association, Biswanath Agarwal.The Posta Bazaar takes up the largest space in Burra Bazar  spread over almost two square kilometres  and hosts traders in pulses, sugar, oil, flour and lime. Mr. Agarwal said semi-wholesalers and retailers have started coming returning but the rise is only by about 20 per cent in the last two days.But Burra Bazars total turnover is much above 100 crore daily. The majority of the transaction is not in black but in cash. Thousands of crores has been lost in the last few days, said Mr. Agarwal.Not so hot potatoesThe president of the Posta Bazar Potato Merchants Association, Gurupada Sinha, who controls a substantial part of the business, said he would not be surprised if farmers commit suicide at the time of payment.Mr. Sinha, whose family has been in the trade for four generations, said the potato sowing season has started only about two weeks ago in Bengal.The seed and the raw material for cultivation arrive from Punjab and are sold in cash. But the farmer has no new cash and thus he would borrow from lenders and fail to repay it, he pointed out. The biggest panic is if the entire old currency, which is not necessarily black, will be rejected now as the exchange amount is getting reduced."

He said mild mist during the early stages of growth would result in better yield.The main vegetables cultivated in the villages are beetroot, carrot, potato, beans, and garlic.A Marayur Krishi Bhavan official said the farming season depended on the weather condition in the coming days. He said there were sudden changes in weather in Kanthallur, especially in the past three years, and they were analysing its impact on vegetable production.The cold wave has attracted a large number of visitors to Kanthallur. Most of the visitors are those coming to Munnar, where too the temperature has started to dip at the early stage of the tourist season."

I have a line of credit with the moneylender, said Prem Singh Pawar, 64, military-man-and-clerk-turned farmer.About Rs.10,000 is due but that will remain (in our accounts)and well adjust. I have not had a problem with getting wheat seeds. This assertion seems to be borne out by data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture. As of November 11, rabi crop had been sown on 146.85 lakh hectares compared to 126.71 lakh hectares at this time in 2015. Wheat had been sown/transplanted in 25.72 lakh hectares as opposed to 18.65 lakh hectares last year.Palpable crisisBut the crunch of readily-available cash is palpable. In the towns main vegetable market where, apart from fresh produce, seeds, pesticide and fertilizer are traded, private traders are furious. Sales of pesticides and fertilizers are down 50 per cent, said Ashok Gupta, 30, a trader, Nobody is buying anything and our stocks are fast approaching the expiry date. They will be useless in two weeks.Mr. Gupta said his business was heavily dependent on cash, but added that he occasionally deposited some savings in his bank account. This year, he saw customers shifting to the Haryana Seed Development Corporation store  a State-run store three doors away  that was accepting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. We got a call from the Agriculture Department asking us to accept these notes, said Ajit Singh Gulia, who runs the store.But I spend a few hours after lunch everyday to deposit these notes, he said.

They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesnt extend credit any longer. Chitra cant pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so, Ms. Bag told this reporter. We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit, Ms Bag said.Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer  a middle-aged man  said he could not extend any more credit as customers were paying in old bank notes.Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land  second only to Uttar Pradesh  was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the States total area. Since Bengals industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato.Ms. Bag  who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May  had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes.He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was a time-consuming affair in the potato sowing season.The potato seeds  which are tubers of the previous year  are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.Crisis timeSince stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes, Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds, warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.We are helplessThe officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur  Sethia Cold Storage  accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. We are instructed not to accept old currency notes, an official of Sethia Cold Storage said .Former president of Cold Storage Owners Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be difficult for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government should intervene.Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants federation and Bengals Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday.The problem, however, remains unresolved, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected, he warned.They are distressed as they do not have new currency to withdraw seeds from cold storage facilities"

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

Shimla-based Telugu apple grower Velladi Purushottama Rao has taken upon himself to make Lambasingi in Visakhapatnam Agency area of Andhra Pradesh the second Shimla of the country.Mr. Rao has been growing apples in Shimla for the past ten years and has become an authority recognised by the Andhra Pradesh Horticulture Department. A native of Kondapalli, his interest in potato farming took him to Shimla. But once he got to the foothills of the Himalayas, he fell in love with apples. In 2006, he leased out five acres of land and has been successfully growing apples in Shimla ever since.Mr. Purushottama Rao says that Lambasingi is better suited for apple cultivation than Shimla because the apple tree does not go into a dormant phase and can therefore produce two crops in a year. The tree yields fruits in the third year and by the fifth year the yield reaches the peak of 20 kg per tree, he said.Crucial meetingA crucial meeting of 90 farmers organised by the Department of Horticulture and Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) on Wednesday rekindled the hope that the dream of the South Indian apple would come true soon.Horticulture Project Officer G. Prabhakara Rao said that ITDA Project Director and IAS officer Ravi Panthamsetti explained to the farmers how apple cultivation would change the economy of the place.Mr. Prabhakara Rao said that two varieties of apples Anna and Dorcet Golden were found to be ideally suited for Lambasingi. Over 10,000 plants would be distributed to farmers in January. Input subsidy would also be given to them for the next three years until the first harvest.Mr. Purushottama Rao said that attempts to cultivate apple on a large scale have failed in South India till now.In an earlier attempt, 300 to 400 trees were planted on a trial basis at the Chinthapalli Regional Agricultural Research Station at Lambasingi. At that time horticulture scientists predicted that the first South Indian apples grown at Lambasingi would hit the market this year. but that did not happen. He said that the yield at the Chinthapalli Research Station was low because of improper pruning which was very important for apples.Attempts were made to grow apples in Coorg in 2012 itself, but cultivation of the fruit there has not yet taken off there."

Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion from Confederation of All India Traders industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency.He added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to insufficient currency notes. The main market areas in Bengaluru were also impacted. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50,000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs daily, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers.Note shortageIn Kolkata, Anupam Boral, who runs a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises, said the shortage of Rs.100 notes is also hurting business. He said he was finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs.100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute.In Coimbatore, confusion and misinformation prevail with regard to cash and withdrawal limits.

But worry looms over the otherwise festive atmosphere. The rain gods have not been kind this year. Groundnut produce has dropped to 40 per cent of last years yield, says farmer Somashekar from Laggere.Bad rain and huge investments in water tankers have resulted in the price of groundnuts shooting up to Rs. 2,000 for a 60-kg sack. This year, small traders have paid Rs. 5,500 per sack compared to Rs. 3,500 last year.If you add transportation costs of Rs. 200, roasting Rs. 200, and cleaning Rs. 100 per sack, then our margins are slim, says Kumar, a groundnut trader from Gavipuram, who has been attending the parishe for the last 25 years.An acre of groundnut crop requires 14 tankers of water once a week for four months. Each tanker costs Rs. 300. This is the economics behind the steep rise in price, said farmers Mani and Manohar from Yediyur. They are, however, quick to add that almost every one at the parishe sells at the same rate for each variety of the nut.We come here three days a year as we are happy to offer our produce to Lord Basava, said Mr. Mani, who grows onion, potato, and garlic the rest of the year.What seems hard for the farmers to shake off is the use of plastic bags. The BMS college students and teachers, who source cotton bags especially for the parishe, supply it free to us, but many who buy in large quantities insist on using only plastic bags. We are helpless, said another farmer, Nagaraju.History rememberedFive lakh people visit the parishe every year and generate business of about Rs. 1 crore from nearly 1,000 farmers, according to authorities at the Bull Temple.

Now, they wait there all day, hoping to find work.We havent had any work since the notebandi [demonetisation] was announced. So every day all of us go to the gurdwara to eat one meal, said Gulfam, a painter, pointing towards the out-of-work labourers sitting around the chowk.No other optionSujit, a welder who also has had no work for two weeks, added: We dont have any other option, so we eat lunch at the gurdwara . Sometimes people go to the temples when there is food being distributed there.At the gurdwara , the kitchen continues to serve vegetables, lentils, rice, roti and halwa for all.On Friday afternoon, the staff and volunteers were busy serving potatoes and dal for lunch and preparing a turnip dish for dinner.The kitchen in-charge, who did not want to be named, scurried around the roti section, where an automated roti machine was being repaired.Busy kitchenIt can make 4,000 rotis in an hour and uses 10 sacks of flour every day, he said, adding that he hoped it would be repaired before dinner.Ravinder Singh Lovely, the chairperson of Sis Ganj Gurdwara and a member of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, said that the langar had always been busy. About 8,000 people eat here every day.But we have seen an increase in the number of people coming since the demonetisation announcement, he said, adding that gurdwaras across Delhi feed more than a lakh visitors every day.We havent hadany work sincethe notebandi [demonetisation] was announced.

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, said both wholesale and retail vegetable dealers were facing losses since demonetisation of the two high value currencies. Vegetable markets are yet to bounce back from the effect, he said.The rates of vegetables have dipped by 5 to 6 per cent in the last few weeks. Business has gone down by nearly 50 per cent. At least half of the stock of vegetables is going waste with no takers. Many vendors have been forced to dump the vegetables as they perish quickly, he said.He added that people did not have money, and hence, the markets were dull with no business. Until a few days ago, we were accepting the old Rs. 500 notes from customers, while we were accepting the old Rs. 1,000 till last week. We have stopped accepting these notes as we do not have change to give in return, Mr. Balu added.The cost of tomatoes is Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 a kg while onions are priced between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15 (fresh onions) while the old onions are priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20. Small onions cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 while potatoes cost Rs. 20.The cost of other vegetables (per kilo): ladys finger  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, drumstick  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, brinjal  Rs. 15 to Rs. 30, cabbage  Rs. 10, carrot  Rs. 15, beans  Rs. 12, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, ginger  Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, broad beans  Rs. 20, bitter gourd  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, snake gourd  Rs. 12, yam  Rs. 20, peas  Rs. 80, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 15."

I saw a girl running up and down the stadiums steps. She was hardly 16 or 17 and not a Communist Party cadre. She was running up to talk to the people and coming down to have a word with the top leaders of the party, even cracking jokes with them, Ashok Mitra, writer and former Finance Minister of West Bengal, said, adding that what he saw underscored one of Fidel Castros primary achievements.Castros achievementsIn country after country, socialists pledged to reduce the gap between the leaders and the led. But Cuba achieved it under Fidel Castro, said the octogenarian writer, a big admirer of Castro and Cuba.However, Mr. Mitra never met Castro, not even when the Cuban leader visited Kolkata in 1973, and rather wrote an acerbic piece, A Revolutionary Handshake .Fifty years ago, what Washington dictated was mutely obeyed by the pack of Latin American countries, mostly ruled by military generals. Fidel changed this scenario. He managed to instil a pride among the Latin American countries. The fact that the U.S. is getting edged out [today] in Latin America, failing to revive old capitalist order, is largely due to Castro, he said.There was a rigid Soviet line  even among Indian Communists  which was not impressed by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedongs revolution. Mao took a dig at Marx. Marx assumed revolution can only take place when a state reaches a certain maturity, Mr. Mitra said.But Mao demonstrated that those described as a sack of potatoes  the peasantry  could be mobilised for social revolution and similar events unfolded in Cuba. When Castro initiated his movement and moved to the mountains, he was severely criticized by the Cuban Communists for his infantile venture.But as Castro emerged successful, it was these leaders who surrendered [to Castro] and this was a huge achievement in 1950s Cuba, said Mr. Mitra.The other aspect is the influence of Castro on the social and cultural scene of South America and the world. Even [late Colombian writer] Gabriel Garca Mrquez publicly said his great inspiration was Castro. But, as Mao said, it takes a millennium to judge a phenomenon  it would take many years to understand and analyse Fidel Castro, the veteran Marxist said."

R.M. Satish, director of the Mysore Grain Merchants Association and a wholesale dealer of rice, told The Hindu that trade volume was down by 80 per cent in the first two weeks after demonetisation was announced on November 8. But for the first time since then, we observed a revival on Monday, with a perceptible increase in both unloading and loading of commodities, he said.During the pre-demonetisation days, I used to trade in nearly 100 quintals of rice a day. It slumped to around 20 quintals after [the announcement]. But since Monday, there has been a surge in supply, fuelled by demand, and the trading is around 50 quintals, he said. However, the general feeling is that it will take another two months for trading to touch the pre-demonetisation levels. Merchants at the APMC yard in Mysuru procure rice from Raichur, Siruguppa, Ballari and even Chhattisgarh to meet local demand and to cater to traders from Kerala.Hinting at an improvement in the currency supply, Chetan, a wholesale dealer of potatoes and onions, said this was reflected in the market trading fuelled by demand and supply. Earlier, he used to sell nearly 300 sacks of onions and 200 sacks of potatoes of 50 to 55 kg each. The numbers crashed after November 8, but this week he has seen increased trading. He expressed confidence in his business hitting pre-demonetisation levels within two weeks.Sajjan Raj Mehta, who deals in spices and dry fruits and procures the bulk of his products from Bengaluru, said, We are seeing some positive signs of revival for the first time. But it will take at least two months to get back to normal levels of trading.The APMC yard in Mysuru is a major hub from where commodities are transported to other parts of the district and to border areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The yard used to receive nearly 150 outstation trucks loaded with commodities daily, but the numbers plummeted by 80 per cent in the first two weeks after demonetisation. Though the traffic has increased since Monday, it is still nowhere close to the pre-demonetisation days."

The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

RavindranR_RAVINDRANWhen Columbus first discovered America, he brought to the land not just people, but a host of plants, animals, viruses and bacteria, leading to a collision of ecologies that had been separated for hundreds of years and that, says Charles C. Mann, journalist, author and scientific writer, was when true globalisation began.Mr. Mann was speaking on Friday at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation on his book, 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created.Calling the ecological impacts of the movement of animals and plants, along with people and commodities across continents as important, Mr. Mann traced the history of the potato from the Andes to Europe, the growth in the production of potatoes being instrumental in feeding large segments of the European population and thereby an increase in the population and more stable governments in Europe.He even quoted a historian as saying the potato was the fuel that led to European colonisation of other parts of the world.Mr. Mann also spoke of the arrival of a pathogen from overseas leading to the devastating potato blight of the 1840s.In China, Mr. Mann said with practically no flat land and no water and with difficulties in growing rice, when maize and sweet potato were introduced, terrace farming took hold, which then contributed to terrible floods every year for a hundred years due to the erosion of soil which filled up rivers.Gift to AmericaMr. Mann also spoke of diseases and genetic immunity, calling malaria Columbus gift to America. He spoke of human beings developing genetic immunity to certain strains of malaria in regions such as Africa, where the disease is endemic and the death of British troops in Africa as they had no immunity against malaria and yellow fever.He linked the slave trade to the deaths due to these diseases and the lack of sufficient availability of indentured labour, which existed before the slave trade began.Prof. M.S. Swaminathan spoke of similar impacts in India, such as people in parts of the northeast where malaria is endemic, developing sickle cell traits and of the countrys food crops, most of which are not of Indian origin. He said the globalisation of genetic resources could have beneficial effects if done with care.N. Ram, chairman, Kasturi and Sons, participated."

While the new generation of the farm community is abandoning cultivation of traditional tuber crops, Mr. Shaji and his family have been conserving tuber seeds for the next generation.He has also established a network of farmers through an informal seed distribution mechanism by which a farmer transfers seeds to anybody on condition that the same amount is returned next year.When I started to collect seeds of tuber crops nearly 20 years ago many of my friends made fun of me.

This time, the Agriculture Department provided Rs.20,000 to the farmers for each hectare of land under cultivation and more areas were brought under vegetable farming.An office-bearer of Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Producing and Marketing Agency, that procures vegetables directly from farmers, said around 70 per cent of vegetables was sent directly to the Kerala markets.If Vegetables and Fruit Promotion Council, Kerala (VFPCK) would also intensify procurement, all the vegetables produced could be brought to the markets in the State.The prices of the main vegetables this season are: potato, Rs.19 to 20; carrot, Rs. 14 to 18; and cabbage, Rs. 5 to 8. Now an average of 18 tonne of vegetables are procured by the government agencies from Vattavada. Horticorp owes Rs.15 lakh to the farmers as dues for purchasing vegetables for the past two months. According to the farmers, if timely procurement is done by the government agencies, the movement of vegetables to Tamil Nadu can be fully stopped."

Swaminathan Research Foundation on his book, 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created.Calling the ecological impacts of the movement of animals and plants, along with people and commodities across continents as important, Mr. Mann traced the history of the potato from the Andes to Europe, the growth in the production of potatoes being instrumental in feeding large segments of the European population and thereby an increase in the population and more stable governments in Europe.He even quoted a historian as saying the potato was the fuel that led to European colonisation of other parts of the world.Mr. Mann also spoke of the arrival of a pathogen from overseas leading to the devastating potato blight of the 1840s.In China, Mr. Mann said with practically no flat land and no water and with difficulties in growing rice, when maize and sweet potato were introduced, terrace farming took hold, which then contributed to terrible floods every year for a hundred years due to the erosion of soil which filled up rivers.Mr. Mann also spoke of diseases and genetic immunity, calling malaria Columbus gift to America.He spoke of human beings developing genetic immunity to certain strains of malaria in regions such as Africa, where the disease is endemic and the death of British troops in Africa as they had no immunity against malaria and yellow fever.He linked the slave trade to the deaths due to these diseases and the lack of sufficient availability of indentured labour, which existed before the slave trade began.Prof. M.S. Swaminathan spoke of similar impacts in India, such as people in parts of the northeast where malaria is endemic, developing sickle cell traits and of the countrys food crops, most of which are not of Indian origin.He said the globalisation of genetic resources could have beneficial effects if done with care.N. Ram, chairman, Kasturi and Sons, participated.Collision of ecologies that began with movement of plants and animals heralded globalisation"

So, the farmers have not been able to prepare the fields for potato cultivation.Second, many of those who have harvested their paddy have not been able to secure loans from cooperative banks to cultivate paddy. The cooperative banks are running short of cash as the lead banks have not been able to give them enough money because of demonetisation.Third, traders, who buy a part of farmers' produce before the government begins procurement, drove a hard bargain this time, taking advantage of the cash crunch.""If 3 lakh hectares are cultivated, the total production will be around 70 lakh tonnes. The state's annual consumption requirement is 60 lakh tonnes. We would not face much of a problem but the rural economy will take a hit,"" an official said."

According to the India Meteorological Department website, the temperature in Bhagalpur was 10.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. It might have dipped further at some places. The weather department at Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour, said there was no relief in sight from the cold for now. Bhagalpur and its neighbouring districts in eastern Bihar along with Kosi and Seemanchal region will continue to experience intense cold weather for the next few weeks, they said. According to Sunil Kumar, head of the weather department of BAU, Sabour, it is possible that the minimum temperature could fall even further in the coming days, though the maximum temperature will not fluctuate much. Sunil denied the possibility of rain in the coming days, and said the department has given instructions to farmers - particularly Rabi crop farmers - on how to irrigate their fields. Potato farmers have been advised to uproot potatoes if the crop is ready or else the cold would destroy it. Lallan Roy, a farmer at Rannuchak, under the jurisdiction of Nathnagar block, said low temperatures generally benefit wheat, vegetables and potatoes, but ""potatoes will be destroyed if it rains."" ""After the devastating floods in August, we now have to face this cold. Life has come to a standstill,"" lamented Anandi Mandal, a daily wage earner at Sabour.

The riots had shattered the equations between the Jat and Muslim community in the area, a combined vote base that his party traditionally depended on.He said he had tried for this kind of consolidation of erstwhile socialists or members of the Janata Parivar to bring farmers interests back to the forefront of politics, but it had not been possible.We did try to bring together former socialists of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, at least for a rally and even that did not happen. You will have to ask [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam Singh why he didnt come for the rally on October 12, he said.Mr. Singhs party had organised a Kisan Swabhiman rally on October 12 and many members of the erstwhile socialist block had participated in it with Mr. Mulayam Singh being conspicuous by his absence.Mr. Singh has entered into an alliance with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (U) for the U.P. elections.Why scrap import duty?Mr. Singh said the removal of import duty on wheat, coming as it does on the back of expectations of a bumper crop domestically this year (after two years of drought) does not make sense.The imported wheat will be hitting our markets just as procurement will start here. I dont understand the logic unless it is to make sure our farmers dont recover their costs, leave alone make profits, he said. According to him, even in the case of paddy, the situation was dire. While the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is Rs. 1470, the real price offered is around Rs. 800-900 with the Uttar Pradesh government not having set up even purchase centres for paddy.Markets in distressDemonetisation had rung the death knell for vegetable farmers as the largely cash-based supply chain to mandis and retail outlets was shattered, he said.Vegetable farmers, potato farmers are in deep distress. The Central government has no understanding of the rural economy. The importance that the agricultural sector has not just in food production but also in ensuring buoyancy in rural demand and economy in general is not being understood by Delhi.Much of rural demand depends on what a farmer earns in the harvest season, and these policies have jeopardised that, Mr. Ajit Singh added.We tried to bring together members of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, but it did not happen: Ajit Singh"

Not only Chatoi, many other traders at the mandi are facing problems in arranging smaller currency notes even after almost one month of the demonetisation. Most of the traders have to depend on the cash collected from the daily sale of their products to make payments to labourers and meet other expenses. The cash crunch has adversely affected the overall business transactions of the traders at Chatra Bazaar by almost 30 per cent in the past one month. ""Though most of the traders here have started to make payments through cheques to their counterparts in neighbouring states, we are facing problems as we have to make daily payments to the labourers in smaller currency notes, which are not readily available,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi also claimed that the closure of banks for three consecutive days also had led to shortage of cash as most of the ATMs also ran dry till late in the afternoon today. ""I could not make payments to my staff and labourers as I had withdrawn cash for the last time on Friday. The retail traders are also making payments to us in new Rs 2,000 currencies. The situation at the market is unlikely to improve till supply of Rs 500 notes are not increased along with the weekly withdrawal cap of Rs 24,000 per week,"" Chatoi added. Around 5,000 people comprising wholesale, retail traders, middlemen, farmers and labourers are directly involved in the daily fruits and vegetable trade at Chatra bazaar that caters to the bulk of the vegetable requirement not only for the people of Cuttack but for nearby cities also. Chatra bazaar usually registers a daily business to the tune of Rs 2 to 3 crore and 50 to 60 trucks are engaged in transportation of goods to other parts of the state. Now, only 25 to 35 trucks are arriving on a daily basis here. ""There was sharp fall in the booking of stocks from neighbouring states, including Andhra Pradesh and Bengal, during initial period of the demonetisation. However, the situation has improved considerably in the past one week,"" said Kedarnath Lenka, another trader. Lenka said that a truck full of vegetables from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh costs nearly Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000 per trip, while daily payments to labourers vary from Rs 2,000 to 3, 500 per day, including some cash payment to drivers. Earlier, all the traders used to make payments in cash through the drivers arriving from various states with commodities. A senior member of the Chatra Bazaar traders association, Devendra Sahu said despite the financial crisis, there had been no hike in the prices of vegetables in the past one month due to good harvest and production of locally produces from Athgarh, Banki and other nearby areas in the district. ""The retail traders are now depending on the vegetables such as cauliflower, cucumber, tomatoes, brinjals grown by farmers of nearby areas to meet the requirements. As a result, there is no pressure on wholesale traders for bulk import of such vegetables which are perishable items from the neighbouring states,"" said Sahu. Traders at Chatra Bazaar mostly imports tomatoes, peas, coconuts, pumpkin, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits including apple, orange and grapes from neighbouring states, including Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharastra."

The state has been facing an acute shortage of essential items since the United Naga Council (UNC) enforced an economic blockade on November 1. Now, the state's other lifeline is choked. The UNC has imposed an indefinite economic blockade to protest against the state government's move to carve out a separate Sadar Hills district from Senapati district and Jiribam district out of Imphal East. The blockade has cut off the state's lifeline - the Imphal-Dimapur road (National Highway 2). As a result, traffic has increased substantially along the Imphal-Jiribam road. But fears of an impending collapse of the Barak bridge led to only 220 loaded trucks (out of 693 lined up at Jiribam) leaving for Imphal this morning with security escorts. The 220 trucks include 43 trucks of petrol, 81 trucks loaded with diesel, 85 LPG bullets, 10 aviation turbine fuel carriers and one truck loaded with oxygen cylinders. The increased traffic has worsened the Barak bridge's condition. Transporters and the government had chosen NH 37 because it would be less affected by the blockade. Following the arrest of UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary S.K. Stephen on November 25, the blockade has intensified. Essential commodities have become scarce and prices skyrocketed, with petrol reaching Rs 300 per litre and potatoes selling for Rs 50 per kg. The valley residents have responded with a counter- blockade. Movement of goods vehicles towards Naga-inhabited districts have been hampered. Yesterday, 209 vehicles stranded at Moreh were escorted safely to Imphal. The All Manipur Christian Organisation and Tribal Church Leader Forum today urged the United Committee Manipur to reconsider its ultimatum served to the UNC to lift the blockade within 72 hours, ending at midnight tonight. Christian leaders have urged the UNC to withdraw the blockade. Rev. Prim Vaiphei, president of the All Manipur Christian Organisation, said people had suffered enough for 37 days. He requested the UNC leaders to lift the blockade yesterday and they pointed out that the economic blockade was not against any particular community but against the state government. The All Manipur Muslim Welfare Organisation has also urged the UNC to end its blockade."

I dont have the time to stand in long bank queues either. He has taken the one route available to him: cutting down on production. From 10-12kg of pulses a day, he now uses less than 8kg to prepare the vada mix. Even then, some part of the stuff still remains unused. Recently, a Paytm representative visited his stall to pitch the e-wallet payment option, Chauhan said. I refused since I dont understand the technicalities, he smiled. Satya Sanjay Dutt, owner of SK Dutt flower shop in New Market He has already had at least three large orders cancelled and sales at the start of the wedding season have been the lowest he has seen.

I refused, said Dutt, who accepts demonetised notes only from those with whom he has been doing business for decades. This time last year, we would sell around 500 locally grown roses daily. Now its difficult to sell even 300 roses, rued Dutt, whose family has been selling flowers for three generations. According to him, florists have been hit the hardest because in a marriage nobody compromises on food. If needed, the axe falls on floral decorations and other such expenditure, he said.

Shibajis family has been running the 144-year-old watering hole for five generations. In the first couple of days (after the cash curbs were announced), we did see a dip in sales.

Picture by Surajit Roy Dec. 15: From murder to disenchantment to skewering questions, seemingly unconnected events in the past 24 hours in places far apart from one another have brought to the fore the unintended consequences of demonetisation in the country. Over 100 factory owners in Amritsar have handed over keys of their units to the district administration in a symbolic protest that stood out in sharp contrast with the public pronouncements of support for demonetisation from most of corporate India. ""The problem is very simple. We cannot run our units any more. Let the government do it,"" said Amit Dalmiya, who runs a textile processing unit in Amritsar. ""If Modiji can run the country, he can also run the industry... it is a question of survival and the situation has gone beyond us,"" Krishna Kumar Sharma, the president of the Amritsar Textile Processor Association, told The Telegraph this evening. One industrialist who sought anonymity indicated his political choice. Without naming anyone, he said: "" Pehli baar to aadmi par bharosa hota hi hai... baad mein pata chalta hai.... (The first time you do trust a man... then realisation dawns). They did not go into demonetisation with full planning."" On Wednesday, the industrialists handed over the keys to the additional deputy commissioner, Tajinderpal Singh Sandhu. Amritsar is home to around 60 textile processing units on which another 700-800 embroidery, knitting and weaving units are dependent. ""At this moment our units are running at 20 per cent of the optimum capacity.... The labour strength had to be halved because of the prevailing economic situation,"" said Sharma. The units have been hit badly because of sudden cancellation of bulk orders since the demonetisation drive started. ""If a person manages to withdraw Rs 2,000 from an ATM, he will buy food and not clothes,"" said an industrialist. A contract worker with HDFC Bank was stabbed to death in Gujarat by three people with whom he had allegedly struck a deal to exchange notes. Rajesh Bhilariya, 27, was called today afternoon to a village in Junagadh where he was allegedly supposed to accept Rs 9 lakh in old notes and hand over new ones, police inspector Ashok Tilva said. Rajesh worked as a "" mitra"" or ""correspondent"" (effectively rural agents) of the bank. Police said Rajesh had reached the spot with his cousin. But the three would-be cash recipients snatched the bag with the new notes and tried to escape. When Rajesh tried to stop them, he was stabbed, the police said. An SBI branch and an adjoining ATM kiosk were ransacked in Malda today after hundreds of account holders seeking cash for family weddings, potato cultivation and travel were told each could withdraw no more than Rs 3,000. The account holders had queued up at the Balupur branch in Ratua, around 50km from Malda, from daybreak. The SBI branch, with 3,500 account holders, is the sole bank in the area. Saidul Sheikh, who was in the queue, said the bank staff initially offered only Rs 1,000 when depositors demanded the weekly quota of Rs 24,000. The amount was then raised to Rs 2,000 and then Rs 3,000. The trouble broke out around noon. The bank employees and officers fled. Mushref Miyan, a trader, said he was becoming increasingly nervous. ""My daughter's wedding is on Sunday. The Prime Minister had said we could draw Rs 24,000 each week. I have about Rs 80,000 in my account. But the bank is offering Rs 1,000 and I am really feeling frustrated. The people erupted today,"" he said. Subol Pal, a farmer, said he needed Rs 40,000 immediately. ""I am not being able to start my potato and vegetable cultivation as I need to invest Rs 40,000. The cash crisis is affecting hundreds of farmers like me,"" Pal said. Ankan Paul, the manager of the Balupur SBI branch, said: ""We are helpless. We are distributing whatever cash we are being sent. The bank was shut down after the violence."" Arun Kumar Sinha, the SBI regional manager, said that things were expected to normalise after tomorrow. BJP parliamentarians and party office bearers have told Amit Shah that the government needs to ensure adequate flow of cash in banks to check discontent among the people despite continued support for demonetisation. ""The public mood is still in favour of the government on demonetisation but people are facing hardships due to the shortage of cash. The government has to increase the cash flow to keep the people favourable,"" one MP from eastern Uttar Pradesh was quoted as having told a meeting on Wednesday evening. Concerned by the feedback, the BJP leadership had called separate meetings of party MPs and office bearers on Wednesday and Thursday. The Supreme Court today took note of growing instances of new currency notes being funnelled out of banks and asked the Centre ""you are not able to secure it?"" The court also grilled the government on withdrawing exemptions granted to hospitals and pharmacies for accepting the demonetised notes. The apex court underscored that although the government claimed that it had infused new currency worth Rs 5 lakh crore into the system, the ground reality was that people were not able to get even the promised Rs 24,000 per week.

Chandrachud, attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi said certain bank officials were diverting the money. ""Bank managers had done this fraud.... The Government of India can't sit in every bank and monitor. We are having raids every day."" The submission invited a repartee from Justice Thakur and triggered titters in the courtroom: ""So your Rs 5 lakh crore has gone this way. You are not able to secure it?"" When the attorney-general contended that there had been no complaint or protests from the common man on withdrawal of exemptions, Justice Thakur asked: ""You expect all people to come here? Please tell us what is your apprehension? What is wrong in exempting government hospitals? How can it be misused in government hospitals?"""

The measures were taken following last week's temporary ban ordered by the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority (Bafra) on import of these vegetables. Confirming the development, the secretary-general of the Bhutan-India Friendship Association, Gelephu chapter, Ugyen Rabten, said: ""There has been strict surveillance on vegetables imported from India. It is much less now, but still continuing as local supply is not enough to meet the demands downstream."" Rabten said the ban is mostly on vegetables produced at Falakata in West Bengal and Barpeta in Assam, which are said to have high pesticide content. ""There will be proper monitoring of the imports now,"" he said. Assam shares 261km of the 700km international border with Bhutan. Of this, Kokrajhar shares 85km, Baksa 83km, Chirang 40km and Udalguri 53km of international border with Bhutan. People from Bhutan purchase most of the vegetables from border areas at Datgiri in Chirang besides Darangamela, Kumarikata, Subankhata and Nikashi in Baksa and Bhairabkhunda in Udalguri districts in Assam. The Bhutan media has reported that the agriculture and forest ministry last week had asked Bafra to clamp a temporary ban on import of beans and cauliflowers following lab tests that showed pesticide residues higher than the permissible limit for human consumption. Reports, quoting a ministry press release, said: ""Following the recent positive test results confirmed through use of the test kits for imported fruits and vegetables, the samples of selected 10 imported fruits and vegetables have been tested in three reference food laboratories in India and Thailand."" Assam agriculture commissioner Amlan Baruah told The Telegraph in Guwahati this evening that he is not aware of the ban, but now that the matter has been brought to the notice of the state government, it will definitely examine the issue. ""Buying and selling of agri/horti produce are private activities and do not come under the purview of the agriculture department, but we will look into it since a neighbouring country is involved. We will be issuing advisories to the growers to follow the guidelines developed by our state university on use of pesticides. The ban would also have its impact on the growers about benefits of using pesticides judiciously,"" Baruah said. Sources said the ban has affected bean growers in lower Assam districts. Initially, the ban was imposed on import of potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, beans, cabbages and cauliflowers from Indian markets. But as the production of organic vegetables goes down in Bhutan, demand for vegetables grown in the border districts goes up. ""So, except beans, all other vegetables have been supplied to Bhutan as before,"" a vegetable vendor from Chirang district said. The demand of vegetables grown in India is more in Bhutan because of their cheap price compared to vegetables produced in that country, a police source at Datgiri in the India-Bhutan bordering area and one of the gateways to Bhutan, told The Telegraph. Bhutan nationals in Sarpang district of that country buy green vegetables from a big weekly market at Datgiri in India every Thursday. ""The market survives on buyers from Bhutan,"" Nandalal Mogor, a youth of Runikhta in Chirang district, said. According to a section of farmers in Chirang, growers in West Bengal use higher amount of fertilisers and chemical pesticides. ""Vegetable farmers in lower Assam use fertilisers and chemicals wisely. Early seasonal vegetables need high amount of chemicals for growth and their prices are also high because of the cost of the chemicals,"" farmers in the Bengtol area in Chirang said."

The area falls under the jurisdiction of Ahiyapur police station. Cops suspect it to be the handiwork of extortionists. The criminals also looted Rs 5 lakh from Ramu's shop and took away two mobile phones and other precious belongings. Deputy SP Ashish Anand said Ramu, a resident of Nanpur Bhakra village under adjoining Sitamarhi district, was a wholesale dealer of potato. His body was found early this morning when other shopkeepers noticed blood trickling out from the downed shutter of the shop and raised an alarm. There are more than 200 wholesale outlets of fruit, fish, vegetables, fertilisers, foodgrain, onions and potatoes located on the sprawling premises of the marketing yard. Angered over the murder of Ramu, vegetable owners downed shutters to protest the growing menace of extortionists and criminals. According to sources, extortionists collected levy from businessmen in the market yard every month clandestinely and those unwilling to oblige were threatened of dire consequences, alleged Bhola Rai, an onion trader of Sharfuddinpur village. The police sent the body to SKMCH for a post-mortem. ""The murder is aimed at creating a fear psychosis among the businessmen and collect extortion money,"" said Dinesh Kumar, a fertiliser trader. Police have lodged an FIR of loot and murder of the businessman against unidentified criminals. The cops have recovered a pistol and a knife. A truck driver, who was sleeping near the incident spot, is being quizzed. DSP Anand said the deceased the criminals fired two bullets at his neck and an attempt was made to slit his throat. The DSP said the criminals tried to loot the money first and then he was killed. According to other shopkeepers in the vicinity, four youths known to Ramu had sipped tea with him sitting on the floor of the shop last night. ""Further investigation is in progress to nab killers,"" said the DSP."

Indian and American scientists have jointly discovered what they say is a novel, previously unrecognised association between the amount of potassium consumed in everyday diet and the risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, inflammatory chronic diseases affecting the small or large intestines. Their study, published yesterday in the research journal Frontiers in Immunology, has also identified a likely biological mechanism to explain how a potassium-rich diet might suppress the intestinal inflammation induced by the body's own immune system. ""We've seen potassium's protective effect and we think we also know how potassium protects the intestines,"" Amit Awasthi, an assistant professor at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad (Haryana), and the study's joint principal investigator in India, told The Telegraph. In the study, led by Andrew Chan from the Massachusetts General Hospital in the US, the researchers tracked over 194,700 women over many years. They found that those among them who excreted high potassium in their urine -- a signal of high dietary potassium intake - had lower risk of the inflammatory bowel diseases. Patients with these inflammatory diseases experience abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea with blood or pus, weight loss and fatigue, and other symptoms. Gastro-enterologists estimate that India has about 1.5 million patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. In laboratory experiments, the researchers also observed that exposure to potassium altered the behaviour of a set of immune system cells called T-cells that can induce the type of inflammation underlying the inflammatory bowel diseases. ""The potassium appears to reduce the inflammatory capacity of these T cells,"" said Awasthi, whose arm of the study was funded by a joint research alliance between the UK-based Wellcome Trust and the Union government's department of biotechnology. He said the Faridabad institute was hoping to collaborate with doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, to explore whether potassium could be used in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases. ""This is an interesting finding, but whether potassium, either through diet or pills, has any effect on decreasing inflammation in patients still needs to be investigated and established,"" said Vineet Ahuja, professor of gastro-enterology at AIIMS, who was not associated with the study. Inflammatory bowel diseases are primarily treated through steroids and drugs that can modulate the immune system. Limited surveys and anecdotal evidence suggests that India is witnessing a rise in the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. Some studies have suggested that ulcerative colitis is more prevalent in northern India while Crohn's disease is more common in southern India."
58e536ec7be9e05a951f5c46,Paddy alert in Bengal,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161123/jsp/nation/story_120840.jsp,2016-11-23,,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 22: Around 35 per cent of the monsoon paddy in Bengal could go waste because of the demonetisation drive, an agriculture department estimate has suggested. However, against the backdrop of chief minister Mamata Banerjee's vocal opposition to the domonetisation, a section of officials in Nabanna, the Bengal secretariat, felt it was ""a bit early"" to forecast crop losses. Nabanna sources said the department drew up a report on the basis of feedback from all the districts. The government sought the report to gauge the impact of the demonetisation on the harvesting of the monsoon paddy. After the Centre recalled the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, reports poured in from rural Bengal that farmers could not harvest the produce as they had no money to pay the daily labourers. ""The estimates mentioned in the report suggest that there could be a loss of 35 per cent of the total paddy produced in the kharif season. If the crop is not harvested, it will rot in the fields. If the situation does not change dramatically, the state's total rice production is bound to be hit this year,"" a senior Nabanna official said. According to agriculture department officials, if the kharif crop is not harvested by the end of November, the total production is affected. ""If the farmers keep paddy in the fields till the end of November, a large portion of the grain will fall off because of the changing weather conditions..... It will result in crop loss,"" another official said. This would mean the farmers will face difficulties in recovering their investments. Potato cultivation would also suffer if the kharif paddy is not harvested by the end of November, the sources said. ""The sowing of potato seeds needs to be completed by mid-December for a healthy production. If the kharif paddy remains in the fields till the end of November, farmers would not get time to prepare the fields to grow potato,"" an official said. Some Nabanna officials said the report was based on estimates and the final production amount would be calculated only after the harvesting is completed. ""It is a bit early to say that the state is going to face huge crop loss,"" an agriculture department official said. The report will be sent to the Centre tomorrow. The major chunk of the yearly paddy production is done in the kharif season. Bengal produces about 158 lakh tonnes of rice annually, of which 110 lakh tonnes are harvested in the kharif season. The annual consumption requirement is 150 lakh tonnes. ""If 35 per cent of the kharif crop gets destroyed, the total rice production this year will come down to about 120 lakh tonnes,"" a source said. ""Farmers usually sell the boro (winter) paddy before the Pujas to meet festival expenses and the cost of harvesting the kharif crop. Most of the cash in the possession of farmers has become useless because of the demonetisation. So they have not been able to hire labourers for harvesting,"" the source said. The agriculture department officials said the effect was already evident in the sluggish sales of potato seeds at state government centres."

PHOTO: PTIPTIManipur, which has been struggling to cope with an indefinite economic blockade since November 1, now faces a siege-like situation following a wildcat total shutdown imposed by the United Naga Council (UNC) and other Naga organisations since November 25.The latest shutdown follows the arrest of UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary Stephen Lamkang, who have been remanded in custody till December 22.Faced with demands for their release for a lifting of the blockade, Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, however, told The Hindu , The law will take its own course.The blockade has emptied the States markets of essential supplies. With nothing to buy, demonetisation has, ironically, left the people indifferent.Since November 1, there has been no normal movement of trucks on National Highways 2 and 37  lifelines that pass through Naga villages  or along the 100-km Imphal-Moreh Road on the Trans Asian Highway No 1.New districts opposedThe UNC, which claims to represent Naga interests, is opposed to the creation of the Sadar Hills district out of the Senapati district, with a substantial Naga population.At midnight on Thursday, the State Cabinet finalised the creation of seven new districts, with the nomenclature of Sadar Hills changed to Kangpokpi. Mr. Ibobi says this has been done for administrative convenience, and that to create a district is the prerogative of the government.Ethnic strifeHowever, Naga organisations, who met to take stock of the development, have said, It amounts to rubbing salt in the wounds.The creation of new districts has been a subject of ethnic strife in Manipur since 1971, when it was first proposed.Successive governments have failed to resolve the festering identity-driven tensions sparked by the exercise. For instance, Naga and Kuki villages are located side by side in all four hill districts of Manipur.Mr. Ibobi Singh, who has helmed Manipurs successive Congress-led governments since March 2002, told The Hindu: The UNC does not respond to our invitations to hold talks on the stand-off and other issues. So we requested Home Minister Rajnath Singh to resolve the crisis by convening a tripartite meeting.However, the State government at the last moment backed out of a meeting between the Government of India, the Manipur government and the UNC on November 15.Home Ministry officials met representatives of the UNC as planned but failed to break the impasse.Whereas amity is widely prevalent in people-to-people interactions, the ongoing stalemate between the State government and Naga hardliners has slowed normal life to a halt in Manipur. Essential commodities like potatoes, eggs, lentils, edible oil and salt have vanished from the markets; life-saving drugs are scarce, and fuel is being strictly rationed.Ruling on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition, the High Court of Manipur on November 25 directed the State government to provide adequate security to vehicles plying along the two national highways. Two other directives call for the deployment of paramilitary forces to ensure the free movement of the trucks.Cross-border trade with Myanmar at border towns of Moreh in Manipur and Namphalong in Myanmar, legalised since 1995, has also come to a standstill,hit by the double whammy of the blockade and demonetisation. Although the formal trade agreement identifies only some items, all manner of goods make their way to Manipur from here.The blockade has driven down the rupee-kyat exchange rate at these markets from 1,900 kyat/Rs. 100 to 800 kyat/Rs.100. Transportation of goods from other States to Manipur has also been affected.The All Naga Students Association Manipur told reporters that it had no objection to the creation of the new district, provided the Nagas were consulted on the process."

""It is the Manipur chief minister who is playing politics on the issue with the narrow objective of winning some votes. It is very unfortunate that the lives of people of the valley have been thrown into such a difficult situation,"" Madhav told reporters on the sidelines of an organisational meeting of the Assam BJP here. Madhav said the Centre had been ready with security forces from day one. ""They (security forces) were available two months ago to him (Singh). They are available today. They could at least use those forces now and get the blockade cleared. He (Ibobi) is not doing it,"" the general secretary said. ""We have been constantly in touch with the state government and repeatedly telling the chief minister to use the available state and central forces. Union minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju visited the state the day before yesterday to tell the chief minister again that we are ready to give whatever support it wants. Constitutionally, the Centre is obliged to extend all support to state governments and it is the mandate of the state government to seek and secure support of the Centre. We have made forces available from day one,"" Madhav said. The Manipur BJP has been asking the Centre to do everything to remove the blockade, he added. Manipur continues to suffer from the blockade as petrol prices went upto Rs 120 to Rs 150 per litre in different places, cooking gas upto Rs 2,000 per cylinder and potatoes to Rs 35 per kg. Curfew is still on from 9pm to 4am in Imphal West and Imphal East districts. The state government was supposed to lift the ban on private Internet service providers on Christmas Day, but considering the situation, it is unlikely to be withdrawn till December 30. The Manipur BJP today appealed to the UNC to withdraw the blockade. Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan reviewed the position in Manipur in New Delhi today and directed the oil marketing companies (OMCs) to take all possible remedial measures to ease the situation, an official release said. The companies are moving supplies under heavy security protection via an alternative route (National Highway 35 via Jiribam) after shifting its supply base to Guwahati from Tinsukia. The companies and the ministry are in constant touch with the state government, which is coordinating the movement of supplies. A delegation of the All Manipur Working Journalists' Union, led by its president Wangkhemcha Shamjai, called on Union minister of state (independent charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Jitendra Singh in New Delhi and discussed the prevailing unrest in Manipur. In a memorandum submitted to the DoNER minister, the journalists expressed concern over the hardships faced by the people of the state as a result of the economic blockade. According to them, media houses had been badly hit as a result of the UNC blockade, leading to an acute shortage of newsprint and other related material like printing plates. In addition, they alleged that the movement of reporters to collect news has got hampered due to fuel shortage. The Manipur BJP spokesperson, N. Biren Singh, told The Telegraph that there is a possibility of airlifting essential commodities if the situation demands."

Around 6.30 on Friday morning, the few customers at a vegetable vendor's stall in Nagerbazar included an unfamiliar face. The middle-aged man, presumably not a resident of the neighbourhood, scanned what was on offer and picked up two medium-sized cauliflowers. Before the seller could even quote his price, the buyer had whisked out four 500-rupee notes from his shirt pocket, kept them on the stack of potatoes and walked away briskly. ""I am lucky that he chose me to get rid of some cash, of which I am sure he has plenty!"" the vendor would say later . His wasn't the only story worth retelling at the end of the third day since Prime Minister Modi turned cash into a conundrum. Metro went around town looking for slices of life in the time of cash-or-curse and there was not a dull moment. ""Don't go over 2 lakh. They are saying that only deposits over Rs 2.5 lakh will be scrutinised, but you never know with the income tax guys.... My advice is to deposit Rs 1.75 lakh in your account.

""No...no...I don't think you should put Rs 2.5 lakh each in both accounts.... How much cash do you need to put away?"" he asked in response to the man's reply. A pregnant pause followed. ""Okay, umm...then you will have to look for other ways. Do you know other people with accounts?"" the man said, barely recovering his voice. Two co-passengers looked at each other and exchanged knowing smiles. Hardly anyone with a bank account wouldn't have been bombarded with messages since Thursday night saying ATMs would be open from Friday. Most banks even waived transaction charges on withdrawals. But only one among at least 75 ATMs that Metro visited between 11.30am and 4pm was found open and working. Apart from this one ATM of a nationalised bank in BBD Bag, the rest either had their shutters down or their screens displaying messages like ""out of cash"" and ""temporarily out of service"". Debasish Mitra, a railway employee, was in the long queue outside the functional ATM at Gillander House. ""I had visited several before coming here, but all of them were shut. I heard that this one too had run out of cash but was refilled. There are at least 30 people ahead of me and I don't know if I will be able to withdraw some cash,"" he said. "" Shaathh hazaar ka kya karein? Aur koi account nahi hai kya? Pata kar aur bata abhi (What do I do with the 60 grand? Are there no more accounts?

On realising that several men and women in the queue had turned around and were staring at him, the man walked away so that he was out of earshot. Later, when Metro asked what he did for a living, pat came the reply: "" Dhanda (business)."" And was he facing problems depositing his cash? "" Aap se matlab (Is that your business)?"" the man retorted. A BBD Bag bank had two queues 300 metres long, one for deposit and another for exchange, after the lunch break. Two policemen stood between the entrance and the queues, allowing 15 people from each line to enter at a time. The strategy worked until two policewomen allegedly tried to go inside citing ""official work"". Hundreds protested in unison, demanding to know what work awaited them inside. The duo retreated and a voice quipped: ""Shortcut -e note bhangate eshechilo (They tried a shortcut to notes)!""

The study, based on small samples of patients from Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai, has found the average salt consumption was 10.9 grams a day. This is more than double the 5 grams a day recommended by the World Health Organisation for healthy people. Two-thirds of the 446 patients already diagnosed with hypertension or high lipid levels added extra salt to their food during or after cooking. Three in four regularly ate processed, ready-to-eat food that was high in sodium content, raising their salt intakes. ""I think we're seeing the effects of two things - some negligence on part of the patients and some lack of awareness about hidden salt,"" Abhijit Trailokya, a Mumbai-based doctor who was part of the study team, told The Telegraph. ""Some patients may not add extra salt on their plates but eat pickles which is high in salt."" The researchers say their findings are in line with earlier surveys that found Indians eating unhealthy amounts of salt - through pickles, papad, chutneys and fried snacks as well as staples and processed food such as cheese, soup, potato chips and salted biscuits. An Indian Council of Medical Research study that covered 13 states had three years ago documented salt intakes ranging from 7 grams a day to 28 grams a day, with an average of 13 grams. Other surveys have shown that some people might be consuming up to 42 grams salt a day. Multiple studies from across the world have associated high consumption of salt with high blood pressure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and kidney disease. Trailokya and the collaborating doctors from hospitals in the other cities also observed that vegetarians on average consumed more salt than non-vegetarians. The average values varied across the cities -- about 14 grams in Delhi, about 10 grams in Bangalore, Calcutta and Chennai, and 9 grams in Mumbai. The findings have been published in the current issue of the Journal of Association of Physicians of India. The researchers, who analysed the dietary intakes based on information provided by the patients themselves, also found that vegetarians ate more saturated fats such as butter and ghee compared with non-vegetarians. The consumption was higher among patients sampled in Delhi than in the other cities. Earlier medical studies had indicated that about half of patients with hypertension might remain undiagnosed or not be taking treatment. Among the patients on therapy, only about half may have blood pressure values well within the required levels. But some doctors concede that the blame may not all lie with the patients. A senior Delhi-based doctor said it was unclear how well and how persistently patients diagnosed with hypertension received advice from their physicians on the need to change their diet and lifestyle and maintain the change permanently. ""Such advice needs to be repeatedly given at every visit; the patients need to be questioned each time and reminded. This takes significant investments of time by doctors,"" said Vivekanand Jha, a nephrologist in New Delhi and executive director of The George Institute for Global Health. ""Some doctors are probably doing this, but many may find it easier to just prescribe medicines."""

""Most of us do not have low-denomination currency to pay the tax,"" Singh rued. An official at the gate said nearly 1,800 to 2,000 vehicles, including a large number of trucks, ply daily through the Assam-Bengal border in Dhubri district. These vehicles have to pass through five checkposts for sales, motor vehicle, forest, Assam Agricultural Marketing Board and excise taxes. The truckers have to pay the tax or levy according to their goods. The sales tax checkpost is one of the most important at Chagolia checkgate. On an average, it collects Rs 8 lakh daily, but since the last two days, collection has come down to only Rs 2 lakh. The vice-president of Dhubri-Golokganj Truck Owners' Association, Azizure Hussain Khan, expressed resentment over the problems being faced by the truckers at Chagolia checkgate and held the government responsible for this situation. ""Without an alternative system replacing the old one, the government has hit the movement of trucks carrying essential commodities. Half the trucks stranded on the Bengal side are laden with food items,"" Khan added. Dhubri deputy commissioner Dhiraj Choudhury said the problems would be sorted out, as the Dhubri branch of State Bank of India had deposited Rs 18 lakh of Rs 100 denomination in their three ATMs at Chagolia checkgate today. ""Moreover, we are keeping a close watch on the situation at Chagolia and if required, more money can be put into the ATMs,"" Choudhury added. However, a server failure today prevented truckers from withdrawing money from the ATMs. Former chief minister Tarun Gogoi said in Guwahati that the Centre should have done proper planning to ensure that the people did not face problems in acquiring cash following the demonetisation. ""There is no proper system in place and hence the lower middle class people are facing trouble. People are not getting cash even after queuing up at ATMs for hours. The trade of small shops and tea stall owners has been hit hard. Honest people are suffering the most,"" Gogoi said at a news conference this afternoon. On the BJP's allegation that the Congress took no step against black money during its tenure in power, Gogoi said, ""If they don't have black money, how could they use so many helicopters before the last election? We could not use helicopters so much despite being in power for 15 years. Let the BJP disclose details of the bank accounts of their Assam unit and the Assam PCC will also do so. Party funds must be made corruption-free first. Only honest people will suffer while the big fishes will remain. It will make very little difference until we take steps to check the amount of money being used by political parties for election purposes."" Yesterday, former industry minister Pradyut Bordoloi said steps taken by the government were not enough to address the people's problems. The scramble for cash at ATMs and banks in Imphal continued today. Banks were open but were low on cash today. Additional reporting by Sumir Karmakar in Guwahati and Khelen Thokchom in Imphal"

In October 2015, WPI inflation was (-)3.70 per cent.Wholesale Price Index inflation in vegetables witnessed deflationary pressures and was recorded at (-)9.97 per cent in October. Inflation in this category had scaled a high of 28.45 per cent in July.This was aided by inflation data for onion, which was at (-)65.97 per cent.Pulses inflation continued to rule high at 21.80 per cent in October, according to the commerce ministry data.Potato, a daily consumable vegetable, witnessed maximum inflationary pressure at 60.58 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose 6.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food inflation basket showed moderation with inflation at 4.34 per cent in October, as against 5.75 per cent in September.The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.67 per cent in October compared with 2.48 per cent in the previous month.The rate of inflation in sugar was at 29.63 per cent and that for petrol was 3.57 per cent.The WPI inflation for August has been revised upward at 3.85 per cent against provisional estimate of 3.74 per cent.Data for October retail inflation is expected later in the day.The all-powerful Monetary Policy Committee headed by the Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel last month cut benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.While he had signalled more tolerance towards inflation, the easing in the Consumer Price Index data was in line with the RBI's forecast for average 5 per cent inflation in fourth quarter of 2016. This, many expect, would create more room for interest rate cuts."
58e53f607be9e05a951f66c3,Cash crunch strains food chain,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161115/jsp/frontpage/story_119272.jsp,2016-11-15,,Telegraph,"Uday Hazra is an affluent farmer. His fields are flush with harvest-ready paddy but he cannot hire day labourers. Shiva Sambhu Das is a day labourer who works on farms to earn Rs 100 and 2kg rice a day. He needs money to feed his family and pay for his children's education. Sarashi Jasan Samanta's shop is brimming with fertilisers he had stocked ahead of the potato-sowing season. But he is not getting customers. Samir Sahana runs a poultry unit, but the demand for his chickens has dipped. Nov. 14: The fates of Hazra, Samanta, Sahana and Das are bound together by cash, the absence of which is disrupting the rural food chain. Unless cash flows from Hazra to Das, the labourer cannot harvest the farmer's ripe crop. If the crop is not harvested, the farmer will not be able to buy and sow potato seeds, which means Samanta's fertilisers will not find a taker. Unless the farmer, farmhand and the fertiliser supplier complete the economic jigsaw, Sahana's meat will remain unsold. Cash, indeed, is the binding force that holds life together in rural Bengal - and in most of India's hinterland. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana are residents of Burdwan's Kendur village, around 140km from Calcutta. The plight of the four residents is a textbook case of the impact of the demonetisation - and the resultant currency crunch - announced by the Prime Minister on November 8. ""I cannot get my paddy fields harvested because I have to pay around Rs 1,000 daily to six or seven labourers. I have to harvest my crop soon as the paddy is ready and time is running out to sow potato seeds. But I don't have the money to buy the seeds or the fertiliser,"" said Hazra, who can be categorised as a big farmer in Bengal. The 62-year-old has a two-storey house that bears all the signs of solvency, from a double-door fridge to a water filter. His cowshed houses 10 cows, and prime gobindobhog paddy fills the silo in his courtyard. The farmer has one new Rs 2,000 note and several Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Hazra spoke of a stifling feeling of cashlessness. Told that his home and surroundings did not suggest such a sorry state of affairs, he said that for rural households, savings meant what was grown in the fields. ""I have 110 packs of quality paddy at home, which I retained after the last harvest so that I could sell them this winter at a better price. But there are no buyers. Even if I find some, they will insist that I accept the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" Hazra said. At Badamtala in Burdwan town, where the big rice traders have their gaddis (offices), several traders said the price of paddy had started falling after the demonetisation announcement. The price of gobindobhog has dipped from around Rs 2,200 a pack of 60kg to Rs 2,000. Other crops too are fetching lower prices, the traders said. Although the big farmers are often accused of exploiting the labourers, they remain the drivers of the rural economy, where the organised public and private sectors hardly generate any employment. By engaging in agriculture, they provide a livelihood to others in the village ecosystem. In neighbouring Hooghly district, another fertile zone where farmers grow three to four crops, labourer Rabin Sing is losing around Rs 500 every day this harvesting season. ""I work in two shifts during harvesting as I have to feed a family of four.... The farmer I work for gave me Rs 500 saying it can be changed in the bank. I lost a day trying to do that but couldn't exchange it. The farmers don't have money,"" said Sing, who is praying for a speedy return to normality. After demonetisation, he has been left with his life's savings of Rs 3,000 - two Rs 1,000 notes and two Rs 500 notes. After the experience at the bank, he deposited the money with two kirana stores from where he will buy his monthly provisions. ""They said they would give me provisions against this money.... But I don't have any cash. I can't buy medicine, fish or egg,"" Sing said, sitting near a kirana shop in Mirzapur, 50km from Calcutta, where 95 per cent people depend on agriculture. The shop had become the venue for an evening adda . Soon, stories of inconvenience were being exchanged. But some in the audience protested, emphasising that a few days' pain was worth the bigger gain in the future. When this correspondent asked about black money and why it was bad for the economy, Sanjay Patra, a carpenter, said: ""I don't know all that... but rich people will now face the music."" What about the misery of his fellow villagers? It's just a matter of a few days, he said. But P. Sainath, the founding editor of People's Archive of Rural India and a veteran journalist who has written extensively on poverty, said: ""The Prime Minister is talking about bearing pain for 50 days.... You can imagine how long it will take. But there is little doubt that the impact on the rural economy is going to be devastating."" Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India, predicted that the demonetisation's effect on the rural economy and country's informal sector could reduce GDP growth by one percentage point this year. ""Whatever you are witnessing in rural Bengal is not unique; it's happening across India as the sowing season is going to start and people have no money to buy seeds, fertilisers or pesticides,"" Sen said. Textbook economics says that the surplus generated in agriculture sustains the other sectors by generating multiplier effects, which help the economy grow. As the rural economy is cash-based, the first casualty is spending power. ""I was in Chikalthana, on the edge of Aurangabad (Maharashtra). Nobody has cash there. There is chaos and a law-and-order situation is developing,"" Sainath said. Some analysts have been saying that rural India's ""resilience"", arising from an informal credit system that facilitates cashless transactions among acquaintances, will help it cope. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana agreed that left without cash, they had been able to survive the past six days because of the credit system. Mirzapur residents echoed the assessment. ""At the village level, a personalised credit system works. But it cannot sustain as the moment you are out of the village, it doesn't work,"" said Sainath. Sen said that although the rural population can tide itself over the crisis for some time, its indebtedness would grow and make the villagers more vulnerable to moneylenders. ""The indebtedness in the economy is growing, and it's not a good sign,"" he added."

Hundreds of trucks loaded with essentials items and oil tankers remained stranded in neighbouring Nagaland and Assam as the United Naga Council (UNC) sponsored indefinite economic blockade entered the 13th day today. The Naga organisation imposed the blockade along the Imphal-Dimapur (National Highway 2) and the Imphal-Jiribam (National Highway 37) since November 1 to oppose the government's plan to create two districts - Sadar Hills out of Senapati district and Jiribam district out of Imphal East.

58e5402e7be9e05a951f67ce,Bengal farm tax waiver,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161115/jsp/bengal/story_119268.jsp,2016-11-15,,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Nov. 14: The Mamata Banerjee government today decided to waive the tax collected on agricultural produce being transported from one district to another for the next three days. ""To save farmers and commoners, perishable vegetables should not be allowed to spoil. Bengal government has decided not to impose any agricultural tax on movement of trucks for next 3 days,"" the chief minister tweeted. Senior Nabanna officials said the government would not lose much by waiving the agriculture produce marketing committees (APMC) tax as it gets only Rs 10 crore annually from it, as compared to the Rs 3,000-crore revenue collected from excise goods. ""But the chief minister's move will send a positive signal to the rural populace who are facing a huge crisis because of the demonetisation drive. The number of banks and ATMs are far too few in villages, where most of our vegetable farmers are concentrated,"" an official said. Officials pointed out that things were not that bad on Bengal's roads as toll taxes have been waived on national highways and the state highways don't collect any revenue. ""The movement of trucks has not been affected much, at least in Bengal. But marginal farmers are facing difficulties in transporting their produce from one district to another because of the shortage of notes of smaller denominations,"" the official said. The tax collected on agricultural produce varies from district to district and the type of vegetables. For instance, the tax collected from a farmer carrying a sack of potatoes in Burdwan is not the same as that in Hooghly. Sources said the government also planned to direct local bodies such as municipalities and gram panchayats to waive road tax collected from vehicles entering their area. ""A number of local bodies such as gram panchayats and municipalities collect a tax called road tax. This is also creating trouble for the people. So the local bodies would be urged to waive the tax for a few days,"" a senior minister said. The chief minister had last week voiced concern about people in the rural areas in the wake of the Centre's decision to discontinue the existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. At a news conference on Saturday, Mamata had laid stress on the 700 gram panchayats that she said don't have banks and many ATMs. Subhas Ghosh, the general secretary of the West Bengal Truck Owners' Association, said the decision to waive the APMC tax for three days would help small farmers but the real problem lay elsewhere. ""Our trucks are stranded at different state borders because the drivers don't have enough money to buy diesel or their permits have expired. They cannot renew the permits because of the prevailing crisis and the few functioning ATMs,"" said Ghosh."
58e540447be9e05a951f67ea,"October inflation down, call for rate cut",http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161116/jsp/business/story_119404.jsp,2016-11-16,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Nov. 15: Softening food prices have helped to ease retail as well as wholesale inflation in October, raising hopes that the RBI may go in for another rate cut in its monetary policy review next month. Consumer price index-based inflation eased to a 14-month low of 4.20 per cent in October, while WPI inflation fell to a four-month low of 3.39 per cent. Retail inflation was 4.39 per cent in September, whereas the wholesale price index-based inflation stood at 3.57 per cent. Retail food inflation fell to 3.32 per cent in October from 3.96 per cent in September. For the second month in a row, retail inflation is less than the target of 5 per cent set by the RBI. The WPI food inflation basket, too, showed moderation with inflation at 4.34 per cent in October against 5.75 per cent in the previous month. However, pulses and potatoes showed an elevated trend even though it moderated from September. Pulses inflation declined to 21.80 per cent in October from 23.99 per cent in the previous month, while in the case of potatoes the figure was 60.58 per cent against 73.31 per cent. WPI inflation in fuel was up at 6.18 per cent in October against 5.58 per cent in September because of a price rise in both petrol and diesel. Manufactured products, which comprise about 65 per cent of the index, saw inflation ticking up to 2.67 per cent in October from 2.48 per cent in the previous month. The Monetary Policy Committee headed by RBI governor Urjit Patel had last month cut benchmark interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent. While Patel had signalled more tolerance towards inflation, easing in CPI data was in line with the RBI's forecast. This, many expect, will create more room for rate cuts. Industry chamber CII said, going forward, both the wholesale and retail price inflation were likely to remain muted as favourable monsoon would augment food supplies in the marketplace and international commodity prices would remain under pressure."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."
58e540f67be9e05a951f68c6,WHOLESALE DESPAIR,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161117/jsp/bihar/story_119658.jsp,2016-11-17,,Telegraph,"Vegetable vendors wait for customersat Anta Ghatin Patna on Wednesday. Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Demonetisation has paralysed wholesale markets in the city, be they of grocery  rice, wheat, pulses, spices and suchlike  or fruits. The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. As one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."

The herds have retreated to the thickets of the neighbouring States. But the prowling of two lone elephants at the tri-State junction continues leaving the farmers in about 100 fringe villages in a grip of tension as they expect the return of the herds to their fields any time.During the last five years, movement of the wild elephants, numbering over 70 and split into five or six herds, between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon in the Kuppam region.Two herds had barged into the fringe hamlets of the two constituencies in the third week of December, and the forest personnel could drive them back into the thickets of TN and Karnataka in separate operations during the last couple of days.Since August, the farmers of the Kuppam mandal have been familiar with the presence of a lone elephant moving along the borders of Tamil Nadu. Another single elephant problem surfaced a couple of days ago in Santhipuram mandal, when it got separated from a herd of seven pachyderms.The farmers who are generally used to drought conditions mostly rely on horticulture crops. Since November, stretches of banana, potato, tomato and beans plantations suffered the ire of the marauding tuskers in many villages. With Sankranthi just two weeks away, the farmers get ready to harvest their crops.However, the man-animal conflict has forced them to abandon night vigils. This gives them an additional headache: scope for theft of motor pump sets and other electrical gadgets and cables by miscreants. Danger also lurks for farmers while moving in the fields during 10.00 pm-2.00 am shift of power supply. In the last two years, five farmers had been killed in the attacks of wild elephants. At the same time, seven pachyderms were reported killed in the same region, due to infighting among the herds and electrocution in the fields. The last quarter of 2015 had witnessed the presence of large herds in the V.Kota and Ramakuppam mandals.Forest Range Officer (Kuppam), Kalappa Naidu, said all efforts were under way to prevent the man-animal conflict in the region, including strengthening of solar fencing, digging of elephant proof trenches and talks with the TN and Karnataka forest department officials, seeking their coordination in monitoring the movement of the wild elephants.Movement of the wild elephants between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon"
58e5433a7be9e05a951f6bb9,Farm credit dries up,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161117/jsp/frontpage/story_119669.jsp,2016-11-17,,Telegraph,"Nov. 16: Operations at Cooperative banks, the banking lifeline in rural India, have virtually come to a halt in Bengal soon after the demonetisation decision, choking the credit flow to farmers and robbing them of an avenue to convert their old notes. On the credit front, the 3,000-odd branches of cooperative banks in the state are unable to offer loans because they are not getting enough funds from lead banks (public sector banks) that are busy servicing the crowds at their own doorsteps. The impact is already telling on the ground. The state agriculture department today decided to shelve midway its campaign of drawing farmers to the banks to obtain loans through their Kisan Credit Cards. The one-month campaign was supposed to have been carried out between November 7 and December 7. ""But we decided to stop the campaign from tomorrow as farmers are not getting loans from banks, not even the cooperative banks on which they depend heavily,"" said an agriculture department official. According to an estimate, around 2,000 of the 3,345 gram panchayats in Bengal depend solely on cooperative banks. The lead bank scheme had been launched to strengthen the cooperative banks after it emerged decades ago that nationalised banks shared only 1 per cent of the burden of institutional credit in agriculture. The lion's share was shouldered by the cooperative banks. ""But as the commercial banks themselves are stressed following the demonetisation, the cooperative banks are facing a crunch and the rural people have no place to go,"" said a source. ""We usually withdraw Rs 10 lakh a day from our current account at our lead bank during the peak season. But in the past one week, we got a total of Rs 8 lakh.... So, it's not possible to meet the demand for loans from the farmers,"" said the manager of a cooperative bank in Rampurhat, Birbhum. The cooperative banks' large customer base, made up mostly of farmers, faces a crippling problem on deposits, too. A cooperative department official said the branches of cooperative banks have stopped taking deposits in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes following an RBI notification issued on November 14. The RBI notification said: ""No exchange facility against the specified bank notes (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) or deposit of such notes should be entertained by them (district central cooperative banks)."" An official in the state cooperative department said: ""It appears that as the majority of the cooperative banks did not make KYC (know your customer) mandatory, the RBI has prevented them from accepting deposits.... The decision has affected nearly 2 crore account holders of the cooperative banks."" He said: ""The two problems are enough to kill the rural economy.... The rural populace, more than 70 per cent of whom depend on agriculture, are forced to go to faraway places to exchange their old notes, which is causing a loss of mandays. The non-availability of loans is bound to hit the rabi (winter) cultivation this year."" Usually, around 10 lakh hectares are cultivated during the rabi season, whose produce includes potatoes, other vegetables and oilseed. ""Our estimate is that the area under cultivation would shrink by 30 per cent and the total sown area would be below 7 lakh hectares this year,"" said the official. The plight of Seikh Nijamuddin, a Birbhum farmer who has 22 bighas of cultivable land, tells a story. He had taken a loan of Rs 25,000 during the kharif (monsoon) season from a cooperative bank. He had arranged for Rs 27,000, all in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, to repay the loan and apply for a fresh loan of Rs 48,000 to sow mustard and potato seeds. ""But the cooperative bank is not taking the old currency notes, and I have been unable to exchange the notes even after visiting banks located 20km from my village as the exchange limit is only Rs 4,500,"" Nijamuddin said. The farmer said that if he did not get the loan within the next seven days, his cultivation plans would be thrown into disarray."

Fuel pumps have been remaining closed for the past one week as stocks ran dry. Prices of other daily essentials rose with the stock depleting fast.Citizen organisations yesterday seized potato bags from the city's grocery shops and sold them at Rs 20 per kg.Angered by the scarcity of essential commodities, people have stopped their supply to the Naga-dominated districts from Imphal in the past few days.Citizens' organisations in Churachandpur district today checked the stock and price of such goods in the shops at Churachandpur town.The situation eased to some extent today after the state government yesterday brought nearly 200 loaded trucks and tankers, which were stranded at various points in Assam, with security escorts along the Imphal-Jiribam highway.Some of the petrol pumps in Imphal were opened today.Police and India Reserve Battalion escorts brought 75 loaded trucks to Imphal from Chandel district.The JAC of Sadar Hills was infuriated at chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh's alleged failure to fulfil his promise of creating the district on November 1, the day the annual Kut festival of the Kuki community is celebrated.The JAC had even constructed a foundation stone to mark the district's inauguration. Angered by Ibobi Singh's ""betrayal"", the JAC asked Congress members of the autonomous district council in Sadar Hills to resign from the party immediately. It also asked all district and block-level Congress workers from Sadar Hills to resign by tomorrow.Officials of the Union home ministry held talks with a UNC delegation in New Delhi on Tuesday on the blockade. The meeting could not arrive at a consensus as no representative of the Manipur government was present.Ibobi Singh had clarified that no representative was sent as the home ministry did not send any invitation.Official sources said the state government is planning to restore the supply mostly on the Imphal-Jiribam highway by providing enough security escorts."

The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has sent back trucks bringing in the Indore and Agra variety potatoes.Yes, potato arrivals from outside the State were stopped today and we are sending back such stocks, said B.M. Srinivasa, Joint Director, Department of Agricultural Marketing and Secretary of APMC, Belagavi.The decision was taken when farmers prevented unloading of potatoes from trucks that had arrived from other States and also organised a rasta roko agitation on the APMC Road for nearly four hours. They withdrew their protest only after Mr. Srinivasa announced during closing office hours that potato arrivals from other States have been stopped at the APMC yard.Speaking for the agitating growers, P.L. Kadam Patil, Raju Bapu Shanbag and Shankar Basavanni Desai said that Belagavi taluk was a major potato growing area in North Karnataka. It is known for its red-skinned potato variety with better taste than the other varieties. The potato harvesting season was at its peak now and daily arrivals of huge stocks from Agra, Chennai, Delhi, Indore and also from Hassan and Chikkamagaluru have directly impacted prices, which have crashed by at least 50 per cent. The present prices for local variety is Rs. 1,000 per quintal and Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,200 per quintal for other varieties at the APMC.They said that normally 2,000 quintals of the native variety of potatoes land from different villages of Belagavi taluk at the APMC on non-market days. Wednesdays and Saturdays, the market days, witness double the quantity."

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

Seen here are farmers at the agro produces market in Mosale Hosahalli of Hassan taluk. PHOTO: PRAKASH HASSANWhile urban areas in the State are adapting themselves to the changed scenario after the demonetisation of high-value notes, rural areas, especially farmers, continue to be under duress even 50 days after demonetisation.With no improvement in cash flow in villages, there are no takers for farmers produce.The fall in demand has triggered a drop in prices of agricultural produce.In Hassan district, many farmers have kept their stocks of potato, maize, ginger, and other crops as there are no buyers.As those who harvested potato in September/October got Rs. 16 a kg, the farmers who were harvesting the produce in November/December were hoping for a further increase in prices. But, much to their dismay, prices have crashed to Rs. 10 a kg.In this situation, many have not sold their produce. Three truckloads of potato have remained unsold in our village, said Papaiah, a farmer from Marenahalli near Mosale Hosahalli in Hassan taluk. But the stock has started to perish forcing some of them to sell at Rs. 4 a kg. The case of maize growers is no different. The price of maize has dropped to Rs. 1,300-1,400 a quintal from the level of Rs. 1,600-1,700 before demonetisation. Also, farmers have to bear transportation cost as traders have stopped farm-gate purchases after demonetisation in most of the areas.The coffee growers are also hit as demonetisation has coincided with the harvest season. A coffee planter with 25 acres of plantation needs to pay wages of about Rs. 45,000 a week as he hires about 25 labourers. But, one can only withdraw a maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week from the banks, say planters.U.M. Thirthamallesh, secretary of the Karnataka Coffee Growers Federation, says, Because of the cash crisis, planters are hiring less number of workers this year, resulting in delayed picking, which may affect the quality of coffee beans, besides harming the plants in the long run. In northern districts like Kalaburagi, farm labourers have started demanding a part of the harvested produce as their wages instead of accepting money, as several landlords are trying to give them old currency notes.What has added to the woes of farmers is that most of the ATMs in rural areas have remained closed due to paucity of cash."

Prices are down but I dont have any other option than selling. If I delay, the quality of the potato will deteriorate. I have to sow wheat after potato harvest, hence, Im forced to sell my crop at a poor price, though it means a heavy loss, said Jaswinder Singh, a Jalandhar potato farmer.In Haryana too, farmers are selling seasonal vegetables at throw away prices. In the Shahbad market, potato fetched Rs. 2.75 a kg, while cauliflower went for Rs. 2 a kg.

As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

UP government has announced that it will give 25kg potatoes, 10kg wheat flour, 5kg chana dal, 5 litres of edible oil, 1 litre desi ghee and 1kg milk powder to 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in Bundelkhand. This will be in addition to the 35kg foodgrain the families receive under the National Food Security Act, 2013.According to SDRF guidelines cleared by the Centre on April 8, 2015, however, families grievously affected by natural calamities can be offered government assistance on following conditions: First at the rate of Rs 60 per adult, and Rs 45 per minor, for those families not staying in relief camps. Secondly, the state government should identify families not staying in relief camps and also declare the basis on which they were selected as beneficiaries for assistance. Thirdly, any special assistance can only be given to beneficiaries for 30 days, and extended in the case of drought to a maximum of 90 days or three months. Lastly, the state government cannot spend more than 25% of the total annual allocation to SDRF for extraordinary relief operations.But special assistance of the kind UP government plans to give to Bundelkhand's poorest of poor - the Antyodaya familes - is in direct contradiction of most of the SDRF guidelines. Sample this: Each relief package for distribution in the region costs the state more than Rs 2,500, including packaging, transport and distribution. According to UP's department of food and civil supplies, there are 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in seven districts of Bundelkhand, with one family unit, on an average, accounting for two adults and three children. According to SDRF guidelines, relief should be given at the rate of Rs 60 per adult and Rs 45 per child. If this formula is followed, each family is entitled to receive relief worth Rs 255.But every unit of UP's Bundelkhand package-if only the cheapest variant of each component is considered-adds up to approximately Rs 1,670, minus the costs of packaging, transport and distribution. That's 10kg potatoes for about Rs 60-Rs 80, 5kg chana dal for Rs 375, 10kg wheat flour for Rs 240, 5 litres of mustard oil for Rs 575, and 1kg desi ghee for Rs 400. Add 1kg milk powder for families with children and the amount increases by Rs 250 to settle at Rs 1,920 per packet.For 2.34 lakh beneficiaries, the cost totals Rs 45 crore. With additional cost of packaging, transport and distribution, senior government functionaries confirm one month of supplying relief to Bundelkhand's poor will cost the state's exchequer approximately Rs 70 crore, and that is on the lesser side. UP does not have the financial resources to provide relief to the drought-hit farmers. Earlier this month, CM Akhilesh Yadav wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi asking for financial assistance from the Centre ""to provide, for at least six months' edible oil and foodgrains for residents of the drought-hit districts of the state."" In UP, SDRF allocation for a year is Rs 709 crore, not allowing the government to spend more than Rs 177 crore per annum for relief work across UP. for the moment, though, UP government will support poorest of poor in Bundelkhand for a month. Then, the drought-hit poor will be on their own, again."

Several unregistered farmers (more than 1,000) are also growing the tuber, the sources said.The farmers are being provided financial assistance under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to grow potatoes. The directorate purchased seeds from the National Seeds Corporation Limited (NSCL) and distributed them among the farmers at a subsidized rate.""Farmers of three tribal-dominated districts, Kandhamal, Koraput and Mayurbhanj, grow potato during kharif season as the soil and climatic conditions are conducive for it. The crop is grown during the rabi season in other areas,"" said director of horticulture Susanta Nanda.The sources said sub-standards seeds from NSCL led to crop loss in Kandhamal last kharif season.Altogether, 497 farmers of around 100 villages in Daringbadi and Tumudibandh blocks had cultivated tuber on 137 acres on an experimental basis under the mission. The government sanctioned Rs 23,100 per hectare after the farmers demanded compensation for crop loss.Since absence of storage facility has been a concern for farmers, the government has decided to set up 46 cold storages. ""At present, there are 27 cold storages and construction of 15 others has begun,"" said Nanda. Odisha produces 2.5 lakh MT of potato annually against a demand of around 10 lakh MT."

The fuel and power fell 9.2% year-on-year in December reflecting the sharp decline in global crude oil prices. But the increase in food inflation stood out.In December food inflation rose an annual 8.2%, rising from November's 5.2% largely driven by a sharp spike in price of pulses which rose 55.6% year-on-year in last month. Prices of vegetables also firmed up rising an annual 20.6% during the month, while onion prices shot up an annual 26%. Potato prices fell nearly 35% year-on-year during December.Data released earlier this week showed retail prices inched for the fifth consecutive week in December to an annual 5.6% compared to the previous month's 5.4% increase. The government revised the reading for October to a decline of 3.7% compared to the previously reported number of a contraction of 3.8% Economists said the rise in food inflation was a worry and need to be watched. The RBI has also said that food prices need to be watched to assess the impact of patch monsoon rains on the farm sector. ""The considerably steeper increase in food inflation at the wholesale level than at the retail level in December 2015 poses some concern,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist at ratings agency ICRA.She said on a sequential basis, food prices displayed a disparate trend in December 2015, hardening at the wholesale level by 0.6% and softening at the retail level by 1.0%. Nayar said the month-on-month uptick in wholesale food prices in December 2015 may be a pre-cursor to a similar trend at the retail level in the ongoing month. ""With the contraction in industrial output in November 2015 largely attributable to a one-off base effect and the hardening of retail and wholesale inflation in December 2015, we continue to expect the RBI to pause until the fiscal targets for 2016-17 are revealed in the Union Budget,"" said Nayar."

Though many prominent schools in the city started health food awareness among students even before the board directive, they will now strictly implement the guidelines.Welcoming the board's decision, the CBSE schools in Bokaro are taking steps to ensure that vendors outside the premises too do not sell unhealthy food. The circular lays down that no HFSS food must be available in school canteens and, if possible, necessary steps must be taken to ensure non-availability of HFSS within 200-metre radius of the campus.Ashok Singh, principal of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, said they have already circulated the food chart among students ""with the slogan 'Eat healthy, Keep fit'"".""We encourage students to eat healthy food like roti-sabji, idli, dhokla, sprouts, salad.

On Saturday, Singh visited the shops in the vicinity of the school and requested them to stop selling unhealthy food to students.Other schools, besides Chinmaya, have also asked students not to bring chips, fried food, aerated drinks, ready-to-eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, potato fries, etc. Father Jacob Thomas, principal of MGM Higher Secondary School, said the canteen has been alerted about the new rule and a food chart will be put up inside the canteen in the next few days.Suresh Kumar, general secretary of Sardar Patel School, said, ""We have asked children to bring roti-paratha and vegetables for lunch. The students staying in hostel at Kamlapur are served rice-dal, roti and sabji.""A few schools, like Pentecostal Assembly School, which do not have canteens encourage students to bring healthy food from home.But the health drive has not impressed many students.

Though foot injuries are most common, even injuries to the back and shoulders cannot be ruled out.Dr Rajesh Badiyani, orthopaedic surgeon, said joint problem among runners are most common in joints that bear weights, such as the hips, knee and ankles.""If someone suffers an injury, then that person should opt for a compression bandage or splints to stabilize the affected area. An elevation of the limbs to reduce swelling also helps,"" he said.He added that an appropriate intake of vitamin D, calcium and iron is important to maintain the strength of the bones. ""In an adverse condition, it is ideal to rest and ferment the area with ice. If the injury is severe, then the runner should slowly return to activity after several weeks of healing and stretching exercises,"" he said.Kanchan Patwardhan, clinical nutritionist, said that stocking up on carbs is ideal since they convert into glycogen and our body uses glycogen while running. ""Ideally, the carbs should come from wholegrain cereals, dry fruits, potatoes and sweet potatoes and beet roots.

The company has also increased its R&D spend by 40% over last five years to catch up with its chief Indra Nooyi's diktat of focusing on better-and-good-for-you products. D Shivakumar, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo India, has been at the helm of the Indian arm of the US food and beverage major for two years. Here, he talks to TOI about the company's game plan for 2016.You know the health and wellness journey that PepsiCo is on. Indra Nooyi's vision for the company has classified products into categories such as good for you, better for you and fun for you. Tropicana, a top-end health and wellness brand, will be an extremely important part of our portfolio going forward. We locally source nearly 65% of what we sell here in terms of fruit juices. Therefore, it's a very important element of the value chain of the agriculture market. Fruits and vegetables are an important part of the agenda for the government going forward. And Tropicana will play an important role in executing that.We have just launched mosambi juice, which is a great innovation. This is the first branded mosambi juice in the market. The most widely-consumed drink in India is mosambi with 18% market share followed by lime juice (nimbu paani). We are competing with a housewife who prepares mosambi juice and a vendor selling it on the street. The focus on Tropicana is to build a whole range of these type of drinks, to really get fruit juice to be a part of the diet of an Indian family. Earlier, we didn't have enough citrus processing facilities in India. We have now established that with a partner in Maharashtra. The focus is to Indianize as many products as possible such as orange juice. Later, an extension programme should be a part of our larger programme like we have done with potato.We are testing a product called Revive in Tamil Nadu with low sugar levels. We have reduced a lot of fat content in products such as Lays. In line with PepsiCo's global direction, India will produce a range of healthier products as we go forward. For our snacks and beverage portfolio, we have a clear five-year plan. At the same time, most categories have become premiumised. So, how do you premiumise the range? We launched Lays Maxx last year at a premium. Nimbooz Masala Soda at a premium. I think localisation and premiumisation are going hand in hand in food and drinks. We launched Kurkure Butter Masti, Slice Alphonso. Indians are definitely wanting higher quality products. There is always a value point in the market but this trend is definitely being seen in almost every category.They want healthy with taste. The average Indian family is about four people now. Earlier, it was 5.5. So, if you have two kids in the family, their palates tend to decide what comes into the house. So that's the reason Indian households tend to go for a combination of tasty and healthy and not healthy alone. Even in oats, our masala variants are driving the category.We only have a product approval process in India. Worldwide they have an ingredient approval process. The FSSAI is working with the industry to find out the best way to go about it. So the industry is united about having an ingredient approval process as opposed to product approval. Ashish Bahuguna has been receptive to our suggestions and I am sure he will do the best thing possible."

The conservationist is the recipient of 2015's Whitley Award, regarded as the green Oscar, for preventing human deaths in Tamil Nadu's Valparai area in the Anamalai hills - home to the second largest elephant population of the country.The system, developed by Kumar and his team after extensive research on elephant behaviour and patterns, has managed to bring down annual fatalities to one, against the average of three deaths prior to launching the system in the tea and coffee plantations of Valparai plateau.""In an elephant-dense territory, conflicts are bound to happen. We worked on ways that allow both to live with each other. There are no problem animals, but problem locations. During our research, we spotted a pattern in the fatal cases - of the 42 people who died in direct conflict with elephants between 2002 and 2015, 37 did not know there are elephants near them and bumped into them accidently. Besides, 72% of all conflicts happened on the roads and late in the evenings or at night. This analysis formed the basis of our solution,"" said Ananda Kumar. Involvement of the local residents is essential, he said. ""We invited them to share information. Intially, we used to get calls from villagers asking us for information about elephants, now almost 80% of the calls are of informers,"" he added.In Maharashtra, elephants are a concern primarily in the Chandgad, Ajara and Gadhinglaj areas of Kolhapur, where, according to reports, more than 600 cases of the tuskers damaging crops were recorded in 2015. Five elephants are said to be a bane in this area. Meanwhile, three of the four elephants which were captured in Sindhudurg district in 2014 died soon after. Elephants feed on sugarcane, coconut and bananas, besides bamboo and sweet potatoes - all found in abundance in these areas.Prachi Mehta of the city-based Wildlife Research and Conservation Society, who investigated man-elephant conflicts in Sindhudurg and Kolhapur districts a few years back, said, ""Villagers are not used to having elephants in their vicinity and are not tolerant to their existence. Conflict is bound to happen if crops suited for elephants are cultivated on the borders of the forest. Any simple, cost-effective alarm system, which requires minimum human intervention and outsider help, is thus a welcome idea."""

The liver, spleen and penis of the bear and three legs of the nilgai were removed. Sources said that removing private parts of the sloth bear was a part of superstition for childless couples seeking a baby.The carcasses were found on Sunday in Bolunda by a villager who informed the forest officials. While range forest officer (RFO) of Goregaon V Kadam tried to downplay the incident by saying concrete information regarding removal of parts will come only after the post-mortem report, sources from the spot confirmed that some parts of bear were removed and nilgai was completely butchered. Also some two-three kilometres away from the spot, two potato bombs were found at a farm at Borgaon. ""Our volunteers saw huge fresh potatoes in the farm and got suspicious. On checking, they found a chip inside them. This is a new kind of bomb we have come across. It might if an animal ate the potatoes,"" said honorary wildlife warden of Gondia Sawan Bahekar.""The carcasses were tied to big stones before being dumped into the well so the they don't float up. The animals must have been poisoned, trapped or electrocuted,"" said the sources. Kadam said the post-mortem was conducted and investigation was in progress. ""Prima facie it appears the bear's body was thrown into the well four-five days back. Post-mortem will reveal what parts were removed,"" he added.Senior officials from the department said removal of organs is done under superstitious beliefs. ""In nearby villages, a bear's penis is believed to be a cure for childlessness as it is believed to bestow fertility. Liver and other parts are also used for making good luck bracelet,"" they said.Bahekar said that rampant poaching of scheduled animals showed that department had no control."

Onion bulbs should be evenly coloured with no signs of sprouting, tomatoes have to be smooth and firm with no cuts or blemishes and greens should look fresh and springy, with no signs of insect damage. ""My mother taught me how to choose vegetables. I am particular that even the potatoes I pick are firm and well-shaped without green patches or sprouts,"" says the 35-year-old bank employee.""I want to feed only the best to my family and won't pick anything with blemishes.""In India and abroad, looks do matter. Not just among human beings but also where produce is concerned. Sellers and buyers, supermarkets and restaurants, all often reject `ugly' food, that is, misshapen and bruised fruits and vegetables.""Customers do prefer fruits and vegetables that `look good'. Sometimes they do reject fruits that are misshapen, so we return them to the vendor from whom we procured,"" says V R Govindasaamy , founder of Amma Naana. According to estimates m the United Nations En from the United Nations Environment Programme, onethird of the produce grown in the world is thrown out simply because it's considered `ugly' though it is perfectly edible. To combat the colossal food waste, the `ugly food movement' is taking off across the world, especially in Europe and Australia. In 2014, Intermarche , the third largest supermarket chain in France, launched a campaign, Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables, to celebrate `ugly' produce and help put an end to food waste.Until recently, the European Union had specific rules that prevented misshapen produce from being sold. For instance, a spear of asparagus could not be sold unless at least 80% of its length was green. Those rules have since been scrapped and 2014 was designated the `European Year Against Food Waste'.While Indians may not reject produce terming them `ugly', fruits and vegetables that do not conform to the way they should ideally look are rejected. India, the second largest producer of fruit in the world, wastes fruits and vegetables worth Rs 13,300 crore every year. According to a 2013 report by Emerson Climate Technologies India, a business of the US-based manufacturing and technology company Emerson, this is because of the lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated transport.Discriminating against 'ugly' produce adds to wastage. ""We get our produce from various farms. If any of it is oddly shaped or has blemishes -for instance, if carrots have a cut in the middle or the bottle gourd is knotted up, they are filtered out at the farm,"" says Madhusudanan K, director of Dhanyam, an organic store with branches in Adyar, Anna Nagar and T Nagar. ""Customers do tend to like things that look good and have a `normal' shape. And they feel bad feeding anything that looks misshapen to their families,"" he says.""Customers pick and choose, and whatever they reject, we dispose of,"" he says, adding that it is probably just 2% of what they procure.Ramanthan Balasubramanian, a media professional admits he wouldn't buy misshapen fruits and vegetables. ""I wouldn't reject them as they are `ugly' but I would be afraid there is something wrong with them,"" he says.That's also the reason why many stores are careful about placing 'good looking' fruits right in the front.""Most of the shops polish the apples, and also keep the best looking fruits in the front when we stack them up,"" says the owner of a fruit and vegetable store in Mylapore.""People are attracted by the way it looks and are willing to shell out more.""The Indian way of selecting produce also causes damage and wastage, say store owners. ""People like to touch and feel their veggies and fruits. When too many people handle it, even good produce gets spoiled,"" says Madhusudanan.In India, though, wastage is cut as the oddly shaped produce is often sold off at a cheaper rate, says shop owners. ""Even if something has blemishes, we can always cut off that portion and sell it cheap,"" says a fruit stall owner. ""But then, it is only poor people who opt for it.""Experts feel that the Indian market and sensibilities are different from that of the West, so an `ugly food movement' may not be the need of the hour.However, different methods can be employed. ""People here are conservative and look for value for money, so it is but natural that when they go to a store, they pick the best,"" says Shree Periakaruppan, founder of Foodology , a recreational culinary studio. ""But if these oddly shaped produce are sold cheaper, there will definitely be takers."""

It's a different matter that the Congress government was bogged down by a Karnataka High Court verdict and recent deluge in parts of Bengaluru.""None of the politicians in the state would want to put their hands into the fire over the encroachment issue, since illegal encroachers constitute a huge chunk of their vote bank. It's really surprising that Siddaramaiah has dared take the risk, especially when the 2018 assembly polls are fast approaching. It would have a huge impact on the vote bank, considering the targets are the poor and middle class,'' admitted a senior Congress leader.KPCC vice-president Prof BK Chandrashekar, however, says Siddaramaiah has to be lauded for his steadfastness and bold decision which his predecessors in the past 25 years failed to take, but hastens to add that he would want to see how the chief minister goes ahead and takes it to its logical end.Opposition leaders, who are surprised by Siddaramaiah's decision, claim the beleaguered CM is only trying to resurrect his image as a leader by launching the anti-encroachment drive and targeting vulnerable people in BJP constituencies.""Why are buildings of influential politicians, builders and IAS officers not being demolished? If Siddaramaiah wants to prove his commitment, he must ensure the BBMP demolishes all buildings, including those owned by powerful people in constituencies represented by Congress MLAs,"" said state JD(S) president HD Kumaraswamy. He said Siddaramaiah should also initiate action against builders and politicians who are named in the interim report of the lake encroachment committee, and the AT Ramaswamy Committee report on encroachments in Bengaluru.Off-hand, though, the netas concurred that public representatives -- the local corporator, MLA and MP across party lines -- are to be equally blamed. Not only did they look the other way when encroachments was taking place, they also actively encouraged encroachers and squatters, apparently to build their vote bank, and have now dropped them like a hot potato. The demolitions will definitely have a deterrent effect on their prospective voters in the long run.SELECTIVE AND PARTISANI neither support nor defend nor justify illegal constructions and the encroachment clearance of rajakaluves undertaken by the BBMP with the support of chief minister Siddaramaiah, purely because they have been selective and partisan. Houses belonging to the poor and lower middle class have been earmarked for demolition, but palatial mansions and offices allegedly built over rajakaluves have been spared. These gullible people have been conned by an unscrupulous real estate lobby. BBMP officials, too, are equally guilty as no illegal construction or encroachment of drains can take place without the knowledge and consent of civic officials. Steps must be taken to recover money from these officials to compensate people whose houses were demolished. The BBMP should come out with an exhaustive and comprehensive map of the rajakaluve network.BS Yeddyurappa | State BJP president"

Are. Different. Ghugre will readily launch into a detailed - and convincing - exposition to back his claim. He's clearly had practice: It's something he did over and over again when he introduced vadapao to the city in 1991.""It took me a good two years to get the message through,"" he remembers, sitting amid a small crowd of breakfast eaters at the now-popular Ghugre Nashta Point at Mahajan Market in Sitabuldi . He set up the shop with help from his parents and elder brothers, and runs it now with his wife Prachi, son Pranav - a hotel management graduate - and a staff that has been loyal to him for decades. A second branch of the eatery started at Bajaj Nagar just eight days ago.Call it first-mover advantage, but Ghugre has become pretty much synonymous with vada pao and made it into a viable snack option in the land of tarri poha and, of course, aloo bonda.Okay, so, here's the difference: The batata vada has no onion. Its crispy gram flour skin is just that, a thin skin, rather than a soda-plumped crust. The quantities of ginger, garlic, green chilli are different, and so is the form in which they are added to the potatoes during the cooking process. The vada is also far milder than the bonda, that has garam masala.Ghugre has, of course, perfected the vada. The flattened patty is stuffed into a custom-made pao (it's larger and more pillowy than the average pao, Ghugre explains) that has a light dabbing of tamarind sauce and the wet garlic chutney, a modification that was made to suit local taste buds. ""People here found the vada pao with powdery garlic chutney, the way it is served in Mumbai, to be too dry,"" Ghugre says.Fans have dubbed the paste-like condiment 'chumma chutney', which is ironic, considering that its garlic content will put paid to any chances of the eater getting a kiss.Ghugre claims he sells close to 1,000 pieces of the vada pao daily, although the shop's other Maharashtrian savouries - sabudana vada and pudachi vadi - do briskly too. The busiest time - unmanageable crowds are always a nice problem to have for eating house owners - is just before Dussehra and Diwali . ""After festival shopping at Sitabuldi, it is almost a ritual to eat at our place. Some 100-150 people are in queue during those days,"" Ghugre says, with mock exasperation and genuine pride.But it's not just Nagpurians. ""Even Punekars, who are notoriously hard to please, appreciate our vada pao,"" he says, adding that known names from Marathi theatre, such as Dr Girish Oak, make it a point to visit the place whenever they are in town. And, during and after the winter assembly session, ministers and officials bulk-buy Ghugre's sweets, especially santra barfi and satari pedha In fact, it was Ghugre's father Janardan who introduced Satari Pedha to Nagpur 66 years ago. This variety, that originates in Satara, is firmer (because the khowa is roasted for a longer period), has a prominent flavour of nutmeg and a longer shelf life than regular pedha.So you see, regular pedha and satari pedha are also not the same thing. They. Are. Different."

The party has already dislodged the Congress as the main opposition in this last bastion of the Left.A request from the TMC forced all private schools to remain closed on Tuesday in her honour. With a desire to expand the party base in this northeastern state, Banerjee lashed out at the BJP-ruled government at the Centre and the Left Front government in Tripura for adopting anti-people policies. Banerjee stressed she would have to build up a movement to overthrow the Marxists the way she has done in her home state ending 34 years of Left rule.Addressing a rally at Vivekananda Stadium in Agartala, Banerjee said the people of West Bengal had voted the TMC back to power with a thumping majority for its pro-people activities and development. ""I am sure, the people of Tripura have already decided to throw out the Left Front government for its anti-development stance and undemocratic activities. The Trinamool Congress will form a new government here after a year,"" the chief minister stated. She alleged that 23 years of uninterrupted LF rule in Tripura could not ensure basic healthcare and education. Hundreds of people go to Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad daily for treatment. The government, which has been pocketing public funds, does not have the right to criticise others, she said.""Agriculture, industry and manufacturing sectors are suffering from multi-phased crises resulting in unemployment and crime, which the Manik Sarkar government is yet to understand,"" pointed out the chief minister.The price of essential commodities has been sky-rocketing in Tripura and potato is being sold at Rs 40/kg. ""How can the LF government remain in power after that? They must step down immediately. They are always complaining that the Union government is depriving them. How can a democratically elected government be solely dependent on the Union government after 45 years of attaining statehood?"" she questioned.""West Bengal had to suffer 34 years Left misrule. However, in the last five years, industry and agriculture have got a boost and a large number of youths have found employment. I promised the people I would bring back the lost glory,"" she claimed.""Today I am committing to the people of Tripura that in the 2018 election, the entire West Bengal Trinamool Congress will mobilise its energy to overthrow the Left. I will come again and again. We will share the joys the woes of the people here,"" she said.Criticising the BJP, she alleged they are not interested in Tripura or West Bengal. Their target is to remain in power at the Centre. ""The BJP is not concerned about us; their target is to trigger communal tension wherever they get a chance. The Modi government is a government of the rich for the rich by the rich. It does not have any pan India stake or vision except tall talks.

We worked on ways that allow both to live with each other. There are no problem animals, but problem locations. During our research, we spotted a pattern in the fatal cases - of the 42 people who died in direct conflict with elephants between 2002 and 2015, 37 did not know there are elephants near them and bumped into them accidently. Besides, 72% of all conflicts happened on the roads and late in the evenings or at night. This analysis formed the basis of our solution,"" said Ananda Kumar.Involvement of the local residents is essential, he said. ""We invited them to share information. Intially, we used to get calls from villagers asking us for information about elephants, now almost 80% of the calls are of informers,"" he added.In Maharashtra, elephants are a concern primarily in the Chandgad, Ajara and Gadhinglaj areas of Kolhapur, where, according to reports, more than 600 cases of the tuskers damaging crops were recorded in 2015. Five elephants are said to be a bane in this area. Meanwhile, three of the four elephants which were captured in Sindhudurg district in 2014 died soon after. Elephants feed on sugarcane, coconut and bananas, besides bamboo and sweet potatoes - all found in abundance in these areas.Prachi Mehta of the city-based Wildlife Research and Conservation Society, who investigated man-elephant conflicts in Sindhudurg and Kolhapur districts a few years back, said, ""Villagers are not used to having elephants in their vicinity and are not tolerant to their existence. Conflict is bound to happen if crops suited for elephants are cultivated on the borders of the forest. Any simple, cost-effective alarm system, which requires minimum human intervention and outsider help, is thus a welcome idea."""

The state has received only 650 mm rainfall this season, which is 81.57% of the 797 mm of average seasonal rainfall.Water in the 202 dams of the state was only 41% against the total storage capacity of 15763.76 MCM. The water in the 137 dams in Saurashtra was only 20% of 2526.59 MCM.Besides the drop in cultivation of arable land, market forces have also ushered in major changes in crop choices in the state.Cultivation of wheat in areas without irrigation has dropped by 69%.The usual area tilled for wheat every year in areas with little or no irrigation is 63,900 hectares. Sowing of cumin seed also fell by 16%, while garlic sowing fell by 59% of normal sowing. Garlic sowing, however, has been on the decline for some time, said sources in the agriculture department.On the other hand, sowing of onion and potato was up by 18% and 37.7%, respectively .While onion was sowed in 5.32 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 4.49 lakh hectare, the sowing of potato was in 11.24 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 8.16 lakh hectares.The biggest shift in crop choice was in the case of fennel whose cultivation went up by 201%.

The normal sowing area in north Gujarat is 10.86 lakh hectares.Garlic may become scarcePeople may have to be ready to face a crisis in garlic supply as the sowing of garlic which is usually was over an area of 1.92 lakh hectares was done in an area of 80,000 hectares. Sources said that for the last few year garlic farming in the state has been on the wane."

Far from running amuck, as children as young as 5 are wont to do, these tots were able to channel their energies to fuller effect at Yoga by the Bay, some of them learning for the first time, the playful goodness of this ancient discipline.Bringing her daughters all the way from Andheri was Jigna Sanghvi, who hoped to inspire them into the practice. ""I've been doing yoga since my childhood when I was taught by my father, and it has always helped bring me peace of mind, bust stress and provide energy,"" she said. ""Now my kids can learn in this beautiful setting.""The asanas were specifically tailored for kids, who followed a programme called 'Grow Tall with Mickey Mehta'. ""What we instil into kids today in terms of wellness will be their fundamental foundation for growth tomorrow,"" explained Mehta, adding, ""They will become more optimistic, more constructive in their behaviour, and all this from outdoor exercise and yoga because when you breathe in fresh oxygen, the child develops a different perspective that helps with immunity and digestion as well.""On the last Sunday of every month since July last year, thousands of people have thronged the sea face, yoga mats in hand, for Yoga by the Bay, a joint initiative by Shaina NC, her father Nana Chudasama's NGO I Love Mumbai and holistic health guru Mickey Mehta, which is supported by The Times of India. ""You know in Mumbai, I have two kids myself and I see that they're just couch potatoes only into junk food, so I think yoga just nullifies it,"" said BJP politician Shaina NC.""The event started after the tremendous response to World Yoga Day on June 21 when around 8,000 people came out despite the rain,"" Shaina NC added. The 1.3km stretch extends from Pizza By The Bay at Kilachand Chowk to the Marine Drive flyover. In the past, themes have ranged from 'Yoga for senior citizens' - Mehta had designed a special workout for the occasion - to 'Clean Mumbai, Green Mumbai,' which was marked by the distribution of saplings.Specially-abled children from The Spastics Society of India, now known as ADAPT (Able Disabled All People Together), practised up front, enjoying the exercise with full vigour. ""Yoga has been part of our curriculum from the beginning, It helps these kids calm down and focus, like meditation,"" said Reshma Tandon, special educator and deputy director at ADAPT. ""We don't know what's going on inside of them sometimes, as kids with celebral palsy might not be able to communicate, but yoga helps calm them.""Also in attendance were celebrities like actor and emcee Rashmi Nigam, who has become a regular at the event, as well as actress Amrit Raichand who brought along her son. ""I do yoga four times a week and believe it benefits you to the max. My son has done it before in school, but he's terrible at it, and I thought what better opportunity to teach him than here,"" she said.BJP MLA Raj Purohit came by to participate, having first experienced the event at its inauguration. ""I am very impressed with this initiative,"" he said. ""It's not just me, I know people in the area also love it and I'm glad to have supported it from the beginning. I feel that this kind of movement should exist all over Mumbai."""

The prevailing conditions have triggered concerns about the output of wheat and chana (gram).According to experts, a warm winter along with poor soil moisture level will adversely impact the rabi crop this year and productions could be severely hit.""The weather has been erratic and is not conducive for production of Rabi crops, including wheat and gram, which require bitter cold conditions and moisture. The region did experience a brief spell of cold, but the temperature shot up again. For wheat production, the suitable temperature is below 12 degrees Celsius and it should prevail for a period of 40-45 days.""""However, currently the present temperature is ranging between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius. High temperatures can affect the tillering (side shoot growth) process,"" district agriculture officer Sanjay Kumar Singh told TOI on Monday.He further said, ""If similar climate conditions persist, production of other Rabi crops too will be negatively affected. Frequent change in climatic conditions has added to the woes of farmers who are already worried about poor soil moisture that is likely to hit the yield this season."" However, the present weather conditions are favourable for production of potatoes, he added.Unseasonal rains in the first half of 2015 had damaged Rabi crops, especially wheat, in the region, which impacted yield and output besides diminishing returns for farmers.Later, they faced a weak monsoon that adversely impacted the output of kharif crops, mainly paddy. While many farmers had to pay more for irrigation to save paddy crop, those who failed to do so lost their crop and money.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature rose to about 25 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal on January 11.The weatherman as well as Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) have forecast similar spell for coming days.On being contacted, weather scientist of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) SN Pandey said, ""While we expect the maximum and minimum temperatures to be around 16 and six degrees Celsius respectively, the actual temperatures are way higher resulting in a warm winter this year.""""Lack of rains due to weak western disturbances is the reason for present weather conditions and the moisture-laden winds are only responsible for snow in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand regions,"" he said.Similar weather conditions are expected to prevail in the region till first week of February and the Rabi crops would be badly affected, added Pandey.Besides, as per the forecasting by IMD, the maximum temperatures are expected to range between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius while minimum temperatures would be around 9-11 degrees Celsius in coming days."

Sixty three year-old Sumitra Kalapatapu doesn't mind the work if that means well-roasted gourds stuffed with a tangy onion paste; something that will show to the world that Andhra food has more to it than biriyanis and fiery fish curries. Elsewhere, 34-year-old Deeptha Vivekanand is readying to host an authentic 'Mudaliar' meal to dispel the myth that Tamil food comes out of either Brahmin or Chettinad kitchens.Food is increasingly being used to subtly re-affirm cultural identities by a few Bengalureans. Their weapon?Secret stashes of grandma's recipes featuring uniqueness of their homelands or communities from Kashmir to Kerala. The back to the roots theme doesn't end here. These pop-up meals, advertised over social media, can be had at the chefs' homes while listening to the nitty-gritty behind a creamy Sindhi seyal chicken stew, or a spicy Coorgi sesame (elle) chutney or a decadent Parsi sali-per-eeda (potato crisps topped with eggs).""More than 100 people have come home after I began Sumi's Kitchen in March 2014 and 90% were not Telugu.It feels good,"" smiles Kalapatapu, who serves only Telugu Brahmin fare. No garlic or onion, except when it comes to the hardy karelas.Her joy is doubled by the fact that Andhra food is equated with nonvegetarian dishes in popular imagination. ""The food at my home is quite flavourful but isn't available at restaurants in Andhra Pradesh. Maybe it is because most restaurants are owned by communities that eat nonvegetarian food,"" says Kalapatapu.Vivekanand says she used to get really riled up when every morsel of food from the southern states were clubbed under 'south Indian'.Another thorn in the flesh is the popularity of Chettinad cuisine, which has been marketed well by eateries across the country. ""It struck me odd that in Bangalore, which has a strong Mudaliar community (a trading community), there were no restaurants with our food. Somebody has to try, ""she says.Food historian and hospitality industry veteran Suresh Hinduja also has taken it upon himself to be the custodian of Sindhi recipes. ""You might've heard that Sindhi cuisine has become an engendered species. It is forgotten and no restaurant in the country serves it,"" says Hinduja, who does pop-ups at home mainly for close friends.And when in doubt, they all go back to grandmothers or at least their home towns. Hinduja has done extensive research and has ''studied under grandma and mother,"" while Vivekanand got a master list of recipes from her grandmother in Chennai.The final list has been whittled down to vazhakkai vadai (banana fritters), mutton curry with radish, and paal bonda (fried snack in sweet milk).Kalapatapu gets her chillies and papad from Andhra to make the dishes as authentic as possible.Kalapatapu isn't being nostalgic when she says that Bengaluru chillies don't have the bite to give the right piquancy to her pickles. In international food circles, there is a word for what she is trying to say: 'terroir'. The French word literally means `soil' but indicates the taste of a dish created by climate and culture of a region. When food is mixed with heritage, and is able to embody the memories of people and places, it becomes `edible chronotype', writes Michael A Di Giovine in Edible Identities: Food as Cultural Heritage. Sometimes traditions are `invented' for the revitaliza tion of communi ties, he writes.Various regions in European Union have created terroir designations for classes of food while UNESCO has designated several European, Middle Eastern and Latin American cuisines as 'intangible cultural heritage'. While the question of what is authentic remains, to the eager visitors, such meals are quick culinary getaways. ""There was this guy from the north-east happily eating appam and stew at my home. We are all like foreigners in India, looking for some exotica,"" says Tresa Francis, who hosts Syrian Christian meals that belong to her native central Kerala.There is more to this trend that prompts startups like LikeMind and Platehopper to offer platforms to connect home chefs and clients. Food is just the spark, friendship and stories are the real items, says Apratim Buragohain of LikeMind, which hosts chefs like Francis and Vivekanand. If Gen X would've been happy having a blast with friends, millennials want to hang out with those who share their interest. ""Technology is enabling a subtle behavioural change, ""says Buragohain.IT professional Roshni Sen landed at Kalapatapu's to discover Andhra food and celebrate her husband's birthday with a healthy homely meal.She had also hoped to connect with people in a city that has become increasingly distant.First, there was a friendly dog. But what changed the course of the meal was curd. ""While serving food, aunty told me that curd will set fast in Bangalore if I put one dry chilly in the vessel, "" says Sen.Hardly scintillating party topic but it stayed. ""When you are staying in a strange city , you don't get to interact with people of your parents' or aunts' generation. I do miss that, ""she says.That's quite an edible memory."
