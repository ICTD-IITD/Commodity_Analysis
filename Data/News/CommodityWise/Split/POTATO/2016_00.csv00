Each country celebrates the festival differently adding their own touch; while many celebrate Christmas today, there are countries for whom the celebrations is in January. From the sweetest, to the weirdest, we list how X-mas is celebrated differently around the world.There are many traditions attached when it comes to celebrating Christmas in Serbia . While one of their traditions involve a girl/ woman collecting water from a well, spring, or stream on Christmas morning, as it is believed to have beneficial powers to strengthen health. Gifts are distributed three Sundays before X-Mas eve. Interestingly, to receive the gift, a game is played where the recipient of the gift is tied up and must hand over gifts to pay their ransom. Logs are also set on fire, as to the traditions it symbolises, the fire that the shepherds of Bethlehem built to keep Jesus warm after he was born.In Venezuela, one can relive their childhood every time Christmas is around. In Caracas, it is common to travel to church for morningservices on roller skates. Roads are cleared to provide churchgoers a safe passage. Many even tie pieces of string and dangle them out of the window so, if they oversleep, passers-by will be able to take support of the string whilst waking them up.In Iceland, there are 13 Santas, who are believed to have come down from the mountain one by one, 13 days before X-Mas. Depending on a child's behavior they leave presents. If the child has been good a present is left for them, however, if the child has been naughty, then a rotten potato is left. It is also believed that one by one the Santas leave after X-Mas, the last one leaving on January 6. Austria has a little scary, way of celebrating the festivities. In Austria they take to the streets to celebrate Santa's terrifying evilcompanion, Krampus. Several people gather at the Hollabrunn Market Square, where over 100 Krampus impersonators are present to scare onlookers. It is said that the German folklore states that Krampus beats naughty children and then puts them in a woven wicker basket on his back. It's certainly not a merry X-mas!In Australia the festivities come only in July. While they do celebrate X-mas on December 25, but the place is comparatively hotter, than other places. Hence they celebrate it with pomp in July again when it is the coolest. Christmas in July does not replace the real Christmas in December, it's enjoyed as an extra celebration. It's also traditional to enjoy a barbecue on the beach on the big day.While we all expect Santa Claus to come and hand us our gifts, in Italy the gifts are handed by Befana, the Christmas Witch. Also the presents are usually distributed after the New Years' Eve. It is said that the kind old Befana distributes presents and is depicted riding a broomstick whilst carrying a bag filled with sweets and gifts, and enters homes through the chimney."

But it did not, despite a drop in prices in the wholesale market. If the wholesale market price dip was due to less demand in the retail market despite adequate supply , this did not reflect in the retail prices. For example, prices of Chandramukhi potatos in Kolkata retail markets stand at Rs 20-22 a kilogram when the government deadline for taking potato out of the state cold storage was December 8. It held true for retail prices of winter vegetables as well, when they were supposed to dip a little during this time of the season. For example, a piece of cauliflower is priced between Rs 8 and Rs 10 a piece in the wholesale market, but the same vegetable is selling for Rs 20-Rs 22 in the retail market. Similarly , eggplants, which are available in abundance during winter, are priced at Rs 11 a kg in the wholesale market, while they cost Rs 22 per kilogram on the retail shelves.The contrast was contrary to the perception that the price of perishable goods would nosedive due to demonetisation. Though the rates did crash by almost 7580% post-demonetisation, they soon soared and remained consistent towards the higher range. ""The drive seems to have had only a marginal effect on the prices of vegetables in retail markets, where the rates have gone down by merely 5-10% after the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" said Prabhat Kumar Das , organising sec retary of the Federation of Traders' Organisation and member of the chief minister's task force on price of edibles. This has surprised the state agriculture marketing department, whose minister Tapan Dasgupta, recently made the rounds of some markets to find out the reason for the constant rates. Even families, hoping for a respite albeit temporary , seemed disappointed with the veggie prices remaining high. ""I had hopes a slash in prices of edibles will be the only silver lining to the demonetisation drive but even that did not happen. The prices have stayed on the steep side,"" said Kakoli Dhar, a homemaker in Lake Town So what is the reason for the price mismatch between the wholesale and retail prices? State agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta blamed it on aggregators and retailers, trying to make up for loss in trade volume, by keeping the prices steep. ""Middlemen in the wholesale markets control the rates. A decrease in supply and increase in demand works in their favour. We are trying to weed out such elements so that the common man do not have to shell out more,"" said Dasgupta.The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), under the finance ministry , did not rule out a price rise after an immediate slump due to demonetisation. The reason, it said, the producer at the first point of the supply chain might withdraw due to the liquidity crunch, leading to less sup ply , pushing prices up.Some traders alleged several unscrupulous elements were keeping the prices up by resorting to dishonest means. ""Within the first week, the prices dropped, but they did not dip further, though supply shrank,"" said the government's task force member. This despite several households shifting to malls and marts to buy edibles with plastic money .Salt Lake homemaker Reema Mukherjee earlier bought 25% of her groceries from the local market and rest from a convenience store. Now, she has shifted to a big store, using her debit card. ""It makes sense to use debit card now. Though I feel the supply in my local market is fresher and I can also bargain there, I am forced to go to the mart now,"" she said."

While there were certain variations across city markets, the overall price curve continued to slide downwards 10 days after the demonetisation move.Markets across the city witnessed low sales even on Thursday. ""I have barely sold 15kg potato since morning. Normally we sell around 120kg each day. The slump has pushed us into a severe cash crunch,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market Potato prices have witnessed the sharpest dip in the past three days after wholesale prices came down to Rs 11 per kg for the Jyoti variety on Wednesday. ""Based on the grading of the Jyoti variety, prices varied between Rs 11 and Rs 12 at the wholesale markets,"" said Patit Paban Dey, former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association. ""It seems that farmers needed cash to stay afloat and decided to release potato at a lower price,"" he added.""We are yet to receive the Nasik variety of onion. But the prices have come down further. This normally happens when the market is flush with new produce,"" said Shakti Prasad Ghara, a vegetable vendor at the New Market. Prices of seasonal vegetables are also showing a downward trend with supplies increasing at the city markets. ""New produce have started coming in and prices of seasonal vegetables like beans, cabbage, capsicum and carrot have come down substantially,"" said Rajat Laskar, a vegetable vendor at Gariahat Market.Egg prices have witnessed a sharp drop in the past few days, and the fish market is suffering because vendors aren't accepting the Rs 2,000 notes.On the other hand, transporters are worried about the liquidity crunch after the toll tax is re-imposed from November 24."

A December devoid of snow threatens the crop of exotic vegetables , which he supplies to hotels in Delhi and other parts of the country each summer. This is not a one-off case. Weather in the hill state has been erratic for quite some time now. The change has been subtle but relentless. Last year, for instance, very less snowfall was recorded in December, particularly in areas like Lahaul-Spiti, which otherwise used to be covered under several feet of snow.For residents of 521 villages of Lahaul-Spiti, this threatens their way of life. Springs emanating from snow deposits are a major source of surface irrigation through gravity kuhls (water channels). The springs are both perennial and ephemeral, getting recharged mainly from melting snow on the higher reaches. There is only one cropping season from April to September or early October when mean minimum and maximum temperatures range approximately between 12 degree celsius to 24 degrees celsius.Suresh Kardo, a resident of Kardang village in Lahaul-Spiti said missing snowfall has become a cause for serious concern for farmers in the tribal district as agriculture is completely dependent on snow, which not only provides moisture to the soil but also recharges water sources for summer.""In the summer, people mainly grow cash crops like peas, potato and cauliflower. Besides, people have switched to the cultivation of exotic vegetable varieties which are supplied directly to hotels and restaurants in Manali and Delhi.These vegetables need plenty of water for irrigation and missing snowfall endangers crop production next summer,"" said Thakur.At Ratnari village of Shimla , apple grower Ashutosh Chauhan is worried about the forthcoming apple season. Missing snowfall will lead to less production as the requirement of chilling hours could not be met. ""Since October 5, the state has not received rain and snow and we do not know how extensively this prolonged dry weather will affect apple production,"" he said.The wheat crop has also been affected in lower Himachal as sowing has been delayed in many areas.People who have sown wheat are facing losses as irrigation facility is not available in many areas.""Himachal Pradesh has been witnessing dry weather conditions for two months. This has affected sowing of wheat, peas and garlic. Even natural water springs are drying up. People are heading to the temple to pray for rain and snow as the cash crop is under threat,"" said Suresh Kumar a farmer from Kullu."

Tucked away amid hills and forests, the village is situated 60 km from here in the Maoist corridor.However, things changed for better since the implementation of a watershed development project by the district administration during 2015-16. The project has not only led to increase in the tribals' income but also checked migration.""Earlier there was no irrigation facility at the village and we solely depended on monsoon for agriculture. Also, we used to migrate in search of work. But now, the watershed project have given us confidence to grow crop in off-season also,"" said Sadhu, who has cultivated maize and potato on his five acres. This year, Sadhu has earned Rs 2.50 lakh by selling potato, cabbage and maize.Officials said Rs 30 lakh has been spend for the project.

The distribution drive, planned outside the UP Legislative Assembly building, is aimed at drawing the government's attention to the acute problems being faced by farmers across the country, exacerbated by the government demonetisation move which had led to a liquidity crunch.Speaking to TOI, BKU's Lucknow spokesperson Alok Verma said, ""Farmers have not been able to sell their potato and paddy produce and the markets are lying empty . To make ends meet, a large number of them were forced to make distress sale of paddy at Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal even though the minimum support price declared by the government is Rs 1,470 per quintal. Now, demonetisation had crippled business further because farmers have no money to buy seeds, DAP , and fertilisers to sow the rabi (winter) crop. They are dumping their produce in the state capital in the hope that the government will take note and do something for them.""Until Tuesday night, 22 trucks-full of paddy and potaoes had landed up outside the BKU office in Lucknow. Verma claimed that potatoes and paddy in excess of 100 quintals will be up for grabs outside Vidhan Sabha.

But in these days of 'conscious eating', another potato is slowly but steadily taking over the mantle of 'favourite'; the sweet potato While most of us usually tuck into piping hot, steamed, sweet potatoes as a tea-time snack, the interesting feature of the tuber is that is lends itself beautifully to cooking, be it sweet or savoury dishes, and is increasingly being opted for as the 'healthier carb'.But, do not be fooled by the word 'sweet'. Sweet potatoes contain a whopping dose of beta-carotene, Vitamin C , potassium and other vital vitamins and minerals. In fact, the nutritional value of this tuber has been ranked as the highest among several other foods.Goa boasts two varieties of sweet potatoes grown locally the brown-skinned, orange variety and the white-skinned variety that is also known as the 'Goa Velha white'. Both are popular and widely available, especially during the winter season.Food blogger Xanti Fernandes e Pinto of xantilicious.com says she finds sweet potatoes to be an excellent alternative to regular cooking potatoes in most dishes as they are a rich source of complex carbohydrates and Vitamin C. Some of her favourite sweet potato-based sweet dishes are bebinca and neureo. ""The sweet potato neureo, or kongancheo neureo , is something I have been eating since I was a child at my Hindu neighbour's home,"" she says.The procedure to make these, Pinto says, can get a bit tricky as the dough, due to its stickiness, needs to be handled between plastic sheets while rolling and folding. And like in most sweet potato-based dishes, the level of sweetness can be adjusted as desired by simply adding a bit of sugar.Homemaker Nirmala Fernandes has fond childhood memories of a sweet dish she would be served at the convent whenever she visited her aunt. The dish consists of parboiled sweet potatoes that are then sliced or cubed, pan-fried with a dash of coconut oil and tossed in a pre-prepared filling of grated coconut and coconut jaggery (ghodd-chun).""Apart from steamed, sweet potatoes, this version is also a family favourite,"" she says.Avid foodie and owner of the popular food blog, 'Hungry? Hog?', Sapna Sardesai says she indulges her family with many different sweet potato preparations. ""Sweet potato kheer, made with sago and coconut milk, is quite a popular traditional dish and a favourite, too,"" she says.Another popular preparation, she says, is the puran poli, which is traditionally an Indian stuffed bread with a lentil filing. ""A stuffing made using boiled and mashed sweet potatoes, a bit of sugarcane jaggery and grated coconut makes for a delicious alternative,"" Sardessai explains.Sweet indulges can hardly get better than this."

By November 25, 55% of paddy is harvested, but only 22% Kharif paddy has been reaped so far. The government is thinking of diverting 100-day job labourers to fields for reaping the crop.Bengal's food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Tuesday said: "" After the paddy is procured, it will go to rice mills . Each entry at rice mill will generate three challans, one of which comes straight to food department in Kolkata. Immediately , the fund will be transferred to the bank account of the farmer through RTGS system. The entire procure ment will be monitored at multiple levels so no corruption creeps in.""He added: ""We have Rs 5,000 crore with the department for procurement. Moreover, we are taking a loan of Rs 1,000 crore from the West Bengal Finance Development Corporation. Besides, the Centre is supposed to give us Rs 2,008 crore this year and Rs 481 crore against last year's due.The state has set the minimum support price of Rs 1,490 per quintal (.1 tonne). It has also set a procurement target of 52 lakh tonne paddy which will yield 41.20 lakh tonne rice. The state's requirement out of the procurement is 32 lakh tonne. Six lakh tonne of rice will be sold to Jharkhand. Rest of the rice will be given to state food safety pool and central food safety pool.The food minister also alerted against a fake job racket in the name of paddy procurement. The racket is playing havoc with the youths in rural Bengal. They are duping job-seekers and charging thousands of rupees in the name of recruitment of civic volunteers by the food department. ""We cannot recruit civic volunteers. Civic volunteers are there with the police department. In case of procurement, the civic volunteers will be roped in from the respective superintendent of police of the district. They floated fake websites and I have ordered inquiry by CID,"" said Mullick.Potato clearance deadline extendedThe Bengal government has extended the deadline for clearing potato stock from cold storage by eight more days.Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta on Tuesday said, ""We have asked all the stakeholders in the potato business to clear the stock immediately.

However, there is little impact of on retail price. Thanks to the middlemen and the last man in the retail market, the price of vegetables remains quite high compared to their prices the same time last year. With the liquidity crunch continuing unabated, there is an element of distress sale at the source (from the field) by farmers. The overwhelming fear that the perishables may not be sold at all is also working behind the price crash.The potato (jyoti variety), which grows in abundance in Hooghly, is sold at Rs 4 per kg soon after its withdrawal from the cold storages. After sorting the potato, wholesale price stood at Rs 7-8 per kg. The retail price should have been Rs 910 per kg after taking into account the transportation and other costs. But the retail price remains as high as Rs 16-22 in most of the markets in the city. Thanks to demonetisation and the resultant liquidity crunch, a stockpile of 8 lakh tonnes of potatoes remained in the cold storages even after the deadline of clearing the stockpile expired on November 30. Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said the potato price should come down after the potato stockpile is cleared. He has set a deadline of December 8 for clearing the entire stock from the cold storages.The price of brinjal, which grow mainly in Hooghly and Burdwan, crashed to Rs 55-60 per palla (per 5 kgs). The wholesale price should not be more than Rs 15 per kg. But brinjal price in the city retail market hovered around Rs 25-30 per kg.Cabbage, which was Rs 35-40 per palla in the wholesale market, is sold at Rs 20 per kg in the city retail markets.The biggest crash happened in tomato prices. Toma toes grow in huge quantity in Bankura and Purulia. The farmers on Tuesday sold it at Rs 20 a palla. The tomato wholesale price at Khatra and Manbazar stood at Rs 6 per kg. But the retail price of tomato remains as high as Rs 20-25 per kg on Tuesday.Uttam Kundu, a wholesaler at Seoraphuli wholesale market, said, ""We have asked farmers to raise Rs 1 per kg against every vegetable so that farmers get some price. But the fear of liquidity crunch is so high that people did distress sale. The market has become a bit unpredictable.""Agriculture marketing department sources said there is a collusion of middlemen and the last man in the market (last retail outlet) that prevented the plunge in retail price.Dasgupta said, ""We are not sitting idle.

The plastic waste generated in the Diamond City will be used in the construction of asphalt roads.The civic body has started a pilot project for constructing roads using plastic waste in three municipal zones namely Katargam, Varachha and Udhna adopting Indian Road Congress' (IRC) guideline for use of waste plastic in hot bituminous mix (dry process). Official sources said the Diamond City generates around 1,600 tonnes of solid waste per day. Out of this, the plastic waste consists of around 10 per cent or 160 tonnes.The entire process is very simple. The plastic waste material above 40 micron and below 90 micron, including items like plastic carry-bags, plastic cups, plastic packaging for potato chips, biscuits, chocolates, etc. are shredded to a particular size using a shredding machine. The aggregate mix is heated at 150c and transferred to the mixing chamber, and the bitumen is heated to 160c to result in good binding. It is important to monitor the temperature during heating.The shredded plastic waste is then added to the aggregate. It gets coated uniformly over the aggregate within 30 to 60 seconds, giving an oily look. The plastic waste coated aggregate is mixed with hot bitumen and the resulting mix is used for road construction. The road laying temperature is between 110c to 120c. The roller used has a capacity of 8 tonnes.""The advantages of using waste plastic for road construction are many. The process is easy and does not need a new machinery. For one metric tonnes of bitumen, around 80 kilogram to 100 kilogram plastic waste is used. Plastic increases the aggregate impact value and improves the quality of flexible pavements. Wear and tear of the roads, rainwater seepage and road durability could be increased to a large extent,"" said municipal commissioner M Thennarasan. Adviser and incharge of road development department Jatin Shah told TOI, ""Plastic waste helps increase the strength of the road. These roads have better resistance towards rainwater and cold weather. """

""It is not only milk, but even routine lives of farmers are affected. There is little sowing activity in rabi season as loan disbursement has come to a standstill and rates for produce like potato have declined,"" Hinge said.However, speaking at an interactive session organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists (PUWJ), minister of state for agriculture Sadabhau Khot said, ""Farmers are happy with the demonetisation decision as they are going to reap the benefits in the long term."""

Liquidity crunch and fresh supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have changed the game altogether. The wholesale price of Jyoti variety of potato crashed to Rs 2-3 per kg at markets closed to cold storages across Bengal. However, the crash has a little impact on the retail markets in the city.This year saw the least potato production  9 million tonne  in Bengal compared to earlier years. So, many farmers and middlemen calculated a good price if they managed to hoard a substantial amount of potato. A section of farmers, middlemen and cold-storage owners fudged this year's actual storage to jack up the price. So, when the actual storage was 6.5 million tonnes across 462 potato cold storages in Bengal, it was shown only 3 million tonne. This led to abnormal rise of potato price in both wholesale and retail markets.Potato economy of Bengal is always erratic. It is one of the most risky farming bets. With a contribution of 25% in India's potato output, Bengal is the second-largest producer of the vegetable after UP. ""A section of middlemen and traders speculate the probable price of potato every year, keeping in mind the production of potato and its price in previous years. But things often go haywire when ground reality changes,"" said Shankar Adhikari , an agriculture economist.November 30 was the last date for clearing entire stock. But government found a huge stockpile of potato in the cold storages. Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta extended the last date of clearing the stock till December 8. But even after that the government found a huge stock uncleared. Now that section of farmers and middlemen find it difficult to withdraw the stock from cold storages as the cost overshoots the wholesale price.Paschimbanga Potato Traders Association president Swapan Samanta said: ""Liquidity crunch along with fresh supply of low-cost potato from Punjab has changed the game. Bengal potato now has hardly any buyer. The potato retail price now should be below Rs 8 in Kolkata's retail markets."" Traders are jostling to sell before the new crop arrives in December end, failing which the old one must be destroyed."
58d6c963a3d24b1894a6b23c,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

As wasted fruits and vegetables fill the area and raise a stink, estimates show that at least 60-70% of the produce is going waste because supply chain has been disrupted by cashlessness. It is the same situation at most mandis that come under Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Markets Board.On Wednesday morning, potato buyer and whole seller Mohammad Salim ordered throwing 25 sacks into the garbage dump. A single sack contains 1 quintal potatoes. ""An average of 20-25 sacks are going waste since demonetisation was announced,"" said the businessman.His son Mohammad Shaan said wastage over the month was to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh. ""We would have sold the produce to retailers at an estimated rate of Rs 5 per kg which means Rs 12,500 for 25 quintals. If the average for 28 days of demonetization period is calculated, our loss stands at Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said.But Salim is not the only one to have run into losses. The mandi comprises 50 buyers and at least 500 farmers in the vicinity. ""Cash and change crunch has upset business across levels. Over 60-70% of the produce is wasted for lack of demand. If this goes on, the mandi will have to close down,"" said Arvind Shukla, vice-president of the mandi's vegetable and fruit whole sellers association.General secretary Irshad Hussain added, ""Many farmers are not able to bring their produce to us because they have no money for transport. Some of the growers are dumping their produce either for peanuts at the local level or leaving it to fate. Even those who can manage are not able to get the cost of ferrying goods as prices have nose-dived.""Explaining the price factor, Saroj Pal, a dealer in tomatoes said, ""In October, a crate of tomatoes (25kg) sold at Rs 700 but a farmer gets only Rs 100 for the same now. Clearly, the rates have come down seven times.""Cauliflower, the cash crop of the past two seasons is making farmers regret. ""A single bud is fetching just 1 rupee instead of Rs 6-8 each last season,"" said Dharmu Lodhi, a farmer from Bangermau.Wastage at the fruit sellers' end was estimated to be around 40-50%. Tanveer Ahmed, who dealt with exotic fruits like kiwis , kinnows and grapes said, ""We dealt with these fruits on a daily basis but there have been just one or two business days in the week. The stock is going waste on a daily basis.""Tomato farmer from Rajpur (MP), Angad Singh said ""Will Modiji pay for our losses?"" Nizam Bhai pyazwale said, ""Many farmers had taken loans... the bid to battle black money is fine but not at the cost of human lives. Steps have to be taken immediately,"" he said.Hand-to-mouth locals are perhaps the only happy ones in the mandi because some vendors are giving away their vegetables free. Potato dealer Mohammad Irshad said, ""It will be disrespect of the Almighty if food is thrown away so it is better some human consumes some it without paying."" Beneficiary of this benevolence, Gita from Birdibagh said, ""I will use the best part for the family while feed the cattle on the rest."""

I will do it',"" said C V Sheela, one of the nurses. ""She smiled at us when we walked in, chatted with us, and, on most occasions, cooperated. When we were around, she made an effort to eat despite difficulties.She would have one spoon for the sake of each of us and one for herself,"" Sheela added.Her diet included her favourite upma, pongal or curd rice and potato curry, prepared by her cook. There was a team of 16 nurses who were posted in three shifts; Sheela, M V Renuka and Samundeeswari were among her favourites.After a condolence meeting at Apollo Hospitals , doctors, nurses and paramedics described how she was sometimes funny, usually cooperative, and occasionally difficult during her 75-day stay.Jayalalithaa was brought to the emergency room on the night of September 22 in severe discomfort. Four hours later, when her vitals were stable, she woke up and asked for some sandwiches and coffee. ""It had been a long journey for her since then,"" said Dr R Senthil Kumar, senior consultant, who led a team of intensive care experts. When she wasn't too tired, she would chat with duty doctors. She would give tips on skin care and sometimes 'ordered' them to change their hair style. ""She always advised women to give themselves some time however busy they were,"" said medical director Dr Sathya Bhama.She wasn't a fan of Apollo Hospitals' coffee. One day, she told a room full of nurses and doctors to pack up and come to her Poes Garden residence. ""Come, let's go home. I will serve you the best tea from Kodainadu,"" said critical care expert Dr Ramesh Venkataraman There were moments when she was firm. When UK-based Richard Beale gave her a pep talk asking her to cooperate, telling her that in the hospital he was the boss, she weakly gestured to him that 'this state' was her turf.Doctors vividly remember her being spirited when AIADMK won all three polls in Thanjavur, Arvakuruchi and Thiruparankundram on November 22. ""She watched the news on Jaya TV and smiled,"" Dr Bhama said.But everything changed on that fateful Sunday evening. She was watching an old Tamil soap opera when an intensivist (name withheld) walked into her room. Jayalalithaa didn't smile or talk. She seemed breathless. By the time the doctor adjusted the ventilator, the monitors around her had flat-lined. She had. Two days later, when doctors and nurses walked into the hospital, the silence was deafening. ""She promised to take us to the TN assembly ,"" nurse Sheela said with her voice breaking."

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer.

Vegetable prices have remained the same at all the Kolkata municipal markets , even after the shift in sales from the neighbourhood bazars to shopping malls during the initial days of demonetisation. Even the state task force team apparently couldn't get to the bottom of the reason.""There is a huge difference between wholesale and retail prices. We have brought it to the CM's notice. I fear there is a strong retail cartel in the city that has prevented any drop in rates even after wholesale prices started going down. There has also been a slump in field rates,"" said Bengal Vendors' Association president Kamal Dey . The high retail price doesn't quit sync with the supply scene as Bengal, like elsewhere in the country , had a bumper yield this year.Potato prices in the retail market range between Rs 10 and Rs 12 a kg, while its wholesale rate is pegged at Rs 7 a kg. What's more is that cold storages are auctioning the potato stocks at Rs 120-140 for a 50-kg packet, which comes down to Rs2.4-Rs 2.8 a kg. The marginal decrease in retail prices for some items is no match to the price crash during this part of the season. So much so that potato far mers at Tarakeswar are dumping their stocks because the prices they are getting is half the amount they spent on potato seeds for sowing.Other vegetable prices, too, defy the economics of demand-and-supply, with traders at Kolay Market wondering where and how were the perishable items stored to ensure a regulated supply . Prices of vegetables remained similar compared to that last year, even during the first few days of demonetisation. ""There was a fall in demand initially. Most people had to cut down on their daily budget. Retailers didn't compromise on prices even then,"" Dey said.The widening gap has prompted some farmers to shift to cultivating flowers. ""This may lead to a supply crunch, pushing prices up further,"" Dey said, adding the vegetable-to-flower shift could impact the food chain. ""We will start feeling the pinch from February . We may have to pay double for vegetables,"" Dey said."

In 2015, potato sowing was conducted over 5.19 lakh hectares till December 5. This year, however, 10.17 lakh hectares have been sown by the same date. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.Currently, Gujarat ranks fifth in the country in production of potato. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily. While 23 lakh tonnes had come to the market in 2014, in 2015, that amount went up to 31 lakh tonnes, and to 35 lakh tonnes in 2016.Sowing of the crop picked up over last month, said officials, who reported that at least 5.51 lakh hectares had been sown in the last 20 days alone. If the trend continues, sowing will cross 12 lakh hectares - so far the highest area used to cultivate potato in Gujarat in any year.Mavjibhai Desai, chairman of the Deesa APMC attributes the exponential growth of potato farming to a number of reasons. ""This year, sowing has gone up with Narmada water reaching the northern parts of the state,"" said Desai, adding, ""The big increase in storage facilities has also drawn the attention of farmers to the cultivation of potato.""Desai said that in 2015-16 the top potato growing states - Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - had seen their production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, unlike other potato-growing states, Gujarat had registered an increase in potato production due to higher acreage.Better prices have also attracted farmers to potato cultivation, hold officials in the agriculture department, who said farmers received a good price last year for their yields, and this year, as compared to 2015, potato seed is cheaper and more easily available.In 2015-16, cold storage capacity went up by 6.25 lakh tonnes, with the current capacity at 22.5 lakh tonnes, said agriculture department officials.

""All will be punished in the near future,"" Modi said. He further said the courts are getting many cheque bounce cases. With the use of digital banking, this problem will also end, the PM said.He called upon the farmers to take up honey farming in their fields along with other crops.

This centre should be responsible for research and value-addition to castor and its finished product. He further said that once he had asked Verghese Kurien to value-add to isabgol and Kurien had come out with IsabCool ice-cream.

Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch. The Punjab Potato Seed Federation has already approached Bengal agents with a request to collect the money from farmers in old currency notes. West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances. ""I have intimated the state government about the proposal and am waiting for the response. I came to know that the Punjab government has endorsed the move.

""It's fun watching him play against everybody else.""It wasn't as much fun being on the receiving end.Thunder center Enes Kanter recorded 17 points and 10 rebounds. Victor Oladipo added 15 points for Oklahoma City, who withstood 37 points and 15 rebounds from Pelicans star Anthony Davis.Rookie Buddy Hield broke out of a slump with 16 points, all in the second half, for the Pelicans, who trailed by as many as 15 but cut the lead to seven points with three minutes remaining.Davis had a chance to trim the deficit to five, but he missed back-to-back shots on the same possession.Westbrook then produced a fastbreak finger roll to stretch the edge back to 93-84 with 2:39 to play.An Oladipo free throw and two three-pointers from Hield pulled New Orleans within 94-90. But they would get no closer and Westbrook's three-pointer in the final minute put the game away.In New York, Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony scored 20 points apiece to lead the Knicks to a 106-98 victory over the Sacramento Kings.It was the third time in four games that Rose scored 20 points. Brandon Jennings added a season-high 19 points and Kristaps Porzingis chipped in 15 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots for the Knicks, who handed Sacramento their third straight defeat.DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with 36 points, 12 rebounds and three blocked shots. It marked the 10th time Cousins has scored at least 30 points this season.- Magic turn tables on Pistons -The Orlando Magic ended a seven-game run of futility against Detroit, downing the Pistons 98-92 thanks in large part to a stellar performance from Serge Ibaka.Ibaka scored 21 points with seven rebounds, four assists, four blocked shots and three steals for the Magic, who hadn't beaten the Pistons since November 17, 2014.""There's no question he's an elite big man. He's one of the best two-way bigs in the game,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""There's no other way to put it. He's shooting the ball from the perimeter, he's scoring in the post and he's really trusting the pass. He's buying into the hot potato type of mindset, where the open man gets the shot every time. And he's a force on the defensive end.""Nikola Vucevic added 16 points and eight rebounds off the bench for Orlando, who have won three of their last four after a four-game slump.""I don't care about the stats,"" Ibaka said. ""We've been looking for those wins for a long time now. That's the most important thing for me because I know when the team wins, everybody looks good.""bb/dw"

Mercurial Mamata is on a ""'s cash clean-up bid.Such is her determination that she was ready to shake hands with her arch rival CPM against Modi. Although the Marxists did not reciprocate, that didn't faze her. Nor did the refusal of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar  she had moved closer towards him in the last few months  to join her, dampen the. Didi immediately widely seen as a reference to Nitish  and reached out to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. She even put aside her anger against Samajwadi Party for betraying her to back Pranab Mukherjee for the post of President, to enlist UP CM Akhilesh Yadav in her campaign.And she has been raising the pitch constantly, demanding a roll-back of the entire exercise when other opposition parties have restricted their criticism to the manner in whichSo what makes Mamata so angry? Social media is flooded with posts saying it's a desperate bid by her to protect her ilk that has been hit hard by the cash clean-up. But, even if one doesn't discount the view, the argument applies to all political parties, including the ruling BJP. Then why is she alone being so edgy?It would be too early to jump to conclusions, because both Modi and Banerjee are moving by perceptions.Fact is, people across Bengal, from auto-rickshaw drivers to the salaried middle-class, hailed Modi's move the day it was announced.They saw it as a sincere attempt to book the crooks, politicians, real estate developers, a section of bureaucrats and professionals, who've been looting their hard earned money with impunity. Even people standing in long queues were ready to bear the short-term pain for the long-term clean-up. The public mood began swinging a week later, when the liquidity crunch hit households.Sales in kirana shops and local bazaars dropped, making households cut their expenditure and go for credit purchases. In villages, small farmers, at the end of the supply chain, have never had enough muscle to keep this credit business going for more than a week.The result has been a shift of business from local markets to malls. It hit the informal supply chain at a time when a large chunk of people in Bengal ekes out a living from this sector. Harvesting has got delayed by a week in Bengal's villages and sowing of the potato tuber has also suffered. Mamata is hoping to tap into this frustration and anger.Moreover, she seems to have got a sanction from a wide range of economists, including Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. Even a working paper prepared by the Tax Research Group of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) under the Union finance ministry shared some concerns.Mamata is thus playing a gamble to find for herself space in national politics, when other opposition parties are not too confident of the outcome in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Nitish already has problems with his ally Lalu Prasad; and, the Yadav family feud in UP has spilled out into the open. Congress too doesn't have the numbers to command the opposition course.Mamata is far better placed. She has decimated the Left, and BJP, though a rising force in Bengal, is still a distant second. Confident of winning at least 40 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections, the Trinamool chief is now banking on the growing public impatience among the farmer, the petty trader and the salaried class to turn the tables on Modi. It's not without reason that Mamata reached out to the city's biggest trading hub at Burrabazar the other day to talk to traders, many of whom voted for BJP in the national and assembly polls.Finally, Mamata sees BJP as her next opposition in Bengal  reason enough for her to up the ante against Modi. Both the leaders, it seems, are looking at a new polarisation in Bengal, and Mamata is doing it her way."

The move has led to cardamom and potato sales from Bhutan to India dropping drastically as Indian traders have been struggling to arrange cash for making payments, informed persons familiar with the developments. Indian currency is used as legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan. Phuentsholing is the main land border entry point between India and Bhutan.Sufficient cash is not available for the export-oriented businesses in Phuentsholing market, according to the persons familiar with Indo-Bhutan border trade. Bhutanese traders ruethey get to withdraw only Rs 2,500 from ATMs in a day which is not enough. Most of the transactions are cash based.The price of cardamom mid-November hit a record low of 700 Ngultrum per kg, which was between 800 and 900 Ngultrum a week ago. Ngultrum is the currency of Bhutan. One Bhutanese Ngultrum equals One Indian Rupee Indian traders have informed their Bhutanese counterparts they would be able to import agro-products only after three months. Some Bhutanese traders have not been able to export any cardamom since November 8. Cardamom export has drastically gone down in Silliguri, which is a major market for Bhutan. If the trend continues the cardamom price will decline further and there is risk that exports from Bhutan will get further affected, according to informed sources.Similarly potato exports from Bhutan to India have also slowed down. Some Indian exporters also paid their Bhutanese counterparts in old currencies. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner. A free trade regime exists between India and Bhutan. Major items of exports from Bhutan to India are electricity, ferro-alloys, carbides, bar and rods, cement, copper wire, semi finished products of iron and non-alloy steel, Dolomite, gypsum, agri products such as oranges, cardamom and potatoes.Meanwhile, Bhutan's mineral exports to Bangladesh has also been affected. While Letter of Credits are being used for payments, transportation has been proving a challenge.Trucks from Phuentsholing and Samdrupjongkhar, on the border with Assam , take minerals until Burimari, border area between India and Bangladesh. Indian currency is required for logisticssupport in this trade which is currently not available in the market.Bhutan has been taking up the issue of currency ban with India ever since the PM's announcement on demonitisation as the Himalayan State is also being faced with the crisis of cash crunch. Nepal and Bhutan, two major recipients of Indian financial aid, have taken up with New Delhi the issue of demonetisation of high-value currency bills and the impact it could have on financial assistance to them. India has earmarked Rs5,490 crore for Bhutan and Rs300 crore for Nepal in this year's budget The Bhutanese Central Bank has informed all banks in the country to freeze, until further notice, withdrawals of Ngultrums in exchange for demonetised INR notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination by Bhutanese individuals and companies."

""As per the feedbacks we are getting from villages, 10 to 25 workers have returned their home in almost each village in Bihar after the closure of their workplaces in different places in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Gujarat due to note ban,"" Purbey said.He claimed that around 10,000 party workers would attend the dharna programme in each district headquarters on December 28.

(Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh) Every ahrtiya is ordering one-third of the supplies he used to because of the limited cash available with him. (Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh)Wholesale vegetable and fruit prices have crashed due to the cash crunch in the market but retailers continue to hold prices to make the best of a situation in which buyers have cut back purchases.Every ahrtiya is ordering one-third of the supplies he used to because of the limited cash available with him. The retailers also do not have enough cash to pay for what they buy from the wholesalers. The cycle is moving on the strength of credit only. Most of us are giving 3-4 days credit, said Amarvir Singh, president of Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Sellers Association, Ludhiana.WATCH VIDEORasheed, an ahrtiya who works in Malerkotlas vegetable mandi that sends vegetables to mandis in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga and a large part of Punjab apart from Jammu, said, Cauliflower is available with me at Rs 3 a kg while potato coming from cold stores is available in the range of Rs 4-5 a kg. You can take a sack full of gobhi at the rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3 a kg from me and I am ready to give 50 kg aaloo in the range of Rs 200-250 a kg. Most ahrtiyas are selling at this rate only. Last week, wholesale cauliflower was priced at Rs 8-10 per kg. Carrot, which was available at 20 a kg, is now priced at Rs 10 in wholesale market and methi and palak are available at Rs 5-6 a kg against the previous rate of Rs 9-10 a kg in most mandis of Punjab.Amarvir said, A box of apple is available at Rs 500 against the previous price of Rs 600. Almost everything is cheap. Retailers are buying it cheap from us. What prices they are selling, we have no idea.The worst hit are farmers who have to sell the produce at dirt cheap prices as there is no point stocking perishable vegetables. We are sending our full stock to mandis as we have no choice. We cant hoard, said Amarjeet Singh, a vegetable grower from Bhurrekalan village of Ferozepur. A few farmers near Hussaniwala are giving a carrot bag of 50 kg for Rs 200 only as they have lost hope of getting good prices and hence are planning to sow another crop in their fields.WATCH VIDEOI was happy with the move of demonetisation but it has affected my own crop, he said.However, in retail market, cauliflower is available for Rs 20-30 a kg, carrot for Rs 25-30 a kg. Potatos are available at Rs 25-30 a kg.It is difficult to go to the wholesale market to buy vegetables. So we have no choice but to purchase from the vendor at his prices. Moreover, we are buying just half a kg instead of usual one kg because of cash crunch, said Kiranjeet Kaur, a housewife from New Model town.Manjeet Kaur, another homemaker, said, I am buying vegetables on credit from my vendor and I pay him after 2-3 days. I have not done this before, but I have no choice. It will take time for the notes of smaller denomination to get circulated in market.Harjinder Singh, a vegetable vendor who sells saag, methi and mooli everyday in Pakhowal road area, however, said, People are giving me cash and my work is going on. Most of them are buying in the range of Rs 50-60. So I am not facing much problem.Rasheed, however, said, We are following a wait-and-watch policy and are hoping that cash will flow in market in the coming few days.

Saute onions, garlic and capsicums together. Marinate some minced chicken with salt, pepper, cumin, chilli, coriander and add it to the pan. Make a potato patty and add this mixture to it. Roll them up into a ball and dip it into flour, egg and then crumbs. Fry it and there you go, potato chicken dumplings for your New Year party!Ive been a chef for seven years now and specialise in continental cuisine. But, I want to perfect my hand in my traditional cuisine  Chettinadu! The most difficult dish to prepare and which also turns out to be my favourite is Chettinadu fish curry. A small incorrect measurement can change flavours and wreck it. But someday, I will perfect it!I love sea food and I can live on it, especially garlic flavoured prawns; some delicious sea food on a plaintain leaf while sitting on the floor at my home with loved ones. Blissful, really! And an extra spoon of butter maybe? My favourite ingredient has always been butter. It can take your dish to another level of delicious! You know, as much as Im a jovial chef at my work place, I can get a little tensed and worked up at home when food gets wasted. I wonder whybut I love my food and my family. (smiles) I was very young when I began to appreciate the art.I would help mother make chappatis, dosas and chutneys too! I continued to follow her recipes for a while, then began to learn from senior chefs at work before I began to experiment myself. Once, I tried a dish with polenta pasta and fish. Instead of using cornflakes as crumbs to cover the meat, I used polenta pasta. It came out well and the crispiness lasted for a long time! I also cooked in a silver foil pouch which caused every ingredient to retain their individual flavours.Experimenting with food can bring a lot of surprises!Heres another tip. You must always have your curd rice cold. Try this: Add Sauteed ginger, small onions, chilli and curry leaves to the curd rice mixture and serve warm. The flavours of ginger and shallot will be different and you will love it!"

Potatoes, which according to quality were fetching wholesale prices between Rs4 and Rs11 per kg, just a week ago, are now being sold at Rs1.5-Rs6 per kg. In the retail market, prices of potatoes have climbed down from Rs18-Rs22 per kg to Rs11-Rs15 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year at this time, potato prices were at Rs8 to Rs10 per kg, but this year it has dropped to Rs1.5 per kg. The potatoes we are getting now are local potatoes, which are from cold storage.""Speaking on the price drop of potatoes, Kishorekumar Lachhmandas Paryani, a trader in APMC, Ahmedabd, said, ""The old stock is being released from cold storages thus leading to the drop in prices."" Paryani said last year's crop was bountiful and thus the amount of potatoes stocked in cold storages was higher than usual.""Old stock will continue to be released for another month until the new potato crop starts arriving,"" said Paryani.Retailers, however, are of the opinion that there will be no further price drop, and that prices have stabilized.Richa shah a homemaker from Satellite said, ""I don't know whether potato prices will remain low in the coming days, and so I have decided to make and store potato wafers, which I usually do on arrival of the new crop."" She was happy that prices of most vegetables have dropped.Farmers in the state had received good prices for their crops in April 2016 despite 15% increase in production.

Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation , as measured by the wholesale price index rose annual 3.2% in November, slower than previous month's 3.4%.The softening in WPI inflation comes close on the heels of retail inflation easing to a two-year low of 3.6% in November. The government revised upwards the inflation for September to 3.8% from the previously reported 3.6%.The move to scrap some high value currency notes has dented consumer demand and hurt industries and there have been demands for a cut in interest rates to boost demand.The latest data showed food inflation slowed to 1.5% in November, compared to 4.3% rise in the previous month. RBI relies largely on the retail inflation measure although it takes into account all price data, while finalising monetary policy.The WPI data showed vegetable prices slid 24.1% in November, while onion prices contracted 51.5%. But some pressure points were visible as wheat prices rose 10.7%, potato 36.9% year-on-year and sugar 31.7% during the month. The fuel, power and light index rose 7% in November, up from previous month's 6.2%.""WPI inflation has come at 3.15% due to subdued food prices. However, we expect the rate to hover around 4% mainly due to firming up of core inflation and a rise in food prices once the base effect weakens. Also the rabi crop will be critical in driving future prices as the present cash crunch has slowed down the rabi sowing especially for wheat,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said."

Even at the Mantralaya  from where Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's administration has been trying to implement Modi's dream in Maharashtra  you need cash for light refreshments.While state officials say all departments will eventually offer the e-payment option, there is no common deadline or even an urgency to make the switch.Mirror correspondents Makarand Gadgil, Yogesh Naik, Lata Mishra and Iram Siddique visited the Government Book Depot and Publishing House at Charni Road, the state's administrative headquarters, the Wadala RTO, the Fort property registration office, SETU office , JJ and St George Hospitals and Mumbai Central Bus Depot for the test drive. They tried to avail different services and make purchases there through e-payments, but were asked to pay cash.At the 'DigiDhan Mela' in Delhi on Friday, Modi appealed to citizens to carry out five digital transactions from January 1 to help the country to move towards a cashless economy.

The area sown with coriander has nearly doubled from last year, going from 59,100 hectares (ha) in 2015 to past the 1 lakh hectares mark with 16 more days of sowing to go.Officials said that coriander has replaced the cumin crop in the Saurashtra region this year, mainly because of the lesser rainfall there. Cumin needs more water than coriander.""With less water available, farmers are shifting to coriander from cumin. Saurashtra has less water available this year because it received less rainfall this monsoon,"" said Mahesh Vadodaria , secretary of APMC Gondal, which is among the few market yards prominent for its coriander trade.Saurashtra's 138 dams have just 1,078.25 million cubic metres of water, which is about 42.50% of the 2,537.07 MCM capacity.However, this is still 86 MCM greater than last year. Officials pointed said of the one lakh hectares sown with coriander, around 90%  some 92,000 hectares was in the Saurashtra region.Chairman of APMC Unjha, Gaurang Patel , said that the quality of cumin seed produce will also suffer as this year, as winter has not set in properly. The cumin crop arrives in February and with December almost gone, the good winter needed for a quality crop is missing. Cumin has been sown on some 2.26 lakh ha against 1.9 lakh ha last year.The acreage sown with potato is also at an all-time high of over 1.1 lakh ha, compared 1.07 lakh ha last year, agriculture experts said. In 2015, potato was sown on 51,900 ha till December 13. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected. Gujarat currently ranks fifth in the country in potato production. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily."

The cool weather is not kind to those with joint and bone problems. Though doctors say little can be done to avoid the ill feeling, precautions can be taken to ease it. From keeping oneself warm to making sure one gets enough exercise, inflammation can be controlled if attention is paid.Consulting orthopedic surgeon Dr Rajesh Badiyani said people already suffering from arthritis or other orthopedic disease are more prone to morning stiffness.""For many people winter is welcoming, but for arthritic patients it can be a pain. The weather affects them differently i and it is different from person to person,"" a he said while suggesting that exercising, walking and moving about are the best way to ensure that joints don't stiffen. Dr Prashanth Agarwal , consulting orthopedic, Apollo Hospital , said, ""In some people, frigid temperatures may worsen inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and joint pain, affecting the hips, knees, elbows, shoulders and hands.""Researchers aren't sure why cold weather makes us so stiff and sore, but one the ory , based on a small study , is that inflamed joints swell as barometric pressure drops.The swelling irritates the nerves around the joints, causing pain. ""There is also less supply of blood to the peripheral regions of the body due to which one's joints become stiff, causing pain,"" he said.To keep bones less painful, doctors suggest exercises. Being a couch potato is bad for the joints. Exercises help lubricate them to prevent pain. Walking can reduce joint pain and stiffness, keeping people flexible. ""Exercises can boost a person's mental and physical state. Stretching and exercises with light weights are good, as they strengthen the knee muscles and improve flexibility ,"" added Dr Agarwal.Apart from starting your day basking in the sun, it is also important to include foods rich in vitamins in your diet.""Foods like spinach, cabbage, tomatoes and oranges are rich sources of vitamins and minerals.

But no sooner had the effect of heat and smoke on meat been discovered, than it altered the complete outlook towards victuals.Being a port city and the gateway to eastern India, Kolkata played an important part as a British-ruled state. Metiabruz was the place where Wajid Ali Shah , the last of the Mughal emperors, was placed under house arrest but was granted access to all his kingly pleasures, especially the indulgence in cuisine. It's the marrying of these two cultures that the barbecue started evolving in Kolkata.""Barbecues have always been considered status symbols, something which reminds of outdoor locales, large open spaces,"" says Vijay Malhotra, ITC Sonar executive chef. ""The baganbaris or farm houses of Kolkata's affluent class offered a perfect setting for barbecue; a slice of British aristocracy got imbibed into the social Indian thread.""Winters are perfect for barbecue. The chill makes the fingers go cold but the mere touch of hot food brings warmth, both physical and psychological. Barbecues are best had immediately off the fire, when it is smoking fresh. So, what makes a great barbecue? First, the freshness of the meat and ingredients; second, the quality of heat; and third, the marinade. While the first is pretty obvious, chefs recommend use of wood charcoal and not coke to stoke the fire and also smoke the meat while it's cooking.""Traditional barbecuing requires indirect, consistent low heat and longer cooking times.Having a well-made cooker, grill, or smoker that uses charcoal or wood as the heat source is essenP tial. When it comes to lighting a fire, once can use paraffin wax cubes, a chimney or a charcoal starter torch. To keep things as natural as possible, don't use lighter fluid,"" says Lalit Great Eastern executive chef Madhumita Mahanta.There are various types of ovens available in the market but the popular ones are barrel and drum, offset, and bullet-style smokers. One has to be careful with the cheaper models because if they aren't airtight, unwanted oxygen airflow can cause undesirable temperature spikes.While cooking over the fire is fun, it is the behind-the-scene marinating that is key to a well-made barbecue. Chefs advice marinating at least six hours before the barbecue for meats, and a couple of hours for fish and shrimp. One also has to ensure an acidic medium -such as natural vinegar or lemon juice -in the marinade to break down the proteins and fat for faster cooking.Since ovens don't have a thermostat to control the heat, barbecuing requires care. From the initial searing of the meat at medi um heat to subsequently regulating the cooking process to cook it to the core is the trick to a good barbecue, say chefs. ""One can do a barbecue with different varieties of meat or fish, but it is best not to try them together be cause fish gets cooked quicker than chicken which, in turn, cooks faster than red meat,"" says Route 17 The Stake house chef Sanjay Sarkar.There is another essential ingredient to a great barbecue, and that is a good gathering. A barbecue is a super idea for a party or picnic as it can be cooked outdoors on a rack-over, on open fire or on a special appliance.So, what are you waiting for? The weather's per fect, so crank up the heat and get the meats roasting.Barbecue tipsBarbecues are best done outdoors, though nowadays there are a number of LPG-operated barbecue stations for indoor cooking. But you won't get the same taste and flavour in those barbecues because of the absence of smokeFor outdoors, never set up the barbecue under a canopy or tent. Always ensure that the wind never blows into the barbecue and the person doing the cooking does not face the wind because ash and charcoal splinters will then fly into his face, making it difficult to stand and cook. Wind from any other direction is goodBarbecue essentialsCharcoal grill, wire mesh or racks, skewers and tongs If the meat is being skewered, skewers should be square, rather than round.This will assist in rotating the skewers for even cooking on all sidesIf the cuts of meat are flat, a metal mesh should be used and the diameter of the mesh rods should be at least 6mm. This will ensure good grill marks on the food being cooked and also act as a good medium for transmitting even heat to the meatsAccompanimentsThe typical accompaniments will be a nice jus which can also be used to baste the meat a bit, to impart flavour and keep it moist. A jacket potato with sour cream will go well any day, though mashed potatoes go equally well. Corn on the cob finished on the grill works wonders as an accompaniment. A thick-cut slice of crust bread, buttered and grilled on the barbecue, will mop up the accompanying sauce."

The CM, however, kept mum on the exact number of new districts.While presenting the report card of his government before the party's election committee on Monday, Rawat said, ""We have created new tehsils and blocks across the state in the past two years. Our next step is to focus on formation of new districts.""Rawat added that the creation of new districts was not a ""political experiment"" but was aimed at better governance.""Our government has not created any block or tehsil in a haphazard manner. The new districts will also be carved systematically. All formalities in this regard will hopefully be completed in the beginning of 2017,"" said the CM.Calling the formation of new districts a ""major commitment"" of Congress, Rawat said that the move was delayed as the state plunged into a political turmoil that lasted for months.Rawat was referring to the imposition of central rule in the state after nine former Congress MLAs rebelled against the government on March 18 when the appopriation bill was being passed in the assembly.The CM did not mention how many districts would be formed in the hill state, which currently has 13 districts. The number of districts that would fall under Kumaon division or Garhwal division is also not known.The previous BJP government in the state had recommended formation of four districts - Yamunotri, Kotdwar, Ranikhet and Didihat.The creation of new districts has been a political hot potato with administrators saying that the small state can ill afford to go for creation of more administrative units as it would be a burden on the state's exchequer.Political experts in the state, however, said that creation of new districts will result in better administration at local level which may win brownie points for Rawat in the assembly elections. ""More districts will allow for better governance for local residents. This may help Rawat and Congress win votes,"" said a political analyst on condition of anonymity."

These are A-grade big potatoes that he usually sells at Rs 11 per kg. Had you been five days early, he said, you would have got cauliflower and brinjals too - for free.So what's the catch? Sadly for Prasad, the offer is as unconditional as it is tragic.Like many other farmers here, in the potato belt of Uttar Pradesh that starts near Mathura, about 150 km from Delhi, Prasad has little choice. He can either abandon his crop at cold storages or plough it into the ground as cash appears to have vanished from the market ever since the government on November 8 announced withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as legal tender, rendering invalid 86% of India's currency.A rich crop of potatoes is dumped along the roadside and sacks of potatoes abandoned outside cold storages in the potato belt as farmers are not finding buyers in the mandis.Even if there are some buyers, the rates have crashed, making it uneconomical for the farmers to pay transportation costs and take potatoes to the mandis.Kunwar Raghavendra Singh, former zila panchayat member in Raya, said the farmer is getting a rate of Re 1 per kg.Every year, farmers sow potatoes between October 20 and 30. When the new crop is ready around January end, they sell roughly 20% of the produce in February and the rest is sent to cold storages to be released slowly when the rates get higher.The rates average around Rs 600-800 per katta (a bag of 52 kg). The farmer pays Rs 100 to the cold storage owner for storing his crop. So he gets Rs 11-15 per kg. Prasad, a resident of Sesu Nangla village in Raya, had kept 132 bags in Mansarovar cold storage on Mathura-Aligarh road. ""I am getting no rate right now. For my potatoes I was getting Rs 8 per kg before 'notebandi'.But now it is useless. I have to pay Rs 105 per bag to the cold storage person and then add to it transportation costs. What I would get is just Re 1 per kg in a mandi,"" he said.So Prasad is now selling potatoes to gowshalas. He is getting a measly Rs 50 per bag of 52 kg. ""Rest I will distribute for free in the village,"" he said.Just like Prasad, Nekram of Nagla Amrua village had kept 515 bags of potatoes in Brijwasi cold storage at Raya on Mathura-Aligarh road. He hasn't gone back to claim them. ""I would have to pay the cold storage person for something I cannot sell.What is the point?"" he said. The potato belt supplies to big markets in Jaipur, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Kanpur and Lucknow. With the markets running out of cash, the potatoes are useless.In Sadabad on Mathura-Aligarh road, cold storages have been saddled with thousands of unclaimed potato bags. Pradeep Kumar Singh, owner of Om Sheetgrah , said, ""I have about 5,000 potato bags lying unclaimed. These are farmers who owe me money from before. But what do I do? Everybody is in distress.""The cold storages are shut down mid-November for annual maintenance. Singh ran his facility for an extra month so that he could help the farmers already in distress due to demonetisation But now he has had to dump all the bags outside the cold storage. ""We have dug up a huge pit on the cold storage grounds to dump the produce,"" he said.Just a few kilometres from Singh's cold storage in Khandauli block, farmers have been ploughing their produce in the ground. ""What do we do? We carry these potatoes and vegetables to the market to find no buyers.Even transporting and loading them needs labourers. It is additional cost. We use what we can,"" said Moni Singh of Kharwa village. His neighbour let his cattle out to graze on the dumped vegetables and then ploughed the remaining into the field. ""What else? They are useless,"" he said.Prominent farmer leader and Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti national president Pushpendra Chaudhary said, ""The potato farmers have been ruined for the next two years. The markets would not recover even for the sale of rabi crop. The Modi government should at least write off loans of farmers."""

These five firms have combined sales of nearly Rs 3,700 crore, that is higher than Nestle's Maggi , and a few of these firms are larger than Kellogg 's in India.What about the multinationals?GSK Consumer posted negative sales growth in 2015-16 while Pepsi-Co's food division and Mondelez both grew 4%. Experts and company insiders attributed local players' growth to lower price points, increased distribution and conversion from unorganised market.""We have kept our overhead costs low so that our products remain affordable,"" said Chandu Virani, promoter of Balaji Wafers that posted a 14% sales growth last fiscal at Rs 1,440 crore. ""Also, bringing healthier variants and expanding in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh helped,"" he said.On an average, regional snack brands offer 30% higher volume than multinational rivals at similar price points, especially in highest selling price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10.According to market researcher Euromonitor, sweet and savoury snacks have grown by 26%, highest within packaged food segment between 2010 and 2015. About four years ago, packaged namkeen had replaced western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks as the largest segment within branded salty snacks market.""Domestic manufacturers are increasing their distribution and penetration into rural India and have launched smaller packs at lower price points,"" Euromonitor said in a recent report.The research firm expects the salty snacks segment to surpass biscuits with sales of nearly Rs 35,801 crore by 2020, up from Rs 19,151 crore in 2015.Funding from private equity funds helped domestic snacking firms to expand their reach and market their products more aggressively, experts said.""There has been an impetus on brand building and geographical expansion by these regional firms. Their variants launches have been faster compared to large food companies,"" said Devendra Chawla, president, food & FMCG, at the country's leading retailer Future Group.Prataap Snacks, maker of Yellow Diamond chips, was backed by Sequoia and has filed papers for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise Rs 400 crore.The company, which clocked 35% growth in sales last year at.`758 crore, recently roped in actor Salman Khan to promote its brand. Nearly two years ago, private equity fund Lighthouse Funds had invested Rs 125 crore in Bikaji Foods while WestBridge Capital Partners picked up a 25% stake in DFM Foods that sellssnack foods under the brand Crax.It may be difficult for these domestic players to maintain their growth momentum though as larger rivals are entering their turf with similar pricing and products. Parle Products, ITC and PepsiCo have all launched similar range as smaller regional players in the past few years.""No doubt, regional brands offer better value for money. But as we enter their region and expand our portfolio, their growth rate might taper off,"" said B Krishna Rao, deputy marketing manager at Parle Products."

Potato acreage has taken a hit with funds locked up in state cooperative banks. These are some of the features in rural Bengal that is yet to recover from notebandi. Farmers across the state are all ears for another set of announcements from the PM on December 31, if that hastens a change in the 50-day nightmare.The cash-backed informal trade system has been hard hit in the process.

However, local farmers who brought potato left home empty handed, since there were no buyers.Local buyers, who supply onions and potatoes to hotels and retail stores in the district, were seen purchasing the stock that left over from Saturday, only on the condition of getting Rs 100 and the new Rs 2,000 in exchange.A truck driver from Davanagere, Noorullah said, ""The commission agent has paid me using the demonetized notes, with which I can only refuel my lorry. But, I will have to use my money at hotels and mills.""Balappa Hulaji, a farmer from Mannikeri village, who had brought potatoes to the market said that he couldn't store the onions for long since they did not have cold storage. ""If it is not brought to the market, they will undergo decay. I will get my payment later, but I can at least sell my potatoes here,"" he said.President of the traders' association, Manohar Mungari said, ""The Market may resume from the next week, once the new currency notes are in circulation.""Secretary, APMC, BM Shrinivas said that there were no transactions at the market on Wednesday, since the agents' association called off the auction."

The transporters have refused to carry potatoes any more as the unpaid fuel bills are mounting.With fuel stations refusing any more credit to transporters, there is a chain reaction hitting transportation of potatoes.The retail price of the tuber declined on Saturday following the severe liquidity crunch. But it happened as the retailers sacrificed their margin of profit to facilitate faster offtake of the stockpile. ""But this dip at retail level will be temporary as both the wholesale and retail prices will rise, thanks to shortage of supply,"" Swapan Samanta, secretary West Bengal Potato Traders Association , told TOI.Price of potato (Jyoti variety) at the retail end dipped to Rs 18 from Rs 20-Rs 22 in some markets on Saturday. This was offered by retailers to encourage customers to buy more. However, the crisis will be felt in the retail markets soon because of the shortage in supply . The wholesale price of Jyoti and Chandramukhi was Rs 12 and Rs 22 respectively in Hooghly, the largest producer of potato in Bengal.According to Patit Paban De, member, West Bengal Cold Storage Association , 462 potato cold storages across Bengal still has stockpile of 13 lakh tonnes. Out of this, only 3 lakh tonnes will be used as seeds. The rest should have been out in the market. But sudden liquidity crunch has disrupted the system. Small farmers are not taking out potatoes they had hoarded in cold storages. Traders, particularly, transporters are feeling the heat.In Hooghly district alone, there are 161 potato cold storages which still have a sizeable stockpile. November 30 is the deadline for complete stock clearance. The new crop will be coming shortly. Potato prices have shot up since May as the production had dropped in Bengal, the second largest producer of the tuber.Traders and companies, however, expect the downward trend in the agriculture market to continue in the short term as the harvest season is on and the country is looking at a record khariff crop. ""The smallest player in the entire system, the farmer, is panicking. We expect prices to go down further in the short term,"" said agriculture economist Sarit Basu."

The failure of potato mission launched with much fun fare is a pointer to governments failure in the agriculture sector, he added.Last year, by the government's own calculation that only 18% land received water, forcing more than 70% agricultural land to depend on rain.""Why does the government shy away from discussing this?"" he asked."

Price of fish is also down by Rs 50-70 a kg. But it has not elicited a smile yet from customers struggling with cash. At Lansdowne market, Jadu Babur Bazar and Lake Market in south Kolkata, onion price has nosedived from Rs 25 a kg prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's demonetization announcement on Tuesday to Rs 18 a kg on Saturday. A similar situation was witnessed at Maniktala market in the northern part of the city.""People are just not buying unless absolutely necessary. One generally says that Bengalis will never compromise on food but I suspect less fish and meat dishes are being made now. So the demand for onion has dropped. Though supply in wholesale market has dipped because of the liquidity crunch across the country, there is still a glut due to lack of demand,"" said Asit Das, a vegetable vendor at Lansdowne Market.With dues piling up and pressure to clear the stock mounting, vendors are reducing prices. Everyone associated with onion, right from the farm in Nasik to here, is desperate to kick-start sales. ""At any other time, a drop in supply would have led to price rise. But it's just the opposite,"" said Mahadeb Mondal of Lake Market. ""While commodity prices dip normally when there is a liquidity crunch, the trend has so far been missing in Kolkata. But this time we see that happening,"" said Shankar Gupta, a vegetable trader in Kolkata.Price of tomato that comes from farms near Bengaluru is also headed southward, having dropped by Rs 2 in two days and is now retailing at Rs 18 a kg. ""The suppliers are not accepting payment in the demonetized currency notes and have agreed to take the payment later. They have slashed the price so that we accept the stock in this adverse situation,"" said Das.Price of Jyoti variety of potato that commanded Rs 20 per kg till Thursday was selling for Rs 18 on Saturday.Lower consumption has also brought down fish prices at city markets by at least Rs 50 per kg across varieties."

And now, Chennai is poised to get its own such creative retreat. One that will be run completely by women burn survivors.""I wanted to start a cafe where writers, journalists and students can relax over a cup of coffee, read or pen something,"" says restaurateur M Mahadevan of his latest venture. So, Writers Cafe in Gopalapuram will just not have cosy furniture to lounge on but also shelves stacked with books and stationery by Higginbothams, which will also provide e-books on tablets, as well as a room where you can have meetings or get-togethers. Customers can browse through or buy books and are welcome to bring along their tablets or laptops.For the women who run the cafe, it is an opportunity to earn a living. G Parimala, 35, doused herself with kerosene in 2012 after a fight with her alcoholic husband. Suffering 25% burns, she had to undergo numerous surgeries. ""I tried to get a job as an assistant or data entry operator but people see my scars and reject me,"" she says. ""During training I was paid `8,000 and am happy I can work and support my daughter.""M Punithavalli, 29, who suffered burns after a kerosene stove burst in 2015, has a similar story . A former saleswoman, she found it difficult to get back to work. ""My relatives too treated me differently but now I am confident, and my husband is encouraging,"" she says.All the 10 women are part of The International Foundation for Crime Pre vention and Victim Care's (PCVC) Vidiyal project. ""It is a project for burn survivors of domestic violence, which was initiated at the burns ward of Kilpauk Medical College,"" says Prasanna Gettu, founder, PCVC.The organisation provides the women with physical and psychological support. Once they are healed, the women are brought to the centre in Anna Nagar where they go through physiotherapy and psycho-social therapy . ""We address the physical wounds and emotional scars inside them,"" says Gettu, adding that they also try to give the women vision and direction.The women have been training for six months at Winners Bakery. And now Swiss chef Silke Stadler has flown down to train them. The USP of the cafe, which has a confectionery and bakery, will be the Swiss fare. ""We will have dishes like rosti (crispy potato pancake) and flammkuchen (Alsace pizza),"" says chef Karan Manavalan. This is a part of Mahadevan's corporate social responsibility initiative -proceeds from the cafe will go towards Chennai Mission, his charitable organisation.The aim is to reintegrate these women with mainstream society. ""The message is -ditch your sympathy, we need your support,"" says Mahadevan."
