Farmers said they have no money to transport the crop to mandis in other places or to keep their produce in cold storage. Since potato is perishable, the best option they had was to distribute it free, they said. They added that they had no money to buy fertilisers and other farm inputs because of cash crunch.BKU district president Sardar Gurmeet Singh said farmers dumped their produce outside the Vidhan Bhawan in the hope that the state government would take note of their plight and address their problem.Since reports of free potato distribution had been published in newspapers on Friday, people came with polybags and handbags to collect the vegetable. However, it also resulted in chaos as large quantity of potatoes was crushed by passing vehicles.People who collected potatoes said the government must provide cash to farmers so that their agriculture produce is not hit. ""I got plenty of potatoes but I am sad because farmers are facing problems due to lack of fertilisers and seeds,"" said Ambhuj Kumar.""We were without food for last two days as we had no cash. So when farmers distributed potatoes we collected as much as we could,"" said Radharani, a street dweller."

However, orange exporters are now being affected by the demonetisation of high-denomination Indian currency notes.Bhutanese orange exporters rue that because of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in India, they are being charged high rates for boxes to pack their oranges in. Transporters are also demanding extra charges if paid in Ngultrum, currency of Bhutan.Orange exporters from Paro have been sending the fruit to India for the past decade. The yield and quality of the oranges this year are high but the demonetisation is affecting the business.A Bhutanese exporter, who wished not to be named, said the exporters have to pay ""miscellaneous"" and ""other unofficial bills"" in Indian currency. As an interim measure, the exporters have arranged with the transporters to pay in Ngultrum (Nu) with the assurance that they will be paid in INR once it is available.Exporters from Bhutan's Gelephu orange depot have been paying Nu 19,000 per truck to transport oranges till the Bangladesh border. But this year transporters are demanding more than Nu 20,000 per truck. The big oranges (meel) are fetching Nu 820 per box and the small oranges (keel) Nu 630 per box.Export of oranges started in November and lasts till February next year. Bhutanese officials point out that if Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA) were in place, Bhutanese trucks would be transporting oranges all the way to Bangladesh and orange exporters would not be paying Indian truckers inflated prices.Besides paying Indian truckers, orange exporters also need Indian currency to pay their labour and for boxes imported from India. Another fallout of the demonetisation process was the record low prices offered to potato farmers this year in Bhutan.India is and will always remain Bhutan's most important and easily accessible market but during emergencies, contingencies have to be in place to go directly to other markets beyond the neighbouring states, and perhaps even other countries like Bangladesh or Nepal, indicated officials in Thimpu."

I never expected it +HAVANA: The son of a wealthy landowner,that endured for decades and was shaped by his political cunning, keen sense of destiny and boundless ego., was at once idealistic and pragmatic, sharply intelligent and reckless, charismatic and intolerant.Critics saw in him a stubborn bully who violated human rights, jailed his critics, banned opposition parties and wrecked Cuba's economy.Admirers saw a visionary who stood up to US domination of Latin America, brought healthcare and education to the poor, and inspired socialist movements across the world.Even before leading the 1959 revolution that propelled Cuba toward communism and onto the Cold War stage, Castro saw greatness in himself.From an early age, he admired history's boldest figures, particularly Alexander the Great, and believed he and his rebels were part of that tradition.""Men do not shape destiny. Destiny produces the man for the moment,"" he said in 1959.Castro toppled the unpopular US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista by uniting a disparate opposition and outsmarting a bigger, better-equipped Cuban military.His alliance with the Soviet Union put him at the center of the Cold War, most notably when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took the world to the brink of nuclear war.He was a global celebrity, his beard, military fatigues and big Cuban cigars making him instantly recognizable.(Castro exhales cigar smoke during an interview.)He owed his prominence in part to geography. Looking to bolster an ally just 90 miles (140 km) from Florida, Moscow helped him build socialism by giving him billions of dollars worth of aid and favorable trade, from oil to tractor parts.But Castro also mined Cuban nationalism and Latin American pride, stirring resentment of US power and influence.He managed to preserve his revolution despite constant US hostility even when Cuba reeled from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, showing the vigor of a man who intended to die in office.Instead, almost killed by a serious intestinal illness, he was forced to step aside in 2006 and he formally handed over to his younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2008.In his final years, Castro wrote opinion columns for Cuba's state media but was rarely seen. His famously long speeches gave way to silence, at least in public, and comfortable track suits replaced the stiff black boots and crisp military attire.On December 17, 2014, Raul Castro cut a deal to restore diplomatic ties with the United States. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro offered only lukewarm support, raising questions about whether he approved of ending hostilities with his longtime enemy.Known by the militaristic title of ""El Comandante,"" in some ways Castro was always replaying the exhilaration of revolt, exhorting Cubans to fight one battle after another, from confronting US hostility to boosting potato production.He survived numerous assassination attempts and outlasted nine US presidents in power, seizing control of Cuba while Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House and stepping down during George W. Bush's second term.Throughout, Castro lectured Cubans.A magnificent orator who instinctively altered his cadence to fit the moment, he re-trod history and delved deep into detail about Cuban independence heroes, plans to ""perfect"" the revolution and the declared evils of US imperialism.Tall and physically commanding, fastidious in his attire, he often built to a crescendo of indignation, gesturing firmly with long-fingered, well-manicured hands.""We shall endeavor to be brief,"" he told the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, then set a record for U.N. speeches by talking for nearly 4-1/2 hours.Castro never allowed statues of him to be erected or streets to be named after him, saying he did not want a cult of personality. Nevertheless, the cult was everywhere. His image and words were posted on billboards and his name was invoked at every public event.Most Cubans, whether for or against him, refer to him simply as ""Fidel.""He was a night owl. He would keep foreign guests waiting until late at night and then summon them for talks. Even his critics would sometimes find themselves oddly charmed by such encounters.Tad Szulc, a biographer, called him ""Cuba's great master of political seduction.""(Fidel Castro, center, and his soldiers make a roadside appearance as they move toward Havana, in 1959)Born on August 13, 1926, Castro grew up as a privileged son on his father's plantation in the eastern village of Biran, where his playmates were children of impoverished workers living in thatched huts with dirt floors. He said the economic injustice he witnessed there inspired a life-long sympathy for the poor.He attended the Jesuit-run Belen School in the capital and then studied law at the University of Havana, plunging into the violent politics of the time and starting his drift leftward.Long-winded, intolerant and - unusually for a Cuban - awkward on the dance floor, he was not embraced by his fellow students at first but eventually emerged as a leader.He took part in an aborted 1947 plan to overthrow Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and was at a youth conference in Colombia when riots broke out and some 2,000 people died.After law school, he decided to run for Congress in 1952. When Batista staged a coup and halted the elections, Castro began plotting armed rebellion.In 1953, he led a raid on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. Dozens of followers died and he, Raul Castro and others were captured and imprisoned.""History will absolve me,"" he declared at his trial.Pardoned in 1955, he went into exile in Mexico where he met Argentine revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara . Together with Raul, they trained a rebel band that in 1956 returned to Cuba aboard an overcrowded yacht called Granma.(Fidel Castro (L) talking with Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.)Ambushed at landing by government troops, only 12 of the 82 rebels on board made it to the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains.Castro denied Batista's claims that he was a communist but decades later he told Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in a book ""100 hours with Fidel"" that by 1952, ""I was already a convinced Marxist-Leninist.""Whatever the evolution of his views on communism, he was determined to throw off American influence in Cuba. When US-supplied aircraft bombed his rebels in 1958, he vowed revenge.""I have sworn that the Americans will pay very dearly for what they are doing,"" he said in a letter to close friend and aide Celia Sanchez. ""When this war has ended, a much bigger and greater war will start for me, a war I shall launch against them. I realize that this will be my true destiny.""(Fidel Castro with Richard Nixon)Washington viewed him as a potential enemy even before his rebel army forced Batista to flee Cuba on New Year's Day, 1959.It took just two years for the relationship to unravel as Castro nationalized swathes of the economy and introduced a broad agrarian reform. Thousands escaped the island, starting what became a bitter bulwark of opposition in Florida.In April 1961, when his military crushed a CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, he declared Cuba socialist and allied himself with the Soviet Union.Moscow put nuclear missiles on the island in 1962, touching off a 13-day superpower showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis.In an Oct. 26 cable to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Castro seemed convinced the Americans would invade Cuba and suggested the Soviets ""eliminate this danger"" with an act of ""legitimate self defense.""Khrushchev felt Castro was advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike and rejected it, telling him he was satisfied with US President John F. Kennedy's pledge not to invade.The Soviets withdrew the missiles and Washington secretly agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, ending the crisis.The United States imposed its trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 and the CIA admitted trying to kill Castro in the early years of his rule.Plots or plot ideas included trying to get Castro to smoke a poisoned cigar and taking advantage of his love of diving with an exploding seashell, or poisoning a diving suit.Castro reveled in his status as an elusive target., not least having a neighbor - the greatest power in the world - trying to kill me every day,"" he said at a 2006 summit in Argentina, where crowds greeted him like a rock star.While the embargo was economically devastating, it allowed Castro to shift blame for chronic economic problems away from the system he built and onto the United States.He cast the fight as a David and Goliath story.Philip Bonsal, US ambassador to Cuba in 1959, later described Castro as a ""phenomenally gifted, erratic and unscrupulous autocrat who 'freed his country from American imperialism' only to reduce it to a satellite of Moscow.""In a country that was prosperous by Latin American standards but riven by inequality and illiteracy and with an unsavory reputation as a brothel and gambling-rich playground for Americans, Castro sought to build a socialist society.His government trained thousands of doctors and provided free schooling, changes that have endured well into the 21st century, even as the state's role in the economy was reduced in recent years.Those gains came at considerable cost to personal freedoms. Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the state's long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibia's independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.After the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castro's communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the ""special period"" for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cuba's economy.Little was known about Castro's personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leader's only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a ""caudillo,"" or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term. ""I am a kind of spiritual leader,"" he said."

He sold them for Rs 12 per kg. A week later, it was a dramatically different situation. The price had crashed to Rs 4 per kg. ""Nobody's picking up the stuff in the mandi now. Nuksan ho raha hai (I am suffering losses). The mandi guys are telling me that with shortage of currency, there's little demand at the retail level,"" he says.Another farmer, Virendra Dahiya, said, he had wholesaled the same vegetable for Rs 15 per kg at the mandi before the stunning currency measure announced on Nov 8 and has now been trading them for Rs 9-10 per kg.Those standing in the long queues before a PNB branch complain that cash comes and vanishes with the speed of a rumour.Currency shortage seems to have caused a ripple effect down the supply chain. And the consequence can be seen at the bottom of the pyramid.Ajaypal, who mainly grows vegetables over 16 bighas of land owned jointly by four brothers, is making adjustments to beat the blowback of notebandi, the term everyone uses to describe demonetization in these parts of rurban south-west Delhi.Another batch of cauliflowers would have been ready for the market in a couple of days. But the 46-year-old Jat farmer has stopped watering the plants. ""That would delay their growth. I want to hold on for a fortnight. Maybe we will get a better price after that,"" he says.A similar tactic to beat the falling rates has been employed by Jagbir Singh, a Jat farmer with 15 bighas of land in Asra, a village located in west UP's Hapur district. ""I will not harvest potato for 8-10 days. Let them stay where they are till the mandi rates improve,"" he told TOI last week.Once he has disposed of the cauliflowers and the radish, Ajaypal will sow tomatoes and peas. Like many in these parts with a cash flow problem, he is relying on the bond of traditional association that gets him seeds and fertilisers on loan. ""That's part of our dealings every year,"" he says. Dahiya says credit is part of every transaction in this urban village poised on the edge of south-west Delhi. ""Yahan to kirayedaar ka bhi udhaar chalta hai (Even the tenants pay you later,"") he says.Part of Ajaypal's land is fallow at the moment. He has just harvested jowar and now is ready to sow wheat. He's behind schedule by about 10-15 days. ""I will plant a late variety of wheat to compensate,"" the farmer says.Normally, at this time about 20 people would have been working in the field, says the farmer. But the delay means there are only two farmhands at work on Thursday after noon.Ajaypal pays them Rs 250 for a day's work. But he is unable to pay them in cash right now. Overall, he owes about Rs 4,000 to his other regulars who are now working elsewhere, he says. How much do the shortage of money and the losses bother him? His feelings are mixed. ""No 2 ke paise ko lagaam lag rahi hai (Black money is being brought under control),"" he says.Life is more difficult for Sharmila Devi, one of two daily wagers still working in Ajaypal's field. These days she carries vegetables home as part of her payment. Call it a form of barter or good old jugaad, adjustments like these keep the wheels turning for the marginal and the marginalized in times of the scarce rupee."

Apart from potato, the sowing of Isabgul Fennel and coriander has also been on the higher side as compared to the normal sowing area.Interestingly, cumin seed farming in Gujarat which was the most sought after crop during winter sowing, has been on the lower side. The sowing of cumin was less as compared to last year sowing. This year sowing of cumin was completed in 2.67 lakh hectare against the sowing of 2.68 lakh hectare. Sowing of cumin in Gujarat takes place in 3.39 lakh hectare area.Sowing of potato is at an all-time high with 1.23 lakh hectares sown, compared to 1.07 lakh hectares last year, agriculture experts said. In 2015, potato was sown on 93,400 hectares. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.The data indicates that sowing of winter crop his year was at 84 per cent of area normally sown with the crop, 33.08 lakh hectares. The figures show that 27.87 lakh hectares have been sown against 24.72 lakh hectares last year. North Gujarat has seen the most sowing in the state with 10.42 lakh hectares sown. Officials said about 7.41 lakh hectares were sown in central Gujarat.However, sowing which is at a high in the Saurashtra region, this year sowing in Saurashtra has not picked up due to lack of water in dams. The sowing in Saurashtra region was only in an area of 6.71 lakh hectare.Sowing of coriander and fennel has increased this year over past years. An agriculture official pointed out that Surendranagar had highest area sown with cumin. Sowing of fennel, isabgul, coriander, potato and maize have crossed 100% of the area normally sown with these crops in the state."

At the farm level, however, there is a crisis of capital that continues to bother tuber growers even after the Centre's assurance of giving fresh loans to farmers for the sowing and harvesting season. Potato may pinch pockets in the coming season as there has been a drop in its acreage.Tarakeswar Aloo Byabsayee Samity secretary Swapan yee Samity secretary Swapan Samanta put it straight. ""I have come to know that 359 Krishi Samabay Samitis in the Hooghly district will get Rs 50,000 each. If this works out, the total amount adds up to around Rs 2 crore. The outgo as loans during the last season was Rs 212 crore. The KSUs can't disburse the paltry loan amount on their own.They have to give names and address of the farmers and send the list to the central cooperative bank in the district.The bank won't sanction lo ans to those who have taken loans earlier,"" Samanta said.A back-of-the-envelope calculation gives a feel of the calculation gives a feel of the ground reality . ""Potato cultivation for a bigha costs a farmer an average Rs 20,000. I have five bighas and I need Rs 1 lakh for the farming. But the KSU has a total kitty of Rs 50,000. It can meet only a small fraction of the demand.Farmers can't wait. Some have bought seeds and the minimum fertiliser on credit making a payment assurance of Rs 50-100 more after the yield.Some have left parts of their land empty .

The shortage could be compounded by the fact that agricultural Rabi season is set to begin and farmers will require cash credit of over Rs 1,000 crore latest by December 8. Apprehensive of the possibility of currency shortage looming large, the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) has already sent out an SOS to RBI, asking the central body to infuse adequate cash by the end of the next week. The chief general manager of SBI, Partha Pratim Sengupta, confirmed cash withdrawal rate usually shot up in the first week of every month. ""Pensioners gets money in the first week. After the pension gets credited to their accounts, they prefer to withdraw most of it in cash. We hope money supply would go up next week, only then would the situation be under control,"" he said. The RBI, in its latest circular on November 24, advised banks to take appropriate steps to meet likely demands for cash by pensioners. The banking circles feel additional Rs 500 notes, adding up to Rs 450 croreRs 500 crore, would be required to care to customers in the next one week.A top SLBC official agreed that the liquidity situation had certainly improved after the second tranche of the new Rs 500 notes reached RBI but pointed out that the real test would be in the first week of December.""Sowing of Rabi crop has not started yet and farmers will have to start sowing potato by December 10. There is an urgent need of Rs 1,500 crore agro credit in the state, most of which has to be disbursed in cash,"" the official said. He added that SLBC had already briefed the RBI and the central observer about the scene. ""We are in discussion with the RBI. The central bank is also trying to organise more cash,"" he said.The president of All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), Rajen Nagar , also feared that trouble at banks, already grappling with low cash, could escalate at the beginning of the next month. "" Apart from pensioners, both state and Centre will divert a lot of cash to rural economy . There could be shortage of currency in the city,"" he said. Even Bandhan Bank MD and CEO C S Ghosh seemed concerned about the first week of December though he said the scene had drastically improved since last two weeks.An SBI official pointed out that withdrawal had started going up and another official indicated that the it could be 20%25% more in the first week of December.

""I always thought of vadapav as Amitabh Bachchan and wanted to show it to the rest of the country,"" said Iyer.Iyer was delivering a keynote address at Chitnavis Center, Civil Lines, on Wednesday, in an effort to encourage young entrepreneurs aspiring to get a foothold in mainstream markets during an idea-sharing seminar called i-Summit. The programme was jointly organized by Vidarbha Industries Association and Lemon Ideas.The fast food chain has now become a success story which started off as a few stores present only in urban Mumbai and Pune. Making vadapav a brand, as Iyer puts it, was the intent behind Goli and has now grown to over 300 stores spanning 100 cities across 22 states since 2004.The business model is largely outsourced with aspects pertaining to production and logistics contracted to international companies. Iyer pointed out that the company which manufactures burgers for McDonalds is the same that produces the vadas (deep fried potato cutlet) for Goli.According to Iyer, not only has the product been well received at places outside Maharashtra where vadapav is less common but also in areas where the food is unheard of. ""My business has grown through word of mouth. A customer who loved my food actually opened a franchise in his hometown at Aurangabad,"" said Iyer.Iyer believed that the public might get bored of eating the same deep fried batter coated potato cutlet and thought diversifying the food would make the vadapav more desirable. Iyer said, ""To make it more appealing to our customers we introduced variants like mixed-veg, schezwan, corn and cheese into the mix and it paid dividends."" His stores also offer other items like misal and rolls apart from the staple.Running a business on a scale as large as Iyer's does come with challenges, he said. Maintaining a consistent service quality in every outlet is something Goli is proud of, said Iyer. There is much effort being put in to perfect the service, according to Iyer.Similarly, there are many areas within the entire operation that the company is still working on, said Iyer. ""We are concentrating a lot on logistics and production as demand for our product is steadily increasing,"" he said.Iyer has also received a number of enquires from overseas about opening franchises outside India. However, Iyer said there is still time to consider exporting the brand as there in much work to be done here. ""I have people from Dubai and UK who are eager to take my franchise,"" he said.(Reporting by Mohnish Nelarwar)"

Data recently released showed that around 79% of the normal acreage of 33 lakh hectares has been sown this season.The figures show that 26 lakh hectares have been sown against 20.79 lakh hectares last year. North Gujarat has seen the most sowing in the state with 9.02 lakh hectares sown. Officials said about 5.44 lakh hectares were sown in central Gujarat.Officials said sowing was at a high in the Saurashtra region, but this year, because of the availability of Narmada water sowing in North Gujarat has picked up. Sowing in Saurashtra has not picked up due to lack of water in dams.The data indicates that sowing of cumin this year was at 76% of area normally sown with the crop, 3.39 lakh hectares. Sowing of coriander and fennel has increased this year over past years. An agriculture official pointed out that last year Surendranagar had highest area sown with cumin, but Banaskantha has overtaken it this year. Cumin was sown on 64,800 hectares in Banaskantha, while in Surendranagar it was in 55,400 hectares.The chairman of APMC Unjha, Gaurang Patel , said that the quality of cumin will suffer as the winter has not set in properly this year. The cumin crop arrives in February and with December almost gone, the cold weather needed for a quality crop has not been seen. Cumin has been sown on 2.26 lakh hectares against 1.9 lakh hectares last year.Sowing of potato is at an all-time high with 1.18 lakh hectares sown, compared to 1.07 lakh hectares last year, agriculture experts said. In 2015, potato was sown on 93,400 hectares till December 21. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected."

Fruit sales, especially those of apples, have gone down by 80%.The sale of vegetables has also taken a hit but not as severely as that of fruits. The retail price of vegetables like potatoes has gone down by about 50% though demand remains more or less constant. As a result, apart from farmers, migrant labourers are hard hit by the sudden turn of events. According to traders, 60% of migrant labourers have returned to their home states.Rajesh Yadav, CEO, Agriculture Produce Marketing Community (APMC), Sahibabad wholesale vegetable and fruit market, said that 1,156 quintals of fruits were sold between November 1 and 8 while between November 15 and 22 the figure nosedived to 390 quintals. ""The same is true in the case of oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava, which saw a dip of about 70% post-demonetisation,"" Yadav said.Rashid Qureshi, manager of MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, said that normally 100 to 125 trucks laden with fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava would come to the Sahibabad mandi but after demonetisation on average only 25 trucks are coming in. ""This being the wedding season our sales should have gone up but demonetisation has upset our applecart and many small traders would take several months to recover from the ongoing shock,"" Qureshi said.MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, one of the biggest wholesale dealers in fruits at the Sahibabad mandi, used to do business worth about Rs 50,000 per day during normal days but, after demonetisation, business has not exceeded beyond Rs 15,000 on any given day, according to Qureshi.As for vegetables, the overall prices have come down Vegetables like potato, onion, cabbage and tomato are still witnessing steady supply,"" Yadav said.""On Tuesday 2,586 quintals of potato found its way into the Sahibabad mandi and the average in the last week roughly comes to around 2,000 quintals a day though the retail price has come done drastically,"" Yadav said.According to Yadav, 1kg of potato before demonetisation came for about Rs 30 but after demonetisation it is now being sold at Rs 15/kg. ""Similarly, cabbage before demonetisation was sold at Rs 20 per kg which has now come down to Rs 4 /kg and tomato has come down to Rs 8/kg from Rs 18/kg,"" Yadav said.Explaining consumer behaviour in the backdrop of demonetisation, said, ""Since there is dearth of cash in the system because of demonetisation, consumers tend to spend only on essential items such as vegetables and they are saving on liquid cash by doing without fruits. I can see a bit of the 'Giffen paradox' in all this."""

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read | After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less.

Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat.

The new potato crop starts arriving in January in the mandis.Experts HT spoke to were of similar views. The fall in potato prices is more due to seasonal reasons. The production is expected to be more while the impact of demonetisation is limited, said agriculture expert Sachin Bondriya. The potato yield this year is expected to be about 250-300 quintal per acre, about 25% more than last year due to favourable conditions.Manohar Umrao Singh, a farmer who grows potatoes on the outskirts of Indore, said he was watching the prices closely. My crop will be ready in about a months time. However, old potatoes from cold storages have flooded the market and led to price crash.Madhya Pradesh has 210 cold storages, of which 65 are in Indore district.Farmers in Malwa region have been encouraged to grow more potatoes as they are increasingly finding a ready market in food-processing industries and export market in the Gulf. Potatoes grown in Malwa are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. While top-quality potatoes are exported, the remaining are sold in local markets.According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables, including potato and garlic, on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season, an increase of more than 30% over last year."

So was the consumption of salted snacks (like potato chips, namkeen), fried snacks (like samosa, pakora), nuts and dry fruits (like almonds, cashew).The change from traditional to modern diet means that we are now consuming more preserved food, salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and less of fruits, vegetables, milk and dietary fibres.

But now brace for a food crisis and inflation.With truck loads of fish, eggs, vegetables and fruits stuck on highways and at various interstate borders and farmers unable to harvest their crops because of severe cash crunch, experts apprehend that the citys markets could go dry in the next few days resulting in inflation and food crisis.Thousands of trucks all over the country carrying essential goods and perishables are facing huge cash shortage crisis. This issue will become even more serious over next few days and push essential prices up beyond control. Quick action needed, chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted on Monday.A severe cash crunch has hit the nation including West Bengal after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes on November 8.Read:People across India queue up outside banks, fear ATMs may run dryThis crisis has now hit the truck drivers who were bringing in everyday food items from other states including fish, eggs, vegetables and fruits. Faced with severe cash crunch drivers are unable to buy food, pay taxes, repair vehicles in case they develop snags and unable to load or unload the items. We are heading towards a major crisis if this situation lingers for another week, said Subhash Chandra Bose secretary of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association.Later in the evening, Mamata announced waiver of agriculture tax that are taken at sabji mandis to give relief to truck drivers. Bose however said that this is too negligible an amount and wont solve the crisis.Sources said that while a few hundred trucks loaded with fish and eggs are stuck at the Bengal  Odisha border, trucks bringing in fruits such as sweet lemons (mosambi), pomegranates, grapes and oranges from Maharashtra are stuck at Jamsola border. Similarly truck loads of potato are waiting at Jamsala border and those carrying various types of dal are waiting at Golapbag border.Read:Rahul Gandhi to counter Modis personality cult with issue-based politicsFarmers in various districts of Bengal who were harvesting their yields from the fields have also been hit. The wholesale markets in the districts and the Haats (weekly markets) have already started to run dry as farmers are unable to pay the labourers who harvest the crops from the farmlands.Several wholesale markets in the districts such as Madanpur and Gadamara in Nadia where farmers usually come to sell their harvest are gradually drying up. Farmers are unable to pay the labourers who harvest the crops because they have no cash. If these markets go dry the ripples would be felt in the city markets in the next few days, said Kamal Dey, member of the agriculture marketing force set up by Mamata."

But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."

We want to act as a pressure group for getting the concerns answered, Digmohan Negi, one of the founders of Uttarakhand Ekta Manch Delhi, told HT over phone from Delhi.He said the states languages Garhwali and Kumaoni are still considered dialects and demanded their inclusion in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.Gairsain (which is almost equidistant from Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the state) is yet to be made the states capital, Negi rued.Read: Why Gairsain capital issue a political hot potato in election-bound UttarakhandUttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat addressed the gathering over phone and assured action on the demands.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia assured assistance for celebration of hill festival Uttaraini-Makraini at 40 places and setting up of an Uttarakhand Akademi in the national capital, where thousands of Uttarakhandis are residing.Noted Uttarakhandi singer Narendra Singh Negi recited a song specially written for the gathering through which he exhorted locals to join hands for the cause of the hills.

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November. The supply dipped to an average of 93 quintals per day from November 9 to November 22. The supply of oranges also dipped from an average of 453 quintals per day to an average of 306 quintals per day, after November 8.However, the supply of guava has remained constant, at 220 quintals per day, from November 1 to November 22."

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

For weeks, if not months, those about to be married as well as their families were looking forward to this date with anticipation.However, the Centres decision to demonetise Rs 500 and 1,000 currency notes has rather soured their eagerness.My daughter is getting married on November 12. Who knew anything like this would happen overnight, without any preparation? People like us are in deep trouble for the moment. We withdrew money in bulk for shopping but most of the notes are of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 and no vendor or shopkeeper is ready to accept these notes, Manishankar Prasad, a government employee, said.I even thought about postponing the wedding. But that would have been another grave issue as the venues and other bookings have already been done. So the wedding is still on but the charm has gone, his daughter, Pallavi said.The Centres move has also affected venues and caterers.We can allow people to book the venue up to one year in advance, but cannot decorate it so far ahead. And now, basic things like flowers, bulbs, crackers and batteries are hard to buy as we are short of Rs 100 notes and vendors are not taking any other currency notes. Similar is the case with grocery and dairy products. Wholesale vegetable markets were closed on Wednesday and now we are in a do-or-die situation, Vikram Raghuvanshi, the manager of Bhopal-based Hotel Nandan Palace, said.The price of potatoes has skyrocketed after the Centres announcement. Yes, the prices will plunge back to their normal levels after three or four days but currently the issue is grave as the potato is one of the basic ingredients in wedding food, said Lovepreet Singh, a wedding manager.Others have taken a more pragmatic view of the whole situation.We have a wedding party today. Yes, there are issues with the preparations, but one thing is for sure the prime minister has done a great job. We should understand that this move is for our betterment. Thus, despite facing so many problems, I am happy because in the long-term, it will be beneficial for us, said Sudheer Sharma, the owner of Kanta Shravva Palace in Bhopal."

The highlight in a dish of mushy, too-wet, under-seasoned polenta twinkies on miso-aubergine mash was the bright crunch of pickled carrot strings and the tartness of barnyard-y goat cheese (though there was too little of both).The chilli chocolate lentils (made with whole masoor) merely sounded imaginative.

But those of us, who have Jewish friends, would have been told that the holiday is inundated with more tradition and warmth than we know. As the community prepares to usher in the eight-day festival that begins tonight, we join in the observances.The Jewish festival of lights coincides with Christmas this year, a rarity. Mumbai-based Leora Micah Joseph tells us, 'Hanukkah' means 'dedication'. It refers to the re-dedication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in second century BCE, after the Jews reclaimed it from their Seleucid oppressors. ""When they went to light the temple menorah (seven-branched candelabrum), there was only one cruse of olive oil. They lit the menorah, and miraculously, the one-day supply of oil lasted for eight days. Commemorating this miracle of faith, Hanukkah is hence celebrated for eight days,"" says Leora, an active member of the Mumbai Jewish community.As the sun sets today, the nine-branched hanukkiah candelabrum will burn bright. The nightly hanukkiah lighting is at the heart of the festival. Leora says, ""It holds nine flames; one, the shamash (attendant), to kindle the other eight. On the first night, we light one flame. On the second night, an additional flame is lit. By the eighth night, all eight lights are kindled.""Traditionally, oil lamps are lit, but many Jewish homes light candles. Yet, through the sharing of each other's hanukkiah pictures on chat groups, Leora discovered that many families still own oil lamp stands and follow the tradition of lighting with oil. ""Some of these have been passed down generations, and are old, made of wood, brass or a combination of both,"" she says. This was evident from the myriad hanukkiahs adorning a Jewish family's house in Nana Peth. ""There's a wooden one that my husband's great grandfather, a woodworker, made for his family,"" says the lady of the house. They have quite a collection, with a wall-mounted one that belonged to her husband's grandfather, and another made of brass that was lit by his parents in their family home. The most intricate, however, is a foldable traveller's hanukkiah that they've had for as long as she can remember.Several food preparations are associated with Hanukkah, but it's interesting to note how they differ across the community, merely on basis of the geography and cultural fabric various members hail from. Leora mentions that according to legend, the ancestors of Bene Israel (Maharashtrian Jews) settled in Konkan after being shipwrecked off the coast. Their cuisine has influences of Maharashtrian and Konkan culinary styles, including the use of coconut. ""For Hanukkah, it is customary to have something deep-fried, in remembrance of the miracle of oil,"" says Leora.Going by this, Jews the world over, enjoy different preparations; but latkes (deep-fried potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (round doughnuts filled with jelly or custard) are traditional favourites. However, Camp resident Shalom Cohen, now living in California, associates most Jewish holidays with kaka bawas (a Persian Jewish delicacy), that his mother would prepare. ""My sister and I would wait for the holidays when our mum would make these date-filled cookies. They create a very nostalgic association with Hanukkah,"" reminisces Shalom, celebrating in California this year, with his roommate, who is looking forward to the experience.Leora has fond memories of attending Hanukkah parties at the synagogue when she'd go to spend her winter vacations in Ahmedabad. ""The local community would participate in the hanukkiah lighting, amidst prayers and special songs. This would be followed by fellowship, merriment and gift-giving to the children,"" she recalls.It will be a similar scene at the 95-year-old Succath Shelomo Synagogue in Rasta Peth. Daniel Penkar, synagogue president, informs, ""On December 29, the community will gather here to celebrate. Each family will bring its own hanukkiah and light it with the common hanukkiah of the synagogue. This will be followed by a simple celebration."" The Ohel David Synagogue on Moledina Road will see similar celebrations on December 31.In June, the community was conferred with the minority status by the state cabinet. Maharashtra is the first state to categorise the Jews as a minority group. Of the estimated 5000, over 4,300 Jews reside in the state, largely concentrated around Mumbai, Thane and Raigad area. Pune is home to less than 100 families."

This is a raging debate that will never end, so a wise young chef decided to put both on the plate. For every dish you order, a classic version and a modern take are served, and the results are extraordinary. Classic shepherds pie with the lamb and potato on one side, and roulade with stuffed lamb on the other. There were mini dosas and desserts, but my favourite was the classic lobster broth paired with a modern lobster bisque cappuccino. Perfect way to end a debate  agree to both sides.Pan Asian, ITC Grand CholaFive courses of dessert. If I had to choose one meal as my meal of the year, it would be this one by Chef Vikramjit Roy, who made a guest appearance at Pan Asian, which he started a few years ago.

The highlight is the unlimited amount of tandoor and barbecue starters served with a buffet.We reach the hotel by 8 p.m. and the elevator takes us straight to the rooftop. Stepping into the restaurant, the change in ambience is pretty overwhelming. The rooftop has been transformed into a pleasant tropical space with an earthy dcor. A live kitchen is at work at one end of the indoor restaurant space while on the other end you have the open-sky space with a stunning view of bustling Palayam.Food and beverages manager Anuf Khan arrives as we sit down at the table. He briefs us about the new venture. Starters are our highlight. There are many who prefer dining on starters alone instead of an extravagant buffet. So we decided to go heavy on the starters, says Anuf.Four vegetarian and four non-vegetarian starters are served every day. Executive Chef Joginder Pal Singh chips in between with his expertise on kebabs and tandoors. We have a different menu for each day of the week. The dishes range from North Indian tandoors to popular Arabic kebabs and Thai grills. The main-course menu also changes every day, he says. listening to the Chefs description for a while, we could no longer wait and decide to kick-start the feast.Non-veg platter comes first. Murgh Bada kebab, Mutton Hariyali kebab, Fish Irani kebab and Arabic grilled fish with veggies and mint chutney arrive on a shiny steel plate. Spicy brown chicken, cooked to perfection, sets my taste buds on fire as soon as I take a bite and the Arabic grilled fish with juicy soft fish cubes with a coriander-lemon coat melts in the mouth. But the clear winner is the Mutton Hariyali kebab with exquisitely cooked mutton in a green sauce made of palak and a variety of spices, while the mildly spicy Irani fish kebab stands out for its exotic taste.The vegetarian starters are equally impressive with the delicious Bharwan tandoori aloo, a special dish which involves a thick soft potato rings filled with shredded paneer, leading the platter. Veg seekh kebab and Arabic subzi tikki are the spiced-up bites on the platter while cubes of paneer cooked in Satay peanut sauce adds a sweet touch.Though stuffed with the smoking starters, we decide to try out the main-course as well, starting with a Vegetable pulao, Methi gosht, which is mutton cooked in thick cashew-fenugreek based gravy, and scrumptious gobi in black pepper sauce. Next up is Indian breads. Roti and butter naan, though a little too crispy for my comfort, go extremely well with the moderately spicy red curry and the rich sweet n sour gravy of paneer butter masala.We sign off the evening with a bowl of warm gulab jamun, chocolate pastry with fresh fruits and two big scoops of mango ice cream.Skyye Grill is open from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. on all days of the week. The buffet is priced at Rs. 888 including the taxes. For reservations, call 0471-2333333, 9847030003."

The initial cost, including seeds, urea and pesticide, comes to Rs.18,000 per acre. The cash crunch has prevented me from carrying on sowing operations, Surjeet Singh, of Phul village in Bathinda, told The Hindu .Mr. Surjeet Singh has sown wheat on the rest of his seven-acre land.With each day passing, problems are getting aggravated. Most transactions are being done on credit, so my ability to buy inputs has become limited. I have to buy whatever traders offer me on credit.Patience is running out. If this [the cash crunch] is not sorted out soon, the government will face the wrath of farmers, he said.The data from the Agriculture Ministry show that till December 2 this year, the total area under the rabi crops stands at 415.53 lakh hectares, against 382.84 lakh hectare this time in 2015. While wheat has been sown on 173.93 lakh hectares, against 152.56 lakh hectares last year, the area under pulses has risen to 112.95 lakh hectares from 99.83 lakh hectares last year. The area under oilseeds has risen to 70.7 lakh hectares from 64.21 lakh hectares.Satnam Singh of Beru village in Patiala expressed the same concern. Wheat sowing should ideally be done between mid- November and the last week of the month. But sowing on my land has been delayed by a week. This means the quality of my crop could take a hit, resulting in a lower yield.Many other farmers of my village have been spending long hours in queues in front of banks and ATMs  the crucial time we should spend on our fields, he added.Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has recently said demonetisation has not impacted the Rabi crop sowing, citing the increase in the area under wheat and pulses, the main crops.Noted agricultural policy analyst Devinder Sharma said: If farmers and the people continue to face difficulties caused by demonetisation, the government will face the consequences. It is now becoming clear that demonetisation is aimed at rescuing the banking sector, not at unearthing black money."

Among the new varieties, which are set to be released, AICRP C-28 variety was the one to be watched due to its distinct features, he said.The new variety, which is a 125-day crop (around 15 days more than traditional variety) will give an yield of around 40 tonnes/acre unlike traditional variety, which gives around 30 tonnes. This is a heat tolerant and pest-resistant variety whose tubers will be bigger in size, he said.He said it would take at least a year to introduce the variety to the farmers.Potato is cultivated on around 33,000 hectares in the State and Hassan alone accounts for 12,000 hectares.He said that the Station is in the process of producing seed of potato locally to prevent the practice of importing them from north India, which was expensive."
58e4abe4a3d24b281b1011ab,Cash crunch & confusion trigger trade shutdown ,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Cash-crunch-confusion-trigger-trade-shutdown/article16511611.ece,2016-11-17,"more-inTraders across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy. Besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.Traders pleaTo improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. Mr. Seth, who is also the joint secretary, Automotive Parts Merchants Association, added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. For those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. He pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. Many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. The main market areas in Bengaluru city were also impacted. APMC yard in Bengaluru is known for its cash payments. Only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer Bengaluru. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. In the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.Business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. As per the estimates of the Karnataka Hosiery & Garment Association (KHGA), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. The association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than Rs.50000 for daily business needs. The government should soon bring Rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, KHGA.In Kolkata, Anupam Boral, Proprietor of a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises (GSE), said the shortage of Rs 100 notes is also hurting business. For instance, Boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute. Though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" On other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, Boral said, I am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between Rs 800 to Rs 1500. The shortage of Rs 100 rupee is crippling us. Even if I avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of Rs 2000 denomination.""In Coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi in Coimbatore, went to the bank on Thursday morning to draw Rs. 30,000 from his Cash Credit (CC) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only Rs. 10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another Rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. How can I manage a week with Rs. 10,000?The castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in Coimbatore city. We usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. But, there are so many restrictions now and I had to draw money from the bank. I have this account for nearly 40 years. We should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. However, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw Rs. 50,000 from his CC account. He had drawn Rs. 10,000 last Friday and was allowed to draw another Rs. 40,000 on Thursday. There is no clarity on the issue. Some banks allowed the industries that have CC account to draw Rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said V. Sundaram, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.The plight of small scale industrial units in Hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. Cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. Since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry leaders Ravindra Modi and V. Anil Reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. Since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.Though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says K.Koteswara Rao, Convenor of All India Forum for Small and Medium Industries. He expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M.

It was clean and dry, warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and there was plenty of work on the local farms. But now, even this bare-bones way of life is threatened.The family, along with another 242 cave-dwelling households dotted around the capital of Bamiyan province, also called Bamiyan, could be forced to move soon. They are whats left of around 10,000 families who have been relocated over the past decade as part of the local governments programme to protect the unique man-made grottoes that it hopes will transform Bamiyan into a global tourist destination once Afghanistans war with the insurgent Taliban, now in its 16th year, is finally over.The couple moved here from neighbouring Maidan-Wardak province because they believed it was a stepping stone to a better future.We had no money and my husband couldnt get a job, Marzia said as she breastfed her baby. We left because we were poor.But 12 years later, they are still living in the cave, along with their five children aged from 10 months to 8 years, including 6-year-old Freshta who hasnt been the same since a land mine exploded close by her four years ago. Her mental development stopped.Destroyed by timeAny original features, such as the brightly-coloured geometric murals that were painted by the monks who created these caves, are long gone. Theyve been destroyed by time, the elements and the wear-and-tear of hundreds of years of habitation, including the fires that residents build for cooking and heat.Life here is difficult, Marzia, 30, said. Water must be fetched from a nearby stream, and a 9-volt battery charges a solar panel that provides light after dark. Cooking is done on a stove fuelled by a gas bottle. They have installed a door and a step up into the one room that all seven members of the family share. Smaller caves outside are used for storage.On the rural outskirts of the city, amid the rutted fields where the provinces main potato crop is grown, the cave-dwellers do what they can with their meagre resources, determined that the next generation will have a better life. As Shia Muslims of the Hazara minority they have suffered historic persecution, but they have also benefited from immense largesse from international charities and governments.Amid an intensifying Taliban-led insurgency, Bamiyan is a haven of peace, as the Shia Hazaras have successfully kept the war off their territory since the end of the Sunni Talibans regime, under which they were persecuted and much of the provinces Buddhist heritage destroyed. A proliferation in recent years of all-covering burqas and hijabs among the local women attests to a growing concern about the war as it spreads elsewhere in the country.High ambitionFreshta Ahmadi runs a school for 25 children aged 4 to 9 years old, who gather in the living room of her familys three-room cave home six days a week to learn reading, writing and mathematics. Freshta is 18, in her last year of secondary school and hopes one day to become a doctor. She has been running the cave school since 2012 with money donated by Parsa, an Afghan charity.These children are from poor families, their fathers are itinerant workers, farmers, or refugees from other poorer areas, she said. Their circumstances dont dampen ambition, however the children, mostly girls, stand in turn at the whiteboard, complete a few exercises in front of their classmates, then reiterate their plans for a future as doctors, police officers or engineers.Bamiyan is probably best known as the site of two massive Buddhas, one 55 meters tall, the other 38 meters tall, that were carved into the cliff face above the modern city between the 4th and 6th Centuries and which were destroyed by the Taliban at the urging of al-Qaida in early 2001, in a defiant show of extremist power and hubris ahead of the attacks on the United States on September 11 that year.UNESCO has classified the cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley as a world heritage site representing Buddhist and Islamic religious and artistic developments from the 1st to 13th Centuries.

We accepted initial couple of days inconvenience as our contribution to fight against corruption. But now the situation is fast changing, people need swift access to their own money for their daily needs, said Sangram Keshari Rout, a resident of Sahidnagar of the city.The scene across the city looked similar to situation witnessed after any disaster. People would keep waiting nearby ATMs for our hours. Once they would spot a vehicle coming for cash replenishment, they would lose no time to form queues before ATM counters. Almost all localities of the capital city witnessed similar sights.Small traders were worst hit as the demonetisation announcement made their business to nose-dive. I usually sell potato and onion worth Rs. 10,000 everyday and it goes up to Rs. 15,000 on Sundays. However, I have not touched Rs. 3,000 today, said Pratap Swain, a trader in Unit-I market, of the city.Many grocery shops in colony areas have remained closed for past three days. If I will open my shop, my customers will request me to sell commodities on credit. I might face difficulties in recovering the money. It is better to keep the shop closed for a few more days, said Manua Das in Baranga market.Identical situation prevailed in almost all districts of the State. Consumers have cut down their volume of daily purchase while saving precious cash for emergency situation."

Normally, potatoes here sell like hot cakes.There is hardly any wholesaler or agro commodity trading house to buy potatoes in this area. Most of the farmers have been forced to sell the produce at rates almost less than the actual cost of production, Najaib Gill, a prominent potato grower on the outskirts of Una town, told IANS.He said this is the season when potatoes grown in low hills of the State, mainly in Una district, command monopoly in the markets of north Indian states of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Delhi.He said there is a huge demand for the potatoes in the plains.Since the production (in the hills) is optimal and the demand is high in the plains, we are not getting adequate prices as the traders say they have no cash in new currency notes, he added.Potato is one of the major cash crops grown in the lower and mid-hills of the State. Una district alone harvests potatoes on 700 hectares.The States potato yield was around 200,000 tonnes in 2015-16, while estimates this fiscal put the produce at 195,000 tonnes, according to the Himachal Pradesh Economic Survey for 2015-16.Besides Una district, the table potato is also cultivated in Bilaspur, Kangra, Mandi, Shimla, Solan and Kullu districts.The Lahaul Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district is known for producing virus-free potatoes that mainly find a market for plantation.Sarvjit Singh Dogra, state Agricultural Produce Market Committee Secretary in Una town, told IANS that a 50-kg bag of potatoes is fetching between Rs 400 and Rs 425 in Una, while it sold for around Rs 800 last year.Currently, potatoes are being retailed at Rs 30-35 per kg across the country.Growers are facing many hardships. Many are being forced to accept old currency notes.For more than a week there was no bulk buyer for potato. Finally, we have decided to sell the entire produce at almost half the rates by accepting old currency notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, said a farmer, requesting anonymity.He said if the government could allow use of old high denomination notes for purchasing seeds, it should also be liberal with the growers for accepting the banned notes for their produce till the new currency is in full circulation.Field reports say most of the farmers have delayed the harvesting of the potatoes till the prices spike again.Last week, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh expressed concern over lack of enthusiasm among the traders during centuries-old Lavi Fair, synonymous with trade in traditional items like hand-knitted woollens, farm implements and dry fruits as well as horses, yaks, sheep, at Rampur town, some 130 km from the state capital.The fair too was hit hard by the demonetisation decision.Its unfortunate that this year the trade fair was hit by the demonetisation of currency notes.

Compare this with prices just a month ago, when tomato was retailing at Rs. 30 a kg. While a good yield over the last one month has normalised supply, tomato growers have now been affected by the post- demonetisation cash crunch.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and in case of tomato, even to Kolkata.Supply of tomatoes to Tamil Nadu was affected during the Cauvery crisis. Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato grower from Nukkanahalli in Kolar disitrct, and added that farmers were suffering huge losses.Vegetable prices have also been crashing: a kg of beans is now selling at Rs. 14, onion at Rs. 16 and potato at Rs. 26. The prices took a hit over the last two weeks. This is despite the fact that November and December usually see vegetables retailing at higher prices in Bengaluru.The prices have come down by over 30 per cent in the last week alone, said a senior official heading the vegetable procurement section in a leading retail chain.Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms, said that another reason for the falling prices has been falling retail sales, indicating lower consumption of vegetables, creating a high supply and low demand cycle.However, procurement officials fear that the supply-demand cycle may soon be reversed if the cash crunch continues for a longer period, affecting crop patterns.Now, vegetable growers are resorting to distress sale. But they are not being paid for their produce immediately, further worsening the cash crunch. If this affects sowing this season, then we will soon stare at low supplies and skyrocketing prices, the official said.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to markets"
58e4df54a3d24b281b103233,Business takes a wholesale beating in Burra Bazar,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Business-takes-a-wholesale-beating-in-Burra-Bazar/article16662566.ece,2016-11-21,"Nearly two weeks after demonetisation, the business community at eastern Indias largest wholesale market in Kolkatas Burra Bazar is furious. The community, which has remained loyal to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the years, has suffered close to 100 per cent fall in business. The office-bearers of at least three merchant associations in and around Burra Bazar said the BJP will pay dearly for demonetisation.There was hardly any customer in the first week. Business dropped by 100 per cent, said general secretary of the Posta Bazar Merchants Association, Biswanath Agarwal.The Posta Bazaar takes up the largest space in Burra Bazar  spread over almost two square kilometres  and hosts traders in pulses, sugar, oil, flour and lime. Mr. Agarwal said semi-wholesalers and retailers have started coming returning but the rise is only by about 20 per cent in the last two days.But Burra Bazars total turnover is much above 100 crore daily. The majority of the transaction is not in black but in cash. Thousands of crores has been lost in the last few days, said Mr. Agarwal.Not so hot potatoesThe president of the Posta Bazar Potato Merchants Association, Gurupada Sinha, who controls a substantial part of the business, said he would not be surprised if farmers commit suicide at the time of payment.Mr. Sinha, whose family has been in the trade for four generations, said the potato sowing season has started only about two weeks ago in Bengal.The seed and the raw material for cultivation arrive from Punjab and are sold in cash. But the farmer has no new cash and thus he would borrow from lenders and fail to repay it, he pointed out. The biggest panic is if the entire old currency, which is not necessarily black, will be rejected now as the exchange amount is getting reduced."
