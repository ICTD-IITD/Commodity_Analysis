Appoorwa, who regained the singles title she won in 2004, apart from the doubles and team event gold medals in the World championships in Birmingham recently.This was far more tougher than the first title in Colombo, in terms of competition and joy, said the 35-year-old Appoorwa in an exclusive chat with The Hindu from London on Saturday.We were informed two weeks before the Worlds that potato starch powder would be used in the championship instead of the regular boric acid, Appoorwa said. The big difference is the fast movement of the coins on the board, and you have to have great control, she said.The 2003 International Carrom Federation Cup winner had an extremely tough journey to get back into the circuit. Blessed with a boy (Kanishk now studying in UKG), Appoorwa had to balance between her job  she is the Administrative Officer in LIC, Hyderabad  and training, and she did that in style.I can say this is the best moment in my life. My first objective before coming here was to give it my best and not think of the results though any sportsperson would love to keep winning, she says.I must thank my employers (LIC) for their great support both in terms of granting me permission to train in the run-up to this World championship and also for sponsoring my entire trip to Birmingham, she said.I dedicate this win to my father (Sai Kumar), husband (Kishore) and to all officials of the Hyderabad Carrom Association including president B.K. Haranath and the Secretary S. Madan Raj for their great support.This is the best moment of my life"

They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesnt extend credit any longer. Chitra cant pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so, Ms. Bag told this reporter. We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit, Ms Bag said.Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer  a middle-aged man  said he could not extend any more credit as customers were paying in old bank notes.Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land  second only to Uttar Pradesh  was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the States total area. Since Bengals industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato.Ms. Bag  who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May  had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes.He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was a time-consuming affair in the potato sowing season.The potato seeds  which are tubers of the previous year  are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.Crisis timeSince stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes, Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds, warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.We are helplessThe officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur  Sethia Cold Storage  accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. We are instructed not to accept old currency notes, an official of Sethia Cold Storage said .Former president of Cold Storage Owners Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be difficult for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government should intervene.Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants federation and Bengals Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday.The problem, however, remains unresolved, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected, he warned.They are distressed as they do not have new currency to withdraw seeds from cold storage facilities"

Shimla-based Telugu apple grower Velladi Purushottama Rao has taken upon himself to make Lambasingi in Visakhapatnam Agency area of Andhra Pradesh the second Shimla of the country.Mr. Rao has been growing apples in Shimla for the past ten years and has become an authority recognised by the Andhra Pradesh Horticulture Department. A native of Kondapalli, his interest in potato farming took him to Shimla. But once he got to the foothills of the Himalayas, he fell in love with apples. In 2006, he leased out five acres of land and has been successfully growing apples in Shimla ever since.Mr. Purushottama Rao says that Lambasingi is better suited for apple cultivation than Shimla because the apple tree does not go into a dormant phase and can therefore produce two crops in a year. The tree yields fruits in the third year and by the fifth year the yield reaches the peak of 20 kg per tree, he said.Crucial meetingA crucial meeting of 90 farmers organised by the Department of Horticulture and Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) on Wednesday rekindled the hope that the dream of the South Indian apple would come true soon.Horticulture Project Officer G. Prabhakara Rao said that ITDA Project Director and IAS officer Ravi Panthamsetti explained to the farmers how apple cultivation would change the economy of the place.Mr. Prabhakara Rao said that two varieties of apples Anna and Dorcet Golden were found to be ideally suited for Lambasingi. Over 10,000 plants would be distributed to farmers in January. Input subsidy would also be given to them for the next three years until the first harvest.Mr. Purushottama Rao said that attempts to cultivate apple on a large scale have failed in South India till now.In an earlier attempt, 300 to 400 trees were planted on a trial basis at the Chinthapalli Regional Agricultural Research Station at Lambasingi. At that time horticulture scientists predicted that the first South Indian apples grown at Lambasingi would hit the market this year. but that did not happen. He said that the yield at the Chinthapalli Research Station was low because of improper pruning which was very important for apples.Attempts were made to grow apples in Coorg in 2012 itself, but cultivation of the fruit there has not yet taken off there."
58e50131a3d24b4437c4a335,Cash crunch triggers virtual trade shutdown,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/Cash-crunch-triggers-virtual-trade-shutdown/article16543915.ece,2016-11-08,"Traders across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy.To improve the situation, traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion from Confederation of All India Traders industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency.He added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to insufficient currency notes. The main market areas in Bengaluru were also impacted. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50,000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs daily, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers.Note shortageIn Kolkata, Anupam Boral, who runs a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises, said the shortage of Rs.100 notes is also hurting business. He said he was finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs.100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute.In Coimbatore, confusion and misinformation prevail with regard to cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate, went to the bank on Thursday to draw Rs.30,000 from his Cash Credit account, but was shocked when told that the maximum limit was Rs.10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs.80,000 a week for wages and another Rs.20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M. Soundariya Preetha & Arun S)"

58e50cd1a3d24b4437c4a958,"From Dubai, with love",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/From-Dubai-with-love/article16734454.ece,2016-12-01,"Chef Himanshu Saini is all of 29. The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

58e52a3a7be9e05a951f4e98,Cash crisis hits potato,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161207/jsp/bengal/story_123388.jsp,2016-12-07,"Calcutta, Dec. 6: Potato cultivation in Bengal could decline this year because of a chain of events triggered by demonetisation, an agriculture department estimate suggests.According to the estimate, prepared with inputs from the districts, the cultivation area could shrink by 25 per cent.The estimate has been prepared at a time chief minister Mamata Banerjee is leading a vocal protest against the Centre's demonetisation drive.""It appears that potato will be cultivated on about 3 lakh hectares, 1 lakh hectares less than the usual farming area,"" an official said.Sources in the agriculture marketing department said only 75 per cent of the usual area could be brought under potato cultivation this year.The sources said the district authorities had ""identified"" three reasons linked to the demonetisation drive behind the shrinking potato cultivation area.First, the harvesting of 25 per cent of the monsoon paddy is yet to be completed because farmers do not have enough cash to pay labourers. So, the farmers have not been able to prepare the fields for potato cultivation.Second, many of those who have harvested their paddy have not been able to secure loans from cooperative banks to cultivate paddy. The cooperative banks are running short of cash as the lead banks have not been able to give them enough money because of demonetisation.Third, traders, who buy a part of farmers' produce before the government begins procurement, drove a hard bargain this time, taking advantage of the cash crunch.""If 3 lakh hectares are cultivated, the total production will be around 70 lakh tonnes. The state's annual consumption requirement is 60 lakh tonnes. We would not face much of a problem but the rural economy will take a hit,"" an official said."

According to the India Meteorological Department website, the temperature in Bhagalpur was 10.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. It might have dipped further at some places. The weather department at Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour, said there was no relief in sight from the cold for now. Bhagalpur and its neighbouring districts in eastern Bihar along with Kosi and Seemanchal region will continue to experience intense cold weather for the next few weeks, they said. According to Sunil Kumar, head of the weather department of BAU, Sabour, it is possible that the minimum temperature could fall even further in the coming days, though the maximum temperature will not fluctuate much. Sunil denied the possibility of rain in the coming days, and said the department has given instructions to farmers - particularly Rabi crop farmers - on how to irrigate their fields. Potato farmers have been advised to uproot potatoes if the crop is ready or else the cold would destroy it. Lallan Roy, a farmer at Rannuchak, under the jurisdiction of Nathnagar block, said low temperatures generally benefit wheat, vegetables and potatoes, but ""potatoes will be destroyed if it rains."" ""After the devastating floods in August, we now have to face this cold. Life has come to a standstill,"" lamented Anandi Mandal, a daily wage earner at Sabour. Families with school-going children welcomed the district administration's decision to shut junior section of schools till December 17. The weather has hit transport and road and railway communication the most. Several long distant trains on the Kiul-Bhagalpur-Sahebganj loop section and the Katihar-Naugachia-Barauni section are not running as per schedule. The Upper India Express was cancelled on Tuesday. ""Because of dense fog, trains are running late,"" said a railway officer at Bhagalpur. Even buses are hit. Prem Kumar, conductor at a local bus stand, said: ""The number of passengers has fallen considerably. Most buses are running late."" He pointed at a Katihar-bound bus plying with 10 passengers when most Katihar- or Purnea-bound buses are normally over-crowded. The weather has not been kind to the aged either. Sources at the Barari Smashan Ghat (cremation ground) said many elderly people have died in the past two days."

The riots had shattered the equations between the Jat and Muslim community in the area, a combined vote base that his party traditionally depended on.He said he had tried for this kind of consolidation of erstwhile socialists or members of the Janata Parivar to bring farmers interests back to the forefront of politics, but it had not been possible.We did try to bring together former socialists of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, at least for a rally and even that did not happen. You will have to ask [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam Singh why he didnt come for the rally on October 12, he said.Mr. Singhs party had organised a Kisan Swabhiman rally on October 12 and many members of the erstwhile socialist block had participated in it with Mr. Mulayam Singh being conspicuous by his absence.Mr. Singh has entered into an alliance with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (U) for the U.P. elections.Why scrap import duty?Mr. Singh said the removal of import duty on wheat, coming as it does on the back of expectations of a bumper crop domestically this year (after two years of drought) does not make sense.The imported wheat will be hitting our markets just as procurement will start here. I dont understand the logic unless it is to make sure our farmers dont recover their costs, leave alone make profits, he said. According to him, even in the case of paddy, the situation was dire.

The Central government has no understanding of the rural economy.

Pictures of the most powerful Briton after the Queen snacking at Victoria of Vardaan may be great advertisement, but sales have halved for no fault of the vadas. Dhande me manda hain (The business is going through a lean patch), Chauhan told Metro. Before the curbs on cash were announced, we used to sell around 120 plates a day. Currently, it is barely 50-60 plates a day. Chauhan has stopped accepting the old 500 and 1,000-rupee notes from customers. What would I do with them? I cant pay my suppliers this way, he said. I dont have the time to stand in long bank queues either. He has taken the one route available to him: cutting down on production. From 10-12kg of pulses a day, he now uses less than 8kg to prepare the vada mix. Even then, some part of the stuff still remains unused. Recently, a Paytm representative visited his stall to pitch the e-wallet payment option, Chauhan said. I refused since I dont understand the technicalities, he smiled. Satya Sanjay Dutt, owner of SK Dutt flower shop in New Market He has already had at least three large orders cancelled and sales at the start of the wedding season have been the lowest he has seen. A customer had placed an order before the Prime Ministers announcement. A few days ago, he called to say he would be able to pay only in old Rs 500 notes. I refused, said Dutt, who accepts demonetised notes only from those with whom he has been doing business for decades. This time last year, we would sell around 500 locally grown roses daily. Now its difficult to sell even 300 roses, rued Dutt, whose family has been selling flowers for three generations. According to him, florists have been hit the hardest because in a marriage nobody compromises on food. If needed, the axe falls on floral decorations and other such expenditure, he said. He is counted among the top phuchkawalas in town. He has been written about in multiple food columns, cut-outs of which he religiously preserves. Blame demonetisation for Pandits dejected look on what would otherwise have been a busy weekday evening. Before the cash crisis, I used to sell around 600 phuchkas in an evening and even more on weekends. Over the past week, I have been struggling to sell 300, he said . His potato supplier is disappointed too. Pandits daily procurement is down to 2kg from 5kg-plus. ....And the one place wherespirits are still up Chhota Bristol, the Shaw Brothers-owned bar in Esplanade, is one place where demonetisation has apparently failed to dampen business. Around 4pm on a Tuesday, the drinking den was reasonably packed. You wont find a place to sit after 6pm, said Shibaji Shaw (in picture above), one of the co-owners. Shibajis family has been running the 144-year-old watering hole for five generations. In the first couple of days (after the cash curbs were announced), we did see a dip in sales. But it was back to normal soon, he said. Asked what he meant by normal, Shibaji said the bar sells more than 400 litres of alcohol, including beer, daily. Only cash is accepted and payment comes before the first sip."

Picture by Surajit Roy Dec. 15: From murder to disenchantment to skewering questions, seemingly unconnected events in the past 24 hours in places far apart from one another have brought to the fore the unintended consequences of demonetisation in the country. Over 100 factory owners in Amritsar have handed over keys of their units to the district administration in a symbolic protest that stood out in sharp contrast with the public pronouncements of support for demonetisation from most of corporate India. ""The problem is very simple. We cannot run our units any more. Let the government do it,"" said Amit Dalmiya, who runs a textile processing unit in Amritsar. ""If Modiji can run the country, he can also run the industry... it is a question of survival and the situation has gone beyond us,"" Krishna Kumar Sharma, the president of the Amritsar Textile Processor Association, told The Telegraph this evening. One industrialist who sought anonymity indicated his political choice. Without naming anyone, he said: "" Pehli baar to aadmi par bharosa hota hi hai... baad mein pata chalta hai.... (The first time you do trust a man... then realisation dawns). They did not go into demonetisation with full planning."" On Wednesday, the industrialists handed over the keys to the additional deputy commissioner, Tajinderpal Singh Sandhu. Amritsar is home to around 60 textile processing units on which another 700-800 embroidery, knitting and weaving units are dependent. ""At this moment our units are running at 20 per cent of the optimum capacity.... The labour strength had to be halved because of the prevailing economic situation,"" said Sharma. The units have been hit badly because of sudden cancellation of bulk orders since the demonetisation drive started. ""If a person manages to withdraw Rs 2,000 from an ATM, he will buy food and not clothes,"" said an industrialist. A contract worker with HDFC Bank was stabbed to death in Gujarat by three people with whom he had allegedly struck a deal to exchange notes. Rajesh Bhilariya, 27, was called today afternoon to a village in Junagadh where he was allegedly supposed to accept Rs 9 lakh in old notes and hand over new ones, police inspector Ashok Tilva said. Rajesh worked as a "" mitra"" or ""correspondent"" (effectively rural agents) of the bank. Police said Rajesh had reached the spot with his cousin. But the three would-be cash recipients snatched the bag with the new notes and tried to escape. When Rajesh tried to stop them, he was stabbed, the police said. An SBI branch and an adjoining ATM kiosk were ransacked in Malda today after hundreds of account holders seeking cash for family weddings, potato cultivation and travel were told each could withdraw no more than Rs 3,000. The account holders had queued up at the Balupur branch in Ratua, around 50km from Malda, from daybreak. The SBI branch, with 3,500 account holders, is the sole bank in the area. Saidul Sheikh, who was in the queue, said the bank staff initially offered only Rs 1,000 when depositors demanded the weekly quota of Rs 24,000. The amount was then raised to Rs 2,000 and then Rs 3,000. The trouble broke out around noon. The bank employees and officers fled. Mushref Miyan, a trader, said he was becoming increasingly nervous. ""My daughter's wedding is on Sunday. The Prime Minister had said we could draw Rs 24,000 each week. I have about Rs 80,000 in my account. But the bank is offering Rs 1,000 and I am really feeling frustrated. The people erupted today,"" he said. Subol Pal, a farmer, said he needed Rs 40,000 immediately. ""I am not being able to start my potato and vegetable cultivation as I need to invest Rs 40,000. The cash crisis is affecting hundreds of farmers like me,"" Pal said. Ankan Paul, the manager of the Balupur SBI branch, said: ""We are helpless. We are distributing whatever cash we are being sent. The bank was shut down after the violence."" Arun Kumar Sinha, the SBI regional manager, said that things were expected to normalise after tomorrow. BJP parliamentarians and party office bearers have told Amit Shah that the government needs to ensure adequate flow of cash in banks to check discontent among the people despite continued support for demonetisation. ""The public mood is still in favour of the government on demonetisation but people are facing hardships due to the shortage of cash. The government has to increase the cash flow to keep the people favourable,"" one MP from eastern Uttar Pradesh was quoted as having told a meeting on Wednesday evening. Concerned by the feedback, the BJP leadership had called separate meetings of party MPs and office bearers on Wednesday and Thursday. The Supreme Court today took note of growing instances of new currency notes being funnelled out of banks and asked the Centre ""you are not able to secure it?"" The court also grilled the government on withdrawing exemptions granted to hospitals and pharmacies for accepting the demonetised notes. The apex court underscored that although the government claimed that it had infused new currency worth Rs 5 lakh crore into the system, the ground reality was that people were not able to get even the promised Rs 24,000 per week. Responding to questions from a bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi said certain bank officials were diverting the money. ""Bank managers had done this fraud.... The Government of India can't sit in every bank and monitor. We are having raids every day."" The submission invited a repartee from Justice Thakur and triggered titters in the courtroom: ""So your Rs 5 lakh crore has gone this way. You are not able to secure it?"" When the attorney-general contended that there had been no complaint or protests from the common man on withdrawal of exemptions, Justice Thakur asked: ""You expect all people to come here? Please tell us what is your apprehension? What is wrong in exempting government hospitals? How can it be misused in government hospitals?"""

While in 2002-03, the per capita income of the farmer was Rs 1,062, it has leapfrogged to Rs 4,976 by 2014.""At the same time, the per capita income of a farmer in Punjab stands at Rs 18,059, Haryana Rs 14,434, Kerala Rs 11,888, Rajasthan Rs 7,350, Gujarat Rs 7,926, Maharashtra Rs 7,386, Tamil Nadu Rs 6,980 and Andhra Pradesh Rs 5,979.Now, the state has 32.79 lakh farmers and 24.20 lakh agricultural labourers. Of the 32.79 lakh farmers, only 5,574 have more than 10 hectares.Similarly, 63,688 farmers have land between four to 12 hectares and 3.11 lakh farmers have land between two to four hectares, while the rest have less than two hectares and some even have less than one hectare.The minister also informed the House that farmers had shown interest to cultivate potato.""The potato mission is working in this direction. While in 2014, potato had been cultivated in 15,808 hectares, it has been increased to 25,183 hectares.""To attract the farmers to opt for potato cultivation, the minister said the state government was giving Rs 20,000 subsidy per hectare.""The state government has signed an MoU with the National Seeds Corporation, National Horticulture Research and Development and the Odisha State Seeds Corporation for production of potato seeds,"" the minister said.However, Opposition members today alleged that the potato mission was a failure and the farmers were not getting any government help."
58e536ec7be9e05a951f5c46,Paddy alert in Bengal,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161123/jsp/nation/story_120840.jsp,2016-11-23,"Calcutta, Nov. 22: Around 35 per cent of the monsoon paddy in Bengal could go waste because of the demonetisation drive, an agriculture department estimate has suggested. However, against the backdrop of chief minister Mamata Banerjee's vocal opposition to the domonetisation, a section of officials in Nabanna, the Bengal secretariat, felt it was ""a bit early"" to forecast crop losses. Nabanna sources said the department drew up a report on the basis of feedback from all the districts. The government sought the report to gauge the impact of the demonetisation on the harvesting of the monsoon paddy. After the Centre recalled the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, reports poured in from rural Bengal that farmers could not harvest the produce as they had no money to pay the daily labourers. ""The estimates mentioned in the report suggest that there could be a loss of 35 per cent of the total paddy produced in the kharif season. If the crop is not harvested, it will rot in the fields. If the situation does not change dramatically, the state's total rice production is bound to be hit this year,"" a senior Nabanna official said. According to agriculture department officials, if the kharif crop is not harvested by the end of November, the total production is affected. ""If the farmers keep paddy in the fields till the end of November, a large portion of the grain will fall off because of the changing weather conditions..... It will result in crop loss,"" another official said. This would mean the farmers will face difficulties in recovering their investments. Potato cultivation would also suffer if the kharif paddy is not harvested by the end of November, the sources said. ""The sowing of potato seeds needs to be completed by mid-December for a healthy production. If the kharif paddy remains in the fields till the end of November, farmers would not get time to prepare the fields to grow potato,"" an official said. Some Nabanna officials said the report was based on estimates and the final production amount would be calculated only after the harvesting is completed. ""It is a bit early to say that the state is going to face huge crop loss,"" an agriculture department official said. The report will be sent to the Centre tomorrow. The major chunk of the yearly paddy production is done in the kharif season. Bengal produces about 158 lakh tonnes of rice annually, of which 110 lakh tonnes are harvested in the kharif season. The annual consumption requirement is 150 lakh tonnes. ""If 35 per cent of the kharif crop gets destroyed, the total rice production this year will come down to about 120 lakh tonnes,"" a source said. ""Farmers usually sell the boro (winter) paddy before the Pujas to meet festival expenses and the cost of harvesting the kharif crop. Most of the cash in the possession of farmers has become useless because of the demonetisation. So they have not been able to hire labourers for harvesting,"" the source said. The agriculture department officials said the effect was already evident in the sluggish sales of potato seeds at state government centres."

58e53e5e7be9e05a951f6571,Hidden enemy spices your bite,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161230/jsp/frontpage/story_127616.jsp,2016-12-30,"New Delhi, Dec. 29: Many Indian patients diagnosed with high blood pressure or cholesterol consume large amounts of salt and increase their health risks, a five-city study has suggested, highlighting what some doctors suspect is poor adherence to medical advice. The study, based on small samples of patients from Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai, has found the average salt consumption was 10.9 grams a day. This is more than double the 5 grams a day recommended by the World Health Organisation for healthy people. Two-thirds of the 446 patients already diagnosed with hypertension or high lipid levels added extra salt to their food during or after cooking. Three in four regularly ate processed, ready-to-eat food that was high in sodium content, raising their salt intakes. ""I think we're seeing the effects of two things - some negligence on part of the patients and some lack of awareness about hidden salt,"" Abhijit Trailokya, a Mumbai-based doctor who was part of the study team, told The Telegraph. ""Some patients may not add extra salt on their plates but eat pickles which is high in salt."" The researchers say their findings are in line with earlier surveys that found Indians eating unhealthy amounts of salt - through pickles, papad, chutneys and fried snacks as well as staples and processed food such as cheese, soup, potato chips and salted biscuits. An Indian Council of Medical Research study that covered 13 states had three years ago documented salt intakes ranging from 7 grams a day to 28 grams a day, with an average of 13 grams. Other surveys have shown that some people might be consuming up to 42 grams salt a day. Multiple studies from across the world have associated high consumption of salt with high blood pressure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and kidney disease. Trailokya and the collaborating doctors from hospitals in the other cities also observed that vegetarians on average consumed more salt than non-vegetarians. The average values varied across the cities -- about 14 grams in Delhi, about 10 grams in Bangalore, Calcutta and Chennai, and 9 grams in Mumbai. The findings have been published in the current issue of the Journal of Association of Physicians of India. The researchers, who analysed the dietary intakes based on information provided by the patients themselves, also found that vegetarians ate more saturated fats such as butter and ghee compared with non-vegetarians. The consumption was higher among patients sampled in Delhi than in the other cities. Earlier medical studies had indicated that about half of patients with hypertension might remain undiagnosed or not be taking treatment. Among the patients on therapy, only about half may have blood pressure values well within the required levels. But some doctors concede that the blame may not all lie with the patients. A senior Delhi-based doctor said it was unclear how well and how persistently patients diagnosed with hypertension received advice from their physicians on the need to change their diet and lifestyle and maintain the change permanently. ""Such advice needs to be repeatedly given at every visit; the patients need to be questioned each time and reminded. This takes significant investments of time by doctors,"" said Vivekanand Jha, a nephrologist in New Delhi and executive director of The George Institute for Global Health. ""Some doctors are probably doing this, but many may find it easier to just prescribe medicines."""
58e53f607be9e05a951f66c3,Cash crunch strains food chain,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161115/jsp/frontpage/story_119272.jsp,2016-11-15,"Uday Hazra is an affluent farmer. His fields are flush with harvest-ready paddy but he cannot hire day labourers. Shiva Sambhu Das is a day labourer who works on farms to earn Rs 100 and 2kg rice a day. He needs money to feed his family and pay for his children's education. Sarashi Jasan Samanta's shop is brimming with fertilisers he had stocked ahead of the potato-sowing season. But he is not getting customers. Samir Sahana runs a poultry unit, but the demand for his chickens has dipped. Nov. 14: The fates of Hazra, Samanta, Sahana and Das are bound together by cash, the absence of which is disrupting the rural food chain. Unless cash flows from Hazra to Das, the labourer cannot harvest the farmer's ripe crop. If the crop is not harvested, the farmer will not be able to buy and sow potato seeds, which means Samanta's fertilisers will not find a taker. Unless the farmer, farmhand and the fertiliser supplier complete the economic jigsaw, Sahana's meat will remain unsold. Cash, indeed, is the binding force that holds life together in rural Bengal - and in most of India's hinterland. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana are residents of Burdwan's Kendur village, around 140km from Calcutta. The plight of the four residents is a textbook case of the impact of the demonetisation - and the resultant currency crunch - announced by the Prime Minister on November 8. ""I cannot get my paddy fields harvested because I have to pay around Rs 1,000 daily to six or seven labourers. I have to harvest my crop soon as the paddy is ready and time is running out to sow potato seeds. But I don't have the money to buy the seeds or the fertiliser,"" said Hazra, who can be categorised as a big farmer in Bengal. The 62-year-old has a two-storey house that bears all the signs of solvency, from a double-door fridge to a water filter. His cowshed houses 10 cows, and prime gobindobhog paddy fills the silo in his courtyard. The farmer has one new Rs 2,000 note and several Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Hazra spoke of a stifling feeling of cashlessness. Told that his home and surroundings did not suggest such a sorry state of affairs, he said that for rural households, savings meant what was grown in the fields. ""I have 110 packs of quality paddy at home, which I retained after the last harvest so that I could sell them this winter at a better price. But there are no buyers. Even if I find some, they will insist that I accept the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" Hazra said. At Badamtala in Burdwan town, where the big rice traders have their gaddis (offices), several traders said the price of paddy had started falling after the demonetisation announcement. The price of gobindobhog has dipped from around Rs 2,200 a pack of 60kg to Rs 2,000. Other crops too are fetching lower prices, the traders said. Although the big farmers are often accused of exploiting the labourers, they remain the drivers of the rural economy, where the organised public and private sectors hardly generate any employment. By engaging in agriculture, they provide a livelihood to others in the village ecosystem. In neighbouring Hooghly district, another fertile zone where farmers grow three to four crops, labourer Rabin Sing is losing around Rs 500 every day this harvesting season. ""I work in two shifts during harvesting as I have to feed a family of four.... The farmer I work for gave me Rs 500 saying it can be changed in the bank. I lost a day trying to do that but couldn't exchange it. The farmers don't have money,"" said Sing, who is praying for a speedy return to normality. After demonetisation, he has been left with his life's savings of Rs 3,000 - two Rs 1,000 notes and two Rs 500 notes. After the experience at the bank, he deposited the money with two kirana stores from where he will buy his monthly provisions. ""They said they would give me provisions against this money.... But I don't have any cash. I can't buy medicine, fish or egg,"" Sing said, sitting near a kirana shop in Mirzapur, 50km from Calcutta, where 95 per cent people depend on agriculture. The shop had become the venue for an evening adda . Soon, stories of inconvenience were being exchanged. But some in the audience protested, emphasising that a few days' pain was worth the bigger gain in the future. When this correspondent asked about black money and why it was bad for the economy, Sanjay Patra, a carpenter, said: ""I don't know all that... but rich people will now face the music."" What about the misery of his fellow villagers? It's just a matter of a few days, he said. But P. Sainath, the founding editor of People's Archive of Rural India and a veteran journalist who has written extensively on poverty, said: ""The Prime Minister is talking about bearing pain for 50 days.... You can imagine how long it will take. But there is little doubt that the impact on the rural economy is going to be devastating."" Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India, predicted that the demonetisation's effect on the rural economy and country's informal sector could reduce GDP growth by one percentage point this year. ""Whatever you are witnessing in rural Bengal is not unique; it's happening across India as the sowing season is going to start and people have no money to buy seeds, fertilisers or pesticides,"" Sen said. Textbook economics says that the surplus generated in agriculture sustains the other sectors by generating multiplier effects, which help the economy grow. As the rural economy is cash-based, the first casualty is spending power. ""I was in Chikalthana, on the edge of Aurangabad (Maharashtra). Nobody has cash there. There is chaos and a law-and-order situation is developing,"" Sainath said. Some analysts have been saying that rural India's ""resilience"", arising from an informal credit system that facilitates cashless transactions among acquaintances, will help it cope. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana agreed that left without cash, they had been able to survive the past six days because of the credit system. Mirzapur residents echoed the assessment. ""At the village level, a personalised credit system works. But it cannot sustain as the moment you are out of the village, it doesn't work,"" said Sainath. Sen said that although the rural population can tide itself over the crisis for some time, its indebtedness would grow and make the villagers more vulnerable to moneylenders. ""The indebtedness in the economy is growing, and it's not a good sign,"" he added."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."

The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes.

Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."
58e5433a7be9e05a951f6bb9,Farm credit dries up,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161117/jsp/frontpage/story_119669.jsp,2016-11-17,"Nov. 16: Operations at Cooperative banks, the banking lifeline in rural India, have virtually come to a halt in Bengal soon after the demonetisation decision, choking the credit flow to farmers and robbing them of an avenue to convert their old notes. On the credit front, the 3,000-odd branches of cooperative banks in the state are unable to offer loans because they are not getting enough funds from lead banks (public sector banks) that are busy servicing the crowds at their own doorsteps. The impact is already telling on the ground. The state agriculture department today decided to shelve midway its campaign of drawing farmers to the banks to obtain loans through their Kisan Credit Cards. The one-month campaign was supposed to have been carried out between November 7 and December 7. ""But we decided to stop the campaign from tomorrow as farmers are not getting loans from banks, not even the cooperative banks on which they depend heavily,"" said an agriculture department official. According to an estimate, around 2,000 of the 3,345 gram panchayats in Bengal depend solely on cooperative banks. The lead bank scheme had been launched to strengthen the cooperative banks after it emerged decades ago that nationalised banks shared only 1 per cent of the burden of institutional credit in agriculture. The lion's share was shouldered by the cooperative banks. ""But as the commercial banks themselves are stressed following the demonetisation, the cooperative banks are facing a crunch and the rural people have no place to go,"" said a source. ""We usually withdraw Rs 10 lakh a day from our current account at our lead bank during the peak season. But in the past one week, we got a total of Rs 8 lakh.... So, it's not possible to meet the demand for loans from the farmers,"" said the manager of a cooperative bank in Rampurhat, Birbhum. The cooperative banks' large customer base, made up mostly of farmers, faces a crippling problem on deposits, too. A cooperative department official said the branches of cooperative banks have stopped taking deposits in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes following an RBI notification issued on November 14. The RBI notification said: ""No exchange facility against the specified bank notes (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) or deposit of such notes should be entertained by them (district central cooperative banks)."" An official in the state cooperative department said: ""It appears that as the majority of the cooperative banks did not make KYC (know your customer) mandatory, the RBI has prevented them from accepting deposits.... The decision has affected nearly 2 crore account holders of the cooperative banks."" He said: ""The two problems are enough to kill the rural economy.... The rural populace, more than 70 per cent of whom depend on agriculture, are forced to go to faraway places to exchange their old notes, which is causing a loss of mandays. The non-availability of loans is bound to hit the rabi (winter) cultivation this year."" Usually, around 10 lakh hectares are cultivated during the rabi season, whose produce includes potatoes, other vegetables and oilseed. ""Our estimate is that the area under cultivation would shrink by 30 per cent and the total sown area would be below 7 lakh hectares this year,"" said the official. The plight of Seikh Nijamuddin, a Birbhum farmer who has 22 bighas of cultivable land, tells a story. He had taken a loan of Rs 25,000 during the kharif (monsoon) season from a cooperative bank. He had arranged for Rs 27,000, all in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, to repay the loan and apply for a fresh loan of Rs 48,000 to sow mustard and potato seeds. ""But the cooperative bank is not taking the old currency notes, and I have been unable to exchange the notes even after visiting banks located 20km from my village as the exchange limit is only Rs 4,500,"" Nijamuddin said. The farmer said that if he did not get the loan within the next seven days, his cultivation plans would be thrown into disarray."

Fuel pumps have been remaining closed for the past one week as stocks ran dry. Prices of other daily essentials rose with the stock depleting fast.Citizen organisations yesterday seized potato bags from the city's grocery shops and sold them at Rs 20 per kg.Angered by the scarcity of essential commodities, people have stopped their supply to the Naga-dominated districts from Imphal in the past few days.Citizens' organisations in Churachandpur district today checked the stock and price of such goods in the shops at Churachandpur town.The situation eased to some extent today after the state government yesterday brought nearly 200 loaded trucks and tankers, which were stranded at various points in Assam, with security escorts along the Imphal-Jiribam highway.Some of the petrol pumps in Imphal were opened today.Police and India Reserve Battalion escorts brought 75 loaded trucks to Imphal from Chandel district.The JAC of Sadar Hills was infuriated at chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh's alleged failure to fulfil his promise of creating the district on November 1, the day the annual Kut festival of the Kuki community is celebrated.The JAC had even constructed a foundation stone to mark the district's inauguration. Angered by Ibobi Singh's ""betrayal"", the JAC asked Congress members of the autonomous district council in Sadar Hills to resign from the party immediately. It also asked all district and block-level Congress workers from Sadar Hills to resign by tomorrow.Officials of the Union home ministry held talks with a UNC delegation in New Delhi on Tuesday on the blockade. The meeting could not arrive at a consensus as no representative of the Manipur government was present.Ibobi Singh had clarified that no representative was sent as the home ministry did not send any invitation.Official sources said the state government is planning to restore the supply mostly on the Imphal-Jiribam highway by providing enough security escorts."

The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has sent back trucks bringing in the Indore and Agra variety potatoes.Yes, potato arrivals from outside the State were stopped today and we are sending back such stocks, said B.M. Srinivasa, Joint Director, Department of Agricultural Marketing and Secretary of APMC, Belagavi.The decision was taken when farmers prevented unloading of potatoes from trucks that had arrived from other States and also organised a rasta roko agitation on the APMC Road for nearly four hours. They withdrew their protest only after Mr. Srinivasa announced during closing office hours that potato arrivals from other States have been stopped at the APMC yard.Speaking for the agitating growers, P.L. Kadam Patil, Raju Bapu Shanbag and Shankar Basavanni Desai said that Belagavi taluk was a major potato growing area in North Karnataka. It is known for its red-skinned potato variety with better taste than the other varieties. The potato harvesting season was at its peak now and daily arrivals of huge stocks from Agra, Chennai, Delhi, Indore and also from Hassan and Chikkamagaluru have directly impacted prices, which have crashed by at least 50 per cent. The present prices for local variety is Rs. 1,000 per quintal and Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,200 per quintal for other varieties at the APMC.They said that normally 2,000 quintals of the native variety of potatoes land from different villages of Belagavi taluk at the APMC on non-market days. Wednesdays and Saturdays, the market days, witness double the quantity."

Seen here are farmers at the agro produces market in Mosale Hosahalli of Hassan taluk. PHOTO: PRAKASH HASSANWhile urban areas in the State are adapting themselves to the changed scenario after the demonetisation of high-value notes, rural areas, especially farmers, continue to be under duress even 50 days after demonetisation.With no improvement in cash flow in villages, there are no takers for farmers produce.The fall in demand has triggered a drop in prices of agricultural produce.In Hassan district, many farmers have kept their stocks of potato, maize, ginger, and other crops as there are no buyers.As those who harvested potato in September/October got Rs. 16 a kg, the farmers who were harvesting the produce in November/December were hoping for a further increase in prices. But, much to their dismay, prices have crashed to Rs. 10 a kg.In this situation, many have not sold their produce. Three truckloads of potato have remained unsold in our village, said Papaiah, a farmer from Marenahalli near Mosale Hosahalli in Hassan taluk. But the stock has started to perish forcing some of them to sell at Rs. 4 a kg. The case of maize growers is no different. The price of maize has dropped to Rs. 1,300-1,400 a quintal from the level of Rs. 1,600-1,700 before demonetisation. Also, farmers have to bear transportation cost as traders have stopped farm-gate purchases after demonetisation in most of the areas.The coffee growers are also hit as demonetisation has coincided with the harvest season. A coffee planter with 25 acres of plantation needs to pay wages of about Rs. 45,000 a week as he hires about 25 labourers. But, one can only withdraw a maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week from the banks, say planters.U.M. Thirthamallesh, secretary of the Karnataka Coffee Growers Federation, says, Because of the cash crisis, planters are hiring less number of workers this year, resulting in delayed picking, which may affect the quality of coffee beans, besides harming the plants in the long run. In northern districts like Kalaburagi, farm labourers have started demanding a part of the harvested produce as their wages instead of accepting money, as several landlords are trying to give them old currency notes.What has added to the woes of farmers is that most of the ATMs in rural areas have remained closed due to paucity of cash."

File PHOTOVegetable farmers in Punjab and Haryana are going through yet another period of hardship as the wholesale price of the seasonal crops has hit the rock bottom, forcing farmers into distress sale.Farmers and officials told The Hindu that with the harvesting season picking up, the supply of green peas, cauliflower, potato, carrot and tomatoes had increased. But the demand is subdued because of the poor cash availability.Farmers have not been able to recover even the production cost.At the Amritsar vegetable market, price of green peas on Moday was down to Rs. 4 a kg, well below the production cost of Rs. 6 a kg. Farmers blamed the poor returns on the increased supply and demonetisation.Cash crunch impactGreen pea prices are so low that I wont even recover the input cost , said Jagbir Singh Maan, a farmer from Manawal Kalan in Amritsar. He said traders were offering low prices, citing subdued demand and the cash crunch post-demonetisation.In the fruit and vegetable market in Chandigarh, the wholesale prices of fresh vegetables have slumped because of the rise in supply and low demand.Rajinder Kumar, secretary of the Chandigarh Market Committee, said in the past week, potato prices ruled at Rs. 5-10 a kilogram. I have been supplying vegetables in bulk to hotels in Chandigarh, but since demonetisation, the orders have gone down by 30 per cent, said Deepak Dhawan, who is a commission agent in the Chandigarh market.The wholesale prices of all seasonal vegetables have dropped in the past month, he said.In the Jalandhar vegetable market, potatoes fetched a paltry Rs. 2 a kg on Monday. Prices are down but I dont have any other option than selling. If I delay, the quality of the potato will deteriorate. I have to sow wheat after potato harvest, hence, Im forced to sell my crop at a poor price, though it means a heavy loss, said Jaswinder Singh, a Jalandhar potato farmer.In Haryana too, farmers are selling seasonal vegetables at throw away prices. In the Shahbad market, potato fetched Rs. 2.75 a kg, while cauliflower went for Rs. 2 a kg. I sold my potato for Rs. 2.75 a kilogram.As the prices have dropped, farmers in my village have started feeding their potatoes to their cattle to avoid buying feed, said Rakesh Bains, a farmer from Kurukshetra, who planted potato on 24 acres.Farmers have been unable to recover cost of productionas the priceshave plummeted"

Farmers are being forced to sell potato at Re 1 per kg. ""In Jinjia, farmers preserve potatoes in cold storage. But unlike previous years, huge stock of potatoes remains unsold this time,"" said peasant activist Pallab Hazarika .
