A lot of vegetables have started rotting, wholesale trader Farooq Riaz said.While the vegetable mandi is functional, onion and potato traders have decided to suspend their operation till Thursday.The problem is that we are not able to pay farmers and commission agents as there is shortage of smaller denomination notes. Farmers dont accept cheque and so operations have been suspended for a few days, Sunil Rajani, a wholesale trader said.At present, onion and potato are trading at Rs 8 per kg but prices might increase in the coming days.Around 100-125 truck carrying about 30,000-35,000 bags of onions come to Choithram mandi daily. Their local consumption is about 20% while the rest is sent to nearby areas. Some traders are giving vegetable to vendors on credit, but such operations are limited. Commission agents said while farmers were bringing their produce to the market there was no cash to pay them.To tackle corruption, tax evasion and uncover undeclared wealth the Prime Minister on Tuesday demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes."

58f0fa31a3d24b3489ce64dd,Linking food and nutrition security,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Linking-food-and-nutrition-security/article16217399.ece,2016-11-08,"The euphoria around the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, seems to have dwindled. As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

Several unregistered farmers (more than 1,000) are also growing the tuber, the sources said.The farmers are being provided financial assistance under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to grow potatoes. The directorate purchased seeds from the National Seeds Corporation Limited (NSCL) and distributed them among the farmers at a subsidized rate.""Farmers of three tribal-dominated districts, Kandhamal, Koraput and Mayurbhanj, grow potato during kharif season as the soil and climatic conditions are conducive for it. The crop is grown during the rabi season in other areas,"" said director of horticulture Susanta Nanda.The sources said sub-standards seeds from NSCL led to crop loss in Kandhamal last kharif season.Altogether, 497 farmers of around 100 villages in Daringbadi and Tumudibandh blocks had cultivated tuber on 137 acres on an experimental basis under the mission. The government sanctioned Rs 23,100 per hectare after the farmers demanded compensation for crop loss.Since absence of storage facility has been a concern for farmers, the government has decided to set up 46 cold storages. ""At present, there are 27 cold storages and construction of 15 others has begun,"" said Nanda. Odisha produces 2.5 lakh MT of potato annually against a demand of around 10 lakh MT."

To prepare healthy menu for the canteen, schools have been asked to form school canteen management committees (SCMC) comprising teachers, parents, students or canteen operator in each school.CBSE secretary Joseph Emmanuel, in a circular issued to all the affiliate schools, said, ""Consumption of food high in fat, salt and sugar has been found to be associated with many diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation and hyperinsulinemia with a risk of cardiovascular diseases in later life.""""In this context, the the ministry of women and child development (MWCD) constituted a working group which submitted its report on addressing consumption of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS).

The committee will coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food available to students in the school, said Emmanuel.The board has also asked the schools to design physical activity programs for students taking into account age, climatic and other environmental conditions. He said there should be at least around 45 minutes of physical activities or games period for classes I to X every day. For classes XI and XII, schools should ensure that all the students participate in physical activity, games or yoga with maximum health benefits for at least two periods per week."

The fuel and power fell 9.2% year-on-year in December reflecting the sharp decline in global crude oil prices. But the increase in food inflation stood out.In December food inflation rose an annual 8.2%, rising from November's 5.2% largely driven by a sharp spike in price of pulses which rose 55.6% year-on-year in last month. Prices of vegetables also firmed up rising an annual 20.6% during the month, while onion prices shot up an annual 26%. Potato prices fell nearly 35% year-on-year during December.Data released earlier this week showed retail prices inched for the fifth consecutive week in December to an annual 5.6% compared to the previous month's 5.4% increase. The government revised the reading for October to a decline of 3.7% compared to the previously reported number of a contraction of 3.8% Economists said the rise in food inflation was a worry and need to be watched. The RBI has also said that food prices need to be watched to assess the impact of patch monsoon rains on the farm sector. ""The considerably steeper increase in food inflation at the wholesale level than at the retail level in December 2015 poses some concern,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist at ratings agency ICRA.She said on a sequential basis, food prices displayed a disparate trend in December 2015, hardening at the wholesale level by 0.6% and softening at the retail level by 1.0%. Nayar said the month-on-month uptick in wholesale food prices in December 2015 may be a pre-cursor to a similar trend at the retail level in the ongoing month. ""With the contraction in industrial output in November 2015 largely attributable to a one-off base effect and the hardening of retail and wholesale inflation in December 2015, we continue to expect the RBI to pause until the fiscal targets for 2016-17 are revealed in the Union Budget,"" said Nayar."

Though many prominent schools in the city started health food awareness among students even before the board directive, they will now strictly implement the guidelines.Welcoming the board's decision, the CBSE schools in Bokaro are taking steps to ensure that vendors outside the premises too do not sell unhealthy food. The circular lays down that no HFSS food must be available in school canteens and, if possible, necessary steps must be taken to ensure non-availability of HFSS within 200-metre radius of the campus.Ashok Singh, principal of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, said they have already circulated the food chart among students ""with the slogan 'Eat healthy, Keep fit'"".""We encourage students to eat healthy food like roti-sabji, idli, dhokla, sprouts, salad. We are asking our teachers to share food with their students so that we know whether the guidelines are followed. If we catch someone with junk food on campus, we will call his parents and counsel them,"" said Singh.HFSS food can lead to diseases like diabetes, hypertension, chronic inflammation at an early age. On Saturday, Singh visited the shops in the vicinity of the school and requested them to stop selling unhealthy food to students.Other schools, besides Chinmaya, have also asked students not to bring chips, fried food, aerated drinks, ready-to-eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, potato fries, etc. Father Jacob Thomas, principal of MGM Higher Secondary School, said the canteen has been alerted about the new rule and a food chart will be put up inside the canteen in the next few days.Suresh Kumar, general secretary of Sardar Patel School, said, ""We have asked children to bring roti-paratha and vegetables for lunch. The students staying in hostel at Kamlapur are served rice-dal, roti and sabji.""A few schools, like Pentecostal Assembly School, which do not have canteens encourage students to bring healthy food from home.But the health drive has not impressed many students. Sunita Kumari, a student of a public school, said though eating healthy food is good, banning junk food is not right. ""Sometimes we can eat junk food for a change of taste. My parents are already strict about what I eat and now the school's instructions have given them more reasons to get stricter,"" she said.Parents have welcomed the move, but some pointed out that preparing paratha and vegetables would be time-consuming, especially for working mothers. Anjali Sinha, a resident of Sector-III/C, said her daughter is fond of junk food. ""Preparing healthy food takes time, but we can't compromise with our child's health,"" she said."

The party has already dislodged the Congress as the main opposition in this last bastion of the Left.A request from the TMC forced all private schools to remain closed on Tuesday in her honour. With a desire to expand the party base in this northeastern state, Banerjee lashed out at the BJP-ruled government at the Centre and the Left Front government in Tripura for adopting anti-people policies. Banerjee stressed she would have to build up a movement to overthrow the Marxists the way she has done in her home state ending 34 years of Left rule.Addressing a rally at Vivekananda Stadium in Agartala, Banerjee said the people of West Bengal had voted the TMC back to power with a thumping majority for its pro-people activities and development. ""I am sure, the people of Tripura have already decided to throw out the Left Front government for its anti-development stance and undemocratic activities. The Trinamool Congress will form a new government here after a year,"" the chief minister stated. She alleged that 23 years of uninterrupted LF rule in Tripura could not ensure basic healthcare and education. Hundreds of people go to Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad daily for treatment. The government, which has been pocketing public funds, does not have the right to criticise others, she said.""Agriculture, industry and manufacturing sectors are suffering from multi-phased crises resulting in unemployment and crime, which the Manik Sarkar government is yet to understand,"" pointed out the chief minister.The price of essential commodities has been sky-rocketing in Tripura and potato is being sold at Rs 40/kg. ""How can the LF government remain in power after that? They must step down immediately. They are always complaining that the Union government is depriving them. How can a democratically elected government be solely dependent on the Union government after 45 years of attaining statehood?"" she questioned.""West Bengal had to suffer 34 years Left misrule. However, in the last five years, industry and agriculture have got a boost and a large number of youths have found employment. I promised the people I would bring back the lost glory,"" she claimed.""Today I am committing to the people of Tripura that in the 2018 election, the entire West Bengal Trinamool Congress will mobilise its energy to overthrow the Left. I will come again and again. We will share the joys the woes of the people here,"" she said.Criticising the BJP, she alleged they are not interested in Tripura or West Bengal. Their target is to remain in power at the Centre. ""The BJP is not concerned about us; their target is to trigger communal tension wherever they get a chance. The Modi government is a government of the rich for the rich by the rich. It does not have any pan India stake or vision except tall talks. The Trinamool Congress is the only choice for Tripura to bring about change,"" she added. Mamata arrived here last evening and held several rounds of meeting with Trinamool Congress leaders. She left for Kolkata this afternoon along with a dozen leaders."

The government on February 13 last year decided to purchase the produce through Markfed (in seven districts) and Nafed (23 districts).While Markfed was to lift 8,500 MT, Nafed was assigned to procure 20,500 MT. Markfed opened procurement centres in six districts but closed them without purchase on the pretext that it did not find potato of specified size, the CAG said.The CAG report said the government then lowered the procurement target of Markfed to 5,500 MT in three districts (Bargarh, Balasore and Jharsuguda). However, due to delay in procurement and lack of cold storage facilities, panicked farmers were forced to sell potato outside the market yard."
