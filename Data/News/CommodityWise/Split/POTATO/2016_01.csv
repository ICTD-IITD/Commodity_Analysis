But, when he recently visited the country as part of an all-boys' four-member delegation representing India for YEP, not only did his perception change, but he gat the ""real picture"". ""People of Kazakhstan love Bollywood,"" says Damanjeet. ""They are ardent fans of Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan. During my stay, I found that people there watched Bollywood flicks dubbed in Russian.""Not only films, Damanjeet says, they also love Indian soap operas.Food, however, was also a challenge. Daman, a vegan, turned non-vegetarian there. ""The only vegetarian dish available there was boiled potato. I happily the horse meat in Kazakhstan,"" he says.For Kumudini Bhutani, a trip to Sri Lanka was something which helped her to come out of her ""comfort zone"". Kumudini says getting up at 5 in the morning, going for PT, rehearsing for cultural events for the rest of the day just to visit a country so close to her's, initially, seemed impractical. ""But after 10 days, getting the 'India' jersey and badge, and being called an 'ambassador of India', changed all that. I was the most overjoyed,"" says Kumudini, a student at MCM DAV College, Sector 36. ""We also visited Kotlawala Defence University where degrees like BTech, law, and medicine are offered. We On interacting with the cadets of the university, who too wanted to join their armed forces like us, I realized that irrespective of where you live or what language you speak, love for the motherland is a common thread that connects us all,"" she says.Bhupinder Singh, who visited Singapore as part of YEP, says he was the most impressed by 16-year-olds managing the whole tour of the NCC delegation. ""From taking care of the cadets to visits, food and everything, they were our managers. I must say that they successfully kept their tradition alive with their hospitality,"" says Singh, a second-year student pursuing BA at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26. ""Another moment of pride came when we visited a naval ship in Singapore and came to know that its first chief was a sikh,"" says Bhupinder.Jannat Chatwal visted Bhutan as part of the delegation under YEP. She says that being happy is what Indians must learn from Bhutan. ""We also visited the Taktasang Palphug monastery, which is accessible only by trekking. When we looked at the monastery from Paro valley, it seemed almost impossible to get there but we could trek the path and reached our destination,"" says Jannat.It was for the first time that four cadets were selected from Chandigarh to represent India under YEP. These four students were selected after they were shortlisted for the Republic Day camp held in Delhi. After a round of group discussions and interviews, the shortlisted candidates were trained in Delhi for 10 days."

Data released by the state's agriculture department shows a 39% drop in land cultivated for rabi crop this season in Saurashtra.Overall, rabi sowing is down by 1.65 lakh hectares or 14% of the 33.68 lakh hectares cultivated in 2015. North Gujarat, which relies on Narmada canals, has witnessed only a slight increase in rabi sowing - from 10.58 lakh hectares to 10.82 lakh hectares.Region-wise, sowing was poorest in Saurashtra, at only 60.68% of fields cultivated for rabi crops as compared to 2015. In Saurashtra, instead of 9.04 lakh hectares usually tilled during rabi season, this year, only 5.50 lakh hectares have been used for rabi crop cultivation. The reason, said officials, is the shortage of water in dams. Officials of the agriculture department said that usually water in the check dams lasts till early December. But this year, due to erratic rains, farmers were forced to withdraw water during August and September leaving check dams empty by mid-October.Crop choice, observed officials, have also changed and there was a 100% increase in sowing of fennel seeds, while both potato and onion - essential for the kitchen - witnessed increase in sowing. This year, 11.24 lakh hectares of land have been used for potato crops, against the 8.16 lakh hectares used on an average."

Since water for irrigation of crops and personal consumption is heavily dependent on melting of glaciers in the mountain ranges, lack fresh snow has left residents from tribal districts in a crisis like situation. Moreover the district has recorded negligible rainfall. Lahaul has a total geographical area of 9,11,195 hectares of which 3,398 hectares is used for irrigation and cultivation. Lahaul-Spiti has 521 villages that are solely dependent on natural source of water for irrigation.The only cropping season begins from April to September with minimum and maximum temperatures ranging approximately between 12C and 24C.During this season, mainly grown cash crops are peas, potato and cauliflower. Barley is grown in 403 hectares area, maize in 19 hectares, wheat in 46 hectares, potato in 747 hectares, peas in 1782 hectares while 202 hectares is used up in the districts for fruit production.A study conducted by the state rural department under integrated watershed management programme states that most of the precipitation in the district is in the form of heavy snow in winter months. Springs emanating from snow deposits are major source of surface irrigation through gravity Kuhls (water channels). These springs are both perennial and ephemeral getting recharged mainly from melting of snow on higher reaches, the study states.Rajesh Baba said ""Past experiences have shown that less snowfall results in damage to crop production"".Dinesh Kumar a resident of Goshal village said that many people cultivate off season vegetables during summer and are earning handsome income by sending exotic vegetables to markets located outside the valley. ""These vegetables need plenty of water of irrigation and considering the fact that very less snowfall has been received so far there is a big question mark over their income in coming season,"" he added.""Snow during winters provides moisture to soil. Our irrigation channels are snow fed,"" said Jai Ram Thakur a resident of Hinsa village.Agro-climatic conditions of Lahaul valley is conducive to grow several high value cash crops included off season vegetables, vegetable seeds, exotic vegetables, seed potato, hops, apple, almond, apricot, sea buckthorn etc. There are vast tracts of cultivable waste lands, if brought under irrigation, could increase the cropped area by about 20 per cent, official sources said."
58f188fca3d24b245e59b2aa,Govt fair price shops likely to sell potatoes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Govt-fair-price-shops-likely-to-sell-potatoes/articleshow/51335168.cms,2016-03-10,,The Times Of India,"CUTTACK: The district administration is considering to sell potatoes at fair price shops to provide relief to the consumers. District officials said if potato prices keep soaring, measures will be taken to counter this. ""Our officials are keeping a close watch on the situation. If necessary, we will make arrangements to sell potato at government-run fair price shops,"" said collector Nirmal Mishra.As per the direction of the state government, the district administration will also start conducting surprise raids on potato wholesalers and their godowns located at Chhatra Bazaar and Krushak Bazaar Thursday onwards to check the price rise in retail markets.When potato prices had skyrocketed in the state earlier, Cuttack was among the first few districts to start selling the vegetable at fair price shops. Besides, special teams will conduct raids on potato godowns in the city to keep a check on hoarding. Retailers will also be directed to sell the vegetable at appropriate prices.The vegetable traders' association has ruled out the possibility of hoarding in Cuttack. There are hardly 8-10 big potato wholesalers in the city. ""It is difficult for traders to hoard potatoes as we do not have well-equipped cold storages to stock the vegetables. In fact, 5-7% of the vegetables rot during transportation. So we can't risk stocking it,"" said secretary of Chhatra Bazaar vegetable traders' association, Debendra Sahoo.Sahoo said attributed the price rise to low production in West Bengal. ""This year, West Bengal's potato production has gone down by almost 30-40%,"" added Sahoo. Traders in Cuttack import potato from West Bengal. On Tuesday, the wholesale price of a kg of potato was Rs 13 while it was sold in the retail market at Rs 16 to Rs 18."
58f18913a3d24b245e59b2c9,Making of the other Miss India,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Making-of-the-other-Miss-India/articleshow/51477225.cms,2016-03-20,,The Times Of India,"In Roha, a Maharashtra town where undernourished men travel in threes on motorbikes, there is a gym exclusively for women. But the pair of remarkable upper arms that Neeta Shingur spotted at a beauty parlour on a fine March morning had come from somewhere else. ""A very tall woman came in with lovely, long hair and..."" trails off Shingur, pointing to her frail biceps and raising her brows. Shingur is referring to Shweta Rathore, a leggy 25-year-old engineer from Mumbai who has travelled over 100 kms, along with her equally muscular brother Saurabh and a suitcase containing spray tans, sports bras and sweet potatoes, to claim the title of Miss India (sports physique) once again.As a segment within the 9th National Body Building Championship 2016, this Miss India contest falls somewhere between pageant and spectator sport. Though it promises bronzed, two-piece-clad women in high heels, it does not come with the weight of tiaras or questions on world peace. Here, beauty figures only after agility, flexibility, muscle tone and strength. Three years ago, the Indian Body Building Federation (IBBF) introduced 'Women's Sports Physique' for lean women who didn't want to boast either the muscularity of bodybuilders or the feather-weight frivolity of models.The winner gets a trophy that looks like a jubilant version of the Filmfare lady and a sum of Rs 50,000. But for Rathore, it is the title that matters. If she wins, the engineer, who has over 1 lakh followers on Instagram, will inch closer to her dream of becoming a fitness celebrity. Right now, ""Indians confuse thin with lean,"" says Rathore, who plans to groom physique athletes after the contest. ""Indians are blessed with strong genes but lack knowledge about fitness and body transformation,"" adds Rathore. This is why passers-by in Dubai compliment her while Indians look at her ""like I am an alien or something,"" says Rathore.Backstage on D-day, March 13, sporting a sparkly purple bra, sheer black skirt and a faux-diamond bracelet, Rathore is a sight to behold. Two women cops also sit inside the changing room to keep men at bay. But personal trainers, husbands, brothers and fathers stream in and out. They fish out sponges and rollers from gym bags and pat down washboard female midriffs with fake tan, dab armpits with foundation, fasten sparkly bras with safety pins and spray thighs with something that makes everyone cough.As Saurabh paints her abs mahogany, Rathore sizes up her opponents. Mumbai's Jahnavi Pandav, mother of a nine-year-old, is doing push-ups against a chair in a leopard-print bra and skirt while Delhi's Ginnie Jogia Chugh, a writer, is practising the four poses they are judged on. Internationally, women bodybuilders and fitness physique models are supposed to wear bikinis. ""But keeping the society and culture in mind, we ask them to wear sports bras and shorts,"" says Chetan Pathare, secretary of IBBF, who wants to take the sport to small towns.In fact, the changing room also boasts small-town teens like Pandel's spunky Soniya Mitra who says her costumes do not define her and Kharagpur's Shreyasee Das Chowdhury who was introduced to the sport by her father, Ranajeet, a yoga and gymnastics coach. Contestants also have to execute a choreographed 10-second routine. This is what made Sunita Vishwakarma, a 28-year-old from Chhattisgarh, opt for the ''bodybuilding'' category instead. ""I didn't want to dance,"" she says.The segment, say officials, helps attract women spectators. ""Earlier we would see only two to three women in the audience. These too were relatives of the male bodybuilders,"" says an IBBF official. Things have changed now. After four hours of watching beefy men with serial numbers dangling on their crotch, an announcement of the ladies' event makes a bunch of boys return to their seats. Their hormonal reactions seem to elicit the announcement that follows: ""Rohekars respect our sisters as much as our brothers."" The crowd is never undignified though, says an IBBF official.The preparation requires several sacrifices from the models. Two days before the event, Rathore excused herself to put on sunglasses mid-conversation. Skimping on water for over 24 hours was making her head swirl. ""I need my body to look sharp,"" said Rathore, adding that water would round off her carefully-cultivated edges. Her veins won't pop, her muscle cuts won't look ""sharp"" and her ""conditioning""  developed through a rigorous routine of cardio, weight training and strict diet  won't show. As someone who has won Miss Mumbai 2015 and Miss Maharashtra 2016, besides Miss World 2014 and Miss Asia 2015, in the fitness physique category, Rathore comes with a lot of experience.When it's showtime, 'Saare Jahan se Accha' plays in the background as the ten contestants line up on stage. For the choreographed routine, the other contestants step on the riser (elevated part of the stage), but Rathore walks right up to the front of the ramp. She waves with aplomb, poses, and when asked to relax, does it with a flourish. It pays off. After she is declared Miss India (sports physique) 2016, Rathore hits the backstage and empties two bottles of cold water."

We have urged them to allow central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to export onions under the Price Stability Funds, which has been set up by the Centre to stabilise prices of select commodities like onion and potatoes in the country. The government will bear losses, if incurred, during export, but on the contrary, profit will also be added into the PCF account.""The source added, ""The government will give onion export target of 10 lakh metric tonnes to both Nafed and SFAC, which will help stabilise prices and save farmers from incurring losses.""Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop are harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six-seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them in the hope of getting better prices later. Onions arriving in the market are four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting. Farmers have huge stocks of onions, but prices have declined a lot and they are unable to manage to obtain even the production cost. It costs Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions, but farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. Now, onion prices have declined in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal, causing farmers to incur heavy losses.During the last financial year 2015-16, the government introduced PSF for onions, potatoes and other crops with provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget. Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 metric tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and SFAC. But the scarcity had compelled the government to import 10,000 metric tonnes through MMTC Ltd to meet the domestic requirement last year. For 2016-17, the Centre has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF. This year, the government has already created a buffer stock of 15,000 metric tonnes so far through Nafed and SFAC.Meanwhile, the ministry of commerce has decided to give a grant of %5 on onion export, but pitching Nafed and SFAC for export of onions will help stabilise prices in the country."

Also, the cash recovered from inside jail was Rs88,850 in 2014 and Rs69,500 in 2015.From Dahod sub-jail, only three mobiles, one charger and one sim card was recovered. It is worth recalling that recently a mobile was recovered from the cell of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti convener, Hardik Patel, who is lodged in Surat jail.Not long ago, in December 2013, jail authorities had discovered a 213-ft-long tunnel dug by accused in the serial blast case. The recovery of such equipment once again from inside jail premises raises serious security concerns, when the government claims CCTV and cell phone signal jammers have been installed in prisons."

As agents in other market yards of the state were on a strike since last three days, those in Nagpur joined them on Wednesday. By that time a truce was struck. The agitation was against government's move to free vegetables and fruits from monopoly of market yards. The indefinite strike is now called off for a month.The showdown led to prices of potatoes jump to Rs22 a kg from Rs17 in the bulk market. Onions also touched Rs13 a kg from Rs 9. Rates of other vegetables jumped 25% to 30%, bringing many items in the range of Rs40 to Rs60 a kg. There was no impact on fruit prices, though there is a major presence of agents dealing in fruits at Kalamna. Rates of foodgrains also remained stable as supply at market yards is minimal during this season. Even though the new rule covered only fruits and vegetables, agents dealing in grains at Kalamna also joined the strike.The market yards are managed by an elected Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Till now it was mandatory to bring the produce to designated market yards and commission agents played an important role in the system.This is how business happens in an APMC. Suppose farmer turns up with 50 bags of onions, he will contact a commission agent. As would the prospective buyers. The agent then arranges an open auction which is monitored by APMC officials. After the deal is struck, the farmer gets his money through the agent who pays from his pocket and offers credit to the buyer. The agent deducts a commission in turn. Some times, farmers leave their produce with the agents with directions to sell only at a specific rate. The agents also offer farmers an advance even before produce is sold.The new rules bar agents from charging commission from farmers. Instead they have to take it from the trader buying the produce. The farmer is also free to sell the produce even out of APMC. ""This can have a major impact on our business. The government is freeing farmers from APMC but the agents are still bound there. Commission is deducted from farmers' payment as a charge of services provided by us,"" said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director in APMC Kalamna representing the commission agents.""The agents provide farmers with ready cash. The money is paid to farmers and recovered from trader after nearly a month. Some times the trader defaults but the agent ensures the farmer gets his money,"" said Jaiprakash Wasani, an agent agent dealing in onions and potatoes. Chabirram, a potato grower from Mainpuri who brought his produce to Kalamna, said ""we trust the agents as they pay in cash. Will the trader do it too in the new system?""""After the recent negotiation after which the strike was called off, it was proposed to free even the agents from APMC. So in the future there may be no auction. The agents may also directly buy farm produce from even out of APMC yards and sell it directly to traders,"" said Chhabrani. A final decision is expected a month later.Kishore Tiwari, director of Vasantrao Naik Swavalamban Mission, a state government task force on farmers, said the move only diverted attention from the core issue. This would help less than 1% of farmers as a majority of them would still sell through APMCs. The real benefit will be there if the reforms also covered foodgrains and cash crops, he said.In a nutshell* State government has ended monopoly of APMC yards* Farmers free to sell produce anywhere* Agents dealing in APMC yards see red, and announce indefinite strike* Those in Nagpur joined on Wednesday. Others on strike since three days* Agents have struck a truce with government, strike called off for a month* Government may allow even agents to buy produce anywhere* A day's strike leads to moderate increase in rates of vegetables* The reforms only cover vegetables and fruits"

The horticultural department attributes this to the introduction of high-yield hybrid variety seeds in the past few years.Five years ago, the total production of all the varieties of hill-grown vegetables in the Nilgiris stood at approximately 1.4 lakh metric tonnes. However, now the production has increased by 20% to 25% per annum and accounts for 1.72 lakh metric tonnes.""The horticulture department has introduced hybrid and high-yield varieties of vegetables, including carrot, beetroot, cabbage and potato in the past five years. Now, we can see a significant increase in productivity,"" N Mani, joint director, horticulture department told TOI. ""Nevertheless, the area for vegetable cultivation remains the same.""While high-yield varieties of potatoes like 'Kufri Gridhari' and 'Kufri Jothi' and 'Kufri Swarna' have been introduced to the farmers, hybrid varieties of carrot, beetroot and cabbage have also yielded good results for the farmers.""As far as beans is concerned, the native varieties are giving good yield and have good market support"", said Mani.There are over 70,300 farming families in the hill district who are cultivating vegetables on around 6,600 hectares of land.Earlier farmers used to go for two-three crops of vegetables in a year. But now, they go for four crops in one year.The department also renders the facility of micro irrigation system at 100% subsidy scheme, besides other subsidy schemes for vegetable cultivation. ""Hence, the farmers need not worry about monsoon failure, if at all it occurs,"" said Mani.C Sivalingam, a farmer in Ooty told TOI, ""The subsidies, rendered by the horticulture department are certainly encouraging the farmers. We see more yield per hectare with hybrid vegetables like carrot, beetroot and cabbage"".According to records, around 900 hectares of farming land, which was left without cultivation in the past, has come under active farming land as subsidies and hybrid and high yield varieties of vegetables attract the farmers.Recently Nilgiris collector P Sankar conducted an inspection tour to various farming lands in the district.He said, ""Agriculture and tourism are the backbones of the district. With increase in vegetable productivity, the district foresees a brighter future."""

""I have handed over the resignation letter to the CM.Though I'm yet see the vigilance court directive, I'm resigning from the post on moral grounds. I had said earlier that I would never cling on to the post citing technicalities if any court makes remarks against me... I hope the CM will accept my resignation,"" Babu said at a news conference in Kochi.Babu made his announcement after a closed-door meeting with Oommen Chandy and senior Congress leaders in Ernakulam.Sources said KPCC president VM Sudheeran's statement that the party considered the court directive very seriously, and that an appropriate decision would be taken soon, prompted Babu's quick response. Chandy, whose known confidant Babu is, speaking later in Kottayam acknowledged receipt of the resignation letter but said he will take a decision only after studying the vigilance court verdict and holding discussions with his colleagues.There might be worse to come. Bar Hotel Owners' Association working president Biju Ramesh threatened to reveal names of more ministers who accepted bribes from bar owners but only once the dates of assembly elections are declared.This, he explained, was not only to ensure that the electorate would punish them accordingly but also to minimise the incumbent government's ability to save its tainted ministers.Earlier in the day, in a scathing attack on the vigilance department for ineffective handling of the probe against the minister, vigilance inquiry commissioner and special judge S S Vasan directed VACB to submit a progress report on the probe by February 22.He also made it clear that the new probe should be a court-monitored inquiry as per the 2008 order of the Supreme Court. In his order, the judge recalled that Quick Verification Report (QVR) order was issued on December 9, 2015, and ""no result worth the name has come out after a lapse of one and a half months ... Considering the circumstances, I find that investigation has to be monitored by this court.""The inquiry has been ordered based on a complaint filed by social activist George Vattukulam. As per his complaint, Biju Ramesh had alleged that Babu had demanded Rs 10 crore as bribe from bar owners for reopening bars after the state government had decided to close them down.Biju Ramesh had also stated publicly that bar owners had paid Rs 50 lakh as advance to the excise minister on October 31 last. The judge has ordered filing of FIR against Biju Ramesh too since offering bribe is as culpable as accepting it.Claiming that there was no pressure on him to resign from any quarter, Babu dared LDF to make it clear they will not reopen the 730 closed bars.""Can the LDF announce in their election manifesto that they would not reopen the closed bars,"" he asked.Babu also alleged that he was `victim' of a conspiracy between bar owners and CPM leaders, particularly its state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.CPM leaders rebut conspiracy angleK Babu on Saturday said it was CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan who conspired against him with bar hotel owners. In a press conference held in Kochi, the outgoing minister said Kodiyeri held a meeting with five bar owners on December 15, 2015, at 7pm at the house of CPM MLA Sivankutty in Thiruvananthapuram.According to Babu, Kodiyeri demanded bar owners to drag the names of a few more ministers so as to topple the UDF government. Biju Ramesh's allegations were a result of this conspiracy, Babu said. Meanwhile, Kodiyeri and other CPM leaders including V S Achuthanandan and Pinarayi Vijayan dismissed Babu's allegations."

The presence of large number of students and their involvement in various activities, something very unusual for a government school, has led to parents making a beeline to get their children and wards enrolled here.While the state government made every bit effort to get maximum number of children enrolled in schools every year in June, the Kanya Shala number 4, located in one of the economically backward locality of Junagadh, hardly needs to make any efforts. All thanks to the innovative method of teaching introduced by its principal, Tarun Katbamna (32), parents are shifting their kids from private schools to this government one. In the last three years, 234 children from private schools have shifted to this school.""This year alone, 70 students from different schools have got admission in classes II to VII. Thirty of these students have shifted from private schools,"" said Katbamna. It took him three years to change the perception of the people and improve the quality of education with innovative methods.""When I was appointed principal in 2012, the attitude of parents towards the school was very bad. Students hardly attended schools regularly, especially on Saturday as they need to wake up in the morning. So, I started showing them feature films on large screen to attract them on Saturdays,"" said Katbamna about his techniques to get the attention of children.""I used to show the film for 15 minutes and next part was to be shown next Saturday. So, curious students came to see the film. However, there were still some students who did not attend the school,"" he said.Katbamna said, then we started 'Janta Raids' where he would go to children's home and pick them up from their beds and bring them to school. ""The methods may have been harsh but people saw our commitment for their children's education and their attitude towards government school changed,"" said Katbamna.Another problem faced by Katbamna after he took charge was the habit of school children eating packaged food including potato chips and other fried items. ""The first thing we did was to ban packaged food items. Then, we started our own 'Nasta house' (snack house) where we give snacks to students at nominal rates. We give snacks which are healthy. It also includes seasonal fruits. It solved two problems. Campus became free of plastic and school earned Rs 12,000 per annum by selling snacks. We decided to use the money for children and purchased 425 stainless steel lunch boxes. These were distributed among school children,"" said the 32-year-old principal.""Our first priority was to increase the number of students attending the school and ensure that they remain there,"" he added. To hold the attention of children and improve their writing skills, Katbamna learnt calligraphy.""I take classes on basic calligraphy to improve writing skills of kids. Parents are very impressed by the results of the activity. It helped in developing self-confidence. Now, parents of kids are our ambassadors and they tell others about the school,"" said Katbamna proudly.""My son Dev was studying in a private school till class VI. But last year, I shifted him to government school as I saw that he was feeling stressed. He is now happy here.,"" says Lata Devchandani, Dev's mother."

While a kilo of tomatoes was sold for Rs 60 at the Rythu Bazars on Tuesday, the price of the same commodity was between Rs 80 and Rs 100 in the open markets.Also, the available tomatoes were not of good quality, complained consumers.Officials attributed the sudden rise of tomato prices to sluggish supply from Madanapalli market in Chittoor district, where crops were damaged due to unseasonal rains and heat during the last few months.Confirming this to TOI, a Rythu Bazar estate officer G Prasad said until May-end, a kilo of tomatoes was sold at Rs 10. In the span of just two weeks, the prices rose to Rs 60 in Rythu Bazars.""Vizag daily gets tomatoes in seven lorries of 16-tonne capacity from Madanapalli. But now, we are receiving two lorries.

In 1992 too, he did not run to the government for financial assistance like most NGOs.He had a unique experiment in mind. Over the last quarter of a century, he has executed it with finesse.Samanta started the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), which today enrols over 25,000 students. Ten per cent of the fee paid by KIIT students goes for managing the 25,000 KISS students. All employees, including faculty, contribute 3% of their salary for KISS, which runs up a daily expense bill of over Rs 50 lakh.The completely mechanised and carbon footprint-conscious KISS kitchen is an eye-opener. Every day, it consumes 7,500 kg of rice, 2,200 kg of dal, 7,200 kg of vegetables and potato, 25,000 eggs, 2,800 kg of chicken and 600 kg of fish to provide lunch and dinner to 25,000 children. The breakfast is mostly pounded rice, cornflakes, curd and milk.The kitchen uses solar power and recycles the waste as fertiliser for its gardens. It recycles treated water, used for washing hands and utensils, as well as water that flows out of bathrooms, to irrigate its plants.The children take time to overcome the cultural gap they experience in the state capital after travelling miles from their remote tribal hamlets. But good food, proper environment, coaching and opportunity makes them shed their inhibitions and unveil their potential.One such example, the rugby team comprising tribal children, defeated teams from Zambia, Romania, Switzerland and Kenya before beating South Africa in the final to clinch the Under-14 World Rugby championships in 2007.Many have excelled in different fields. But their potential in sports remains the bright spot.Manjula, a girl from the 'Lanji Saura' tribe, has played netball up to Commonwealth Games level, while a 'Sabara' tribe girl, Bhagyashree, is the pride of KISS having represented India at the Asian Games six years ago in China. It is a story of getting ins- pired to inspire others.Samanta is modest about his single-handed contribution to society, specially the poor and underprivileged tribals. He remembers his difficult days as a child and the 1990s when he was giving shape to KIIT and KISS liter- ally brick by brick.""Many large-hearted persons extended help to me in my childhood and those initial difficult days of KISS. I am just contributing back to society. It gives me immense inner satisfaction to find so many children from tribal households getting proper education and motivation to be able to open the windows of opportunity all by themselves. What delights me most is that many of these children after completing their education from KISS or KIIT are going back to their villages to spread education,"" Samanta told TOI.Samanta plans to open KISS in every tribal district of Odisha and other states. ""It will be difficult to sustain the KIIT and KISS model in other states. We will need funds through corporate social responsibility,"" he said."

""This has given away the clear failure of government policies and programmes announced to deal with crisis,"" said Benudhar Samal, a bank employee.Sources have revealed potato production has dropped by 20-30% across India this year, leading to a price rise in the major potato-producing state, West Bengal, from where Odisha imports a major portion of its needs.

They survive on margins after paying transportation costs and taking the produce to wholesale markets closer to the city.Prabhat Kumar Das, the organising secretary of the Federation of Traders' Organisation and member of the chief minister's task force on price of edibles, admits that presence of several layers of aggregators in the supply is spiralling up the prices.""In Koley Market which is the biggest wholesale hub for vegetables, there are two to three layers of middlemen. The profit that each aggregator makes gets added to the cost price. The end consumers have to bear the price brunt,"" said Das.To unearth the reason behind the unusual spike in the prices of some vegetables, TOI visited a pocket in Hooghly from where vegetables come to the city through a complex chain of aggregators and wholesalers.Panna Lal Mondal, a small farmer in Baganbati, 60 kilometres from Kolkata, refuses to believe what he just heard.The ladies finger (dharosh) Mondal grows in his six cottahs fetched him only Re 1 per kilogram last week but shoppers in Kolkata are paying between Rs 20 and Rs 24for the same vegetable.""It's unbelievable,"" the 58-year-old farmer exclaimed in dismay, told about the skyrocketing prices in the last-mile markets in the past few weeks.In the neighbouring village of Nalikul, the ribbed gourd that Sujit Samanta harvested in his 11 cottah land has fetched him only Rs 4 per kilogram. In Kolkata, the vegetable is selling for anything between Rs 22 and Rs 26.""When we go to the markets to sell our produce, the middlemen refuse to buy saying that there is no demand in Kolkata. They buy them dirt chap but make a fat profit selling in Kolkata,' said Samanta, 62.If the movement of price from one market to the next is tracked, it is evident that the price tends to double with each change of hands. The uniformity  doubling at each stage  is an intriguing factor as the costs involved at each stage are different.A rise in the price to some extent is inevitable because of the distance and the number of intermediaries involved. But a 1900 per cent spurt (from Re 1 to Rs 20 in case of ladies finger ) suggests profiteering by a section of middlemen who control the supply chain of vegetables from farm to food plates."

58f2082aa3d24b245e59e54b,Golf: Willett apologizes for brother's rant ripping US fans,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/golf/top-stories/Golf-Willett-apologizes-for-brothers-rant-ripping-US-fans/articleshow/54574210.cms,2016-09-29,,The Times Of India,"Chaska, United States, Sept 28, 2016 (AFP) -A controversial commentary insulting US Ryder Cup supporters written by the brother of Masters champion Danny Willett prompted an apology Wednesday from the Englishman making his Europe team debut.Pete Willett, writing for the website NationalClubGolfer.com, described American fans as ""those fat, stupid, greedy, classless bastards.""Another section under the sub-heading ""Bastards"" alluded to ""the type of golfer that's a vice-captain for Team USA.""Calling US supporters a ""baying mob of imbeciles"" and ""a giggling group of reprobates,"" he added, ""Team Europe needs to shut those groupies up.""They need to silence the pudgy, basement-dwelling irritants, stuffed on cookie dough and pissy beer, pausing between mouthfuls of hotdog so they can scream 'Baba booey' until their jelly faces turn red.""They need to stun the angry, unwashed, Make America Great Again swarm, desperately gripping their concealed-carry compensators and belting out a mini-erection inducing 'mashed potato,' hoping to impress their cousin.""They need to smash the obnoxious dads, with their shiny teeth, Lego man hair, medicated ex-wives, and resentful children. Squeezed into their cargo shorts and boating shoes, they'll bellow 'get in the hole' whilst high-fiving all the other members of the Dentists' Big Game Hunt Society.""After the venom flowed, it was Willett the major winner who was hailed last April at Augusta National, becoming his brother's peacekeeper.""I would just like to apologize obviously to everyone involved for what has been said. It's obviously not the thoughts of myself and of the team,"" Willett said. ""I spoke to (Pete) on the phone after I was made aware of what was said. And I said to Pete that I was obviously disappointed in what was said and written about the American fans that obviously took me under their wing fantastically back in April.""Willett met with US captain Davis Love after his practice round to apologize.""Me and Davis had a chat for a few minutes about it all and he took it very well."" Danny Willett said. ""I think he's drawn a line under it obviously for himself and for the team. So hopefully everyone else can do the same and we can get on and have a great tournament.""It will be the reactions of US spectators, beer and hot dog fueling optional, in their actions toward Willett and his teammates that determine the fallout from the mess.""Everyone that plays in this team plays in America most weeks,"" Willett said. ""It was tough then to kind of get your head around everything. You wanted to get off the golf course and hopefully get it sorted, draw a line under it and get back to what we're doing.""- Love 'ignored the noise' -US captain Davis Love said he ""ignored the noise"" by not reading the story.""If I read it, I'm just going to get mad,"" Love said. ""So I just try to ignore it.""He noted US crowds have been loud already, saying, ""It's four holes into a practice round and they are cheering and screaming. Just wait till Friday when it's for real.""Europe captain Darren Clarke called Pete Willett's comments ""bitterly disappointing.""""It is not what Danny thinks. It is not what I think. It is not what Team Europe stands for,"" Clarke said. ""The article was beyond our control.""Spectators that Clarke has praised for days could turn 18 holes into a nightmare gauntlet for Europe.""That's not the way that we view things,"" Clarke said. ""The fans could not have been nicer and better to us this week, and hopefully that continues.""- 'Hard-fought but fair' -Gamesmanship and other issues arose as well Wednesday, with Love and Clarke having settled some. Pin placements are done by the PGA of America.""We were going to get out of the business of the home team setting the pins and the other team not knowing,"" Love said. ""It has been a more fair way to handle it.""As for mental moves between match rivals, Love said, ""Letting a guy putt out a couple times, things like that, that's part of match play and a lot of it's done with a wink and a jab. We play golf together all the time. We're friends and we compete against each other.""It will be hard-fought but fairly fought.""js/rcw"

And, he is aware how tough it is going to be. As the Samajwadi Party looks up to him to deliver, like he did in 2012 by ensuring a landslide victory, Akhilesh Yadav seems confident of taking on all adversities  from his apprehension of BJP causing trouble ahead of polls to charges of breakdown in law and order. Asked if presence of heavyweights in his party is a worry, he tells Swati Mathur...The 2017 assembly election in UP will be big, and you will be at the centre of it. What will be your election slogan?It is difficult to say right now. In 2012, we started an ad campaign without a slogan, just a video showing a cycle overtaking an elephant. Then we came up with 'Ummeed Ki Cycle' and went to the people. In four years since I took charge, our work is now visible. We have moved to 'Ummeedon Ka Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh' and 'Roz Naye Kadam' to highlight the things we have done beyond our manifesto promises.I believe people want to see what we can offer them. We have instilled confidence in democratic principles, and given them faith that we will deliver.But law and order remains a sticking point.This is a lie, an easy tool to attack the Samajwadi Party government with. There are some incidents that cannot be stopped. I am deeply sorry about what happened in Bulandshahr. The incident occurred on a busy highway and no one noticed. We caught the gang and we took immediate action. While the Bulandshahr incident is unfortunate, two medical supervisors sexually assaulting a woman employee in a Gurgaon hospital is as bad. This was never highlighted the way the Bulandshahr incident was. I only ask this: Is a hospital safe or is a highway? People just do politics over incidents.No one doubts your focus on development, but there is still a perception that your party is not aligned with you fully, and that it is still an unruly lot.There used to be talk about how UP has four-and-a-half CMs. Those who highlighted this the most are now unable to find a chief ministerial face for their own party. My thought is: everyone should contest, work hard, and fight well. SP will be in a contest with different parties in different constituencies. But I can safely say SP will be in the contest across UP. We have good organisational strength.Is there a possibility of a gathbandhan?We have a lot of work to show on the ground. It makes no sense for us to tie up with anyone, before or after the polls. We are confident that we will form the government again. We will only do better if we get another term.Both BJP and you may face someanti-incumbency. Do you think that gives the BSP an advantage?During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, our anti-incumbency was not very high. We maintained status quo on our vote share. But the floating vote went to BJP, and we lost badly. Now, everything is clear. An assessment of booth and constituency level results shows BJP got between 40,000 and 1 lakh or more votes in some places. This vote will shift again. Where it moves is crucial. My understanding is that people want a progressive government and they want development. This is separate from caste, region and religion.Your father has publicly scolded you on many occasions. Does that sometimes hurt you?No, not at all. I have said this many times  he is the same man to me at home that he is outside. I don't know what other fathers must be like. In the case of Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav), what's in his heart is what he is outside.What do you discuss at the dining table?(Laughs) We don't discuss anything. I put my kids in front by asking them to have dinner first and say I will join later. On a serious note, I think his objections, when they come, should be taken in the right spirit. If there is something wrong in the party or in the government, who else will he alert but the chief minister?Do you fear this will be a polarised, communal election?It is certainly the BJP's attempt, especially because they have no work to show. With no delivery, they cannot fight on the development plank. They began creating trouble on the issue of migration, saying that people were leaving UP out of fear. But the people of Shamli protested and the ploy went against the BJP. Then they talked of religious conversions. That failed too. They then raised the issue of cow protectionism. The PM was forced to accept this was wrong and condemn it. The PM's statement should have come a lot earlier.Do you think cow vigilantism did not matter as long as the target were Muslims? But now, with a Dalit backlash, did the PM make a statement because he feared losing Dalit votes?The Prime Minister should have made this statement and stopped cow vigilantism a long while ago. In UP, we have solved cases, and stopped cow slaughter. The BJP has even tried to polarise people on this issue. If you look at police records in UP, BJP has raked up issues across the state to cause trouble. UP government said it will impose the National Security Act on anyone carrying out cow slaughter illegally. Even then BJP workers took law into their hands, and, in the process, damaged the image of UP. Finally, they realised they were wrong.Samajwadi Party has often been charged with being the other beneficiary of religious polarisation.When Muzaffarnagar riots happened, I thought deeply about it and said it is easy to be communal but exceedingly difficult to be secular. If I am secular, I am faced with a tougher task of assuring each community that I will deliver justice equally. I am always accused of protecting burial grounds from squatters by building boundary walls. But no one talks of all that I have done for all other communities. Politics mein samjhane se nahi thoda behkaane se kaam zyada banta hai.How are your own equations with Prime Minister Modi? What is yourimpression of him?UP has suffered since the BJP came to power. We have lost financially  over Rs 10,000 crore. We sent out a letter to the Centre saying we only want what was due to us. Social sector schemes have been stopped and people are protesting. With the 7th Pay Commission and GST, states are additionally burdened.The PM wants complete control in the hands of the Centre, and that CMs should approach him, each time, with a begging bowl. If PM Modi claims that he understands the pain of being a CM, then I ask him this: We have lost Rs 10,000 crore because of the new Niti Ayog formula. How do we manage now?But your party has supported theGST bill. Yes , we have. We have made our concerns known to the Centre. We are concerned about whether there will be a protest by traders, for instance. They have no clarity on how the GST will affect them.What do you think is a good number for the GST rate? Will it be 18% or 20% or 21%?I will not say anything. Right now we are focusing on elections. This will take a long time to come to the states. I don't want to take any step, or make any statement that can get us into trouble.There is talk that you might callelections early.No, I only told them (Election Commission) I am ready if early elections are called. I want elections to be on time. It will be to my advantage because I will get more time to inaugurate all my projects.You said the SP may be fighting adifferent party in every constituency. Overall, who is this contest against, the BSP or the BJP?It depends. As on date, BSP is at number three. BJP and the BSP are both in the race for the number two spot. If the BJP had been so strong, why would they take in Swami Prasad Maurya and cobble an alliance with smaller parties in East UP? They realise they have lost ground.Before most elections, parties tend to over-promise. You may have done extra, but there may also be promises you haven't fulfilled. How do you reconcile that and go back to people?When we formed the government, I asked senior leaders why they wrote certain things in the election manifesto. They said they did not know SP would form the government. (Laughs) But now, it is the CM's responsibility to deliver on these promises. I can say we have worked in sync with the manifesto and delivered on most promises. Now, I have clarity on what the government can deliver.The BSP has a clear edge in terms of law and order perception.Perception that Mayawati maintained law and order does not mean that she was being even-handed to all. Ask government officers here; they were not able to enter the CM's house with their shoes on. They were humiliated. If law and order was so good, then how was it that BSP was reduced in numbers to such an extent in the 2012 polls? You cannot imagine the injustice done. A party president's house was burnt by BSP workers. A journalist was beaten up inside his home when he threw a party. Even I was picked up from inside the Lucknow airport where even the CISF was brushed aside. How can any of this be seen as good administration.But how do you counter this perception of poor law and order?Allegations of poor law and order and corruption can be levelled against any government. We are bringing Dial 100, the state-wide, round-the-clock police response centre. There are three key issues pertaining to law and order in UP; the first that people's complaints are not heard, that police do not respond, or came too late, and third, that FIRs are not easy to register. I am resolving each. The first point of attendance for all phone calls that are received will be women. We will ensure response time is reduced to under 15 minutes, and that FIRs are registered soon after. You will see the change soon.Law and order has two sides; the operational efficiencies you refer to, and the other side, whether there is political will to crack down on lawlessness. There have been allegations of land grab by your partymen.This charge (of lawlessness) is a very natural one levelled against SP members. I have taken action whenever anything has been brought to my notice, either verbally or through news. I have not allowed injustice. That is why when BJP workers protested outside police stations, I told them to mark a copy of their complaint to me. If you go to the police to protest about land grab and other issues, then at least give us something on which we can act, formally. I told them, when you email your complaint, mark me a CC. But they gave nothing and just screamed about the ""failing law and order.""Why do you call attacks on SP workers as lawless, ""natural""?I don't know why they got this image. I read Ram Manohar Lohia's speeches and I believe even he was referred to, in Parliament, as a 'goonda'. If it can be said about Lohia ji, the rest of us are small people. It is unfortunate.There is a charge that you patronise the Yadavs and Muslims because they are your vote bank.No, that is not true. This is a perception, and this is only the opposition's tool to attack us.Do the utterances of people like Azam Khan sometimes hurt you?No. I want to clarify one thing. When he says something, it is important to show the complete statement and the context in which it was said.Will you pick all the 403 candidates for the UP elections?I will certainly give my inputs on each one to Netaji and the party brass.You have a number of heavyweights in the party. What if they tell Netaji, 'I want X number of tickets for my candidates'?People should understand that while Netaji is the national president of the Samajwadi Party, he is also my father (laughs). He won't do anything that will harm me.You were instrumental in getting DPYadav's ticket cancelled. It resulted in a change in your favour.I don't want any person who can tarnish SP's image or cause it any harm to enter the party. When our good work gets brushed aside over issues of law and order, it is unfortunate. It is, in fact, more unfair to the people of UP than us.There is a moment in every politician's life when he becomes a statesman. Do you think you have reached that level of statesmanship where people look up to you and do something because you've said so?This is a process that takes time. Although my political career has been a long one, I can say people in Kannauj (the MP seat which he won in 2009 and later gave up when he became CM) look up to me. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, I went to them and persuaded them against contesting against my wife (Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav). They listened to me and she won, unopposed. When land was to be acquired for the Agra-Lucknow expressway, I told them to give up land and that it would benefit them in the long run. They agreed, and the acquisition was completed without any protest.It will be a while before I win the confidence of people across UP. People have watched us closely and we are building trust. Once we hit the campaign trail, we will also talk about and show our work.Also see how things have changed; professionals are running parties and deciding their political ideologies. Can political events be done on ramps? (In reference to Rahul Gandhi's UP Udghosh). Also, events like Townhall. People see this and they understand. These are interesting tests we must all face in a democracy.Have you found the bureaucracyresponsive?Now I know who works and who doesn't. I just need to fit things where I need them to be. If you give them a free hand and accept their ideas, even they enjoy working.To be a member of a large political family will have its advantages and disadvantages. In what situation has this been a liability or an asset for you?(Laughs) I will not say anything on this.What is your realistic assessmentof seats?There were elections in UP in 2012 and 2014. Now, the next is in 2017. I see the seats we won in both these elections as safe seats for us. We will win them, comfortably. The seats we won in 2012 but lost in 2014, and where the margin of loss was more than 40,000, will need a change of either the candidates or our caste calculations. But seats where our margin of loss was over 80,000 will be difficult even if we make drastic changes. Ultimately, seats depend on how well our organisation works, and who the mahaul is in favour of. Currently, we have enough seats to form the government, alone. We want to tell the people we'll work harder if we get another term.When will you start?Very soon. My rath is being readied. Wherever the rath cannot go, I will cycle.BJP has started its booth-level meetings.They are liars. They also claimed they carried out a huge membership drive. They were all fake members. They claimed they had acquired one crore members. We have also had several organisational meetings. Who has better organisational strength than us?Rahul Gandhi spoke of you as an ""accha ladka"". What do you think he might have been thinking?We are both good boys.Do you want to be prime minister?No. I am happy where I am. Netaji should be PM. And why not? I offered to enter into an alliance with the Congress if Netaji can be PM. In politics, you can never be sure of what the future brings.If you win 2017, Netaji's chances asPM will improve in 2019.We will do everything in our power to make it happen. The country needs a man who is grounded and connected to the grassroots the way Netaji is. Even now, there is a lot to be done for villages and for farmers. We will not give up.Will you contest the elections yourself?No. I am an MLC and my term expires only in 2018. This way, I get to travel and campaign more. I think I can win more seats for the party if I travel and campaign.Is it true that you will not go to Noida?(Laughing) I will break that jinx once I have formed the next government. I will go soon after and break that superstition. This time I will listen to the advice of the elders in the party. It is not necessary that this is true, but sometimes it is ok to toe the traditional line.Do you see yourself going beyond UP?Yes, after 2017, I will start travelling outside UP. I have already covered Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, extensively.You said the Congress is trying hard.Is there a worry that they might split some of your votes?No. People of UP are politically savvy. It will take time for Congress to revive, but it is good that they are trying. Work and ideology are important. UP ke chunao mein ek nasha hai. Kis disha mein jayega kisi ko pata nahi (there is something intoxicating about elections in UP. No one knows which way it swings). It is a big poll.You have been the youngest chiefminister of UP. In your experience of governing UP, how will you define this state?It is a big state where people are politically aware. Differences of caste, religion and class exist, but they are only made known at the time of elections. During non-election times, you will find no one complaining about which caste or religion he or she is from. This is that side to UP which rarely gets talked about. The story of a people who have always lived together, despite their differences. UP's uniqueness is that we are the largest producers of most things, from milk to potatoes and wheat. We can be the model to how the rest of the country runs.What is your biggest lesson inthese years?I can say five years are enough to bring big changes to people's lives. If someone has the vision and plans well, a lot can be accomplished in five years."
58f2096ca3d24b245e59e5ee,Where food and faith intersect,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Where-food-and-faith-intersect/articleshow/53902109.cms,2016-08-29,,The Times Of India,"New Delhi: It's called Chhappan Bhog , 56 food dishes loved by Lord Krishna . And they are all spread out as offering at the Jagannath Temple in Hauz Khas. The Saturday evening aarti is in progress. A group of priests are chanting hymns. Devotees stand reverentially in attendance with folded hands, some with eyes closed. Outside on the terrace, the sounds of mridang, jhaanj and bells ring loud and clear.The setting is perfect for an intersection of food and faith - where every morsel nourishes the body, purifies the soul. And that is what the latest edition of Times Passion Temple Food Trail is all about.Raj Jain, CEO Times Group , put the concept of food trail in perspective. He said that the role of a newspaper is not just to ""talk politics"" but also help everyone ""understand our heritage and culture"". The temple food trail was born out of this idea to provide a platform where everyone could do so, he said.Renowned food historian Pushpesh Pant, who's involved with the initiative as an Experience Architect for the participants, explained the concept of chhappan bhog or mahaprasad.He said that the concept came from the simple mathematical calculation of seven days a week and eight prahars, a three-hour period. He dwelt at length on the 17th chapter of Gita where food is discussed in detail. Pant said that the prasad is satvik in nature with no chillies, potatoes, tomatoes, onion or garlic. ""The prasad is for everyone,"" Pant said referring to its egalitarian character.Some items on the Chhappan bhog list are: dahi bara, peeta, khachudi, khaja, puri, dalma, khua, moog dali and papudi.The participants in the temple food trail also visit temples in Mathura, Vrindavan, Jaipur and Nathdwara. ""In Mathura too, the prasad is called 56 bhog but has a predominance of the madhur ras. The emphasis there is on sweets,"" Pant said. He also pointed out that the nature of the offering changes with the geography of the land.Ravindernath Pradhan, secretary, Sri Nilachal Seva Sangh, spoke at length about the challenges in organizing the event. ""The preparation for the chhappan bhog started around 3am and was over only by 7pm. In all, it took about 16 hours,"" he said. A six member team came especially from Jagannath Temple, Puri to prepare the mahaprasad. ""Satvik bhojan guides us our mind and body in the right direction,"" said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, a senior member of the team.Akrita Kalra, who's participating in trail, said that the evening felt like ""the discovery of a whole new world. ""Even looking at the varieties of offering before the Lord was a feast for the eyes. One got a sense of fulfillment just by looking at it,"" said Kalra, an education counselor by profession.Another participant Smita Dugar said that listening to Pushpesh Pant on food was like hearing a voice right out of a history book. ""I am a pure vegetarian and being a food consultant as well, I wanted to learn about temple food, its origins and history. Mr Pant puts everything in perspective,"" said Dugar."
58f20cb9a3d24b245e59e7cc,vegetable prices likely to soar before Chhath puja,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vegetable-prices-likely-to-soar-before-Chhath-puja/articleshow/55198081.cms,2016-11-02,,The Times Of India,"RANCHI: A steep hike in vegetable and fruit prices has become the trend ahead of festivals here. With Chhath festival around the corner, prices of veggies and fruits have increased and are only likely to soar further from Wednesday.On Tuesday, the price of bottle gourd (kaddu or gheeya) ranged between Rs 20-Rs 40 at the local markets. Anita Devi, a vendor at Peace Road , said she and her friends are planning to sell them at a higher price since it is one of the vegetables eaten on 'Nahay-Khay'.Sunita Pradhan, a resident of Hinoo and who is performing the puja for over five years, said on the second day, Lohanda and Kharna, which is about a day-long fast ending with eating chapatti (roti) or pancake (puri) with rice dessert (kheer), has also become an expensive affair. ""The price of one litre milk is above Rs 30 and one kilo rice is also the same. We prepare the menu considering the diet of each family member and keeping our budget in mind,"" she added.At present, the cost of carrot is Rs 80 per kilogram, ginger Rs 100 per kilogram, radish Rs 10 per 100 gram, cauliflower between Rs 40-50 per kilogram, new potato Rs 25-30, old potato Rs 20 and pointed gourd is Rs 30-40 per kilogram. Most of these items, apart from fruits, are essential for 'aragya soop', which is offered to the sun god during the festival.Nannu Devi, another vendor near Raj Bhavan said rpices of vegetables will increase by at least Rs 10 or Rs 20 ahead of Chhath puja.Even fruits such as small sized local apples are available for Rs 50-Rs 80. However, sugarcane which is a necessary fruit offered during Arghya, was not visible in the market. Shanti, a vendor at Birsa Chowk , said sugarcane will be sold from Wednesday onwards. Mohammed, a vegetable seller at Doranda market, said with the onset of winter, prices of vegetables is usually high but post-Chhath, the prices are likely to slide as per the demand customers."
58f21139a3d24b245e59e926,Just pop or bake your vada pav now,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Just-pop-or-bake-your-vada-pav-now/articleshow/53418769.cms,2016-07-28,,The Times Of India,"Schezwan vada pavMayonnaise vada pavPalak cheese vada pavButter-grilled vada pavMakka vada pavWhen it comes to the food-loving Puneite, nothing drives home the idea of comfort food better than the humble vada pav does. There's a certain magic that the golden fried potato fritter, tucked between tender bread, conjures, especially on a rainy day. Couple that with some piping hot kadak chai and voila; you're in seventh heaven.From the time it was churned out in the 1960s, as a result of Mumbai-based snack vendor Ashok Vaidya's innovative brainwave-to serve a hot vada between bread with garlic chutney, the vada pav has travelled from the Maximum City across the country. While this age-old preparation continues to be revered, Pune, for one, is seeing the snack take on various avatars, much to the delight of those willing to experiment.Call the potato and cheese vada version that he serves in Baner a deconstructed vada pav if you must, because Kanishka Kamat will have no qualms. ""In keeping with the city's love for the dish, offering vada pav on the menu was a must. However, while retaining the flavours, we've added our style to it,"" shares Kanishka. The dish isn't served in the same vada-in-pav manner, but is plated like a fine-dine one - vadas sitting on a plate with an artistic stroke of tamarind chutney, accompanied by garlic and curry-leaf-infused bread and the mandatory green chillies on the side. The potato vadas add more to the flavour carnival with their gooey mozzarella filling. Drooling already, aren't you?Rs 125Just when you thought the vada pav preparation was sacrosanct, there are others who believe that the humble snack is a playground for delectable experimentation. Head to Balewadi, where Chef Shailendra Kekade amalgamates the comforting goodness of the vada pav with, wait for it, bacon! ""The very twist lies in the trademark taste of bacon. We cook off the bacon bits infusing them with flavours of garlic, curry leaves, ginger and turmeric, spices that lend the traditional vada pav its familiar taste. The mass is then batter-fried and served in a home-baked bun,"" Shailendra shares. Total indulgence, this one comes doused in the goodness of pork juices.Rs 240A deceptive one, this variant looks just like the regular vada pav in appearance, but its distinct taste will validate why it's a carnivore's preferred option. There's no potato in the vada, but a rich mix of chicken, cheese, herbs and special spices enveloped in a crisp besan coating. ""We also tried a pasta vada pav along with this in the past, but the chicken variant has been the most popular among patrons till date,"" shares Harshad Bele, from the Baner-based cafe that serves this offering. Being vegetarian, are you feeling left out? The good news is they have a paneer version too.Rs 50If the thought of downing calories troubles you, fret not; there is a baked variant to enjoy. The vada makes way for spiced potato stuffed into a bun (not pav) and baked to perfection. ""This snack came to Pune around three years ago after it did well in Mumbai. It's a healthier rendition of the usually greasy snack,"" says Karan Vaswani, who runs the Viman Nagar outlet of the bakery serving this snack. Have Puneites warmed up to the variant? ""I happened to try it by chance one day and it challenged my set notion of the snack. Sans the besan coating, I felt something was missing at first, but for the most part, the flavours are bang on,"" says IT professional Nikhil Vidyasagar.Rs 20Who could possibly imagine the snack morphing into nibbles resembling the kernel-puffed popcorn? Well, you can find this avatar if you drive to Nagar Road.

58f220b8a3d24b68099aa682,Portrait of a Mumbai serial killer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Portrait-of-a-Mumbai-serial-killer/article14400284.ece,2016-06-25,,The Hindu,"An opening disclaimer establishes the films connect (as well as the disconnect) with the infamous serial killer of the 60s in Mumbai: Raman Raghav, who had left a trail of 41-odd murders behind him. This film is not about him, the disclaimer states. Indeed, the film is about a contemporary copycat killer. But then it is not just about the new age Ramanna either.Crime vs lawWhodunnit? Whydunnit? Howdunnit? RR 2.0 is actually neither of the above. Yes there are many murders that keep you riveted, but they are not an end in themselves. They are more a contrivance, as is the cat-and-mouse game between the killer Ramanna (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and the cop Raghuvendra Singh Ubbi (Vicky Kaushal).The slayings and slaughters are mere pit-stops in the journey of these two characters and their unfolding relationship with each other. The killings (right from the one at the start, to those in the end) are devices through which director Anurag Kashyap explores the crime vs law binary. He brings the two together, coalesces and fuses them. Is there much that separates the two? Arent they reflections of each other?The film is a long chase in which each is actually running after his own shadow. It is, as if Kashyap deliberately splits an immoral, unlawful mind into two and the film then becomes a voyage to a metaphoric completion. As if on cue Ramanna says of Raghav:  Apni mukti aurat mein dhoondh raha hai (He is looking for his own redemption in a woman). Implying quite kinkily that it is he: who is actually his salvation.The pivot of the film is the portrait of the serial killer. The creature of Mumbai mythology and folklore is brought alive with added shades of the dark and the menacing in this brand new avatar. Glowing cat eyes, a scar running down his forehead, at times wearing his own sisters earrings, humming  aadmi musafir hai  and moving around with an iron car-jack in hand, scouting furtively for victims, hiding in slush and rising up nonchalantly from it plastered with muck: Siddiqui is brilliantly frantic and frenzied as the cold-hearted, demented, voyeuristic pervert. Like the best of killers, his depravity is built on his individual philosophy: that he has a wireless access to God, he is the messenger of Yamraj who is telling him to pick people up and kill them.Brutal killingsFor him killing in the name of nation or religion, is just not as evolved as killing purely for the heck of killing: which is what he practises. Siddiqui packs in such brute force in his lean frame and mean presence that everyone else gets automatically shoved to the periphery. Sitting on his knees, looking up at the cop in the balcony: with one unwavering look he sends a chill down the spine. But, despite Siddiquis overpowering presence Kaushal stands in good stead as a reckless, trigger-happy, drug-addled cop keeling dangerously close to Ramannas side of darkness.They share much in common. Both have emerged from squalid surroundings; belong to worlds that are rotten and foul. Be it the filthy slums or a decaying middle-class family. So a passing reference to Vasanthabalans Angadi Theru seems quite appropriate in the scheme of the film. Both Ramanna and Raghav are creatures bred and brought up in patriarchy and yet are, victims of it (Raghavs uneasy but submissive equation with his dad, for instance) perpetuating its deep misogyny. No wonder women, however strong-willed, get the worst end of the stick, be it Ramannas victims or Raghavs girls.Some sequences stand out. Ramanna holding his sisters family hostage brings out his sick mind in the queasiest way possible. A massacre followed by a feast of some chicken curry and, to top it all, that dynamite of a song:  Behooda . Most satisfying! Or, that unnervingly funny killing in slums even as an old lady is too busy collecting the potatoes fallen from her bag. The killings and bloodshed might be kept off screen but the gore and gruesomeness reach out.The black humour adds to the horror. For instance, the long scene at the beginning where Ramanna confesses to his crimes: only to be let off by the police. Owning up becomes his ticket to freedom, and to more murders than the nine already committed.Taut thrillerMore than the story itself, it is the quirky telling that is the key. Structured around eight chapters, vividly shot in the slums, pulsating with raucous music, Raman Raghav 2.0 is a taut thriller, full of energy and brimming over with tension. It doesnt flag even once and holds the viewer tightly in its grip.Such is the dizzying momentum and pace, that you even stop caring about some missing pieces of the jigsaw that might have been niggling at you. Clear-cut, uncomplicated Raman Raghav 2.0 takes you on an entertainment high.Raman Raghav 2.0Director: Anurag KashyapStarring: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vicky Kaushal, Sobhita Dhulipala, Amruta SubhashRuntime: 141 mins"
58f221b4a3d24b68099aa776,The race to light up the last village,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-race-to-light-up-the-last-village/article14592893.ece,2016-08-25,,The Hindu,"Jalan Singh, 30, has not removed the cardboard carton that protects the sides of his new Godrej refrigerator. You cannot miss the striking red cooling machine in the room. Having spent Rs.12,000 on it, Singh is proud of his acquisition. Sixty-nine years is a short time in an independent countrys life but it has been a long time for power to reach Singhs village, Tanwarpura, an hours drive from Barmer city in Rajasthan. Power that arrived in the village two months ago, although erratic, nudged Singh to buy a refrigerator. He opens it to show it to us, but its empty. The rains may have tripped some lines, a government official offers an explanation. Rains did lash the village a few days ago. Having been consistent this year, they promise good harvest and some extra income. Singhs spirits are not dampened by the temporary absence of electricity; he reels off his wish list: a fan, a cooler, and an atta chakki (flour mill).Rukh Singh, his neighbour, has beaten him to procuring an atta chakki . The flour mill means two extra hours of sleep for his wife. In the early hours before dawn, Tanwarpura wakes up to the sounds of the chakki as women work it to pound flour. With the manual mill, it took my wife four hours to prepare the flour for our daily meals. The electric one takes an hour, Rukh Singh says. His wife smiles behind her veil, allowing Rukh Singh to speak on her behalf.The Singhs got an electricity connection under the Modi governments flagship scheme of rural electrification launched in July 2015, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The governments goal is 100 per cent electrification by 2019. Official estimates peg the number of un-electrified villages in India at 18,452. Of this, the government claims to have electrified 10,097 villages till date, a figure that doesnt go uncontested.The lifelines of a villageAt least there is light, says 34-year-old Chagan Kanwar, a mother of two. Two weeks ago, for the first time, solar energy lit up houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti in Barmer district where she lives. Designated as a Desert National Park area and situated almost at the farthest edge of the State, a few kilometres before the border with Pakistan, the village has around a hundred households. Power for Kanwar means less pollution. The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining, she says. The inhabitants of this basti were accustomed to travelling 25 km to Gadra village to charge their mobile phones. A shopkeeper there would ask for Rs.10 to charge each phone. We used to take 10 phones once a week to get them charged, says Pan Singh. Mobile phones, lifelines for the villagers and the only connection to the outside world, when powered ran for a week.Their main lifeline, however, is the sun. Under the off-grid scheme of DDUGJY, houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti have been provided with a 100W solar panel which can light five LED bulbs, one standing 12W fan, and a socket to charge a mobile phone. These three utilities come as part of the solar kit, a one-time investment of Rs.1,029 which works out to 5 per cent of the total cost incurred to install the kit in every home. There is no burden of electricity bills.The villagers have become so accustomed to the absence of power that even its presence does not prompt them to switch on the fan. The two villages, Tanwarpura and Salam Singh Ki Basti, are examples of the grid and off-grid programmes of the Centre, which are committed to providing electricity in every village. Explaining the decision for this, the Executive Director of Rural Electrification Corporation, Dinesh Arora, says: States have generally preferred and adopted grid connectivity for most of the villages except in areas where connectivity is either not feasible or cost-effective.In Rajasthan, as at the Centre, a Bharatiya Janata Party government is at the helm. Both Central and State officials are racing to power villages, but they are also wary as the media has turned its gaze to the claims made by the government in rural electrification. Officials everywhere are now tutoring villagers on the art of communicating with the media. With a spate of critical reports on the app-based claims of electrification on GARV making the government more watchful, even the hint of a journalist in the remotest of villages sends officials into a tizzy.Promise of powerMeanwhile, in distant Uttar Pradesh, power is a touchy issue, especially as elections are set to take place next year. When the Centre claims credit for any development, the State is quick to point out loopholes.In Anandpur, a village at the edge of Hathras district which is famed for asafoetida, a dried latex that is indispensable to curries and dals (lentil), power comes and goes. A gift from Delhi, an LED bulb, has brought light into the lives of 70-year-old Ram Prasad and 17-year-old Rahul. The electricity meter, wrapped in plastic, is a prized possession and is precariously mounted on the mud wall of the house that has a small porch, a room, and a tube well in the courtyard. There is a toilet too, Prasad points out, seemingly well-versed in the drill of showing to outsiders the trappings of modernity that have crept into the village. The toilet is pitch dark; light hasnt travelled there yet.For rural India, the DDUGJY brings not only the promise of power to every village, but its attendant trappings too. Our ancestors will be happy. They never saw light, says Savitri, a resident, as she begins cooking potatoes and chapattis under the light of a solitary bulb. The bulb has freed her from having to swat insects that she would have otherwise battled with under the light of a kerosene lamp or candle.Glimpses of a fractious relationshipAnandpur is an odd mix of upper castes (mostly Thakurs) and backward castes. Adversity and deprivation is the glue that holds these communities together. Most of the villagers wear a bemused look as officials from the electricity department come inquiring about the availability of power here. Mukesh Kumar from the State Electricity Board examines 18 meters installed in Anandpur and requests people to show their papers. He looks agitated. We were not informed about the installation. What if the villagers refuse to pay for the power or their homes collapse in the rains? he asks. The question hangs in the air, offering a glimpse of the fractious relationship between the Centre and State.The Prime Minister claimed in his Independence Day address that Nagla Fatela, a village in Hathras, was electrified but the media found surprised villagers and a dark village when it reached there. The embarrassment caused by this episode has left everyone on edge here and the U.P. government is determined to keep a check on every connection by sending its officers to the field. Kumar is one of them. Other senior officials have been dispatched from Lucknow. Says Rakesh Verma wryly: Ideally, the village should be getting 14 hours of power but that seldom happens. Lets see what happens after the elections. The officials wait patiently for Anandpurs residents to show their cards. Others who also wait are the men who installed the meters, the Centres officials.The scheme is premised on the Centre and the State working in tandem. The Centre provides the infrastructure; the State provides the power after working out its availability  12-14 hours a day is what has been calculated. The reality plays out differently as power keeps tripping. Young Anshu whispers that she saw a snake first when the light came on some time at night in her thatched hut just two days ago. Snakes are common in the tiny village of Anandpur, which is ringed by paddy fields. The villagers could not steal power like other villages nearby  katiya , or the illegal tapping of power, is rampant there  as high tension wires made that impossible.The power is erratic and the wait long and uncertain. We wait and watch; so do Savitri and Rahul. Everyone looks at the cooler fan installed upside down, a common jugaad in these parts, which works when the electricity comes. This is a welcome addition to their huts as it helps make the nights less muggy.In Anandpur, the monthly income of a family of five rarely exceeds Rs.2,000. Electricity is a luxury. Agricultural holdings are small, and income is supplemented by selling milk. The villagers are worried; they ask as they wait for the power to come, Do we have to pay the bill? As per the plan, the village will get power from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pointing out the absurdity of the schedule, an official on a visit to the village says, We dont draw the plan. We follow instructions from Delhi. Contesting this, Mr. Arora says, The responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.These villagers are the Antyodaya card holders. In other words, they are the poorest of the poor whose entitlements are a few kilograms of rice and two litres of kerosene a month. The supplies get exhausted quickly and they are forced to purchase these goods from the open market. The nearest school is 2 km away and the villagers are wary of sending their girls to school. Rahul is studying for an examination and he finds the light a godsend. I can study now when the light comes; I dont have to study under the lamp, he says, wistful though for a regular supply.The State government is working out a way to regulate the tariff so that people pay for the power they consume. From the headquarters in Lucknow, the chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Desh Deepak Verma, has been keeping a watch ever since false claims were made about electrification, by dispatching officials to the ground. He says the problem is with the definition of an electrified village. One in 10 homes is all that a series of schemes have focussed on. What about the 9 others? And within the 10 per cent, only poles have reached some villages; last mile connectivity is still distant.Its 6.30 p.m. when dusk falls to herald the night. Thirty hours have passed, but Tanwarpura has no power. Is it because of the rains? Electricity is transformative, but only when it is available, Rukh Singh says. We get it for about two hours a day. A tiny bulb dispels darkness in Jethmal Singhs house. I got my connection under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) governments Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) before it was re-christened by the BJP government as DDUGJY. Only five connections have come in the last six months under the DDUGJY, he says. Thirty of the 35 households which have electricity in this village were electrified under the RGGVY. A Tata Sky dish hangs at the back of Jethmals house. The TV, however, is missing.On August 12, the governments field engineer encouraged us to purchase a television so that we could tune in to Prime Minister Narendra Modis Independence Day address. We bought the set on the 13th, he says. People gathered in Jethmal Singhs house on August 15. But the TV conked off after the Prime Ministers speech and has been sent for repair.Bhiram, who lives ten minutes away from Jethmals house in the nearby village of Tirsingra, also listened to the Prime Minister speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort. The field engineer told me that light would reach my village too, he says. But there was a problem. In April 2015, the government identified 34 un-electrified villages in Barmer. Tirsingra was not one of them.Un-electrified and not on the listA hundred kilometres away from Tirsingra, Mahadev Nagar has a similar story. There is no power in the village and it is not on the governments radar. Surta Ram, 40, calls fellow villagers to gather on the lawns of the primary school to discuss the problems related to lack of power. Photographs of Indira Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar hang prominently in his house. He calls himself a samaaj sevi (social worker). For the last five years, we have been contacting government officials at all levels: the Collector, the MLA, and others. Now they tell us that our name is not in the government survey, he says. Ten days ago, the MLA said that our village will see light this Diwali. Lets see.Mahadev Nagar has a primary health centre, a facility that other villages mentioned as lacking here. But it is just a building. There is no doctor here. No one wants to come here because there is no electricity, Surta Ram says.Adds 39-year-old Puga Ram: Yesterday, three malaria patients had to travel for 5-10 km for injections. The ambulance also doesnt come inside our village. Puga Ram teaches in the village school and is concerned about the childrens education. This is the age of computers. How will these kids get digital literacy if there is no electricity, he asks, distressed. There are five classrooms in the school; one is under construction. The heat inside the room compels the teacher to take his classes on the sands outside under the trees. Misra Ram shows a receipt of Rs.200 dated November 2015. For electricity connections, we had to apply in groups of five. A hundred such forms have been sent from our village. I have applied thrice. But there is no progress, he says.All conversations with the villagers start and end with electricity. Its announcement and presence have fuelled aspirations long bottled up.Back in Salam Singh Ki Basti, Abdul Khan shakes his head, disgruntled with the governments solar-powered electricity scheme that is oddly restrictive as well as liberating. We wanted electricity powered by the grid. The current set-up limits us to a few predefined utilities. There is nothing more that we can do with this, he says. The power limitation of the solar kit doesnt allow them to use other appliances. Unlike in Tanwarpura, electricity in this village doesnt match aspirations. Also, the government is advocating for one kit that fits all. This means that the village school in Salam Singh Ki Basti gets the same set kit as the houses. There are multiple classrooms, but only one fan.In the summer heat in Anandpur, 70-year-old Prasad dreams. Now that we have seen light, we have become a little greedy. Dil aur chahta hai (the heart desires more), he says. That means a few hours more hours of light. And a fan that will make the summer more bearable.The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining.

58f22322a3d24b68099aa812,A need for balance,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/A-need-for-balance/article14506988.ece,2016-07-22,,The Hindu,"As expected, a conversation with Kalki Koechlin begins on a wholesome note. As soon as we sit down for a meal together, she says, I dont look like it, but I eat a lot. The flexibility she shows in her choice of roles reflects in her choice of cuisines as well. From Kashmiri to Chettinad and from Japanese to French, Koechlin has a taste for all of them. She talks of her fondness for yakhni pulao and butter chicken in one sentence. As I come from south India, I have a special affinity with spices. Whether it is rasam or wasabi sauce, the actor likes it hot.For this meal, however, Koechlin opts for Mediterranean cuisine with a mezze sampler. It is an assortment of hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh and beet root labneh with grilled pita, marinated olives, feta and falafel.At once, she picks up a falafel (deep-fried ball made with ground chickpeas and fava beans) and calls it a Spanish vada. In fact, even when shes on sets, Koechlin says sge thinks about food! You think about food but very rarely do you get good food on the sets, she says. We are lucky that we get to travel a lot with our films and hence get to taste different cuisines. Like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara i ntroduced me to Spanish food. But if you are a vegetarian, Spain is not for you for they offer fish to vegetarians! she chuckles. The actor says she knows she needs to be healthy. So I drink carrot, beetroot and apple juice mixed together and of course lots of coconut water.Rather starve than cookHer appreciation of food and need to eat healthy hasnt resulted in motivation to enter the kitchen. I would rather go hungry than cook, she chuckles before adding that shed prefer baking though. I cant cook on a daily basis. But I can bake bread, apple pie and all sorts of cakes.Having spent her childhood in Puducherry, Koechlin has fondness for its cuisine. It is a mixture of French, Tamil and Vietnamese food. Spring rolls, fish curries and French baked potato with cheese dominate the scene. At home, I love to have fish prepared in coconut milk. And, then there is rasam which I could have throughout the year.For her last release, Waiting , the actor shot in Kochi and had her fill of fish curries.The film was was appreciated by critics. Reflecting on the experince while munching on tabbouleh, Koechlin says that director Anu Menon and she had to rework the character. We changed the lingo. We needed to arrive at the weird Hindi that a Mumbai girl speaks. Words like pakaoed entered the vocabulary. We also worked on the look. She wanted Tara to look desi , with kohl eyes, sharp eyebrows and black and curly hair. It was a different experience for me.Drawing from lifeAs for getting into the emotional core of the character, Koechlin maintains that she draws from life and from other peoples stories. But I think, ultimately, it has a lot to do with putting yourself in that situation while rehearsing with your co-actors which is possible when you have a co-actor like Naseer.Her process, she says, is about being genuine to the experience. I dont think you can prepare yourself for a scene like the first time you see your husband in a coma, she says. You cannot plan how you would react. I have had situations where my family members had to be in hospital for a long time but when I am actually shooting I dont recall those moments. Those memories are useful when you are preparing and rehearsing. By the time I am on the set, I am the character and not Kalki. So I could not refer to Kalkis personal experiences.Tara, Koechlin continues, was a reflection on how fast-paced life has become. We dont internalise ourselves very much. But then it could be seen as a stereotype of this generation. Anything can become a stereotype. We are all stereotypes. When we look at somebody in a salwar kameez we often say she is a Punjabi aunty type, a short skirt evokes a different reaction. It depends on how you play the character. If you find the humanness of that character, it will work.Similarly, the actor, who comes from a strong theatre background says, melodrama is often misunderstood. The same issue can be expressed in a subtle or melodramatic way. It depends on its treatment. It changes from independent to commercial cinema. In both cases, you have to be true to the character, you have to believe the emotion: only the ways of expression are different. The truth of the emotion remains the same, she says, citing the example of the recent Rajat Kapoor adaptation of Macbeth where she plays a dark clown. Dark humour is hard. The flow of the play is such that the three witches go on to become lady Macbeths.Theatre, particularly plays like these, keeps Koechlin on her toes. I dont take many holidays and when you enjoy your work, you dont feel like taking a break. I am lucky that I get to do what I want to. There are times when I have no work. So when you have lots of work, you better do it.But this attitude doesnt always work with the family. My mother usually stays with me for two months and after that we fight and she goes to stay with my brother, says the actor. And her concerns start from why I work so much. She would complain that I dont spend time with her, why I put so much stuff in the refrigerator.After the initial reluctance, the actor of French origin is now being accepted by all kinds of filmmakers. She feels she broke into the commercial mould with Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . It is another matter that most could not still pronounce her surname right. I have put it in Devanagari on my Twitter account but it doesnt help.Meanwhile, we talk about how women-centric films are on the rise. I hope it is not just a trend and is going to stay. It is a natural evolution. And it is not just actors; we now find a lot of female crew members and DOPs.But, the actor is careful to underline that she is for gender balance and not star balance. Shes alluding to directors penchant for a particular set of female actors who have delivered hits. It should not be about star worship.The increasing presence of women crew members ensures that there is a female perspective, she says.If Waiting had a male director, he would have had a different perspective and it could be equally relevant as well. My point is at present we have many male perspectives and [we] need a balance. Indeed!There are times when I have nowork. So when you have lots of work, you better do it"

They get Rs.180 to Rs.500 a kg for the chilli at Chilla, an exclusive market to sell farm produces of the tribespeople.At the market started by the Forest Department in 2014, produces ranging from vegetables, chickens and forest honey, besides cattle are auctioned, avoiding middlemen, every Thursday. An official of the Forest Department said when the price quoted at the auction was found below the market level, the officials themselves intervened and purchased the items. The vegetables and tubers reaching the market are fully organic. The turnover of Chilla touched Rs.47.44 lakh by August 31. This included Rs.2.18 lakh commission to the Vana Samrakshana Samithy (VSS) which operates the market. The aim of the project was to find market for produces grown by tribespeople and make them economically independent. In the initial period, it was a challenge as the produces were not so competitive in the general market. However, the market slowly gained popularity and those from remote areas too started attending it. The tribespeople can bring their produce and participate in the auction.The official said that natural forest honey was sold at Rs.360 a kg. Middlemen used to purchase it at Rs.200 a kg.Cultivation has started in the settlement areas of Thayannankudy, Kammalankudy, Nellipettykudy, Periyakudy and Vengaprakudy which have been remaining uncultivated. Carrot, chilli, cardamom, potato, benana, tapioca, barley, ginger and turmeric reach the market from remote areas.Now the market is functioning in an open area in front of the forest station. There is also a plan to make a thatched shed for the market.The vegetables and tubers reaching Chilla, a market started by Forest Department, are fully organic."

Akshay is a proud student-farmer. His initiative to take up cultivation of vegetables on 2.5 acres of land owned by his school, PKHMO UP School at Edathanattukara, near Mannarkkad, has won him the Kerala governments first Student Farmer Talent Award (Vidhyarthi Karshaka Prathibha Award).Now a Class 8 student at nearby GO Higher Secondary School, Akshay has taken up the project in the new school apart from using his weekly holidays to continue with the vegetable cultivation at PKHMO School. Inspired by Akshay, over 200 students of PKHMO are now actively engaged in vegetable cultivation in the school compound, making the institution the top in terms of agricultural production.Akshay received the recognition from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the State-level Farmers Day function held in Palakkad Town Hall on Tuesday. The audience comprising agriculture experts and successful farmers received him with thunderous applause.My father Murali is a daily wage rubber tapper. Mother, Sumithra, is a homemaker. Agriculture is in our blood and by brother, Adarsh, who is in Class 4, too has begun showing interest in vegetable farming, said Akshay in an interaction with The Hindu .Akshay said he wished to become an agriculture scientist who could contribute significantly to the nations food security. V Rasakh and Abdul Wahab, his teachers at PKHMO, had inspired him to focus on vegetable farming.We planted almost every vegetable, including plantains, tapioca, tomato, beetroot and potato. There was high yield despite our stringent determination on organic farming. The produce was sold in the local market and the profit was used to ensure various student amenities, said Akshay. He said he is cultivating vegetables even on the seven cents of land owned by his family."

Mani who, is facing a fresh investigation in the bar licence bribery case, has now been slapped with quick verifications in cases alleging extending tax cuts to interested parties dealing in chicken and chemical trade and also in the conduct of the mass marriage held as part of the golden jubilee of the party.Such cases may not be new to the party leadership, but for the first time, they have found themselves without anyone to take up their case, other than the party chairman and a few senior leaders of the party. As part of the UDF, Mr. Mani could expect support from the entire coalition. That one has to defend the case oneself, that too in the media, appears to be too dear a price to pay in politics.Even as the Vigilance probes were unfolding, the party plunged into utter chaos when what is claimed to be a report of the investigation into the conspiracy behind the bar licence bribery case appeared in a section of the media. Mr. Mani was quick to acknowledge its veracity but the leader of the committee that looked into the issue and partys deputy chairman C.F. Thomas dropped it like a hot potato, denying any part in drafting it. An embarrassed Mr. Mani swiftly retracted his words, but the damage has already been done.The issue has brought the fissures within the party out in the open.The issue has also given credential to the allegations that a coterie has already formed around the top leadership.According to a senior leader, as of now, their position after coming out of the coalition has nothing to cheer about.Row over a report on the conspiracy behind bar bribery case has exposed the fissures within the party"

(Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar) A three-part exercise is followed to ensure the rakes are freshin the morning. (Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar)Given the alacrity with which commuters in local trains throw around wrappers of potato chips and biscuits and eject the blood red pan residue from their overflowing mouths, it takes nearly 185 janitors employed on contract by the Railways to ensure that local trains do not look like overflowing spittoon bowls in motion.A three-part exercise is followed to ensure the rakes are fresh and raring to carry the weight of lakhs of commuters as they leave the yard every morning.According to a railway official, there are currently 145 trains, of which some are sick facing wear and tear to some parts, leaving around 122 trains that are operational on the Mumbai suburban network.All these trains, after completing their daily duty, are either sent to the three yards  located in Kurla, Kalwa and Sanpada  or the 17 sidings, which are comparatively smaller, where they are dry cleaned every night. Here, our men get in the train, sweep the floor, dust the fans and ensure that all the waste left behind is cleared. This happens every night either at the yard or the siding, said an official.It normally takes one person three to four hours to clean the entire train. Mostly, a few janitors work together to ensure that the cleaning is carried out quickly, said a janitor, adding, Normally, we take a longer time inside the ladies compartment as there are vegetables and foodstuff also lying around. Luggage compartment also takes a bit longer. Normally, we find the trains on the western lines carry lesser leftovers than the central and harbour lines.After this first stage is the mopping stage that is carried out only at the yard and not the sidings. Here, the trains are mopped with water, especially the outer sections. And it is here that the janitors come up with their most adamant nemesis: pan and tobacco stains.These patches are almost exclusively outside the general compartment. We really have to work hard to take these stains off. We wash it with soap water multiple times with our hands but some part of the stains always stays. Then someone else will spit on the same spot and the stain gets another layer, making it all the more difficult to wipe it out, said another janitor.A senior official blamed this on the people sitting on the window seat who would spit out through the gap between the grill and boundary of the window and stain the train. Another big challenge during the mopping stage is the luggage compartment.There are mostly vendors who carry things like fish that leaves behind a strong smell. We have to clean the luggage compartment with phenyl and we also spray deodorants to ensure there is no smell. If this mopping did not take place, over a period of time, people would not be able to travel in the luggage compartment, said a janitor.Here, however, there is a peculiar problem that the railway officials face.Some of the janitors are vegetarians and refuse to clean the luggage compartment. At a time, we have 50 per cent of the normal strength of janitors who are available to clean the luggage compartment, said the senior official.After these two basic stages of cleaning, the third stage involves spraying water from hoses at the trains every fortnight for its overall cleanliness. This facility too is available only at the three car sheds. We have a timetable in place for trains that ensures that each train reaches the yard at least once in three-four days.We do not have a single day off, be it a Sunday or a public holiday. On any given day, there is so much dirt in the trains that if we do not clean it even one day, the train travel of the lakhs of commuters wont be a pleasant one, said the janitor.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

File photo: Prakash HassanIn the State Budget 2016, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah earmarked Rs. 20 crore, to purchase private land for the elephant corridor. The Forest Department has proposed the elephant corridor project in Sakleshpur taluk to expand the elephant habitat as one of the steps to deal with the man-elephant conflict in the area.Frustrated by repeated incidents of elephants damaging crops and causing human deaths, the residents of villages in Sakleshpur taluk had stated, in writing, that they were ready to part with their land for the project. As many as 416 farmers had voluntarily come forward to part with around 2,361 acres of land. However, they demanded a good price for their property, from the government.The Hassan district administration conducted meetings with the villagers and recorded their opinions in 2015.The people were in favour of parting with their land, provided they got a good compensation package. The private land required for the project is located in Balehalla, Bettakumari, Jagata, Ettahalla, Boremane, Mankanahalli, Bisale and Arani villages. Except for a few, all the villagers had favoured the project.Recently Mr. A. Manju, minister in-charge of Hassan district, said that a team of officers from the Central government would also visit the place to study the proposed project.The farmers are expecting to get at least Rs. 15 to 20 lakh per acre of the land they will part with. Many of them have encroached upon government land and cultivated it. Now, they want compensation for the land they encroached upon. The officers have not given them any assurance on providing compensation for the land that they have encroached upon.In the budget, CM Siddaramaiah said that Rs. 20 crore will be set aside for the elephant corridor. Besides this, he also mooted encouraging non-governmental organisations and forest user agencies from purchasing private lands bordering forests, and suggested they hand over the same to the Forest Department.New cattle feed unitThe CM has proposed the establishment of a cattle feed unit in Arakalgudu. The Karnataka Milk Federation will make the investments for this unit. Arakalgudu is represented by Mr. Manju, minister for Animal Husbandry, in the Legislative Assembly.Subsidy on certified seedsHassan is one of the major potato producers of the state. The CM has announced a subsidy of up to 50 per cent or Rs. 10 per kg on certified seeds. This will benefit the potato growers, who are planning to purchase certified seeds for cultivation. All these years, the growers suffered huge losses by sowing non-certified seeds."

Though we want to return home, we need at least a portion of what is due to us immediately as we have not sent any money to our families, a worker told The Hindu over the phone.Sources said that the Indian Embassy officials, who visited the camps, took down details of the workers. They said that they will make arrangements to get our dues but we are unsure of how that can be done. The situation is really tense and several rumours are going around the camps. Some say that we would be taken to Delhi and then sent home by train, while others say we would be taken to India and then paid Rs. 500 each to reach home, said another worker.Though the companies shut down sometime ago, their canteens continued to run for sometime. After they closed, we had nowhere to eat. Hundreds of Indians blocked the Mecca Road after which the Army came and then the Indian Embassy stepped in. Kind-hearted Indians and Saudi nationals have been providing food to us. The Embassy also arranged for rice, potatoes and other things, said a worker. Indian community organisations formed an umbrella body called Indian Community, Jeddah, pooled in money and are helping out with food, basic medicines and other necessary items. When we visited the camp two weeks ago, the workers were eating dry rotis. We immediately arranged for food from a restaurant and supplied them rice, dhals, oil and condiments so that the workers can cook and eat, said one of the volunteers with the Indian Community, Jeddah.Pon Kumar, Tamizhaga Kattada Thozhilalargal Mathiya Sangam, who has been helping bring back Tamils stuck in foreign countries, said that only when the numbers are so large the Indian government steps in to help. In gulf countries, hundreds of persons are stuck in prisons. All these workers would have taken loans to get the jobs and would not want to come back. I request the Indian government to talk to the Saudi Arabian government and ensure that these men are provided with an alternative job, he said.M. Babu Murugavel, former Arani MLA, whose area has a lot of people working in countries including Saudi Arabia, said that many of these labourers would have taken loans to get visas.Though ticket, visa and other expenses would amount to under Rs. 50,000, they end up spending nearly Rs. 2 lakh just to reach those countries.

How will the State now go ahead with its proposed projects are the moot questions.All successive governments in AP have failed the people. Post-bifurcation, our leaders should have insisted on equal sharing of Hyderabad revenue for next 10 years since it will remain the common capital till then. Telangana Chief Minister KCR has clearly made the best of the bifurcation, says B. Ramakrishnam Raju, national convenor of National Alliance of Peoples Movement.It is clear that the BJP doesnt trust Chandrababu Naidu. It is trying to marginalise TDP and strengthen its presence in this region. Naidu had also used BJP in the past when it was strong and dropped it like a hot potato when he did not need its support. It is now BJPs turn to pay him back in the same coin, he said.In the given circumstances, he said, the government should shun ambitious projects and instead take the realistic route.Polavaram projectFormer Government whip Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao in Viaskhapatnam called it a great injustice the allocation of a meagre Rs. 1,850 crore to the State against the need for Rs. 1 lakh crore. Pointing to the fact that the revised estimates of Polavaram project cost is around Rs. 36,000 crore, he said a pittance of Rs. 100 crore was grossly unfair.The allocation for Visakhapatnam Metro is a big joke, he said.He said Mr. Naidu should take the Opposition parties and other peoples associations into confidence and fight for the States right.Development in AP is not commensurate with the Centres expectations. Much hype is generated on the new capital but projects have not been implemented, said O. Srinivas, an advocate from Visakhapatnam. AP also should start making its own efforts, he opines.SlowdownIn Srikakulam, leaders have expressed worry over the possibility of unrest among unemployed youth due to slowdown in economic activity as a direct result of inadequate funds at disposal.

Uneconomic expenditure in AP like the Rs. 2,000 crore allotted to Krishna Pushkarams, may not be compensated by the Centre. The government has very few avenues to generate funds. It should encourage productive activities, says L.S.N. Prasad, a Professor of Economics in Hindu College, Guntur.Former MP Yelamanchili Sivaji has a piece of advice for Naidu: Mr. Naidu must realise that it is not possible for a government to build cities. Across the world, cities have been built over years by public and private participation. Unless the AP government comes up with a clear road map for Capital construction and the Polavaram project, the Centre is not going to help it.Bleak futureExpressing concern over a bleak future, he says industrial development may not get the fillip it needs. The leader does not see the possibility of cordial BJP-TDP ties in future.The TDP has no intellectual depth to respond to issues like reservation or the debate on intolerance, he says. Mr. Jaitleys budget has triggered fresh worries for Chartered Accountants.There would be no job for Chartered Accountants in general and small accountants in particular. The budget is neither investor-friendly nor encouraging for the IT sector, says Seshagiri Varaprasad, a CA from Rajamahendravaram.Balanced allocationWhile the Centre is right in making judicious and balanced allocation to all States, the BJP government should have considered APs case which is at the crossroads post-bifurcation, said D. Sundar Ram, academician and social activist from Tirupati.Price riseSk. Arif Ahmad, a private employee, said the budget does not address the problems of an average employee who is at the receiving end of price rise."

This is utterly deplorable, he said.As the potato is sold at the rate of Rs. 18 a kg in market during the harvesting period, the three departments involved in the matter blame each other, he said.While State Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy claimed that potato production was not less as estimated, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said there has been 30 per cent less production of potato due to climate change.The BJP workers in Sambalpur burnt effigies of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Agriculture Minister Maharathy over the States alleged inability to meet the potato requirement. - PTI"

In all, 46 people died. Buildings shook as the wind speed breached the 200 kmph-mark and gusting peaked over 270 kmph.Thursdays threat of the cyclonic storm, Roanu, hitting the coast brought back the memories of Hudhud. But people heaved a sigh of relief as the cyclone passed by north coastal Andhra Pradesh on Friday afternoon.For the first time, probably, the people of the city were seen tracking the course of the cyclone closely.Being residents of a coastal city, we have experienced many cyclones. But Hudhud taught us a lesson and gave us a first-hand experience of what natures fury could be. And that is why we have been monitoring Roanu. We have not only been getting updates from the media and the IMD website but also visited the Cyclone Warning Centre to know about the latest, said B. Chatterjee, a resident.Many were seen stocking up provisions and eatables. People were seen rushing to rythu bazaars early on Friday morning, braving incessant downpour. Appa Rao, a vegetable seller, said, People turned up early and purchased vegetables such as potato and onion in bulk. Milk and bread were in high demand.Seventy-year-old Sudhakar, a retired government employee and resident of Akkayyapalem, went a step ahead by engaging a carpenter to reinforce the window panes with wooden poles.During Hudhud, six of my windows had been broken. I did not want to take risk. But now, I am a relieved man, he said.Maldivian wordIt has been a century-long convention to give a name to cyclonic systems across the world.

The Union earth sciences ministry today signed a 15-year contract with the International Seabed Authority to acquire exclusive exploration and research rights for 10,000sqkm of area in the central Indian Ocean, along the Central Indian Ridge and the Southwest Indian Ridge. The programme will look for polymetallic sulfides, materials that precipitate from fluids emerging from upwelling magma from the deep interior of the oceanic crust discharged through chimney-like structures on the seafloor, senior Indian scientists associated with seabed exploration said. Such polymetallic sulfides are expected to be rich in copper, gold, silver, platinum and zinc among other metals and are viewed as future sources of industrially useful metals. ""This is another step - we're preparing for a future where seabed mining becomes viable,"" said Madhavan Rajeevan, earth sciences secretary, who signed the agreement with Nii Allotey Oduntun, the secretary general of the International Seabed Authority, an agency set up under global sea law. This is the second time India has invested in real estate in the central Indian Ocean. India's department of ocean development had in 1987 acquired similar exploration and research rights for a 75,000sqkm area in the central Indian Ocean basin to look for polymetallic nodules, potato-shaped and rich in cobalt and nickel. The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, and the Institute for Minerals and Metals Technology (IMMT), Bhubaneswar, both laboratories under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, have been involved in experimental extraction and processing of polymetallic nodules from the earlier site. ""We've established the technology to process 500kg per day nodules to extract cobalt and nickel,"" Kali Sanjay, project coordinator for the polymetallic nodules programme at IMMT, told The Telegraph. ""But the extraction of the nodules from the seabed itself is challenging and not economic yet."" India has very little land-based resources of nickel and cobalt, metals that are used in steel and other industries to make key alloys. ""Seabed mining is a long-term goal, but it needs years and years of preparatory activities to reach the seabed, mine the nodules and process them,"" another scientist said. The NIO has during experimental extractions used ""boomerang grabs"" or freefall grabs - devices dropped to the bottom of the sea - to collect the polymetallic nodules. Seabed surveys by the NIO suggest that the abundance of nodules varies from traces to about 25kg per sqm of the seabed. China, South Korea, and Germany are also engaged in similar seabed exploration in the central Indian Ocean."

Telegraph pictures Ranchi, Feb. 1: Farmers at Maramdega reaped a bumper wheat crop this season to usher in grand post-harvest celebrations, thanks to a pilot project that helped revive irrigation facilities at this non-descript village in Simdega district. Another village, Tamra, barely 10km away, scripted a similar success story over the last month, all thanks to the tireless efforts of Simdega deputy commissioner (DC) Vijoy Kumar Singh who has made it his mission to ensure that the administration intervenes in areas where a little help can go a long way in improving the lives of the people. Residents of both Maramdega and Tamra villages, on opposite ends of the district, have always been hard working. But, their diligence never yielded enough for a decent living. But, life took a positive turn in December last year when Singh decided to first adopted Maramdega in Tethaitanger block, and then Tamra, both around 10km from the district headquarters, and develop them as model villages. At Maramdega, to start with, the administration rejuvenated a dead canal on the left bank of Kelaghagh dam on Chhinda river and repaired another one on the right bank. Soon, prosperity began to flow, resulting in record wheat production. The harvest not only helped villagers recover the cultivation costs but also provided financial stability along with two square meals a day for their families. Food taken care of, the villagers have now asked their children to return to school. ""Barely Rs 5.12 lakh was spent on repairing the canals, which are now irrigating over 3,000 acres. Wheat and vegetable productivity, especially onion and potato, have improved significantly. All the villagers are now sending their children to school,"" DC Singh told The Telegraph. At Tamra, the administration helped residents get water from Kansjore dam on Sankh river. They haven't looked back since. ""I observed that the people of both Maramdega and Tamra were hard working, but doomed to fend for themselves in the absence of any support from the official machinery,"" said Singh, who took charge of the district around six months ago. Word is spreading about the transformation of Maramdega and Tamra. The Prime Minister's Office is learnt to have taken note. And yesterday, during his visit to Simdega, chief minister Raghubar Das appreciated Singh's efforts and also praised police for the return of peace in the area earlier terrorised by Maoists and criminals. ""It is because of DC Singh's hard work and dedication that Maramdega has become a model village. SP Rajeev Ranjan Singh is also doing a good job. Other officers may take lessons,"" Das said in his address to local residents during his Yojana Banao Abhiyan. Singh, who had already added two more to his list of model villages - Garhbasin in Kersai block and Hatem in Kurdeg block - is now looking to add another. He has been visiting Kenduda village regularly. Tomorrow he is going there with a group of officials to finalise a roadmap for developing the area. ""No one objects to development work. I move around freely in these remote areas without armed bodyguards. I want to make this a hub of forest produce,"" Singh said about Kenduda in Bano, around 38km from the district headquarters, and traditionally known for lac cultivation. Simdega MLA and former minister Vimla Pradhan has also appreciated Singh's initiatives and promised all help. ""I facilitated the release of Rs 35 lakh for MGNREGS work in the area, which may be undertaken to clean up canals and other water bodies. I have also requested the chief minister to extend financial assistance from other heads for the betterment of Simdega,"" she said. Enthused by the success, Singh has now set a target of 100 villages to develop - 10 from each of the 10 blocks in Simdega district. Apart from irrigations facilities, Singh said, the administration would also take steps to improve healthcare, education and physical infrastructure at all model villages."

""I have just been quaffing the best gol-gappas in Delhi! I tell you they're the best!"" Like any true Calcuttan, my phuchka-pride swelled up and cracked open. ""Nonsense! They can't be anywhere near as good as the ones my local guy sells down the road!"" A brief argument ensued, a verbal altercation that ended exactly as we both intended it to - we agreed to walk down the road to taste-test my local phuchkawallah's product. At the phuchka station we both took up our stances, my friend standing normally, holding her leaf-cup politely, like the well-brought-up Delhi-ite she is, and myself in a pose reminiscent of the great K. Srikkanth at the crease, legs far apart, body leaning forward, but as if the phuchkawallah was at silly point, and with my leaf-cup thrust out. Presently, the holed and armed sphericals began landing in our cups at speed. My friend soon adjusted her stance to avoid the phuchka water sloshing out of her cup and I began to laugh with the nastiness only found in Calcuttans exposing unsuspecting outsiders to Cal phuchkas for the first time. ""Why are they so thin?"" My friend complained, ""I can hardly get them into my mouth before they disintegrate! The stuffing keeps falling out!"" Between expertly crunched mouthfuls I explained to her that sitting at a table in Green Park or Bengali Market and gently eating the rhino-skinned, so-called gol-gappas did not a phuchka-gourmand make. ""This is the real thing. It's supposed to be thin. And you're supposed to eat it in... well, in a phuchka-quick moment!"" My visitor remained unconvinced and unimpressed: the things were not only too fragile - both the Delhi varieties, normal and suji, held their load better - but also too sour and jhaal, lacking the sweet balancing tang of imli ki chutney, and besides, the potatoes in Calcutta were cooked to an over-spiced mush whereas in Delhi the alu was simply boiled, but boiled perfectly. Later, I referred our quarrel to a fellow Gujarati friend, unlike me someone who wasn't born and brought up in phuchka-ville but in that other place on the other coast. ""What kind of Gujju are you?"" He sneered. ""What are all these gol-gappa and phuchka pretensions? It's paani- puri. It was born in Bombay. Invented by Gujjus. 'We are the authentic only' as they say here, and we have the best, original paani-puri, bas!"" Much as I hated to give any quarter to anything in Vadaa-pau-ville, and even as I was missing the suji puris served by a certain gol-gappa dispenser in Mukherjee Nagar in north Chhola-bhatura-pur, I remembered the echt-Gujarati paani-puri parties of my childhood and felt a twinge - the guy had a point, the balance between chilli, sour and sweet, the complexity and variety of the stuffing masalas, the texture of the puris themselves... aah. A few days after this, I found myself playing a return match in Delhi, eating gol-g's at Bengali Market, satisfying my suji-puri urge. It was then that I realized the truth: the best phuchka/gol-gappa/paani-puri is the one you are just about to insert into your cavernously open mouth. Unless of course you happen to be in one of those recent chains that have opened in London, their names woven with words such as 'spice' and 'masala' to connote some coolly hot South Asian chilliness, their gol-puri-phuchkas a travesty of the real things, made all the more painful by costing 7.50 + vat for four under-flavoured specimens. If London is a city overloaded with a choice of the different cuisines of the world, all of them over-priced, many of them Europified or Britishofied, then Calcutta is the opposite - the top grub here is what has been the best since at least half-a-century, if not longer. The traditional local street food is among the most interesting in the world; the different Bangla cuisines are amazing, though many subtleties and variations can still only be found in people's homes and not in restaurants; there is a decent smattering of stuff from other parts of India that has evolved here, such as Anglo-Indian, Calcutta-Awadhi, Punjabi/ Mughlai; and a smaller selection of more or less 'authentic' subcontinental food from the Northeast and south India and so on. International food of some quality is available, but only in the five-star fortresses. In comparison, being in Delhi and not London or Calcutta, has its advantages. Delhi has its own great cuisines, the Mughlai, the Bania vegetarian, the various street foods. Then it has the tributary cuisines from other Indian regions: from Chettinad, Kerala and Andhra to Kashmiri wazwan, from a great variety of northeastern food to Gujarati, Rajasthani and Konkani, and not excluding the centre of Chitto Park where you'll get some of the best Bangla khabar outside Bengal itself. But then, besides this already large variety, Delhi has something else, something which Calcutta desperately needs but is unlikely to get soon. Delhi has middle-priced (that is, considerably lower priced than five-star) restaurants that don't over-emphasize this business of 'authenticity'. For nearly 30 years Delhi has had an abundance of Italian, Thai, French and such places, so the whole obsession with claiming to be being 'real' and 'genuine' has lessened somewhat. What has replaced this in terms of excitement is a bunch of places where the menu displays a combination of skill and knowledge of international approaches to cooking with a stress on local produce, sometimes mixed with selectively picked international imports. So, yes, briefly touring the penumbra of the elite zone recently, I ate a pretty authentic Mexican dinner at a price that was less than rapacious - the dishes tasted 'authentic', the chillies were not local lal mirch but chipotle, ancho and cascabel, the mole was of proper bean, and so on. What preceded the food, though, were cocktails of tequila and tamarind which worked really well. Similarly, there was another dinner where the menu included words like 'medallions' and 'sous- vide', but ultimately one rediscovers one's basic roots in the most unexpected places. So, in an eatery attached to a museum, a place that's made a culinary reputation for itself, a place without a liquor licence, in a crowded, buzzing environment - what you might call 'lunch'. The menu, by the standard of today's Delhi prices, displays a very reasonable right hand column but that's not what catches one's eye or palate. The food here is inspired by traditional fare from all over the country, non-fancy, beautifully made, inventively taking off from the different regional traditions. There are mini rava idlis, there is a very nice take on sabudana bhajiyas, but most beautiful of all is a version of our very own Calcutta beetroot 'chop', a patty that's balled, breaded and lightly fried, accompanied by a ' masala cream cheese' dip. It reminds me of all the good and ghastly wedding catering I have encountered in Calcutta and it transcends all of it, but with easy humility, with no pomp or pretension. There is a whole tour of India in between, from Assamese black chicken in tingmo bread to paneer wittily sandwiched between white dhoklas, but at the end you again come face to face with Bengal: there are crpes involving coconut and notun gur, and then a bhapa doi cheesecake that is truly wonderful. To round off our culinary detour, there is also a dessert I didn't try, where western India clearly meets the northern part of the country, something called ""Mahabaleshwar Strawberry Golgappe - crispy semolina puffs stuffed with strawberry and cream"". This is not fancy food. If you look at the prices you would pay far more silly money in Calcutta, eating boring old Park Street restaurant fare. This is not food that depends on manchego cheese or miso sauce for effect - it has nothing to do with Spain or Japan. Where this and one or two other Delhi places have happily stolen from is the street food available all over the country, tweaking it, bending its ear, slapping and caressing it a little, to produce a very clean and original set of tastes. Which brings me back to my original point - the mother-in-law of tradition was also once the shy bride of innovation, authenticity- saas bhi kabhi originality-bahu thi."

In doing so, it will join the league of universities such as University of Illinois, University of Massachusetts, Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and IIT-Jodhpur closer home. The upcoming varsity in Rajgir will also focus on economic development of its neighbourhood villages. The university plans to generate power from solar photovoltaic panels, which will be fitted above water bodies on the campus. It would generate power from rice husk, biomass and other renewable sources. According to Nalanda University professional adviser A.R. Ramanathan, as the varsity will meet much of its energy requirement through rice husk and biomass, help and cooperation from villagers will be required. He said: ""The university will purchase rice husk, cow dung and biodegradable waste from nearby villages for power generation."" (Non-biodegradable waste does not break down for many years. Plastics, plastic grocery bags, plastic water bottles, metal and glass are examples of non-biodegradable waste.) Sources said 1 tonne of rice paddy produces around 220kg of rice husk. Similarly, 1 tonne of rice husk produces around 400-550kWh. (kWh is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilowatts and the time in hours.) Sources said the benefits of rice husk technology are numerous as by-products of rice husk, can be used in cement and steel industries. According to Nalanda University officials, farmers selling rice husk and biodegradable waste stand to benefit as regions across Rajgir and Nalanda have an agrarian society with high production of paddy and potatoes. Moreover, the role of university will not be confined to just purchasing raw material from villagers. A team of the university will also enlighten the villagers about the technology. Elaborating the point with an example, Ramanathan said: ""Much of the water requirement will be met from a centrally located pond. The university will focus on harvesting rainwater. Big towers will be constructed to act as air-conditioners. These towers will suck in the outside air, absorb moisture and release it inside the campus."" The university construction work will begin from March-end. Nalanda University vice-chancellor Gopa Sabharwal said: ""The university's academic activities are not just confined to classroom teachings. As part of their curriculum, our students have been visiting nearby villages and interacting with the residents there, imparting knowledge and seeking their cooperation."" The villagers, naturally, are delighted. Ram Naresh Singh, a resident of Rajgir, said: ""We are happy that Nalanda University will help us in social and economic development. It should also focus on educational development of the region. The town is so educationally backward that it doesn't even have a single college to cater to the needs of its residents."" Singh, who runs a grocery shop at the Rajgir market, added: ""The university should take initiatives to open colleges for the youths here. Not everyone here will get a chance to study at Nalanda University."" Colleges and universities essentially operate as self-contained small cities, providing huge amounts of energy to its campuses. Given the large energy needs of our college campuses, combined with the social conscience of today's faculties and students, it is not surprising that institutions across the world are beginning to take a leading role in development and implementation of renewable energy projects."

Telegraph picture Finally, things have started moving in the right direction at the Jharkhand Mega Food Park at Getalsud, on the outskirts of capital Ranchi, providing a much-needed impetus to the long-delayed facility that is eyeing debut in the next couple of months. Kitchenmate, a firm owned by Ranchi-based entrepreneur Seema Jain and one of the first six companies to have shown interest in setting up shops, held bhumipoojan at the food park in Angara block, around 25km from the city, on Sunday. The Rs 4.75-crore unit, which has been allotted a one-acre plot, is likely to come up in five-six months. Kitchenmate managing director Seema (51) said the unit would process tomato, green chilli, garlic, tamarind etc for preparing paste/pure, ketchup and batter for idli, dosa, and bada under ready-to-cook and ready-to-serve categories. ""It will take another five-six months to complete the construction and start operations. We will procure vegetables from Bundu and Tamar blocks of Ranchi district, apart from Gumla and Lohardaga, for the unit with an installed capacity of 5MT ready-to-cook produces per day and 4MT ready-to-serve products per day,"" she told The Telegraph. Seema, a postgraduate in applied chemistry from Bhopal University, is a first generation entrepreneur. She and her husband Suresh Jain, who is a PhD in environmental sciences, are very enthusiastic about this venture that proposes to employ 20 local people for operations and maintenance. Food park project manager Rakesh Sahay said the Kitchenmate unit would help farmers earn better returns on their vegetables grown in different parts of Jharkhand, apart from making better use of forest produces. Kitchenmate is one of the six food processing companies, with interests ranging from tomato puree to green peas and cashew nut processing, that are expected to set up units soon at the 56-acre park, which can accommodate as many as 30 units. The other five - Eastern Manufacturing & Exports (frozen potato patties), Raha Enterprises (frozen snacks), Vijay Cashew Processing (cashew nut processing) and Mishti Foods & Engineering (tomato powder and vegetable dehydration) and Jharkhand Green Peas (green peas processing) - are likely to follow suit soon. Their cumulative investment will be around Rs 20 crores. Sources said the Rs 114 crore mega food park, the foundation of which was laid way back in 2009 by then Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay, was likely to be inaugurated within a couple of months. The park will have facilities like cold storage, warehouses, ripening chamber, water storage, power supply and effluent treatment plant (ETP) for the use of food processing units."

Picture by Bhola Prasad Jamshedpur, Feb. 2: Volunteers joined forest department staff to patrol Gerua village all night long till the wee hours of today to instil a sense of confidence among villagers, traumatised by the mysterious deaths of two elephants at a wheat farm, barely 12 km from here, yesterday. The team, with all 18 members of Van Samiti (VS), a registered outfit of villagers who work in tandem with the forest department to protect the wildlife, went around the village on the foothills of Dalma wildlife sanctuary for nearly six hours from 10pm last night till 4am this morning. Armed with searchlights the team travelled in three forest department jeeps. ""Besides our men and Van Samiti members, we also engaged trackers (village youths employed as daily wagers to keep a tab on the movement of elephants and other animals) in the exercise. The joint patrolling will continue for some weeks,"" Dalma range officer R.P. Singh told The Telegraph. Two elephants, male and a female, were found dead at a wheat farm at Gerua village early yesterday morning. The exact cause of their deaths is yet to be ascertained with forest officials looking at twin possibilities _ either the animals had consumed pesticide or they had been electrocuted. Post-mortem reports are awaited, while viscera samples have been sent to the forensic laboratory of the animal husbandary department in Ranchi to ascertain the cause of death. The decision to launch joint patrolling in the village was taken at a meeting between Dalma officials and members of Van Samiti at Makulakocha village, the main entry point to the sprawling 192sqkm Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary late last evening. Besides Dalma divisional forest officer Kamlesh Pandey and ranger Singh, 15 Van Samiti members were also present at the meeting. Singh said they decided on joint patrolling to prevent elephants from damaging crops at Gerua. ""We intend to develop a sense of confidence among villagers. Gerua residents are aggrieved about yesterday's incident and have promised to co-operate with us,"" he explained. Samiti member Kanu Tudu said patrolling was carried out in the entire village. ""We also went near the farms and scanned the area with searchlights and torches. We also carried crackers with us to scare away elephants if they were there."" Gerua village, along the elephant corridor from Dalma to West Midnapore and Bankura in Bengal, is home to around 1,000 people. It has often been at the receiving end of elephant attacks. An elephant herd rampaged the village on January 28. Don, Dalma's maverick tusker, had devoured a potato farm in March last year."

Researchers presenting their latest findings on the subject note that Indians  even from the relatively better-off sections of society  arent eating enough fruits and vegetables to get the preventive health-care benefits from this food group.Though it is the world's second-highest producer of fruits and vegetables, India doesnt seem to be able to turn this to its advantage, notes a recently released research study titled A snapshot of fruits and vegetable consumption: availability and implications for phytonutrient intake, which has tried to understand the actual consumption patterns of fruits and vegetables in India vis--vis global recommended levels for adults.The World Health Organization (WHO) panel on diet, nutrition and prevention of chronic diseases recommends a daily intake of at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables (five daily servings of around 80 grams each), excluding potatoes, cassava and other starchy tubers, to prevent diet-related chronic diseases and micronutrient deficiencies. The study notes that we fall terribly short of the recommendation.This finding is part of the Indias Phytonutrient Report brought out by a Delhi-based think tank, the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which conducted the study across five cities  Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata covering 1,001 individuals from the upper and middle income groups. The worst eating habits [on these parameters] are of youngsters and working adults, says Arpita Mukherjee, one of the authors of the report.The study notes that while Chennai tops the list in terms of servings of vegetables and fruits, Kolkata is the worst. Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR and Mumbai occupy the second, third and fourth positions respectively. On average, the Indian diet pattern is skewed towards cereals with fruits and vegetables accounting for only nine per cent of the total calorie intake. The rise in prices of food items has played a major role in rising household expenditure, explains Ms. Mukherjee.The study found that the average intake of fruits and vegetables is 3.5 servings per day [of 80 grams each], with the average intake of the younger generation even lower  2.97 servings per day and 3.42 servings per day for the age groups of 18-25 and 25-35 respectively. Income plays an important role  the average daily intake is higher for the higher income group. We found that housewives do better in terms of fruits and vegetable intake with an average of 3.65 servings as compared to a working person who has 3.5 servings a day, adds Ms. Mukherjee.The study also found variation across diet types: intake of fruits/vegetables is 3.97 servings for a person on the so-called Jain diet, 3.87 for a vegetarian, 3.43 for an eggetarian and 3.2 for a non-vegetarian.bindu.p@thehindu.co.in"
58f4c48da3d24b0b70c19387,Requiem for the BDD chawls,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Requiem-for-the-BDD-chawls/article14017370.ece,2016-01-24,,The Hindu,"t appears that by now it is well-nigh impossible to delink my two protagonists, Ravan and Eddie, from Central Works Department (CWD) chawl No. 17 in the public imagination. But the mother of all chawls in Mumbai has been that complex of 121 tenement buildings which went up in Worli in the 1920s and another 86 in Naigaon, Sewri, and N.M. Joshi Marg. Bombay was already turning into a booming metropolis and desperately needed housing for locals as well as migrant labourers who came in the thousands to the city. So the Bombay Development Directorate (aka Bombay Development Department) got into the act and built the three-storeyed BDD chawls. Each dark tenement was 160 square feet with common bathrooms and toilet facilities on each floor. Often, three generations, sometimes even four, lived under the same roof and at the same time. In all, the BDD chawls were home to 16,500 families.The BDD prototype was duplicated with variations all over Mumbai, especially by mill owners who were heavily dependent on migrant labour. There was a time before the cotton mills strike of the 1980s when a chawl too would have three shifts of people staying in a room. The chawls have always been a mirror image of the city. Various castes and outcastes, now called the Dalits, lived cheek by jowl though tensions ran deep under the surface. In 1974, the BDD chawls witnessed the worst Dalit Panther-Shiv Sena skirmishes. Somewhere in the third novel of the Ravan & Eddie trilogy, I mention that the CWD chawls were built as solidly as the pyramids. What I had at the back of my mind were the BDD chawls. You have to grant our past British masters one thing. There was no compromise on their workmanship. Unlike their later compromised counterparts, the BDD buildings are monumentally strong and the 1974 disturbances did them little harm. Forty-two years later, they are still in great shape.The water warsBy any standards, the BDD chawls are cramped, inhuman hovels. The two other major problems in the chawls have always been water and toilets. Heres a short excerpt from The Water Wars from my novel, Ravan & Eddie : . the prime mover of life is water. You snapped out of anaesthesia, interrupted coitus, stopped your prayers, postponed your sons engagement, developed incontinence, took casual leave to go down and stand at the common tap, cancelled going to church because water, present and absent, is more powerful than the Almighty... The municipal tap is the original cornucopia. It is plugged into the mains and supplies water twenty-four hours of the day. Twenty-four hours as you know, is a flexi-time concept in our country, and can stretch between three to four hours. Thats on the good days. The timings are fixed. When the water comes, you know its come.And heres a bit from Rest in Peace , the third novel in the trilogy, where Ravan and Eddies friend Asmaan is speaking: Ive yearned, and how, for a single toilet all to myself so that I could take a crap without ten or fifteen people knocking on the door telling me to hurry up even before I had squatted and often the knocking got so urgent, I had to close shop, barely managing to wash my arse. Dont blush (Ravan), you too have been through the same. I wanted to pee to my hearts content instead of always reminding myself not to drink too much water because then you cant control the faucet.No notion of privacyOne of the most traumatic and overlooked tragedies of the BDD way of life was sex. The notion of privacy is totally absent in chawl life. Perhaps the most successful creation of the legendary Marathi humourist, P.L. Deshpande, was Batatyachi chawl (the potato chawl). It is a celebration of the perpetually open and shared public life in chawls. But there is one taboo subject: sex. Remember that there are always anywhere between six to 16 people lying almost on top of each other in a tenement. And yet, what is never talked of in this sentimentalised version of chawls is the fact that sex in this set-up is always rushed, always stolen. Theres something underhand, unspoken and almost dirty about it. And the worst victims are almost always the wives.The coloniser and colonisedThe British colonisers were not interested in do-gooding and the amelioration of the local population. It is the nature of the beast called the coloniser to exploit the colonised to the hilt. In 1947, India won independence and the whole country, especially the poor chawl-dwellers, had good reason to think that in a few decades they would see better days. Surely their own leaders would recognise that even the poor have as much right to space, light, air and a full stomach as anybody else. And that architecture is about imbuing life with dignity. What they had not factored in was that their own leaders and politicians would turn out to be supra neo-colonisers who would seek every opportunity for their personal greed and gain to short-change their own people.When the mill owners were finally allowed to sell their mill lands, the precondition laid down by the courts was that one-third of the land should house the chawl-dwellers who worked in the cotton mills. Now how demanding or, rather, greedy can the poor get? The triad of politicians, real estate developers and the mafia grabbed almost all the land for fancy housing projects and generously packed the original residents into six-and-seven-storeyed, 200 or 250 sq. feet hellholes while building 40 and 60-storeyed luxury high-rises next to them for the privileged and gated rich.Over the decades one has often heard that the government would raze the BDD chawls to the ground and give more spacious housing to the former residents. Talk and promises come cheap in our country while the BDD chawls march towards a centenary. Now, once again, there is talk of knocking them down and replacing the 160 sq. ft with 500 or 550 sq. ft apartments. Who knows, maybe this time the government means business. There is much jubilation, we hear, in the BDD chawls. May I introduce a note of caution? Postpone the celebrations. Wait and watch whether all the talk is just hot air. Look at the small print  perhaps the right term is invisible print. The real estate developers along with our wonderful leaders from every political party may very likely be planning to do you out of hearth and home.(Kiran Nagarkar is a Mumbai-based novelist and playwright.)Somewhere in the third novel of the Ravan & Eddie trilogy, I mention that the CWD chawls were built as solidlyas the pyramids.

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe cost of Vellores favourite brinjal, the thorny variety, has shot up in the last few days. Traders attribute the increase in rate to poor yield following rain.A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam said the thorny brinjal was cultivated in many parts of the district such as Kollaimedu, Usoor and Chenganatham.People in Vellore mostly prefer to eat thorny brinjal than those supplied from other parts of the State such as Krishnagiri and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. It is like Vellores own variety and is fast-moving as it is fresh when brought to the market. However, the yield is poor due to rain, as the flowers are damaged.Hence, the rate has gone up from Rs.30-Rs.40 to Rs.60-Rs.80 per kg, he said. Apart from this, the rates of majority of vegetables continue to be normal. A kilo of tomatoes is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while onions cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18. Potatoes cost Rs. 25, while small onions are priced at Rs. 30.The rate of beans, which was earlier high, has also come down from Rs.60-80 to Rs.30 now, he added.

Also, chances of the potato attracting late blight at this stage are rare.This year, potato has been cultivated on around 10,000 hectares of land in the district. The crop has been in a good state all over the district, prompting farmers to hope for good returns. As the crop has survived for 60 days, there are no chances of late blight again this year, A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, told The Hindu recently.The climate, this year, has been helpful. As there was no incessant downpour for days, the late blight could not spread. Growers have to be thankful for the climate. If there was a continuous downpour in July, there were chances of the occurrence of late blight this year too, the officer said.The Horticulture Department had procured 2,035 tonnes of certified seeds from Jalandhar and sold them to the farmers at a subsidised price. About the yield in the farms where certified seeds were sown, the tubers are uniform. On the other hand, over 9,000 tonnes of non-certified seeds were also sold in the district. Going by the yield this year, a good number of farmers may shift to potato next year, the officer said.Farmers of Hassan have been growing potato for years.

Suraj said: ""We sell only prescribed medicines. If someone places an order with us, s/he has to scan the prescription on to the website. The prescription is checked and verified by a team of doctors and pharmacists associated with us. We want to launch the venture in Patna to provide the people the same kind of infrastructure and network. If needed, we also contact the doctor who has prescribed the medicine to make sure the prescription is not fake. We have faced no problems in Delhi so far, and hope things will work out in Patna too. We are in talks with the government if we need any clearance."" Ritesh (32) started www.homezifi.com, in December last year. A graduate from Ranchi, Ritesh worked in different Patna companies for eight years before deciding to be his own boss. Now, his team provides Patna residents all kind of services. ""You need a technician for your air conditioner, we have it; you need pest control, we provide it. Working for myself and not just for a salary at the end of the month has been a different experience altogether. I started in December last year. We are getting four to five orders on an average a day,"" said Ritesh. ""For the services, 80 per cent of the charge goes to the technician and we keep the rest. We are still in the process of creating a database of technicians in almost every locality of Patna."" Amritanshu (34), a software engineer from Pune University, launched his online grocery store GangaFresh.com last Independence Day. Now, he looks forward to big names entering the market so that there is healthy competition in the sector. ""Right now, we do not have a local storehouse but are connected with grocery stores and collect things and deliver to the people's doorsteps. We are in the midst of developing a mobile application for our customers. We are building the business from scratch and we reached an average 10 deliveries a day in the second month of operation. Besides, we offer dry cleaning services too,"" said Amritanshu. ""We have come to know that Bigbasket (online grocery store operating in several cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and Mysore) is coming to Patna. It will have a local storehouse too. The entry of big players is a good sign and will be good for business. Patna already has Gotmybasket and it is functioning well,"" added Amritanshu who has earlier worked in Microsoft among other companies. Industrialists welcomed the coming up of these new entrepreneurs. Satyajit Kumar Singh, who started an e-commerce venture for selling gorgon nuts two years ago, said: ""It is a good initiative and these men should strive to search for new ventures. If they are shunning traditional jobs and venturing into startups, it is a positive sign for society. But they will have to work very hard and try and develop a model which will allow them to make profit from day one."""

That was the magic recipe for the second edition of Young Chef Olympiad, presented by IIHM and held in association with t2. And after the rigorous six-day competition - cooking and plating countless dishes, making friends, exploring new cities - Canada girl Daniella Germond emerged victorious. ""I didn't think I would win but then they announced my name and I couldn't believe it... it was crazy!"" said the 21-year old from Ontario's Canadian Food and Wine Institute. The girl who likes spicy food beat 10 other contestants from USA, Hong Kong, Mauritius, UAE, Switzerland, Finland, Romania, Paris, Kenya and Mexico, and pocketed a cool $10,000. Last year, 15 countries participated in YCO, the numbers ladle-vaulting to 51 this year. From Australia to Armenia, Philippines to Peru, South Korea to Spain, multiple cultures blended and bonded. ""I'm proud and humbled to see the whole world assembled together in Calcutta for this historic occasion. This platform is for bringing all the young chefs from the culinary institutes under a common mandate, a mandate to learn, teach and network and to grow together,"" said Suborno Bose, the chief mentor and CEO of IIHM and the IndiSmart Group, at the closing ceremony on Monday at Wet-O-Wild, Nicco Park. The Olympiad began in Delhi on January 27 where all the contestants were divided into three groups and sent to three different cities - Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai - for the first leg. All 51 contestants were then brought to Calcutta for two rounds of the final heats. The top 11 contestants battled it out for the YCO trophy at a final cook-off on February 1 at Sector V's IndiSmart Hotel where Daniella brought home the bacon. Each contestant had to cook one chicken dish, one fish dish and a common dessert (Floating Islands also called Oeufs a la Niege in French) within three hours. ""Time always gets the best of you, but I had a game plan and managed to overcome my hiccups. I had to come up with a different application of my chicken at the last minute but I figured it out,"" Daniella told Metro, before she knew she was the winner. Her first winning dish was Confit Chicken Leg with Braised Cabbage, Potato Gnocchi and Balsamic Reduction, and the second was Pan Seared Sea Bass with Kaffir-scented Rice, Roasted Cauliflower, Crisp Leek and Spinach Yogurt Puree. If that sounds like quite a mouthful, it was. ""The taste of the Confit Chicken Leg was exceptional. She actually did two types of chicken in one dish - one was the crispy chicken with a skin on and the other was a roulade that took a lot of time but it came out really well. The fish was perfectly cooked and the presentation stood out. Her dessert was well set. The anglaise sauce went really well with the strawberries and the meringues were perfect,"" said YCO judge Andy Varma, whose London-based company Maia by the AC is the official caterer to the British royal household. Fernando Andres Guajardo Moguel from Mexico and Johan Kurkela from Finland took home the bronze, while UAE's Gabriela Aleksandrova Hristova was declared first runner-up. The winners took the stage at the prize distribution ceremony at Nicco Park, with some gurus of the culinary world - Sanjeev Kapoor, Andy Varma, Udo Leick, Shaun Kenworthy, Kunal Kapur, Sabyasachi Gorai (Saby), Abhijit Saha, Manjit Singh Gill, Andreas Muller, Ranveer Brar and David Foskett. If the Olympiad trophy went to Canada, Calcutta was applauded for making an event of this scale happen. ""The Young Chef Olympiad is a fantastic initiative coming out of Calcutta. What the judges looked for in these six days was how the chefs of the future are going to take this industry forward. We were looking for that special star - someone with the real techniques and skills to be a global success - who can be a role model and inspiration for all young people to join the hospitality industry,"" said David Foskett, the chairman of the YCO jury, at the closing ceremony. Young chefs aside, the other star of the evening was Usha Uthup, who crooned Skyfall, the lyrics echoing the essence of YCO - Skyfall is where we start/ A thousand miles and poles apart/ Where worlds collide.... Now, that's some food for thought to, well, bond over."

BJP state executive committee members met in Puri to chalk out its future plans today, while the BJD held an orientation camp in Bhubaneswar asking its leaders to become tech-savvy and take advantage of social media platforms. ""Our leaders should make best possible use of social media,"" said chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik while addressing the party workshop here. Naveen asked the party leaders to reach out to the people with the message of achievements of his government. The state BJP unit, on the other hand, prepared a blueprint for the coming days at its state executive meeting today. This was the first meeting of the state executive after the reconstitution of the state team headed by Basant Kumar Panda. The state executive passed a political resolution expressing concern over the slow pace of development in the state, while it thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for paying special attention to the ""backward"" state. Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram and Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan attended the meeting. ""The 2016-17 state budget has presented a dismal economic scenario of the state. Out of the Rs 94,000 crore estimated budget proposals, the lion's share is central grants and tax devolution, which account for 48 per cent. On the other hand, the state's own revenue income has been estimated at Rs 45,104 crore. The state government has proposed to avail a loan of Rs 16,000 crore to meet the revenue shortfall,"" said the political resolution. Referring to the poor performance of the state in agriculture and allied sector, the state executive observed that the state was facing acute scarcity of potato as the state is able to produce 2 lakh metric tonnes against the demand of 10 lakh metric tonnes, which has triggered price rise of the tuber. The milk production in the state only accounts for 2 per cent of the country's production. Criticising the BJD government, the BJP executive said it had been able to rule the state for more than one and half a decade as the main opposition party Congress has failed in its constitutional responsibility. ""The party will expose the failures and misdeeds of the state government through a series of agitation programmes. It will also highlight the ""pro-development"" stand of the Modi government at the centre,"" said state BJP president Basant Kumar Panda."
58f4cd78a3d24b0b70c19948,Food on the go,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Food-on-the-go/article15897355.ece,2016-11-01,,The Hindu,"Over the last few weeks I have been on a whirlwind series of travel for work and vacation  and I have taken all sorts of transport  flight, rail, bus, car, hikes, the works. For me, food and travel are inherently connected, like so many of us. And so, I found myself abandoning my Kindle to observe just how the nature of food we eat as we travel has changed.A toddler ambled across our coachs corridor, his beaming face crumpling when he saw his brother tucking into a packet of Kurkure. Kudkude, he yelled, his hand outstretched, trying to grab at that packet. His brother sulked as he was forced to share his precious stash, while the toddler settled into someones lap, happily nibbling at his Kudkude. He couldnt say Delhi  his uncle was trying to get him to say that, but he could say Kurkure. Priorities!On another train journey, a pair of tweens switched on their MacBook, attached a dongle, and promptly ordered themselves Dominos Pizza, after a fairly intense discussion about the toppings. The pizza, it seemed, was scheduled to reach home about the same time that we would all get home. Not to mention, it would be washed down by the accompanying bottles of cola. At the hotel we stayed in Binsar in Uttarakhand, a mother proudly told the wait staff that her son just loves Uncle Chipps, and no meal is complete without it. On another flight, the cup-o-noodles were what most families were ordering for their children.Our cities and villages are now dotted with little kiosks, where traditional local food such as podi idlis or banana chips are shoved aside by shiny packages of processed foods of all sorts. Our trekking guide at Binsar in Uttarakhand kept stopping to pick up remnants of such packaging that were littering his beloved forests, even though there were dustbins inside the sanctuary. Our walk in beautiful Andretta in Himachal Pradesh was strewn with packets of Uncle Chipps, Lays, and Kurkure, wrapped around plants and trees. All of this only underscores the many studies and research floating about  that Indians, including children, are taking to packaged and hyper-processed food with gusto. This, at great cost to our collective well being, including our childrens health.Many of us un-millennials (is that a word?) have fond food travel memories. Our family summer vacations would almost always commence with us lugging Milton flasks filled with ice and water onto the train. As the train trundled on, mum would produce crisp aloo nu shaak, potatoes cooked in their jackets Gujarati style, along with methi theplas, a dab of mango pickle, and of course dahi. In intervals, sev mambra would be produced, carefully stored in ziplock bags ordered from the USA aunt, as well as sliced fruits, and godpapdi. Yet now that weve grown up and have our own families, we dont always do that.Of course, as I grew older, I would often be embarrassed by this stash of food we carried along with us  whether it was to Baroda or to Cape Town. Its only now that I have come to appreciate the hard work that my mum put in, in the form of hours in the kitchen, to ensure that we would be well-fed through the trip.But then lets face it  all of this eating well takes effort and the burden almost always falls on the women of the household, unfairly so. I cook almost every day, but even the thought of producing that quantum of food is daunting for me. And its getting harder to trust street food  you dont know what oil or water it was cooked in, cut fruits and vegetables are a strict no-no, and it is often deep fried starchy food such as samosas, kachoris, or vada paos.Its not surprising that hard-pressed for time and with fewer healthier choices on sale, we are choosing to pick up ready-to-eats, convenience foods, outsourcing our food decisions to corporates. The difference is evident in the way we travel. We cant even be bothered to carry our own water bottles, preferring to buy plastic mineral water bottles instead. Who wants to lug about a steel water bottle when you can use and throw a plastic one. Never mind the environmental impact.Yet does it have to be all packaged, salty, additive-laden food that we need to pack into our travel schedule? Many of these food labels read like a sci-fi movie, undecipherable, straight out of a lab, rather than a farm. Now when I travel, I pack myself a sandwich or get my cook to make me a stack of theplas. Add some fruits and youre sorted for the journey. A friend carries homemade granola with her, another carries packets of puliyogare to mix into rice. On a trip to Madhya Pradesh, we looked at the unappetising train fare (no it wasnt the Shatabdi) and cheered up when a friend produced luchis and aloo sabji for dinner from her bags.

The Krishi Bhavan gives the support and farmers follow their traditional method of cultivation.A sum of Rs.22,500 has been given to the farmers under the Additional Tribal Sub-Plan scheme of the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) for each hectare. The tribal people, mostly women, are engaged in farming  from clearing the land to harvesting the crops.This provides additional income to the families and ensures timely harvesting.The climatic condition of the area is suited for vegetable cultivation in two seasons. Though it is in a rain shadow area, it receives two seasonal rains.The southwest monsoon is the best suited for vegetable cultivation as it rains mildly,' he said adding that the main cool season cultivation starts during this season.The vegetables for the Onam market is the prime business in Kanthallur.It has been found that the soil and climatic conditions in the tribal settlements are also suited for fruit production, he said adding that lemon, apple, and plums sapling developed by the horticulture research stations at Kodaikanal and Thandikudi are given to the settlers.However, one major problem to be faced by the farmers is transportation of the harvested crops from remote areas to the main market at Kanthallur.Mr. Murugesan said there are plans for providing transportation cost to the tribal farmers."
58f4d04c60de470aa339c084,Organic food in Sikkim hotels,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160219/jsp/siliguri/story_70119.jsp,2016-02-19,,Telegraph,"Gangtok, Feb. 18: Tourists visiting Sikkim will now have an option to order dishes made of organically grown vegetables in hotels and restaurants across the state. Earlier this month, the state tourism department had asked hoteliers to list at least one dish made of organic vegetables in their menu. The Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association, an apex body of hoteliers that has around 300 members, has agreed to the proposal. State agriculture minister Somnath Poudyal today said he will request each hotel and restaurant owner to adopt at least one village and procure organic items directly from the farmers there. ""I held a meeting with the association in Gangtok recently and requested the members to adopt at least one village (each) so that middlemen can be avoided. Farmers would be able to sell their produce to hoteliers directly,"" Poudyal said in a press conference today. ""Hoteliers have agreed in principle to include an organic dish in the menu but for that, they need regular supply. By adopting a village that practices organic farming, both farmers and hoteliers would be in a win-win situation."" Sikkim banned the use of fertilisers and pesticides in farming in 2008 and now, 74,000 hectare has been brought under organic cultivation across the state. Some of the locally grown organic vegetables are potatoes, spinach, peas, beans, tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers. On January 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Sikkim as the first state in the country to practise organic farming. However, the hotels and restaurants mostly use vegetables and fruits brought from Siliguri. ""We are yet to ascertain the total requirement but we are confident that locally grown vegetables are enough to cater to tourists in peak seasons. Organic items have high nutritional value"" said agriculture secretary, Khorlo Bhutia. President of Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association, Pema Lamtha, said they will discuss the proposal to adopt villages. ""We have agreed to include organic food in the menu although it might be slightly more expensive. We will hold a meeting with farmers to work out the modalities. The rates could be worked out later,"" he said. On February 8, tourism minister Ugen Gyasto Bhutia had requested hoteliers to serve organic food. ""We want at least two-three organic dishes in the menu. Items can be decided by the hoteliers,"" he said. He added that a notice with the appeal would be issued by the end of the month."
58f4d0a960de470aa339c11c,‘Please have some mercy’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/odisha/story_76448.jsp,2016-03-26,,Telegraph,"An internal rebellion has been cooking up in your party for the past two years. The difference of opinions among leaders, even ministers, have come to the fore. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout raised his voice against you on potato scarcity. What is happening? Our party is democratic. We may have some difference of opinion. Our outlook on a particular issue may be different. But, there is no question of dissension. When the leadership decides something, we all stand by it. Besides, Rout is a senior leader. If he advises something, we try to follow it. Sometimes, I give my views. But it should not be treated as serious difference of opinion. But, Rout has said that the potato crisis was caused by lack of co-ordination among various departments Ours is a potato-consuming state. We have 10 agro-climatic zones and each zone is identified with certain crops. We have not been able to produce the required amount of potato to meet our demands. Besides potato production has come down by 30 per cent in the neighbouring Bengal. With the launch of Potato Mission, we have come up with an integrated planning to meet the needs of tuber. This year, there will be a constant flow of potato to the market, but the price of potato will remain on the upper side. To overcome shortage of potato in the future, we are coming up with a number of cold storages. But will our dependence on Bengal continue? We have to depend on Bengal as it is a neighbouring state. Both on transport and economic grounds, it is advisable to bring in potato from Bengal. We have already told the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to rethink the issue and see how more trucks of potato can come from other parts of the country. Besides, the Centre has brought potato and onion under the purview of essential commodities. So now, there will be barrier-free movement of these two products. People are not getting rice under public distribution system as there are lapses in the distribution of ration cards. Genuine beneficiaries are not getting ration and bungling of ration cards has been a major issue As we have taken up the exercise, many lapses may occur. But we are trying to make it error-free. Once digitisation of ration cards is complete, all these issues will be sorted out. If mistakes are noticed, we will rectify those. But to bring 3.5 crore people under Food Security Act is a huge task. The state is demanding more rice. Do you expect the Centre to oblige? The people prefer rice. If the Centre forces us to take wheat, what can we do? We have put pressure on the Centre to give us required rice and not wheat. The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG) has found out a number of lapses in the technical education imparted even in government-run colleges. How do you react to the charges? After placement of the report in the Assembly, I have asked for compliance of the report from the department, particularly on the loopholes. Once it is over, I will be able to give you a clear picture on this issue. Question marks have been raised on the quality of technical education We are taking a number of steps to reform the technical education sector. Earlier, our students had to appear the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) and all-India JEE. But we have now opted for JEE so that our students compete at the all-India level. We have got the desired results as well. But technical education at the national level faces a number of hurdles. Employment opportunities have come down in the core subjects. But, there is a demand in computer and software-related subjects and the situation is not alarming. You had started a special recruitment drive for the technically qualified people. But it has been stopped midway We had prepared a vision chart taking 10 factors into account. We have been able to achieve five targets, such as winding up of the diploma entrance test, opting for the JEE (Mains) and a few other things. But in the case of recruitment drive, we have not achieved success so far. When we were preparing to move ahead in this matter and hold discussions with 23 industrial houses, a lot of politics took place over the issue. We had an aim that the government would provide the platform. As it has not been possible so far, the deemed universities and the respective colleges are doing their own campus recruitment. However, I agree that unemployment is still a major problem. You are in the news as your opponents have alleged that you had taken undue favour from money collection company Artha Tatwa by accepting an SUV I expect the media to be just. I have taken loan from Vijaya Bank to buy the SUV. This can be checked from the bank and from the regional transport officer (RTO) as well. If anyone has any doubts, they can approach the CBI. But people think that you had taken favour from the deposit collection company Please have some mercy. If I had taken the vehicle as gift from the company and someone proves it, I will consume poison and not show my face to anyone. Have some sympathy for me. Why are you not examining the documents which were circulated by my political opponents? Please verify the authenticity of the documents from the advocate generals office or from the CBI. Nearly 4,000 people from your constituency had taken out a rally from Brahmagiri and demanded arrest of Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra who had made these allegations The Congress had called a 12-hour Brahmagiri bandh on the issue. But the people of Brahmagiri have reposed their faith in me and they want to take the case to a logical end. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra had used some harsh words against you... The people of Brahmagiri and Odisha will decide this issue. But I will wait and will take proper action at the proper time. I express my deep regrets if I have ever used any foul language against my opponent in the media. I dont want to stoop to such a level where people will equate me with Mohapatra. I had also lost election in Brahmagiri in the past, but had never done any vilification of anyone. After I won the election, I was expecting the same democratic values. But no due recognition was given to the democratic process. What can I say if somebody crosses the limits and behaves like a mad person? Did you raise the issue with your party president? I have already informed him about all these political developments, particularly how I had got the SUV by taking loans from the bank. There is no need to explain to him in details as he had already experienced a bit of the political heat during his tour to Brahmagiri. You have been the BJD youth wing president for nine years. You are also closely associated with the decision-making processes of the party. There is a perception that both the BJD and the BJP have a tacit understanding even though your party continues to oppose some of Centres decisions We are maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Being a regional party, we have our regional aspirations. Our prime and foremost duty is to see that we should get our due from Centre. The tax should be equally distributed among the states and there should not be any regional disparity. Our demand for special category state should be given due importance and other issues, such as Polavaram irrigation project, which will submerge vast swathe of area, be addressed. That means you will continue with your demand for a special category state status? Yes. We will do it to fulfil the aspirations of the people of this region. While you are saying you are opposing the BJP-led government at the Centre, your actions dont show it. All of you, including your partys 20 MPs, remained silent on the issue of shifting of wagon factory from Narla in Kalahandi district to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh till it came to light through an RTI activist The chief minister had personally written to the Centre regarding the wagon factory. When it was made public, we had also raised the issue in the Assembly. We had made our stand clear in the Assembly and later it was supported by the Congress. So there is no need to be suspicious about the states motive. Though Naveen Patnaiks leadership remains undisputed, has he created a second rung of leaders within the party? The people of Odisha have reposed their faith in Naveen babu and with his inspiration everyone is trying to take Odisha forward to fulfil Biju Patnaiks dreams. The BJD does not need an alternative leadership at this moment."
58f4d7c060de470aa339cc37,A Sweet and bitter harvest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160106/jsp/opinion/story_62272.jsp,2016-01-06,,Telegraph,"Christmas and New Year celebrations are synonymous with cakes. Busy feasting on this delicacy, India's urban citizens would not have fathomed that the world of baked goodies, and indeed of food, obeys the Darwinian principle. Plum cakes, fruit cakes, pan cakes, and what have you, have led to the near extinction of the humbler, and now endangered, Madua cake. Most of the local bakeries in Ranchi, Jharkhand, stocked and sold very few Madua cakes even though it was Yuletide season. This variety of cakes was once relished by India's tribal people. Ironically, its popularity reveals the harsh challenges to adivasi life. The Madua cake is prepared from the flour of finger millet - considered to be a variety of 'super food' - which has a high nutritional value, remarkable sustaining power and an impressive productivity. Finger millet is rich in iron and calcium. It can survive droughts and pests, and, with a one-tonne yield per hectare, it is considered to be one of the most fecund species in the millet family. It used to be in high demand in Garhwal, the Deccan as well as in Jharkhand. Some fear that the finger millet now falls under the category of 'forgotten' food grains. Part of the reason of its fate is its obscurity. During the raj, finger millet - a staple of the poor and the working class - was considered to be a coarse grain unfit for the consumption of those with refined taste. Just like their aesthetics and values, the vast and diverse food of the tribal people remains a pariah to post-colonial taste buds. The future of the finger millet - and that of the Madua cake - remains inextricably tied to the fate of the battle over global diet and taste. It is instructive that globalization, supposedly a hallmark of diversity, has been characterized by a sharp decline in crop diversity in India. Millets, rye, yams, to name a few crops, are yielding worrisome space to wheat, rice, potato and sugar. More damagingly, public imagination, and, consequently, the discourse is being stripped of the memory of some such food to weaken an admittedly fragmented movement that is fighting to save them from oblivion. A State initiative to protect these indigenous food crops is not an act of altruism: economic logic fortifies the initiative. The yield and nutritional value of the finger millet, to cite just one example, could provide food security programmes with necessary capital. Its resilience would also curtail expenditure in initiatives such as crop insurance. It would not be enough to boost commercial production only. One has to think up ways of incentivizing traditional produce and crop diversity and of integrating them into modern cultural practices. Tribal handicraft has made it to opulent drawing rooms. Why not make our kitchens more accommodating of the staples of India's indigenous people? A battle has to be waged simultaneously to reclaim space for such food in the memory of even the marginalized. One way of going about it would be to make the public distribution system - as well as school mid-day meals - layered and representative of the wondrous diversity of indigenous food."

Before we know it, they are making out. While they are at it, they make fart jokes and Jyoti remarks on Kerrys pan-stained teeth, Itna masala kyun khaate ho? before engaging in a long smooch.This scene from the film stands out as it bends the rules of the standard lovemaking scene in Hindi cinema. It is more carnal desire than genteel lovemaking. And the embracing of the inappropriateness, albeit done in a comical way, is a welcome change. In Kerry on Kutton , there are many such moments, dialogues that border on the profane: a heart-to-heart about mens urinal problems or a tooth found in a gulab jamun, most probably the halwais. But most of them are used for effect. It becomes a problem for the film when the quirks overpower dramatic tension.Kerry on Kutton belongs to the breed of post- Gangs of Wasseypur Hindi films that is so enamoured by the mofussil cool of its subject that it ends up nowhere: much like last years Meerutiya Gangsters . The film isnt even artful in the way it draws inspiration from Anurag Kashyaps two-part gangster saga. There is Piyush Mishras raspy voice as the sutradhar in the trailers and it casts Aditya Kumar, who played the hugely enjoyable Perpendicular, as an important character here.Set in Baliya district of Uttar Pradesh, Kerry on Kutton banks on colourful, rustic characters to tell a story of a new generation of youngsters. All Kerry wants in life is to get laid, Kadambri (Kumar) wants to break out of his family profession of running a brass band and start the seemingly lucrative business of dog-breeding. Tunnu (Prashant Tiwari) is possessive and aggressive about a girl who seems to be getting away from him. Kerry and he develop a rivalry over the materialistic Jyoti who uses her sexuality to exploit the two men.Our Hindi heartland films have echoes of Westerns, and the seemingly lawless countryside seem to lend a landscape to it. In Kerry on Kutton , the theme of violence propagated by the gun-culture in the region runs through. All the main three male characters are looking to break out from their fathers shadows and the only answer to their problems seem to be a tamancha (gun). The women of Baliya wear their desire on their sleeves (or salwar kameezes or saris). The film does well to show us how much more bold and frank people from small towns can seem to be compared to the urban blandness we see in films set in cities.The acting isnt bad. Dubey has an easy charm: a little too genial perhaps. But he makes use of his tall, athletic body to play the strapping man-boy who seems to have a way with the womenfolk. I was beginning to get fidgety about Jagota being too glamorous for the role, but as I spent more time with the character  it did make sense.But all these elements never come together in Kerry on Kutton . For all its merits, it ultimately feels like an empty film that depends more on the quirks of the characters than the characters themselves. As a film that describes its protagonists as wannabe gangsters, it almost ends up being a victim of its own joke.Kerry on KuttonDirector: Ashok YadavStarring: Satyajeet Dubey, Aradhana Jagota, Aditya Kumar, Prashant TiwariRuntime: 125 mins"

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Jan. 6: The BJD today threatened to adopt ""tit for tat"" approach if the Congress continues to hurl eggs at the ruling party's ministers. ""We are asking the Pradesh Congress Committee president to ask his partymen to refrain from such activities. Otherwise, we will be compelled to resort to the tit-for-tat approach,"" said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb. On the other hand, Congress leaders accepted the challenge. ""We are ready. Our party activists are doing the right thing,"" said senior Congress leader and former Youth Congress president Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra. Earlier, Mohapatra, a firebrand leader, had supported the party activists, who had hurled eggs at food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma. In another development, senior cabinet minister Damodar Rout has also condemned the practice of hurling of eggs at the ministers. ""It's a nasty way of protest. If they have any grievance, they should point it out to the administration in a democratic and decent way. If they hurl eggs, people will hate them,"" said Rout. Congress activists had hurled eggs at Das Burma in Puri and Chhatrapur on Sunday and Monday during the minister's visits to Puri and Ganjam district in protest against the bungling in ration card preparation and distribution. Yesterday, health minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak faced a similar protest during his visit to Deogarh. Today, Mahila Congress activists showed black flags to school and mass education minister Debi Prashad Mishra in Sambalpur. In yet another development, the BJP has questioned the advertisement issued by the government asking the ineligible people to refund their ration cards. ""It's illegal. There is no such provision under the National Food Security Act,"" said senior BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra, who announced that the party would take the issue to the village level. Pradesh Congress Committee president Prasad Harichandan said his party would continue its protest over the issue. ""Ration cards have been issued to the ruling party's rich and influential people, while thousands of poor have been deprived,"" he said. The Opposition has also questioned why the government has not taken action against the BJD leaders and workers for violation of the act, as it did in case of government employees. ""We have taken stringent action against our partymen. Resignation of Cuttack mayor Anita Behera is the brightest example,"" said Deb. Besides, police have started arresting the Congress activists for hurling eggs at ministers. On the other hand, Youth and Student Congress activists today burnt effigies of chief minister Naveen Patnaik outside various colleges in Ganjam district, protesting against the arrest of three Congress activists on charges of hurling eggs and rotten potatoes at the car of Das Burma near the Chhatrapur Science College on January 4. Deogarh police station inspector in-charge Sudarshan Jena and sub-inspector Narayana Sahu have been suspended for negligence in connection with the incident, in which some Congress workers hurled eggs at Nayak's car."

Telegraph picture Calcutta, Jan. 27: Come Sunday, foodies in Calcutta, who have probably had their fill of Chinese, Thai and Mexican, will have a chance to get adventurous and step out of their comfort zone to taste khar, tenga and the heat of bhut jolokia, with a couple of silkworms thrown in for good measure. Northeastern food curator Gitika Saikia will be here to take the residents of the city, as well as Assamese residents here who have been pining for some authentic cuisine from back home, on a gastronomic journey through the hills of Assam. The pop-up is scheduled to be held at Club de Ville in Udita Bengal Ambuja on the EM Bypass, to highlight a medley of urban and rural cuisine of her state. A pop-up restaurant is a temporary set-up, often operating from a private home, restaurant or borrowed space, mainly during festivals and other occasions. Saikia, currently based in Mumbai, will cook simple yet mouth-watering dishes from Assam, with an emphasis on indigenous food. She had also held pop-ups in other states and abroad. Famous for her blog Gitika's Pakghor and her pickles, she will provide some of her signature dishes, including lai xaak gahori or pork with broad mustard leaves, til maas (fish cooked with sesame seeds) and rongalao murgi (tender chicken pieces with ripe pumpkin). For a real challenge to the tastebuds, she will present the fiery bhut jolokia, in chutneys as well as with pork and bamboo shoot. The event is the brainchild of food blogger Anindya Sundar Basu of Pikturenama, and his wife Madhushree Basu Roy, cook and food stylist. Connecting over social media, Saikia and Basu hit upon the idea of holding this pop-up to showcase the hidden flavours of Assam. ""Foodies in Calcutta are very open to trying out different kinds of food. The city offers plenty of scope for the introduction of Assamese cuisine. I am sure foodies will embrace the unique flavours of Assam,"" Basu said. ""I quit a more than 10-year-long corporate career in September 2014 to pursue my passion of promoting the unexplored Northeast, its culture and its customs. Since I am passionate about cooking, it was the best medium I could come up with,"" said Saikia. ""I first entered the kitchen when I was in Class II to make a fried egg. I remember it was a disaster and never tried it again till Classes VI or VII. I was a bad cook throughout and then moved to a hostel, limiting my cooking skills all the more. After marriage, my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook, taught me indigenous fare. Seeing her cooking, my interest grew and every time I visited home, I would come back with new recipes and the availability of organic ingredients in the kitchen garden influenced me to try different things,"" she added. On Sunday, the guests will be served black tea served with homemade pithas (rice cakes) on arrival. The main course will comprise lai xaak gahori, guti alu aru tita phool bhaji (baby potatoes stir fry with red bitter flowers), topola bhat (sticky rice), til maas (river fish cooked in black sesame with a hint of herbs) xukan khorisa, mosola paat bhut jolokia gahori (pork with smoked bamboo shoots, bhut jolokia and Arunachali herbs), rongalao murgi, lau khar (bottle gourd and masoor dal cooked with organic alkali and flavoured with Assamese coriander) and steamed plain rice. The accompaniments are misa maas aru bhut jolokia chutney (shrimps with bhut jolokia chutney) and homemade bamboo shoot pickle.

A stray elephant seen near Cuttack on Saturday.Picture by Badrika Nath Das Three elephants have been spotted nearly 4km from the present campus of the National Law University. The herd, however, has not yet crossed the Mahanadi. Resentment was brewing among the villagers since they feared that the elephants might stray into human settlements as the forest department had yet to drive it back either towards Athgarh or to Khuntuni. ""It is for the second consecutive day the elephants have been spotted in the region. They have destroyed a large portion of standing crops such as tomatoes, potatoes and brinjals,"" said 58-year-old farmer Ganesh Das. Das said a lot of villagers from Brajabiharipur had cultivated vegetables on the other side of the river and it was for the second time in the past one year that elephants had been spotted few kilometres away from Cuttack city. The herd has already wrecked havoc on the open fields situated on the other side of the Mahanadi river by destroying vegetable plantations in nearly three acres of farmland. ""We have not seen any measure on part of the forest department to drive back the herd and ensure that they do not cross the river and enter our area,"" said local resident Gauranga Barik.

Picture by Ashok Sinha When Class X student Sushmita Kumari wants to eat rotis in the evening, she has to make them herself. She is not alone. The 280 girls enrolled at the Government Other Backward Class (OBC) Girls' Residential 10+2 School face the same kind of hardships. They live in a damp, cramped, three-storeyed building with drain water flowing near the entrance and stench a constant companion. And they have to make do with just four functional toilets of the total six in the building. So when deputy chief minister Tejaswi arrived for a surprise inspection of the school on Tuesday, Sushmita fought off the nervousness of speaking in front of a roomful of people and stood up for her and her schoolmates' rights. ""There are no teachers of economics and geography in the school and we have to study on our own,"" Sushmita said as the deputy chief minister listened. She went on to tell him that they get non-vegetarian food only twice a month instead of the once-a-week promised by the government. Sushmita pointed out the positives too. The three school cooks, whom she called ""aunties"", were helpful, she said. The minister called the girls to the terrace of the building, where the school food is cooked and consumed. It was well past lunchtime and some food was still left - coarse, parboiled rice, watery dal, and aloo-gobi (potato and cauliflower) in which only potatoes were visible. Roshni Kumari, another Class X student, said a bigger building was needed so that classrooms and staying rooms could be separate and the girls could play outdoor games. ""We are unable to even play indoor games,"" she added.

No lives were, however, lost in the incident. Residents saw flames coming out of around half a dozen godowns of scrap materials around 11pm. The blaze then spread to the sabzi mandi situated at Bank More.

""The weather was windy and it might have propelled the fire to spread to different parts. Over three dozen makeshift vegetable shops and half a dozen shanties were reduced to ashes,"" Sohrab added.

(PTI) New Delhi, Feb. 29: On Friday, plainclothes police picked up a photocopy machine operator in Ber Sarai, a crowded settlement between JNU and IIT Delhi known for its bookshops and eateries, and detained him for the night at a police station. ""They asked him if he had printed 'anti-national' posters for JNU students. Many JNU students come here to photocopy pamphlets - we don't even read them,"" said a friend of the operator. The detainee, who didn't want to speak, was picked up again this evening by the police's special cell as this copy was being filed. The special cell investigates terrorism-related cases and is now handling the JNU sedition case. Since Saturday, Ber Sarai's shops have been refusing to photocopy pamphlets. ""We know the students, they are all familiar faces. We've done this work for several generations of students, often on credit. The loss of business will hurt us but it's better than going to jail,"" a photocopy shop attendant said. ""Times are bad."" Last night, as the owner of a photocopy shop inside the JNU campus was downing shutters, a man in plainclothes approached him and introduced himself as a police officer. ""He asked if I print anti-India posters. I said, 'Sir, I know nothing about this. We just photocopy books, pamphlets, whatever the students give us',"" the shop owner told this newspaper. ""He asked me if I had taken the vice-chancellor's permission before printing anything. I didn't know what to say. I folded my hands and said, 'Sir, pardon me'."" Today, the shopkeeper delivered a bunch of photocopies of pamphlets the students had ordered and told them he wouldn't photocopy pamphlets any more. ""From now on, please get the VC's signature, I told them."" The JNU students' union has condemned the police ""clampdown"" on photocopying of posters. ""This blanket order banning the printing of pamphlets and posters in JNU smacks of a brutal clampdown on the culture of free speech, debate and discussion in our campus,"" it said in a statement. ""We see this as the latest episode in the continuing assault on JNU's plural, democratic spaces.... This (the agitation) has clearly irked the powers that be."" Police sources said no such ban order had been issued. The large wall posters seen at the university are usually hand-painted but the smaller pamphlets are designed on computers and printed out.

58f4e32ca3d24b0b70c1aa48,Everybody loves a good quota,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/everybody-loves-a-good-quota/article8548789.ece,2016-05-03,,The Hindu,"I sometimes feel sorry for the governments of Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan, which are plagued by demands for reservation from powerful and aggressive communities. Patidars, Jats and Gujjars feel that communities that first managed to board the reservation train are uniting to keep them out. State governments would be perfectly happy to include them in the reserved category if they were not worried about the electoral backlash. Other Backward Classes (OBC) classification for Jats brings a similar demand from Rajputs; Scheduled Tribes (ST) classification for Gujjars brings about protests from the powerful Meena community unwilling to share the ST classification. Gujarat seems to have found a novel way to address these demands: be so inclusive that hardly anyone is left to protest. A 10 per cent quota for the economically backward among upper castes that is, those with family incomes of less than Rs.6 lakh per annum (p.a.)  spreads the net so wide that the excluded group is minuscule.Data on incomeSince income data are hard to come by, let us look at three different sources of data to derive estimates of those with incomes above Rs.6 lakh p.a. First, data on income tax filers in 2012-13 show that only 13 per cent of individual returns have incomes higher than Rs.5.5 lakh p.a.; once we take into account people who do not file the returns at all, this forms about 3.5 per cent of total individuals in the country aged 18 and above. Since incomes may be hidden on tax returns, we must look to alternative data. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) collects information on consumption expenditure, not incomes. If we apply household savings rate of about 25 per cent, a Rs.6 lakh income p.a. cut-off would result in a cut-off of about Rs.4.5 lakh consumption. NSSO data (2011-12) show that less than 1 per cent of the population falls in this category. A third source of data is the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2011-12, organised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and University of Maryland. It collects data for both income and expenditure. It shows that less than 2 per cent of the population had household consumption of Rs.4.5 lakh p.a. and about 2.5 per cent had incomes of Rs.6 lakh p.a. in 2011-12. This suggests that whatever statistics we use, a Rs.6 lakh p.a. cut-off will exclude less than 5 per cent of the population from being eligible for reservations if the Gujarat example is followed nationwide.These statistics should calm the passions around this new wrinkle in the battle for reservation in Gujarat. Appeasement tactics used by the Gujarat government are mostly ineffective; they will neither reduce options for middle-income Indians nor will they really expand benefits for the poor among forward castes.Can we devise a narrower band that might really benefit the poor among groups currently ineligible for reservations? Here, our spectacular failure in identifying the poor for issuing Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards gives us reason to be wary. The IHDS survey found that in 2011-12, only 50 per cent of the poor had a BPL card while nearly a third of the non-poor had BPL cards. Almost all observers agree that identifying the poor is a difficult task resulting in errors of both inclusion and exclusion. This is particularly the case when incomes are growing rapidly and a household that is poor in one year may well climb out of poverty the following year. So focussing on just the poor among the general category may be more difficult than we anticipate.Moreover, the demands for expansion of reservation have little to do with the poor among the so-called general category. Most of these demands are emerging from angry young men  many of them with college education  among agriculturalist communities that have historically held considerable political clout (for instance, the Navnirman movement of the 1970s, which the Gujarat government is acutely aware of).Future of reservationIn order to get out of this quagmire, we need to think of the immediate concerns of educated youth and the broader future of reservation in India. What fuels the anger of young men from agricultural communities? As they see it, investing in education has got them only minor monetary benefits. With massive growth in private and distance education programmes of questionable quality, most college graduates today lack the skills for high-paying private sector jobs. They may well be qualified for lower-level clerical or support positions, but for these jobs salaries are far lower in the private sector than the public sector. The ratio of government salary to private sector salary for a college graduate has consistently increased; the IHDS data show that in 2004-05, a college graduate earned 62 paisa in the private sector for each rupee in the public sector; by 2011-12 it had dropped to 57 paisa. With implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, this difference will grow. Not surprisingly, competition for government jobs is fierce. As Prabhat Mittal, Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, noted, in 2015 nearly 2.3 million applications were received for 368 low-ranking positions in the State government. Is it surprising that frustrated young men try to beat this insane competition by demanding inclusion in the reserved category? If government salaries were more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this strident demand may subside. If current initiatives for increasing employability and creating more manufacturing jobs succeed, this will also reduce the pressure.A longer-term solution, however, requires re-evaluation of the fundamental nature of Indias reservation regime. Affirmative action to make space for communities that have historically been subject to discrimination fits well with the Indian ethos of creating a level playing field and is part of the Indian Constitution. But the patchwork implementation, particularly for the OBC classification that is currently in place, makes little sense and leaves room for powerful lobbies to unite around demands for inclusion.One of the ways of dismantling the quota raj is to ensure that the reserved category certificate is not a currency that is hoarded by groups who no longer need it. This involves periodic recertification into the reserved category. Unfortunately, the current system has an established, if imperfect, procedure for notification of new groups into the reserved category but not for moving groups out of the reserved category. A first step towards establishing such a process may be to ensure that we collect data on caste/tribe affiliation along with data on basic demographic and housing characteristics in the 2021 population census. This would allow us to move past the exclusive reliance on the 1931 census and obtain information on the current socio-economic conditions of all castes and communities in India.Frankly, I have never understood the resistance from the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (ORGI) for collecting caste data in national population census. If the colonial census could do this in 1931, why cant we do it today? Collecting data on thousands of castes is difficult, but it is by no means impossible. Perhaps, the collection of data on caste is a hot potato that the ORGI hopes someone else will handle. But surely national interest demands that this caution be put aside to develop a long-term solution to an issue that has gained such visibility. While we are destined for periodic eruptions of demand for reservations by groups like the Jats, without timely and accurate data we have no way of developing a rational system for responding to these demands.Sonalde Desai is Senior Fellow, NCAER, and Professor of Sociology, University of Maryland. Views are personal.If government salarieswere more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this demand may subside"

58f4ee8a7be9e0185109f9d0,Rome revives marine demand,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/nation/story_77465.jsp,2016-03-31,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, March 30: Italy today asked an international court to order India to return a detained Italian marine to Rome, in a fresh chapter of a four-year-old diplomatic battle New Delhi wants to end amid hits to its global aspirations and to trade with the European Union. The request to a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague came hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi held summit talks with the EU, which has criticised India repeatedly in its spat with Italy. India had arrested two Italian marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone in February 2012 after they shot dead two Indian fishermen, mistaking them for pirates, off the coast of Kerala. Latorre was allowed to return to Italy by the Supreme Court after he was diagnosed with brain ischemia - a condition that restricts blood flow to the brain. But Girone cannot leave New Delhi under his bail conditions and lives at the residence of the Italian ambassador. His inability to return home remains a political hot potato in Italy, where a foreign minister had to resign over suggestions that Rome botched negotiations with New Delhi. India began secret negotiations with Italy late last year to find a diplomatic compromise under which the two nations would agree to a series of steps to rebuild bilateral relations while they wait for the outcome of litigation at the international tribunal. Those negotiations remain ongoing. Even while negotiating, India has made clear that any diplomatic deal with Italy will not involve an out-of-court settlement. But crucially, Indian officials have also confirmed to The Telegraph that New Delhi will not challenge the United Nations tribunal at The Hague if it does order India to lift restrictions on the movement of Girone. ""The only reason Girone is not allowed to leave India is so that he can act as a de facto guarantee of Italy's obligation to return him for trial,"" Italian ambassador to The Hague, Francesco Azzarello, told the tribunal today. ""A human being cannot be used as a guarantee of the conduct of a state."" The International Tribunal for the Law of the Seas (ITLOS) had last August ordered India to stop all legal proceedings against the two marines till the UN court at The Hague decides on Italy's larger assertion - that New Delhi has no jurisdiction to try the case. The firing occurred outside India's territorial waters - 12 nautical miles from the coast - and Italy argues that Indian courts have no authority to punish the marines. India rejects this assertion. The ITLOS stay on any legal proceedings against the marines means India can't begin a trial against them till the UN tribunal comes to a verdict. The National Investigation Agency, which probed the allegations against the marines, has said it has completed its investigations. ""If the two marines are allowed to stay in Italy, India will suffer no prejudice,"" Azzarello argued in a written submission to the PCA. ""India anyway cannot try them in the meantime."" If Girone remains in New Delhi, however, he could stay separated from his family for a total of more than seven years, given the average time past cases at the PCA have taken, Italy argued today. India has, however, called Italy's demand ""tendentious"" in a previously secret written deposition to the PCA, made public by the UN tribunal today. In the deposition, New Delhi has articulated its concerns over allowing Girone to return to Italy. Italy has committed that it will ensure the marines are brought to India if the tribunal rules that New Delhi can try them. India remains sceptical of the commitment because Italy once refused to return the marines when the Supreme Court had allowed them to visit Rome to vote in national elections. The marines eventually returned after the apex court ordered restrictions on the Italian ambassador in India. ""India's concern relates to securing his presence in India during trial,"" India has said in the deposition. ""It would be necessary for India to be assured that in case the tribunal finds that India has jurisdiction, the presence of Sergeant Girone in India would be ensured."" But in recent months, India has increasingly weighed these concerns against larger strategic and economic losses because of the tussle with Italy. A member of the world's four major export-control regimes, Italy last year vetoed India's membership to the missile technology control regime (MTCR). Membership of these regimes is critical to end restrictions on India's access to cutting-edge technology in nuclear, defence and research sectors. Italy has held back on key investments in India. The tensions have also spilled over into India's relationship with the EU, one of New Delhi's biggest trading partners. Former Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini, now the foreign relations chief of the EU, had in January last year criticised India's handling of the marines case on the floor of the European parliament. Negotiations on a free trade agreement stood stalled through last year, after the EU blacklisted hundreds of Indian drugs that it said did not meet its phytosanitary standards. The EU also responded coldly to a proposal from India for a visit by Modi to Brussels last April, when he was travelling to Germany and France. Leading up to today's summit, the foreign office made clear it wanted to put the past with Italy behind. ""We have always wanted a vibrant, robust partnership with Italy,"" Nandini Singla, joint secretary in charge of relations with western Europe at the foreign office, said earlier this week, adding that India had committed to ""abide by whatever decision the arbitration tribunal gives."""

Telegraph pictureBhubaneswar, April 20: Faced with potato scarcity, the government today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Utkal Tubers India Private Limited to augment potato seed production.The state has been facing potato scarcity every year as its domestic production does not meet its demand. At present, the state produces two lakh metric tonnes of potato as against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes. Hence, the state is dependent on other states, especially Bengal, to meet its potato requirements.The state had faced a severe potato shortage when Bengal government restricted its supply to Odisha and other states this year and previous year. At that time, potato was selling at Rs 60 per kg in retail market.The state government has now set a target to increase potato production from the existing level of two lakh metric tonnes to 11.25 lakh metric tonnes by 2017-18.On December 27, 2014, the state government launched a Potato Mission for planning ahead to avoid tuber shortage in the state. The mission has initiated several measures to make the state self-reliant in potato production.The task force set up by the state government has estimated that the state will require 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds by 2017-18.However, there has been a big gap between the demand and supply as the domestic production is very low. So, the state government has to procure seeds from states, such as Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.According to plans, 1.10 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds will be produced in the state by 2020-21. The potato producers will get the seeds at reasonable rate, said the officials of the state horticulture directorate."

Many farmers, who cultivated tobacco for decades, have been moving to other crops after a fall in income from tobacco. They find cultivation of potato or maize to be more profitable, given the labour cost and work hours that the commercial crop demands.India is one among the signatories to the UN-framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which mandates phasing out tobacco cultivation by 2020, and the growers here are ready to give it up if they are offered a comprehensive package, besides waiving of loans.Ninge Gowda, a farmer in Belavadi in Arakalgud taluk, said his father started tobacco cultivation in the late 1970s when cigarette manufacturers promoted the crop in the region. In our family, we have three licences. Of them, only one is active now, he said. The Tobacco Board issues licences to the grower, and with each licence, a grower can produce 1,750 kg of tobacco leaves a year. In the last 30 years, the price of tobacco has gone up 10 times, whereas the labour cost has gone up 100 times. Besides that, we have to spend on constructing barns and fuel necessary to dry the leaves, Mr. Ninge Gowda said.Raje Gowda of Kurana Koplu said he had stopped tobacco cultivation for the past two years. With minimum expenses and least labour cost, we get good income from potato or maize. I have borrowed over Rs. 4 lakh to cultivate tobacco. Overburdened with loans, I stopped growing it, he said.Of the 8,000 licence holders in Hassan, nearly 1,000 have stopped cultivating tobacco. S.V. Yoganna, a tobacco grower and Arakalgud taluk, and president of Raitha Sangha, said, Many have stopped cultivating tobacco, and the rest are ready to give up the crop, provided the government gives us a package. How can the Prime Minister give a call for Swachh Bharat all the while allowing tobacco cultivation to continue in farm fields? he added."

Nitesh Tiwary, a businessman and resident of New Area, said markets were forced to shut down on Thursday in view of the then upcoming Ram Navami festival, but the situation took a turn for the worse on Sunday with clashes, including inter-community ones, forcing the administration to impose curfew.

The daughter of a farmer, who was married to a farmer's family, would not let her two sons - Kuntal and Soumyodeep - to till land. Sitting in her in-laws' home at Hitta village in Burdwan's Galsi, Madhumita, whose husband Sushanto committed suicide in January 2012, unequivocally declares: ""They will never be farmers."" Her father-in-law Bikash Chandra Ghosh nods in agreement as the two boys, who study in Classes VI and VIII, stand next to her wearing blank looks. Life is full of uncertainties for the Ghoshes as they do not know how to pay back the banks Rs 3 lakh. The future of the two boys is uncertain as their mother does not have the resources to fund their education. Sushanto's parents don't have money to buy medicines. The family members of Sushanto Ghosh, who committed suicide. Picture by Partha Protim Koner The exact reason behind Sushanto's suicide is not known as the family's version that he killed himself to escape indebtedness has no takers in the administration and hence, no government support. ""What do I say? We lost everything because we are farmers,"" she says. Her torn green sari bears signs of penury. Some neighbours listen to her conversation with this correspondent with rapt attention on a sultry afternoon of April, the harvesting time for the boro crop. Asked why they aren't in the fields, most of them say they haven't sown the seeds. ""Why should we? Farming means losses,"" replies Panchu Gopal Ghosh, who has been farming for at least four decades. The veteran offers a rough calculation to explain the lack of incentive in farming. Such answers from members of farmer families in Galsi block - the top rice producer for years in Bengal and regarded as the Granary of Burdwan, which itself is the state's granary - may surprise outsiders but not the people of the district, where 70 per cent of the population has something or the other to do with agriculture. ""There is no point talking about what it was before and how happy and prosperous we farmers were.... Today, it is even better to be a manual labourer,"" says Swapan Ghosh, who has given up farming and become a mason. This approach of farmers - seen and heard in the rice belt of the district, including Galsi, Bhatar, Raina and Khandaghosh, and the potato belt covering Memari, Manteswar and Jamalpur - has become a worry for the ruling Trinamul ahead of tomorrow's elections, when 16 Assembly constituencies of rural Burdwan will go to the polls. If slogans in Burdwan are any indication, the writing on the wall captures the mood. Sample this: "" Kake vote dilam kaka? Mill- e dhan, bank-e taka, chashir haat sudhui fanka (Whom did we vote, dear friend? Mills are stocked with paddy, banks stashed with money, but the farmers' hands are empty)."" In the 2011 Assembly polls, Trinamul had won nine of the 16 seats. Mamata Banerjee's Maa-Mati-Manush slogan had worked wonders in the district as Trinamul swept the panchayat polls of 2013. There were, however, complaints of electoral malpractice. The trend continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with Trinamul candidates leading in 13 of these constituencies. Aroop Biswas, the Trinamul observer for the district, says the summer of 2016 will not be an aberration either but several lower-level party functionaries feel otherwise. ""The CPM is building its campaign on the agrarian distress and it's striking a chord with common people.... Our target of sweeping the district will not be met,"" a Trinamul leader in Burdwan said. According to him, the CPM's campaign, highlighting a list carrying names, addresses and other details of over 140 farmers who committed suicide in the past few years, has caught on in the region. Trinamul sources concede the chief minister is aware of the discontent brewing in rural Burdwan and she tried to tackle it by holding Mati Utsav in the district, where some farmers were given cash awards and certificates for excellence in production. ""But that hasn't helped much,"" admits the source, adding that the list of problems has only grown for farmers. One of the recurring complaints heard across rural Burdwan is the Mamata government's failure to ensure remunerative price for farm produce while the cost of agriculture has galloped because of a rise in fertiliser prices and a subsequent increase in electricity tariff. ""A 60kg sack of rice used to yield anything between Rs 850 and Rs 900 till 2011. But now the farmers are getting between Rs 620 and Rs 650 per sack. There is genuine discontent,"" says Arup Kumar Chattopadhyay, a professor of economics at Burdwan University. Although on paper the farmers are getting Rs 814 a sack because that's the minimum support price for paddy, price realisation is much less, several farmers have said. ""Now that the panchayats play a role in procurement, they deduct charges like cost of collection of paddy from farmers' homes and various other handling expenses.... Such deductions weren't made during Left rule,"" says Abdur Rezzak Mondal, the district secretary of the CPM's peasant wing. The state government's plan to ensure payment through cheques has boomeranged as most farmers are complaining of delay in payment, which adds to their interest burden on the capital they borrow from money lenders. Scarcity of water is the other problem. The ripples of the discontent in rural Burdwan can be felt in Burdwan town as well. Traders complain of poor sales in the past few years because of the agrarian distress. ""Burdwan doesn't have any industry.... The surplus from agriculture sustains trade here but the flow of money has stopped and all the traders are suffering,"" said Sumit Dutta, the convenor of a traders' body in Burdwan. Agrarian distress and its negative impact on the economy are not unique to Burdwan or any other district in Bengal as a host of factors - some beyond the control of the state government - have made agriculture unviable. But the CPM has made it a poll issue in Burdwan and the hope for the party's revival is riding on the farmers' discontent. The focus on farmers' issues has already helped the CPM as its leaders have managed to build up resistance against Trinamul in the run-up to the polls by campaigning in areas like Raina and Khandaghosh and even finalising the list of polling agents to be stationed in the booths tomorrow. In contemporary Bengal, the finalisation of the list in itself is an achievement. ""We have made a turnaround because we have exposed how the ruling party has ruined agriculture in Burdwan.... Tomorrow is the final and we are ready to resist Trinamul goons if they try to loot votes,"" said CPM state committee member Amal Halder. The similarity with the summer of 2011 cannot be missed. Mamata had then played the farmers' card to her advantage. Amid questions whether the CPM can reap similar benefits, it is almost certain that Trinamul will fare worse than in 2014 in rural Bengal and it will be a blow to Mamata in central Bengal.

58f4f7b57be9e018510a0792,Squatters ‘safe’ on plot TMC refused,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160814/jsp/nation/story_102399.jsp,2016-08-14,,Telegraph,"(Above) The two temples on the plot offered to Trinamul for its party office; rickshaws parked on a portion of the plot on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg. Pictures by Prem Singh.New Delhi, Aug. 13: Santosh Kumar chuckled at the thought that the Trinamul Congress was allotted the plot that is his home in Delhi but dropped it like a hot potato. It was bound to happen, the 34-year-old squatter from Bihars East Champaran district said. Ive been here for long years and have seen thousands come, measure the land and leave. No one ever came to stay. Santosh is one of 1,500-odd encroachers who live in shanties in a 6,000sqm patch of land off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg in central Delhi, from where the Centre recently offered Trinamul a 1,886sqm plot to build an office.But the party was horrified when it found that the plot is home to two temples  one to Sai Baba and the other to Shiva  and refused to accept it. Does Naidu (Venkaiah Naidu, the urban development minister) want us to demolish temples now? Trinamul member Sudip Bandyopadhyay had told The Telegraph on Wednesday night while conveying the partys rejection of the allotment.Santosh is certain that the central government had sold Trinamul a fast one. It was a political ploy, he said. People like us always find plots that lie between temples and mosques to live in  we know that no one will ever touch the area. Some Trinamul sources too said they had a feeling that Naidus ministry had tried to short-change the party by offering it a piece of land that no one wanted. Trinamul sources said the Centre had promised the plot in the days ahead of the passage of the goods and services tax bill, when it needed their partys support, but the allotment came after it was passed. They said that Naidu had been on his best behaviour with senior Trinamul MPs when they approached him for a plot, asking an official in front of them to show the party clean areas to choose from. The area off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg is prime real estate, located a few kilometres from Parliament and a stones throw from the headquarters of most of the big political parties. But for decades, its been home to rickshaw-pullers, mostly migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal. The rows of parked rickshaws take up a large slice of this tract of land, which has four temples of which two stand bang in the middle of the plot offered to Trinamul. Several eateries stand on the plot: they serve chicken curry and rice to their mostly labourer customers. There are multiple grocery stores and tea stalls, and a barber shop-cum-residence that caters to the nearby slum dwellers. Then theres Santoshs makeshift public telephone booth, which also serves as a ticket counter for travellers and an online service centre that helps the rickshaw-pullers pay their bills and send money home. This land is not ours, and well no doubt have to get out if the government tells us to. It hasnt happened in 20 years, though, said Mahesh Shah, 45, who came from Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh. Shah, a rickshaw-puller, lives on a part of the 1,886sqm plot the Trinamul was offered. Sudip had said that the residents had confronted Trinamul MPs staff when they went to see the plot on Wednesday, prompting them to escape with their lives. But the encroachers this newspaper spoke to denied having had any exchanges with the Trinamul representatives.Sudip said Trinamul was determined to assert its right. They were trying to shuffle on to us a plot no one else wanted. Why should we take such a plot? he told this newspaper on Thursday. What we have asked for is our legitimate right and we should get it. We have conveyed this to Naidu and he has promised that more plots will be shown and we can decide which one to take. This newspaper tried to contact Naidu over the phone at his offices in Parliament and at Shastri Bhavan on Thursday and Friday but his staff said he was busy with meetings. A source close to the minister said that Naidu himself had been surprised that Trinamul had been provided a plot with temples and had advised Sudip not to take it. He has promised him two more plots to choose from, the source said. Sudip confirmed this. But the encroachers are thanking the temples. These temples have saved us. Only someone willing to demolish them will get the plot, but who is going to do that? said Naresh Thakur, 50, the barber who runs his shop adjacent to the Shiva temple and opposite the Sai Baba temple. Nowadays, temples alone are the saviours of the poor, he signed off."

Jorhat deputy commissioner Virendra Mittal today told The Telegraph that the response from civil society in coming forward to offer aid to the flood-hit people was ""very encouraging"" with all sections of society participating for a humane cause. ""All kinds of organisations ranging from small clubs and traders' bodies to socio-cultural, voluntary and charitable groups belonging to different communities, apart from PSUs and several colleges, came forward to donate for flood victims in their hour of crisis, which should be acknowledged and reciprocated,"" Mittal said. He said to encourage such positive work and compassion shown towards the victims of a natural calamity, the administration has decided to present appreciation letters to all organisations who donated to the flood-hit. ""We will be giving an appreciation letter thanking each organisation for their humanitarian gesture hoping for such similar responses in the future,"" Mittal said. He said giving such a letter was also expected to send a right message within society. The deputy commissioner said he has also directed the Majuli sub-divisional administration to issue such letters to organisations which have offered aid to the flood-affected people. Jorhat additional deputy commissioner Bubul Lekharu said organisations donated items like biscuits, water bottles, rice, onions, potatoes, pulses, mustard oil, buckets, medicines, clothes and tarpaulin. Lekharu said Rs 27,000 cash was among the assistance offered to the administration to be spent in relief measures. He said some organisations directly distributed the items to the victims according to the administration guidelines while some organisations handed over the things to the administration. Jorhat was one of the 28 districts in the state which was badly affected by floods with Majuli island in the district being severely affected. A large number of villages under Jorhat west, east and Teok revenue circles along with a few villages under Titabar sub-division were also submerged. About two lakh people were affected and about 25 relief camps were set up. Majuli, being represented by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, this time seemed to get priority from the government, with Sonowal flying to the island on July 28 to take stock of the flood scene and rescue measures. Four officials posted in Majuli were suspended and many others were issued showcause notices by Dispur after victims complained to Sonowal regarding officials showing negligence in carrying out relief duty."

The JDU's candidate here - Mohammad Arshad (47), a sociologist well known in Delhi's academic circles - is adept at articulating his point of view on development, illiteracy, backwardness, communalism and gender sensitivity. But the senior professor and head of department of sociology at B.R. Ambedkhar University, Agra, faces two problems. First, he is a candidate of the JDU whose leader Nitish is thoroughly devoid of influence among the electorate in this part of Bengal. Second, Kanhaiya Lal Agrawal, a businessman and chairman of the Islampur Municipal Corporation, has bagged the Congress ticket, won over local CPM cadres and sympathisers if not leaders and succeeded in driving home the message that he is the ""actual"" Cogress-Left alliance nominee. ""Our top leadership and I have made it clear that Arshad is the actual Left Front-backed candidate in Islampur,"" said North Dinajpur CPM secretariat member and seniormost party leader in the region, Swapan Guha Niyogi. ""I am telling you that we are backing Arshad and have nothing to do with Kanhaiya."" But Niyogi also wondered how Bengal Congress president Adhir Choudhary issued the party symbol to Kanhaiya after top CPM leaders, in consultation with their counterparts in the Congress and the JDU, had agreed to spare two seats - Islampur and Howrah - to the JDU and two others to the RJD. Kanhaiya's campaign vehicles far outnumber Arshad's and are bedecked with CPM posters and banners. He is seen with hundreds of CPM cadres and supporters cheering him on. ""Left cadres and those who want to see Mamata out of power know that I am capable of defeating Abdul Karim Choudhary (veteran of many battles and TMC nominee) in the seat. Speak to anyone. You will get the same answer,"" Kanhaiya said. ""It is a queer situation,"" said Arshad. ""I belong to Gaisal and did my schooling at Islampur High School. I went to Aligarh for higher education. I am a son of the soil, fired with the desire to use my education and learning to develop my region. ""Unfortunately, the mafiosi have established their stranglehold on the largely innocent and uneducated people here. But my battle against mafia-dominated politics will go on. We have tried to change the political discourse. We want more educated people to join politics."" Arshad said it was necessary to open industries related to maize and potato - prime yields of the region. He said he is ""connected"" to top Left leaders, including Sitaram Yechuri and Saleem Parvez, and top academics like Amartya Sen and his ""contacts"" will help him bring quality educational institutions to Islampur. Md Tazibuddin, an old CPM cadre, pointed out where the fault lies. ""His (Arshad's) problem is he is hardly known to residents. He is a political rookie,"" said Tazibuddin. ""We all are fond of Nitish and his party. There is a lot of goodwill for Nitish and Lalu Prasad. But they do not command voters in Bengal. It will be risky to vote for Arshad. It will tantamount to wasting our vote and giving the Trinamool Congress an escape route."" As a voter said: ""Arshad is the right man in the wrong party"". The electorate feels the battle will boil down to Karim verus Kanhaiya. ""Despite doing everything right theoretically, Arshad might end up vying for a third slot with the BJP,"" said an employee of a local restaurant. ""Arshad definitely isn't the vehicle that will spread Nitish's reach in Bengal,"" a bookseller said."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."
58f4ff607be9e018510a1309,"India, US seal military pact on hold for 14 years",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160413/jsp/nation/story_79909.jsp,2016-04-13,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, April 12: The Modi government today announced it has picked up the political hot potato of a military logistics pact with the US nearly 14 years after successive Indian governments fought shy of signing it. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar said he had reached an ""in-principle"" agreement with his US counterpart, defence secretary Ashton Carter, on the ""Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement"" (Lemoa), confirming the first report in The Telegraph on April 8. Parrikar and Carter jointly addressed a news conference this afternoon that was followed by a joint statement from the two defence establishments. The Lemoa is a re-christened version and a Cold War leftover of the ""Acquisitions and Cross-Servicing Agreement"" or ""Logistics Support Agreement"" that the US originally designed for its Nato allies. ""But there will be no stationing of (US) troops in our bases,"" said Parrikar in defence of the Centre's decision. He said the Lemoa would be signed in the ""coming months"" and later amended that to ""about four weeks"". Parrikar explained that frequent military exchanges have necessitated the Lemoa. ""As our engagement deepens, we need to develop practical mechanisms to facilitate such exchanges. In this context, Secretary Carter and I agreed in principle to conclude a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (Lemoa) in the coming months,"" he said in his opening remarks. The Opposition, particularly the Left, has been against the agreement - described as ""foundational"" by the Pentagon - because it could give the US military access to Indian military bases. They argue that the US could use Indian military logistics - supplies of fuel, equipment and rest and recuperation for US troops - to pursue unjust wars. The government says the agreement will facilitate coordination with the US in times for humanitarian operations - such as those that followed the earthquake in Nepal last year - and during joint exercises between the armed forces of the two countries. However, the US military is deployed worldwide and has more frequent visits to India and its neighbourhood than India has to the US or its bases. The agreement has also been reached at a time when the US is deploying more military assets nearer to India in an exercise called ""rebalancing"". Just before embarking on his current tour, Carter had said in New York that more than 60 per cent of US military assets, including submarines, were deploying to the Asia-Pacific. The statement from the defence ministers and the joint statement leaves open the possibility that India will also consider signing two other ""foundational"" agreements, the Cismoa and the Beca. The alphabet soup of US military pacts also contains abbreviations beyond the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum or the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo Spatial Cooperation. The joint statement noted that Parrikar and Carter would ""continue working toward other facilitating agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer"".Parrikar and Carter also referred to a Joint Vision Statement on the Asia Pacific by Prime Minister Modi and Barack Obama during the US President's visit to New Delhi in January 2015. The statement, the first of its kind, largely referred to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea where China is locked in territorial disputes with five other nations. Secretary Carter announced that the US and Indian navies will now on cooperate also in exchange of information on submarine development and anti-submarine warfare. The US has the largest submarine fleet in the world and China's submarine fleet also dwarfs India's. In addition, the two sides have decided to institute a regular ""Maritime Security Dialogue"". Parrikar is slated to visit China next week. The cooperation in submarine development would run alongside an enhancement in an aircraft carrier joint working group. India and the US are now in talks on a secrecy pact to exchange classified data on the project.Carter said US relations with India should not always be seen through the prism of the past and the US is ""trusted"", when asked if it was aware of New Delhi's concerns over military supplies, such as F-16 fighter aircraft, to Pakistan. Parrikar said he had conveyed the concern during the delegation-level talks. The US was also supporting proposals by Boeing and Lockheed Martin to make F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets in India. Carter said the US is in talks with India for joint naval patrol. However, Parrikar said India was now only interested in ""deepening naval engagement""."

Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, March 18: The state government has earmarked Rs 300 crore towards its premium share of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The premium rates, to be paid by farmers, have substantially been brought down, so that more farmers can get insurance cover against crop loss on account of natural calamities. Finance minister Pradeep Amat announced the government's decision while tabling the agriculture budget of Rs 13,181.89 crore in the Assembly. The amount is 20.89 per cent more than the outlay for the previous year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his February visit to Bargarh, where from the largest number of farmer suicides has been reported, had urged the farmers to adopt the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme. He also urged the state governments to support the programme. The scheme will come into effect from the coming kharif season this April. Under the new scheme, farmers will have to pay a uniform premium of 2 per cent for all kharif crops and 1.5 per cent for all rabi crops. For annual commercial and horticultural crops, farmers will have to pay a premium of 5 per cent. The remaining share of the premium, as in the previous schemes, will continue to be borne equally by the Centre and the respective state governments. Amat also announced that the state would provide Rs 800 crore towards its premium share of the existing National Agricultural Insurance Scheme, which is implemented in the state on a modified version. ""There is a need for quick relief through adequate compensation and insurance cover to mitigate their financial hardships,"" said Amat. The state government has been bringing a separate budget on agriculture since 2012-13 fiscal. The agriculture budget includes budget for water resources, co-operation, fisheries and animal resource development and agriculture departments. The highest budgetary allocation was made for the water resources department, which stood at Rs 7,241.66 crore in 2016-17 - an increase of about 16.57 per cent. To provide water to farmers, the state government has planned to revive the defunct lift irrigation projects. It aims to revive the irrigation potential and ayacut created over the years that has been lost due to siltation of reservoirs, deterioration of the distribution system and drying up of the water sources of lift irrigation projects. To encourage the tribal to go for production of millets, the state government has decide to launch special programme for millet in the tribal areas to enhance production and productivity of millet. Another scheme has been launched to support the integrated farming system in tribal districts to enhance the farmers' income in the watershed areas. Amat also announced that a new programme, called development of agriculture in collaboration with international institutions, would be launched. The government will take help of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, International Rice Institute, International centre for Agriculture Research Dry Areas and the International Potato Centre for this on knowledge sharing basis. The agriculture department also decided to launch special programme for ""Promotion of Gender Friendly Tools for Farm Women in Odisha"" to improve their efficiency. The government also introduced a new scheme ""Support to Farmer Producers Organisations"" with the objective of mobilisation of farmers to enhance their production. It has also earmarked Rs 100 crore to build godowns. The panchayati raj department will be the executing agency for this instead of the co-operation department. The state government also aims to produce one crore eggs per day and 1 lakh metric tonnes broiler meat per annum by 2020."

Picture by Rajeev KumarChief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday urged the international agriculture research community to catalyse a second green revolution in order to boost productivity and counter food security challenges. Nitish visited Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA) on Friday afternoon and held parleys with agricultural scientists who are conducting research to boost yields of wheat, rice, cereals and maize in the South Asian region. The chief minister laid the foundation stone of a training centre for farmers inside the BISA campus. He also visited few agricultural plots to take stock of the new breeds of potato, maize and wheat being cultivated scientifically. He also urged agricultural scientists of BISA, Rajendra Agriculture University (RAU), Pusa, and Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, to bring revolutionary innovations and concentrate on food security issues with nutritional values. ""Climatic changes often provide a setback to farmers and it's high time one must ponder over the issue. I urge scientists to guide farmers and alert them so that they get used to climatic changes,"" said Nitish. ""Farmers face a number of challenges, including changing climatic conditions, changing diets, paucity of natural resources, compost and quality of seeds."" He also expressed concern over the rise in global temperature stating it poses a threat in producing several crops, including cereals. Nitish lauded efforts put up by the scientists of BISA, RAU and BAU, for focusing on shuttle breeding, devised by Norman Ernest Borlaug, to grow two successive plantings each year instead of one. ""I have full faith on scientists associated with BISA to help farmers engage in scientific techniques that would combine productivity with sustainability. It is the need of hour to quit conventional modes of agriculture, which needs soil movement and churning. Innovative forms such as zero-till farming and intercropping help farmers,"" said Nitish. BISA director Yash Gupta, RAU vice-chancellor Ramesh Chandra Srivastava and BAU vice-chancellor A.K. Singh were also present. The then Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had established BISA on October 5, 2011, in Pusa, Samastipur."

Standalone concerts featuring bands have almost ceased to exist. Reality spells a Puma-this, a Converse-that and a Budweiser-so-and-so, mainly just brand activations masked as concerts aimed at the youth, or in other words, the target market for a new line of shoes, clothes or beer. This, while electronic dance music, for better or worse, has all but taken over whats left of the music performance space.So why have we been set so far back in terms of independent music in the city? Among the various arguments to be made is the hot potato issue of originality. As a defining characteristic of a bands work, originality is a subject contested, yet rarely discussed in the open. And even more so since serious discussions of bands have gone from impassioned debates in watering holes and online forums to calculated moves in agency boardrooms. Are bands with particularly popular Western influences even capable of bodies of work that are wholly unique in this increasingly competitive creative space? Heres an analysis of this phenomenon with a look at last weeks most talked about album, Triggerpunkte by Chennais The F16s.Back in October 2015, The F16s, in conversation with Rolling Stone India , stated, Our music so far was more like a tribute to the bands we listened to. Fans and casual consumers of the material in question, EPs Kaleidoscope and Nobodys Gonna Wait , immediately likened them to UK chartbusters Arctic Monkeys, New York indie darlings The Strokes, and eventually English dance-punk outfit Foals (the F16s had borrowed rather liberally the last-named bands palette of sound).Consequently, The F16s rode a wave of success and recognition that resulted in a trip to the Rubber Tracks studio in New York courtesy of shoe conglomerate Converse. Eventually, they landed up at Londons iconic Abbey Road Studios, where their subsequent music was recorded.As for their latest effort, The F16s say, As a band, were now finding our niche and we understand what we want. This album is way more F16s than any other artist weve been listening to, which is awesome, because we have our own sound.So then, the proof of this statement must be extricated from the pudding, Triggerpunkte , their debut full-length album released recently via Bandcamp. In a week since its release, it has already gained some accolades. Besides their diehard fans, high praise has come equally from genre-agnostic blogs and magazines like Rolling Stone India .To this critics ear, The F16s new, original direction is, to put it bluntly, once again a mosaic of sounds already explored, and in many cases championed by another set of Western bands. Traces of the old F16s happen to remain on a couple of Triggerpunkte s songs, particularly opening duo Summer In My Lungs and Moon Child. The bulk of the album, however, plays out like a tapestry of F16-ised songs by other bands. These include art-rockers TV On The Radio, synth-pop trio Future Islands, festival circuit regulars Mutemath, self-described ambient-punk band Deerhunter, dance-punk icons LCD Soundsystem and notably English supergroup, The Last Shadow Puppets.The album isnt without its meritorious moments though, particularly in the kink of the slinky, slowed-down Cannibal Life II, the more abrasive Digital Dead and the delayed euphoria of closer You Could Use Me As A Weapon. If anything, you cant fault The F16s for keeping it diverse along the length of Triggerpunkte s nine songs.It probably doesnt help the bands cause that their lyrics, though possibly honest and even heartfelt, are still quite arbitrary and often indecipherable. They dont so much play the role of messenger but rather settle for being accessories to the instrumentation.Either way, little in Triggerpunkte asserts itself as a bold, original sound and vision. Not, at least, the kind thats ready to represent modern, Indian band music on the world stage.And if a critic with only a middling interest in Western rock music can pick their influences apart, it does make for a cogent statement on what the word original has really become stretched out to mean.A critical beat down of popular, conglomerate-backed rock bands album will not affect listens or sales. In any case, Triggerpunkte is a free download.Still, it seems that in contemporary Indian rock music, were still stuck paying clothed homage to our influences. The emperor, his lack of clothes notwithstanding, will be just fine so long as nakedness is evidently the flavour of the year.The author is a freelance music journalistDownload Triggerpunkte at thef16s.bandcamp.com"

Photo: AFPScientists unveiled on Monday the gene in carrots that gives rise to carotenoids, a critical source of Vitamin A and the pigment that turns some fruits and vegetables bright orange or red.Un-poetically dubbed DCAR_032551, the star gene emerged from the first complete decoding of the carrot genome, published in the scientific journal Nature Genetics .Vitamin A deficiency is a global health challenge, the study pointed out.Its plentiful carotenoids make carrot an important source of provitamin A in the human diet.Carotenoids were first discovered in carrots (hence the name), but which among the vegetables newly tallied 32,115 genes was most responsible for their formation remained a mystery. The researchers sequenced the genome of a bright orange variety of the vegetable called the Nantes carrot, named for the French city.Daucus carota now joins a select club of about a dozen veggies  including the potato, cucumber, tomato and pepper  whose complete genomes have been sequenced.Laying bare the humble carrots genetic secrets will make it easier to enhance disease resistance and nutritive value in other species, the researchers said.Having identified the mechanism controlling the accumulation of carotenoid, it may be possible  through gene-editing, for example  to import it to other staple root vegetables such as the cassava, native to South American and widely grown in Africa. These results will facilitate biological discovery and crop improvement in carrots and other crops, said Philipp Simon, senior author and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Among vegetables spinach and peas are widely associated with growing up strong, but its hard to beat the carrot when it comes to health boosters.Carrots are loaded with beta-carotene, a natural chemical that the body can transform into Vitamin A.The deeper the orange colour, the more beta-carotene.Carotenoids are also antioxidants, which are thought to protect against heart disease and some forms of cancer by neutralising so-called free radicals, single oxygen atoms that can damage cells.Some of these compounds can prevent disease, Mr. Simon said.Carrots are an interesting crop to work on because of their wide range of diversity. They are familiar to everyone, and generally well-regarded by consumers, but like most familiar things, people dont necessarily know the background stories, said Mr. Simon, led the study published in the journal Nature Genetics .Interestingly, carrots  along with many other plants  have about 20 per cent more genes than humans.Looking back at the plants family tree, scientists have been able to determine that it split with the grape about 113 million years ago and from the kiwi about 10 million years after that, when dinosaurs still lorded over the planet.Originally white, the wild ancestors of the carrot likely came from central Asia. The earliest record of carrots as a root crop dates from 1,100 years ago in Afghanistan, but those were yellow carrots and purple ones, not orange ones. Paintings from 16th century Spain and Germany provide the first unmistakable evidence for orange carrots. Global crop production of the root has quadrupled in the last 40 years and is today eaten everywhere in the world.  AFP/Reuters"

From staying in a river lodge nestled on the banks of the Difloo, which meanders through the national park - to having a taste of local ethnic food, a guided safari, meeting local villagers and the rangers, the two-day visit will see the royal couple get up close and personal with nature. The Duke and Duchess, William and Kate, would touch base at Tezpur airport on Tuesday and then head straight to the Diphlu river lodge in Kaziranga operated by Assam Bengal Navigation, an Indo-British joint venture. The visit coincides with Bohag Bihu, the celebration of the Assamese New Year. ""We are very excited to welcome them and have been waiting for this moment as this is the first time a royal couple will be staying with us,"" Ashish Phookan, managing director of Assam Bengal Navigation, told The Telegraph today. The core team of the delegation will stay at Diphlu while others will be accommodated at different resorts in Kaziranga. Around a campfire at the lodge, the Duke and Duchess will get to connect with life in rural Assam by meeting local people and witnessing Bihu and jhumur dances and musical performances. The food will be north Indian, Continental and Assamese. The Assamese dishes would range from amita khar (traditional papaya dish), patot diya maas (steamed fish in banana leaf), sungat diya sagoli mangxo (mutton in bamboo), besides masor tenga (tangy fish curry), aloo pitika (mashed potato) and others. ""What is most important for us is that they have chosen Kaziranga as the wildlife destination from a host of others in the country. This is the most gratifying aspect for us,"" Rathin Barman of Wildlife Trust of India told The Telegraph. Apart from being home to the rhino, the park is also a tiger reserve, having the highest density of the big cat in the country. On Wednesday morning, the couple will undertake a safari to the Bagori range. ""The idea is to help them see Kaziranga and its wilderness up close. ""If they are lucky, they might see tigers too,"" an official said, adding that rhino sighting would not be a problem. ""There would not be any elephant safari as they have told us very clearly they don't like to ride on an animal,"" the official said. The couple will also meet villagers who have been relocated to keep them out of the path of an elephant corridor. After visiting the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, William and Kate will travel to the Kaziranga Discovery Centre built by Elephant Family, a charity founded by late Mark Shand, brother of the Duchess of Cornwall. They will see a health clinic for working elephants and an elephant information centre, which is under construction.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley stressed that all the controversial loans to Mallya were made under UPA and reminded Rahul about how Bofors middleman Ottavio Quattrocchi was allowed to escape by a Congress regime.Mallya, who left India on March 2 just as a consortium of banks sought attachment of assets and his arrest as well as a judicial order preventing him from leaving the country, dominated proceedings in the Rajya Sabha and also came up in the Lok Sabha.As Congress alleged Mallya escaped despite a 'lookout notice' by CBI, Jaitley said, ""That day, there was no order of any agency to stop him (from leaving the country)."" He said Mallya left before the banks moved the Supreme Court for seizure of his passport.The discussion in the Lok Sabha happened after Speaker Sumitra Mahajan rejected notices for adjournment motions submitted by several Congress, Left and Trinamool MPs even as the opposition accused the NDA government of a ""criminal consipracy"" in allowing Mallya to fly out.In both Houses, Jaitley emphasised that it was under UPA that Mallya got all the controversial loans, listing dates when public sector banks gave money to the flamoyant liquor baron beginning in 2004 and a restructuring in 2010. ""You need to introspect,"" Jaitley told leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad who had attacked the government for letting Mallya leave the country.""We asked Mr Jaitley to tell us how Mallya ran away from India. If there is action against him and a lookout notice has been issued against him, then what is he doing in the Rajya Sabha,"" a combative Rahul asked outside Parliament.As the government and opposition clashed over him, Mallya's transformation from someone whose company was coveted by politicians of diverse hues into someone who was to be shunned seemed to be complete. The confrontation amid intense public scanner also shrank the scope for any room for sympathy.In the Rajya Sabha, SP's Naresh Agarwal demanded action against Mallya, alleging he had violated qualification norms to become a member of the Upper House.As the RS assembled, Azad said high hopes that the government had created of getting black money back stood demolished. He said the government could not get former cricket czar Lalit Modi back and now Mallya had fled too.In the Lok Sabha, junior parliamentary affairs minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that Mallya was ""no saint for us"" and that he had ""not been given a single penny"" by the NDA government, before Jaitley walked in and decided to reply."

Now that Trinamool Congress has taken to theatre for its poll campaign, can BJP be left behind? No, says actor-turned-secretary of BJP's state committee Locket Chatterjee. She has already begun work on scripting four street plays for the upcoming poll campaign.State BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said that street plays have been a part of political campaigns in the Delhi, Maharashtra and Bihar elections. ""In Bengal, we tried to include them in our 2014 polls too. But this is the first time we have decided to do it in such a big way.""Speaking on the issues that are dealt through the plays, Majumdar explained that the main target of their act will be Trinamool Congress. ""We will highlight the failures of the party and showcase the achievements of the Modi government. We will also speak about our development plans,"" Majumdar said.According to Chatterjee, the 20-minute plays will be staged by eight teams, each of which will have five actors.""Unlike the Trinamool that is only interested in praising one individual in their 'Joyotu' campaign, our plays will rip apart their false promises. Our campaign's catchline is 'Din Bodle Din'. The prefix will be added depending on the theme of the dayDepending on the theme of the play, we will add a prefix to the title,"" Chatterjee said.So, if the day's play is is a play on corruption, it will be called 'Durnitir Din Bodle Din'. If it is on rape or rigging, it will be called 'Dhorshoner Din Bodle Din' or 'Rigging-er Din Bodle Din' respectively.The party plans to rope in professional actors, who will be paid approximately Rs 500 per show., are being roped in for the campaign. Every team will have around five plays scheduled for it everyday. players As many as four shows are being planned per day for every team.Unlike Trinamool, which has a strong base in the theatre world, BJP is gardually foraying into taking babysteps in this territory. ""As a child, I did one play. Few years back, I did a play in Toronto that was based on a Dulal Lahiri story. This project Acting in the plays for BJP's political campaign is my first such serious theatre involvement in Bengal. But I will not act here,"" Chatterjee said.The scripts have packed in sarcastic barbs that relates at all to almost all the recent goof-ups in Bengal. Take for example a script on the dialysis of a dog at a premiere government hospital. ""Taking cue from an incident where a 'VVIP' dog of a senior Trinamool leader was allegedly referred to the hospital for dialysis, we came up with a fun script,"" she said.The 'fun script' has funnier dialogues. ""On the recommendation of a certain Mr Maji, someone called Banerjee Babu is shown to have taken a dog for dialysis. When an ordinary citizen also approaches the same hospital for dialysis, he is refused because everyone is busy treating the dog,"" Chatterjee said.The spoof on the controversy regarding the Teachers' Eligibility Test (TET) examination will depict how shows how the money given in dowry has been used by the groom's family to bribe the officials.""But that is of no help since the bride is shown waiting for her jobless husband to get work,"" the actor said.The party has also planned a parody of Sukumar Ray's 'HaJaBaRaLa' has also been planned. The scriptwriters have been working hard to include subjects like the chit fund and the potato scheme scams. Then, of course, there are the recent controversies related to Jadavpur University.""Our party has zero tolerance on anti-nationals. For us, our nation is above everything. Irrespective of the intellectual masks that politicians wear, any party that doesn't hold such a view is a misfit. We will certainly highlight that in our street plays,"" Majumdar concluded."

Ironically, in a largely vegetarian country, fruits and vegetables account for only 9% of the total calorie intake in the country The trend in consumption pattern, however, varies from region to region with people living in south Indian cities consuming more fruits and vegetables as compared to those in the north .These findings are part of the India's Phytonutrient Report, brought out on Thursday by the Delhi-based think-tank Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER). It is based on a survey done across five cities  National Capital Region (Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida), Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata  covering 1,001 individuals drawn from upper and middle income groups.Chennai tops the list with the highest number of servings of fruits and vegetables, while Kolkata is at the bottom of the list. ""The greater number of vegetarians and relatively higher income can partly explain the high levels of intake of fruits and vegetables in Chennai and Hyderabad"", says the report.WHO recommends a daily intake of at least 400 grams (or five daily servings with an average size of 80 grams) of fruits and vegetables, excluding potatoes, cassava and other starchy tubers to ""prevent diet-related chronic diseases and micro-nutrient deficiencies"". The report notes that the Indians consume quite less than WHO norms.The country has, however, been producing fairly good quantity of fruits and vegetables. India had during 2013-14 produced 88.98 million metric tonnes (MT) of fruits and 162.89 million MT of vegetables. The country at present ranks second in the production of fruits and vegetables in the world after China.The report highlights a number of regulatory issues related to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act and consumer protection regulations, which if rectified, could support an efficient supply chain and help to increase the consumption."

Every bite of the roll or parcel let out epic flavours.In 1838, WG Osborne , military secretary to the Me Earl of Lord Auckland , Governor-General of India, accompanied highranking British officials on a mission to Ranjit Singh 's Punjab.His mission was to persuade the Maharaja to join hands with the British. He penned an account of his journey and stay at the palace in a book titled, `The Court and Camp of Runjeet Sing' (sic).In the book, he describes the Maharaja's liking for spicesstuffed boneless meats, especially quails.At one point he mentions, ""The different eatables were served up in the nicest and cool est little vessels possible, about the size of teacups, made of fresh green leaves, so closely sewn to gether as to be capable of retain ing liquids, and beautifully cool and clean. A tray was brought to McGregor and myself, upon each of which was arranged about six of these little cups, contain ing different sorts of own curry, rice, curds, and some remarkably fat quails, with all the ate bones taken out, and highly spiced and sea soned.""A possible reason for serv ing boneless meat was that the king was old at that time. He passed away a year later.Again, while describing the Maharaja's booze sessions, Os bor ne mentions the spices stuffed poultry. ""The only food allowed you at these drinking bouts are fat quails stuffed with all sorts of spices...""Ranjit Singh, whom Osborne called the Lion of Lahore, looked after the birds himself. Though it is not known that these were the ones used for food, the book says, ""During noon-time, the Maharaja often fed grains to his pigeons, quails, falcons, etc., or strolled for pleasure in the garden inside the fort.""However, we can't hail the quail any longer. The bird is not available in the market as there is a ban on its slaughter. Considered a delicacy among the rich families of Punjab, quails were said to be tastier than chicken.Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University had developed a strain of white quail for breeding, but environmentalists took up cudgels, saying the Wildlife Protection Act mentions quail as protected species. However, while the debate rages on, the Punjabis fond of stuffed meats can substitute it with chicken. And as Ranjit Singh would have preferred, it should be boneless. Though the king served it with drinks, one can have it as a starter or as an accompaniment.The overwhelming spices the British officer refers to are added in marination as well as the stuffing. The base of the stuffing can be minced meat, boiled eggs (in the olden days, quail eggs were stuffed in quail meat), cottage cheese or boiled potatoes. Ginger and garlic are added to the mari nation as well as the stuffing.Though these were grilled in the tandoor back in the day, you can grill them in oven or shallow fry in a pan. But the clay oven lifts the taste to another level."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives. RSN MKJ ABI"

Although the registration is under the Companies Act, the companies will operate on co-operative basis, where farmers will be made shareholders. The primary objective of the project is to create an ecosystem for farmers by providing them backward and forward integration.As part of the backward integration, an agri-mart under the brand name Ginkgo Plus would be set up, which will procure quality seeds in bulk thereby reducing the input cost. Farmers will also be given facilities such as warehouses, pack houses, research and development as well as farm mechanization services.""Apart from this, we will form joint ventures to sell the farmers' products. Swedish firm Plantagon has already evinced interest in tying up with us,"" said Jagat Shah, promoter of Cluster Pulse .The project also envisages creating retail and food outlets, to be known as Food Mart.The forward linkage includes retailing, exports, processing, value addition and brand creation for farm products. According to Shah, entrepreneurs will be encouraged to set up units for value addition and the target is to have 10,000 such agripreneurs.The project is mainly aimed at organic farming and deal in commodities like paddy, castor, cumin seeds, guar seeds, chilli, tomato, brinjal, potatoes as well as fruits.""There is a huge demand for organic farm products in the international market,"" said Shah.Gujarat State Co-operative Bank will also be roped in for financing farmers and agripreneurs.The project proponents plan to bring in 20,000 hectares of land in the first year and 40,000 hectares in five years under this initiative."
58f526b57be9e01a17c939e2,Indigenous fare rules at Pune's pop-ups,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Indigenous-fare-rules-at-Punes-pop-ups/articleshow/51287069.cms,2016-03-07,,The Times Of India,"With the city's foodscape gaining added dimensions by the day, Pune's food tribe has begun warming up to more intimate experiences, going beyond regular restaurants replete with swish ambiences and limited menus. Pop-up restaurants for one, are have become recurring occurrences in the city , much to the delight of gourmands and restaurateurs alike. Offering a window to intimate community and indigenous culinary experiences, these give you a chance to dine with complete strangers. Pune Times sets out to `pop' the question as to why the trend is picking up.The past weekend saw foodies bonding over dishes like mutton chops finished with Sri Lankan spices, seer sothi (fish in yellow curry) and Jaffna prawns rice, among others, at a Sri-Lankan popup in Koregaon Park. ""Pop-ups seem a perfect way to introduce people to cuisines they might not have heard of or found at, in city restaurants,"" says Richa Choudhary , who has been organising pop-ups regularly for the past few months. ""People are looking for more experience-based dining now,"" believes Insia Lacewalla, who curates culinary experiences. ""Having travelled extensively , they want to sample new food and meet new people, and pop-ups are an easy way to do that,"" she adds who did a Mangalorean pop-up in Pune a few months ago. Not a new concept on the global culinary radar, pop-ups have began trickling in recently , closer home.Usually hosted at eateries, festivals or private spaces, these are one-time events that last just a day or more. Specially curated menus, restaurants undergoing makeovers or home chefs coming in to present their preparations; these are just some of the characteristics that comprise the experience.Pop-ups come as a chance to explore for those who've had their share of the mundane. Owing to their short span of existence,restaurateurs and curators can cook up a storm, bringing indigenous, exotic and community cuisines to the table. A love for Sri Lankan fare and a dearth of places where it is available gave Richa the idea for a Sri Lankan pop-up. ""A lot goes behind planning a pop-up menu -research, food tasting and reading up about the place and its cuisine,"" shares Richa, who teamed up with home chef Sharad Bagde for this.The menu comprised kukulu massamma (slow cooked coastal chicken curry) and cashews in sprig curry leaves, fare she tasted in Sri Lanka including the chef 's recommendations. Recent pop-ups dedicated to Parsi cuisine and Bohri fare helped throw light on these communities and their fare, featuring lesser known dishes like aleti paleti from the Parsi kitchen and specials from the Bohri household like smoked mutton kheema samosas and raan in red masala respectively .Says IT professional Jasdeep Singh, who attended the Bohri pop-up, ""It gave me the chance to sample a huge variety of food not usually available. I also met a lot of like-minded people who share a common passion for food."" Foodies can look forward to a Pathare Prabhu cuisine pop-up soon.Similarly, the pop-up by a popular Delhi-based Japanese restaurant, hosted by a restaurant in Camp, gave diners the chance to sample traditional Japanese fare like teriyaki glazed artichoke and signature pork belly, also demystifying the fare with a compact menu and a dedicated set-up. ""We hosted the pop-up for three months, so we created a sit-down experience with special ambiance,"" says Khodu Irani, the hosting restaurant's partner.Pop-ups provide one with the chance to acquaint themselves with diverse cuisines, much to the joy of home chefs who have much to offer. Having done three pop-ups in Pune, Mumbai based Gitika Saikia, North East food curator, has introduced Puneites to interesting indigenous fare like baby potatoes and night jasmine flowers, pork with Assamese coriander and goose meat with ash gourd and red ant eggs for the more adventurous palette.""Dishes are curated based on availability of ingredients from Assam, most of them sourced from there,"" Gitika says. She added to the experience by serving her patrons course by course, explaining the story behind each dish. It was a similar experience at the Bohri pop-up, where diners got to dine out of the thaal, essential to the meal. ""I took people through the meal, explaining each item on the thaal and every practice. It was an intimate community experience,"" says Munaf Kapadia. Insia adds, ""My partner Paresh and I realised that the best food comes from people's homes, and there's much to be discovered on the Indian region food scene alone."" The Mangalorean and Parsi pop-ups both saw home chefs dishing out authentic fare.Given its format, pop-ups also serve as a wonderful platform for experimentation at lower cost. Sunil Kirpalani, who co-runs a cafe on Salunke Vihar Road, recently did a pop-up in Baner. ""This allowed us to get in touch with people from that part of town and test another market. Our extensive menu also gave them a chance to get our fare in the comfort of their vicinity. This is something we'd like to do more often,"" says Sunil, signing off."

We have increased the total storage capacity of our two godowns at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, from existing 2,500 metric tonnes to 4,000 metric tonnes. Moreover, we are also planning to take onion storage facilities with capacity of 4,000 metric tonnes on lease.""Patil, who is also a chairman of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, ""The Union government has asked us to create buffer stock of summer onions, which is expected to arrive in the market from next month. Last year, we had procured only around 2,500 metric tonnes of onions during April and May due to lack of storage capacity; although the Centre had asked us to procure 10,000 metric tonnes under the PSF to tackle scarcity and stabilise prices.""Last year, the Centre created buffer stock of around 12,000 metric tonnes of onions through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the PSF. Last year, Nafed procured only 2,500 tonnes of summer onions under PCF due to lack of storage capacity. Now, it has increased the storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes and is planning to take storage facilities on lease for additional 4,000 metric tonnes.The summer crops, which have a shelf life of around six months, cater to market till the arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September-end. The kharif and late-kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected.Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year when there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby prices reporting an upward trend. Considering this, the Centre has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of only around 25 days. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest-free loans to central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees considering the possible scarcity of onions and price rise in future. Initially, the scheme is to be implemented for the current fiscal and the next financial year 2016-17 for onion, potato and pulses."

While the number of Antyodaya beneficiaries in UP are 1.64 crore, Bundelkhand's own Antyodaya beneficiaries add up to 9.55 lakh. Distribution of the special Bundelkhand package will be overseen by the state's relief and rehabilitation department.On Tuesday, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav formally announced the extension of the National Food Security Act, 2013, to all 75 districts of the state.A formal announcement of special initiative for Bundelkhand, sources said, is expected to be announced by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav during the ongoing budget session of the UP Assembly.Conditions in Bundelkhand's seven districts -- Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, and Chitrakoot-- are considerably worse. Apart from being among one of the poorest regions of the state, it has also fallen victim to three consecutive years of crop losses. Some farmer families have reportedly been forced, under the prevailing circumstances, to subsist on chapatis made of a locally grown grass called 'fikara'.While the modalities of the scheme are still in the process of being worked out, state government officials told TOI the desi ghee to be distributed in Bundelkhand will be sourced from UP's Pradeshik Cooperative Dairy Federation, Parag. Annually, Parag produces about 7 lakh kilos of desi ghee for consumption across the state. In Bundelkhand alone, the number of antyodaya beneficiaries is 9.55 lakh. It is not clear, as yet, where the extra quantities of desi ghee will be procured from.Following the state government bounty, Bundelkhand will have more edible oil than the entire country's average consumption. India's per capita consumption of edible oil in 2013-14, according to an ICRA Limited report, was 14.4 kilo per annum. In Bundelkhand, under the government package, Antyodaya families will get 5 kilos of edible oil per month.Incidentally, UP has implemented the Act three years after its enactment. Announcing that the law will become fully operational across up by April 1, the chief minister said foodgrains under the targeted public distribution system (TPDS) would now be made available to all beneficiaries at subsidised rates of Rs 3, Rs 2, and Rs 1 per kilo of rice, wheat and coarse grains, respectively.Till now, only Antyodaya families -- the poorest of poor in the state -- were receiving subsidised foodgrains, while those families living below or above the poverty line were having to pay more for PDS food grain. While NFSA had already been implemented in 28 districts from January 1, this year, it has now become operational across UP, principal secretary (food and civil supplies) Sudhir Garg said on Tuesday.Bundelkhand, however, because of its ""exclusive criteria"", the government said, is not covered under the NFSA. Under the food security law, rice, wheat and coarse grains will be available to all categories of ration card holders - BPL, Antyodaya and APL -- at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 per kilo, respectively. While NFSA ensures 5 kilos of food grains per month to beneficiaries, those registered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the Act says, will continue to receive 35 kilos of food rains."

Though I'm yet to see the vigilance court directive, I'm resigning from the post on moral grounds. I had said earlier that I would never cling to the post citing technicalities if any court makes remarks against me... I hope the CM will accept my resignation,"" Babu said at a press meet in Kochi.Babu's announcement came after a closed-door meeting with CM Oommen Chandy and senior Congress members. Babu is widely considered a close confidant of Chandy, who refused to comment on the resignation. Earlier in the day, vigilance enquiry commissioner and special judge S S Vasan had directed VACB to submit a progress report on the probe against the minister by February 22. He also made it clear that the probe should be a court-monitored enquiry.Babu has been accused of demanding Rs 10 crore as bribe for reopening bars after the state government decided to close them down."

Since sports fantasy league is quite popular among youth, we created a similar one for elections, says Santhosh Kr. Subramanian, one of Potatolives co-founders. The game went live on Wednesday, and so far more than 250 people have logged in and played it.After logging in, the players are presented with two sets of constituencies: Star and My Favourites. For the 10 star constituencies, the players need to choose the winning candidates and their vote percentages. For My Favourites category, they need to first choose their own constituencies. The rest is the same.They need to predict the winning vote percentage of each candidate in their respective constituencies, says Mr. Subramanian, adding:. Once the election results are announced we will match it with the game results and announce winners.The winners will be chosen on the basis of two criteria  how many candidates from their virtual political party win the election, and how close their prediction of vote percentages it is to the actual ones. Mr. Subramanian feels that this game will also create awareness about elections.The start-up intends to keep this game live even after the elections are over.

The incident took place on Monday.The elephant had raided a potato field near the village near Khuttimari forest. The field located at Kerani Para in Duramari belongs to one Dhwajen Adhikary, who had allegedly hooked power from high tension line and laid the open wire on the ground to prevent the jumbos from raiding , said a forest official.. The elephant died on the spot on coming in contact with the wire.On Monday morning, villagers of Duramari saw the carcass of the elephant lying on the field electricutedwith electric wires on its trunk. Primarily Foresters are certain of electrocution. It was the villagers who informed the forest department about the incident. ""The signs on the body indicated that the elephant died of electrocution. The department has lodged an FIR against the land owner,"" honorary wildlife warden Seema Chowdhury said. Dhwajen is on the run from police.Tapping of power from high tension wires and laying of electric traps for jumbos is a common practice in this part of the state, especially in Dooars and Terai. People living in the forest villages and on the fringe areas do this to stop elephants from sneaking into their habitat and paddy fields, especially during the time of harvesting.Over the past few years, the practice has also gained popularity among villagers in the Baundangi area of Nepal's Kakarvitta, a place which is often raided by elephants that cross over the Mechi river on the Indo-Nepal border and enter that village.In Bengal, as many as 18 jumbos were electrocuted in Dooars and Terai over the past decade.Environmentalists blame it on the indiscriminate growth of human settlements in and around forestlands. ""Having their land occupied, elephants have started sneaking into human habitat. The behavioural change in elephants is a result of the continuous man-elephant conflict,"" said Animesh Basu, a member of state wildlife advisory board.An adult elephant requires 200 kilogram of green fodder and 100 litres water every day to survive and due to the continuous reduction in green cover, they raid villages in search of food."

It is estimated that 20,000 to 25,000 street vendors operate in the city and a bulk of them use handcarts.Till now, VMC used to collect Rs 500 as removal charges from handcarts up to the size of two meters. It was proposed to raise the charges to Rs 5,000. For handcarts over two meters, the removal charges were to be increased from Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000. The administration had also proposed that instead of releasing handcarts, cabins and other items within 15 days as per present norms, these should be detained up to 45 days.The standing committee had kept the matter pending in its meeting last week and it was said that the elected wing needed more time to consider the matter as several aspects were involved.

He also reviewed the progress of work undertaken by the panel in their last two meetings and has tasked it to bring violators to book.The panel has been constituted in the consumer affairs ministry which has been closely coordinating with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the IB, the income tax department, the ED, the commerce ministry and state police to deal with caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing.A senior officer said the Centre has initiated these measures to avoid any sudden spike in prices. During the Bihar polls last year, prices of pulses had risen abnormally becoming a major political issue that contributed to NDA's poor show.The DRI has provided a list of major traders involved in import and export of pulses and other commodities for the panel to analyse and for stricter enforcement against caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing, particularly pulses, onion and potatoes. The Centre has also suggested that states fix the margin of profit for traders since in the past there have been huge gaps between wholesale and retail prices.A source said the panel was formed after the PMO and the Cabinet secretariat asked the consumer affairs ministry to take proactive action against hoarders and black-marketeers. Since the enforcement involved states as well, consumer affairs secretary C Vishwanath mooted bringing all departments on one platform for sharing information and concerted action against speculators and manipulators.TOI had first reported on January 26 how the IB had alerted the Centre about major importers of pulses hoarding masoor in huge quantity to control prices when there is a shortage."

Spread over on the southern and northern banks of River Bhavani, the town with over four lakh population has been struggling hard to balance environment protection and development.The Mettupalayam Assembly constituency includes the Mettupalayam Municipality, the town panchayats of Sirumugai, Karamadai, Gudalur, No. 4 Veerapandi and village panchayats in the Karamadai Panchayat Union.Agriculture is the primary occupation  banana, vegetables and areca nut being the important crops. The farmers there face challenges in clean water for cultivation, crop destruction from wild animals, and good price. T.T. Rangasamy of the Bhavani River Water and Groundwater Protection Council says that effluents discharged from the textile and paper industries have made the river water unfit for cultivation. That the water is also polluted by sewage from households and the Mettupalayam town residents dont get clean drinking water is another issue.The farmers in forest fringes face the threat of crop destruction by wild animals, particularly wild boar. For the farming community, this is an important issue, which the next representative in the Tamil Nadu Assembly should address, he says.For the residents, supply of polluted water and that too at irregular intervals is a big problem, says N. Venkataraman of the Mettupalayam Consumer Protection Organisation. The town does not have underground drainage facility. The result is that untreated sewage enters River Bhavani, from where the municipality draws water for drinking water supply.This is the most important issue for not only the towns residents but also those in other towns and villages who depend on the river for water.The other issue that comes to the fore from voters is de-congesting the Mettupalayam town. They want the next elected representative to take steps to complete the road-over bridge at Karamadai railway crossing, Mettupalayam bypass road from Karamadai through Guddaiyur and extend the road leading to Ooty.The other solution that the next MLA should try is for increasing the frequency of the Mettupalayam-Coimbatore train service as that will decongest the road, says L.S. Sidduram, advisor, Mettupalayam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.The vegetable traders, who are an economic pillar for the town and nearby areas, have shifted mundies to outside the town. The potato traders are the ones who still remain in Mettupalayam. The next government should take steps to move them and also workshops and scrap merchants to further decongest Mettupalayam, he adds.The voters other demands include an industrial estate or park in Karamadai to encourage entrepreneurs to set shop there, a marketing society for farmers to protect prices and facilities for handloom weavers in Sirumugai and Chikkadasampalayam.Politically, this constituency has been with the AIADMK since 2001. AIADMKs A.K.Selvaraj won that election by over 40,000 votes. Since then it has been a direct contest between the AIADMK and DMK. In the 2006 election, the DMKs B.Arunkumar lost by a wafer-thin margin of 142 votes.This time, the AIADMK has fielded incumbent O.K. Chinnaraj. DMK has fielded S. Surendran and the TMC has given T.S.

But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

As compared to the price of Rs5-6 per kg in 2015, local farmers are currently fetching Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets, thanks to lower production in other states.Top potato growing states -Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal -have seen production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. Although the yield in Gujarat, too, has dipped by 10% this year, unlike other major states Gujarat has registered an increase in potato production on account of higher acreage. In fact, the potato output has galloped substantially over the last two years.The potato production in an area of one lakh hectare was around 35 lakh tonnes as against 31 lakh tonnes of 2015 and 23 lakh tonnes in 2014.Agriculture minister, Babubhai Bokhiriya, said, ""There is low potato production in the country, barring Gujarat, and hence the farmers are getting good prices. The other reason being that the state has, in the last one year, increased its cold storage capacity, which has led to better storage facilities, and hence the farmers expecting a higher price later are storing their produce, rather than selling on spot,"" he said.""Last year, there was a glut in the market. The supply is higher this year, but the excess output has been absorbed by increase in storage capacity providing a much needed cushion to the farmers. The prices would have fallen this year, too, had there been a rise in potato production across the country,"" said Ashish Guru, president, Gujarat Cold Storage Association.The cold storage capacity in Gujarat saw addition of approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50 kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes, while the annual consumption of potato in the state is 20 lakh tonnes. The lower output in other states kept the prices of vegetable firm, and farmers in Gujarat are able to reap the benefits due to availability of cold storages. ""The wholesale prices had plummeted to Rs 5-6 per kg in Gujarat last year due to glut in the market. However, the prices have remained at Rs 10-13 per kg in 2016 much to the relief of farmers,"" Guru added.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Gujarat potatoes are supplied to Maharashtra and states in south India, and are exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

So, we will not back off,"" said Desai, expressing hope that the proposed draft is discussed and cleared within two or three weeks, so that it can be implemented.He also said that housing societies or residents can order vegetables or fruits directly from farmers as it be a mutually beneficial move. ""Consumers will get fresh farm produce while farmers will get a better price,"" said Desai.The Union government has proposed de-listing of fruits and vegetables, especially potato and onion, from the APMC regulation, which has been accepted by three statesMadhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.After meeting APMC traders, Patil said they will consider traders' side and APMC should not lose out.

While the number of Antyodaya beneficiaries in UP are 1.64 crore, Bundelkhand's own Antyodaya beneficiaries add up to 9.55 lakh. Distribution of the special Bundelkhand package will be overseen by the state's relief and rehabilitation department.On Tuesday, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav formally announced the extension of the National Food Security Act, 2013, to all 75 districts of the state.A formal announcement of special initiative for Bundelkhand, sources said, is expected to be announced by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav during the budget session of the Assembly.Conditions in Bundelkhand's seven districts -Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, and Chitrakoot-are considerably worse.Apart from being among one of the poorest regions of the state, it has also fallen victim to three consecutive years of crop losses. Some farmer families have reportedly been forced, under the prevailing circumstances, to subsist on chapatis made of a locally grown grass called 'fikara'.While the modalities of the scheme are still in the process of being worked out, state government officials told TOI the desi ghee to be distributed in Bundelkhand will be sourced from UP's Pradeshik Cooperative Dairy Federation, Parag. Annually, Parag produces about 7 lakh kilos of desi ghee for consumption across the state. In Bundelkhand alone, the number of antyodaya beneficiaries is 9.55 lakh. It is not clear, as yet, where the extra quantities of desi ghee will be procured from.Following the government bounty, Bundelkhand will have more edible oil than the country's average consumption. India's per capita consumption of edible oil in 201314, according to an ICRA Limited report, was 14.4 kilo per annum. In Bundelkhand, under the government package, Antyodaya families will get 5 kilos of edible oil per month.Incidentally, UP has implemented the Act three years after its enactment. Announcing that the law will become fully operational across up by April 1, the chief minister said foodgrains under the targeted public distribution system (TPDS) would now be made available to all beneficiaries at subsidised rates of Rs 3, Rs 2, and Rs 1 per kilo of rice, wheat and coarse grains, respectively.Till now, only Antyodaya families -the poorest of poor in the state -were receiving subsidised foodgrains, while those families living below or above the poverty line were having to pay more for PDS food grain. While NFSA had already been implemented in 28 districts from January 1, this year, it has now become operational across UP, principal secretary (food and civil supplies) Sudhir Garg said on Tuesday.Bundelkhand, however, because of its ""exclusive criteria"", the government said, is not covered under the NFSA.Under the food security law, rice, wheat and coarse grains will be available to all categories of ration card holders BPL, Antyodaya and APL -at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 per kilo, respectively. While NFSA ensures 5 kilos of food grains per month to beneficiaries, those registered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the Act says, will continue to receive 35 kilos of food rains."

Damodar said of the 18 cold storages under is department 12 are not working since 1998.""I had taken due steps at a high-level meeting for the revival of 10 cold storages and informed the registrar of cooperative societies in writing to start the process of seeking expression of interest through advertisements from private entrepreneurs, but in vain. Nothing has been done yet. What can I do?"" Damodar said.Pratap countered the minister's attempt to dissociate himself from the potato crisis. ""By throwing the blame on the bureaucrats the minister cannot shirk his responsibility. It is his job to make his department function sincerely and solve the problem,"" Pratap said.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan after reaching Bhubaneswar on Saturday joined the potato row, much to the discomfiture of the BJD. ""It is unfortunate that after 15 years of being in power, the BJD government is not able to solve recurring potato shortage in the state. This government only knows how to claim credit over schemes announced by the Centre, but does nothing to address the problems faced by common people,"" Dharmendra said.Potato production in Odisha is officially stated to be around 2.5 lakh tonnes per annum, much less to meet the annual consumption of about 9 lakh tonnes. The low output is largely attributed to farmers' fear of distress sale of the crop due to non-availability of cold storage facilities. At present, potato price rules at Rs 20, almost double of last week's rate, hitting the general public severely.Leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra asked why the potato mission launched by the government last year failed to yield the desired results. The mission flopped because any scheme launched for acquiring political mileage is bound to fail, Narasingha said.Meanwhile, the BJP organised a demonstration at Sambalpur on Saturday protesting against the rising potato price."

Mohinder Singh Sidhu's attempt to get out of the conventional crop cycle about two decades ago in Sheron village of Sangrur has been a fully spiced-up example of it.Sidhu started planting red chillies in his village known more for wheat and paddy rotation, season after season. Today, farmers from even Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of neighbouring Haryana come to Sheron to buy chilli seeds from Sidhu. For the forthcoming planting season, he has prepared seeds for 200 acres.Even near home, farmers of his village plan to have at least 50 acres under red chillie as planting starts in a week from now. Till a few years ago, chilli were planted over 10-15 acres. Sidhu's advice to his fellow farmers and higher prices fetched by his crop are the key reasons for the shift.Known as 'chilli king', 53-year-old Sidhu is, however, not limiting himself to one crop only. He also grows various vegetables and oil seeds, including tomatoes, grams, mustard and potatoes in half of his 30-acre landholding.His tryst with the spice crop began in 1995. A trendsetter, Sidhu are first in the area to set up net house at his farm to grow vegetables and chillies.Speaking about his foray into spices and vegetables, Sidhu said, ""A farmer has to spend nearly Rs 30,000 for sowing chilli in one acre and can get an average yield in the range 80-100 quintals. Going by today's price of about Rs 14-15 per kg, one can easily earn up to four times of the total input costs, which is roughly over Rs 1.2 lakh per acre. Having seen the high returns, more than a dozen farmers in my village alone have decided to grow chillies in the season which starts from the middle of February.""He says his motivation to diversify into other crops was simple. ""I wanted to increase my income from existing landholding. That's the reason I decided to grow chilli in 1995, and soon started reaping benefits of my new venture and carve a niche for myself in Punjab. Recognition followed sometime later as I was conferred with the state award for progressive farmer in 1998 from PAU. Next year, I received the Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal Award, and in 2000 PAU bestowed 'Chilli King' title on me. In 2005, I got the Chief Minister's Award."""

Besides, the fluctuating prices take the cost over the budget.Also, with the current fund allotted by the State government, it is difficult to buy enough vegetables and fuel to feed the 70 odd students everyday, even if the prices are not very high, said a noon meal worker on condition of anonymity.The Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme, in 2012, had introduced a weekly menu, which included mixed rice, vegetable rice, boiled potatoes and eggs among other items in the noon meal programme. The department later increased the feeding charges in anganwadis from 56 paise to Rs. 1.13 per child for days when dal is prepared, which includes 70 paise for vegetables, 24 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. When there is no dal on the menu, the allocation is Rs. 1.35, including 80 paise for vegetables, 36 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. However, 5 paise is deducted from spices, as salt is provided by the Civil Supplies Department.The workers also get four subsidised cooking gas cylinders every year from the government. However, this is not at all adequate. Moreover, many schools do not even have LPG connection and they have to manage with firewood, complained N. Anusuya, member of the Noon Meal Organising Union.The per child per school day charge for children under the noon meal scheme was also increased to Re. 1.30 on days when dal rice is prepared and on other days the charge is Re. 1.70. For older classes, the allocation is Re. 1.40 and Re. 1.80 respectively.Most children come from far off places and the noon meal is their only source of energy. We cant always pay from our own pockets to buy vegetables. This has to be looked into, said Anusuya.Underweight a concernThe fifth Joint Review Mission report on mid-day meal scheme in Tamil Nadu, conducted by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and Department of School Education and Literacy in 2013, pointed out that of a total sample of 279 children, 19.7 per cent were found to be severely underweight and the percentage of normal weight children was only 12.1. Prevalence of underweight was more among girls (89 per cent) compared to boys (81.3 per cent). It had further stated that the funds allotted for purchase of vegetables could be increased due to hike in costs.In the current slab, the nutrition in the nutritious meal programme is being compromised, said S.A. Madappan, noon meal organiser and State president of Noon Meal Organising Union. To improve the situation, the Union has put forth their demands to the authorities demanding a Re.1 increase in the current allotment charge.K. Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-Forces added, Not only this, the allocation per child must be realistic. Only then will we be able to fulfil the true purpose of the scheme.Officials from the department said they were considering the unions demands. We also have to compare the hike in prices with previous years and other states. We shall do our best, said a senior official."

Now, we have increased the onion storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes.""He added, ""The storage capacity of Laslagaon godown of NAFED has been increased from 1,500 metric tonnes to 2,500 metric tonnes, while the storage capacity of Pimpalgaon godown has been increased from 1,000 metric tonnes to 1,500 metric tonnes. This year, we are planning to create buffer stock of 10,000 metric tonnes of summer onions during April and May. We are planning to lease out storage facilities in district to store additional 6,000 metric tonnes of onions.""The summer crops with a shelf life of around six months, cater to market until arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September end. The kharif and late kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year where there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby hike expected in the prices.Considering this fact, the central government has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of around 25 days and they get rotten thereafter. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The central government has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest free loans to central agencies like NAFED and SFAC, to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) considering possibility of the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future."

Kannauj has nearly 10 hectares of agricultural land, where roses are grown.In the district, there are two categories of farmers, one who cultivate rose shrubs exclusively in their plots and have made it their main occupation, while others grow rose bushes in their agricultural lands for extra income.""We have instructed the horticulture depart to prepare a list of farmers interested in learning advanced techonology in rose cultivation. The agriculture department will bear all the expenses. We will assure farmers there is a good return and encourage them to undergo training in Etah and Hathras districts from where rose buds are being currently supplied to local 'attar' manufacturers,"" the district horticulture officer said.Training and pruning of crop is one of the most important practices which influence flower production significantly.""In roses, this practice will be recommended from mid-December to mid-January in which farmers can get good yield. In the district, there are few, who have adopted an innovative practice of 'alternate year pruning'. In this practice, the crop is trained and pruned one year and kept unpruned in second year. Through this practice, second year crop gives higher number of branches and flowers,"" deputy director, agriculture, Rajesh Kumar said.This technology is cost effective and more remunerative in areas like Kannauj, where distillation of flowers is commercially done for extracting essence and its marketing. The farmers could save the money and increase his profit, he added.""Also, we will increase the area under rose cultivation which at present is 10 hectare. The aim is also to introduce diversity in agriculture so that farmers can choose from value crop instead of usual cash crops like paddy, wheat, potato or jowar,"" another officer of the agriculture department said."

For, the taluk in Bengaluru Rural district is fast growing and turning into an urban jungle from a vegetable bowl, thanks to the Kempegowda International Airport, the gateway to the country's Startup Capital.With prominent realtors building apartment complexes and government planning industrial parks, the taluk is becoming a sought-after location for many companies and also individuals searching for tranquil atmosphere away from the chaos of the city .However, that's the scene only in areas along the KIA Road; a visit to the interior areas gives a different picture. The taluk with diverse demography but prominently Vokkaliga population, still retains its agriculture roots. Staving off land sharks, people are fighting tooth and nail to save their farmlands.Raghavendra, a farmer, said urbanization is fast killing his source of livelihood. ""Five years ago, the government started acquiring our lands for the construc tion of the Devana halli R i n g Road. While the government is yet to complete the acquisition process by issuing notices and bringing us to the table, we are trying to save our lands. We don't know anything apart from agriculture,"" the 35-year-old farmer from Bommavaru village said.Raghavendra grows potato and bottle gourd. They are sold in Bengaluru and Mumbai.At the other end, Marakka, an agriculture labourer, fears losing her job if her employer decides to sell his farmland to builders. ""I have been a farm labourer since I was nine or 10. Things are fast changing, and I am nearing 65 now. We do not know what our future is going to be like,"" said Marakka while plucking kohlrabi in the field.The story resonates across the taluk, where diverse crops are grown. From ragi, the primary foodgrain grown in this belt, to roses and grapes, you name it and Devanahalli grows it.According to the agriculture department, the cultivable land has shrunk to 10,000 hectares in 2016 from 16,000 hectares in 2006. However, this is only on paper as the revenue department estimates that the taluk has only 8,000 hectares of farmland. The department blames the drop in agriculture land on lack of water and increasing urbanization.""Close to the city , the taluk is seeing unprecedented growth. Each year we are losing around 200 hectares to development and land acquisition. Under such circumstances, farmers are forced to sell their land, fearing they may lose out on the opportunity to make a quick money and be a part of the development story ,"" said a senior agriculture department official.The villagers say the government is the primary culprit robbing Devanahalli of its traditional roots and rendering farmers unemployed and subservient to MNCs that employ them as watchmen or cleaners.In Bommavaru alone, at least 77 farmers are likely to lose 62 hectares of land for road construction, which will bring them money but render them unemployed.Raghavendra said, ""The government will give Rs 60 lakh for an acre while others will offer Rs 1.2 crore.But this money , considering that we never see such hefty sums, will only last for a few years. What then?"""

A grocery shop off Boring Road said 'Panchmeva' packets comprising dry-fruits pieces were being sold in the run-up to Holi. ""A number of our regular buyers have asked for dry-fruits packets this year as they wanted to switch to some less sugary options,"" Gupta added.Mohanlal Kumar, a buyer said, ""Since we visit so many homes to extend Holi greetings, too much of sweet makes one feel stuffed. Hence, I thought lighter and less sweeter option of dry-fruits should be kept along with some regular sweets."""

On the first day of procurement on Wednesday, it collected 90 tonnes of vegetables.However, farmers at Kanthallur are up in arms against the delay in payments for earlier procurements and the low prices fixed for vegetables. P.T. Mohandas, president of the Kanthallur Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society which procures vegetables from the farmers, said private traders were giving farmers a higher price and only 250 kg of garlic was procured by Horticorp from Kanthallur.There are allegations that vegetables grown on estates are reaching the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralams (VFPCK) market at Kanthallur to be procured by Horticorp.Horticorps procurement prices fluctuated throughout the day, which was a concern for the farmers. Following their protest on Wednesday, Horticorp decided to fix prices for vegetables for the day from Thursday. The prices fixed on the day for a kg of carrot was Rs.27.50, cabbage Rs.15.40, potato Rs.26.40, beans Rs.31, and garlic Rs.135. A Horticorp official on Thursday said procurement would continue till September 11. He said there was no basis for the allegations that the prices fixed by private traders were higher than those fixed by Horticorp. It is Horticorps intervention that ensured fair prices for the farmers, saving them from exploitation by middlemen, he said.Large-scale arrival of vegetables was reported on Thursday from Vattavada, the main market. Jayaprakash, president of the Vattavada Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society, said Horticorp had paid all dues. Farmers received better prices this season."
