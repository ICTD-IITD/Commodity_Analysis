Data released by the state's agriculture department shows a 39% drop in land cultivated for rabi crop this season in Saurashtra.Overall, rabi sowing is down by 1.65 lakh hectares or 14% of the 33.68 lakh hectares cultivated in 2015. North Gujarat, which relies on Narmada canals, has witnessed only a slight increase in rabi sowing - from 10.58 lakh hectares to 10.82 lakh hectares.Region-wise, sowing was poorest in Saurashtra, at only 60.68% of fields cultivated for rabi crops as compared to 2015. In Saurashtra, instead of 9.04 lakh hectares usually tilled during rabi season, this year, only 5.50 lakh hectares have been used for rabi crop cultivation. The reason, said officials, is the shortage of water in dams. Officials of the agriculture department said that usually water in the check dams lasts till early December. But this year, due to erratic rains, farmers were forced to withdraw water during August and September leaving check dams empty by mid-October.Crop choice, observed officials, have also changed and there was a 100% increase in sowing of fennel seeds, while both potato and onion - essential for the kitchen - witnessed increase in sowing. This year, 11.24 lakh hectares of land have been used for potato crops, against the 8.16 lakh hectares used on an average."

Since water for irrigation of crops and personal consumption is heavily dependent on melting of glaciers in the mountain ranges, lack fresh snow has left residents from tribal districts in a crisis like situation. Moreover the district has recorded negligible rainfall. Lahaul has a total geographical area of 9,11,195 hectares of which 3,398 hectares is used for irrigation and cultivation. Lahaul-Spiti has 521 villages that are solely dependent on natural source of water for irrigation.The only cropping season begins from April to September with minimum and maximum temperatures ranging approximately between 12C and 24C.During this season, mainly grown cash crops are peas, potato and cauliflower. Barley is grown in 403 hectares area, maize in 19 hectares, wheat in 46 hectares, potato in 747 hectares, peas in 1782 hectares while 202 hectares is used up in the districts for fruit production.A study conducted by the state rural department under integrated watershed management programme states that most of the precipitation in the district is in the form of heavy snow in winter months. Springs emanating from snow deposits are major source of surface irrigation through gravity Kuhls (water channels). These springs are both perennial and ephemeral getting recharged mainly from melting of snow on higher reaches, the study states.Rajesh Baba said ""Past experiences have shown that less snowfall results in damage to crop production"".Dinesh Kumar a resident of Goshal village said that many people cultivate off season vegetables during summer and are earning handsome income by sending exotic vegetables to markets located outside the valley. ""These vegetables need plenty of water of irrigation and considering the fact that very less snowfall has been received so far there is a big question mark over their income in coming season,"" he added.""Snow during winters provides moisture to soil. Our irrigation channels are snow fed,"" said Jai Ram Thakur a resident of Hinsa village.Agro-climatic conditions of Lahaul valley is conducive to grow several high value cash crops included off season vegetables, vegetable seeds, exotic vegetables, seed potato, hops, apple, almond, apricot, sea buckthorn etc. There are vast tracts of cultivable waste lands, if brought under irrigation, could increase the cropped area by about 20 per cent, official sources said."

District officials said if potato prices keep soaring, measures will be taken to counter this. ""Our officials are keeping a close watch on the situation. If necessary, we will make arrangements to sell potato at government-run fair price shops,"" said collector Nirmal Mishra.As per the direction of the state government, the district administration will also start conducting surprise raids on potato wholesalers and their godowns located at Chhatra Bazaar and Krushak Bazaar Thursday onwards to check the price rise in retail markets.When potato prices had skyrocketed in the state earlier, Cuttack was among the first few districts to start selling the vegetable at fair price shops. Besides, special teams will conduct raids on potato godowns in the city to keep a check on hoarding. Retailers will also be directed to sell the vegetable at appropriate prices.The vegetable traders' association has ruled out the possibility of hoarding in Cuttack. There are hardly 8-10 big potato wholesalers in the city. ""It is difficult for traders to hoard potatoes as we do not have well-equipped cold storages to stock the vegetables. In fact, 5-7% of the vegetables rot during transportation. So we can't risk stocking it,"" said secretary of Chhatra Bazaar vegetable traders' association, Debendra Sahoo.Sahoo said attributed the price rise to low production in West Bengal. ""This year, West Bengal's potato production has gone down by almost 30-40%,"" added Sahoo. Traders in Cuttack import potato from West Bengal. On Tuesday, the wholesale price of a kg of potato was Rs 13 while it was sold in the retail market at Rs 16 to Rs 18."

58f1bef6a3d24b245e59ccb8,Strike at APMC Kalamna called off in just a day,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Strike-at-APMC-Kalamna-called-off-in-just-a-day/articleshow/53199424.cms,2016-07-14,"Nagpur: The strike by commission agents at Kalamna market yard, dubbed Asia's largest in terms of area, was called off in the evening after a day long built up. As agents in other market yards of the state were on a strike since last three days, those in Nagpur joined them on Wednesday. By that time a truce was struck. The agitation was against government's move to free vegetables and fruits from monopoly of market yards. The indefinite strike is now called off for a month.The showdown led to prices of potatoes jump to Rs22 a kg from Rs17 in the bulk market. Onions also touched Rs13 a kg from Rs 9. Rates of other vegetables jumped 25% to 30%, bringing many items in the range of Rs40 to Rs60 a kg. There was no impact on fruit prices, though there is a major presence of agents dealing in fruits at Kalamna. Rates of foodgrains also remained stable as supply at market yards is minimal during this season. Even though the new rule covered only fruits and vegetables, agents dealing in grains at Kalamna also joined the strike.The market yards are managed by an elected Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Till now it was mandatory to bring the produce to designated market yards and commission agents played an important role in the system.This is how business happens in an APMC. Suppose farmer turns up with 50 bags of onions, he will contact a commission agent. As would the prospective buyers. The agent then arranges an open auction which is monitored by APMC officials. After the deal is struck, the farmer gets his money through the agent who pays from his pocket and offers credit to the buyer. The agent deducts a commission in turn. Some times, farmers leave their produce with the agents with directions to sell only at a specific rate. The agents also offer farmers an advance even before produce is sold.The new rules bar agents from charging commission from farmers. Instead they have to take it from the trader buying the produce. The farmer is also free to sell the produce even out of APMC. ""This can have a major impact on our business. The government is freeing farmers from APMC but the agents are still bound there. Commission is deducted from farmers' payment as a charge of services provided by us,"" said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director in APMC Kalamna representing the commission agents.""The agents provide farmers with ready cash. The money is paid to farmers and recovered from trader after nearly a month. Some times the trader defaults but the agent ensures the farmer gets his money,"" said Jaiprakash Wasani, an agent agent dealing in onions and potatoes. Chabirram, a potato grower from Mainpuri who brought his produce to Kalamna, said ""we trust the agents as they pay in cash. Will the trader do it too in the new system?""""After the recent negotiation after which the strike was called off, it was proposed to free even the agents from APMC. So in the future there may be no auction. The agents may also directly buy farm produce from even out of APMC yards and sell it directly to traders,"" said Chhabrani. A final decision is expected a month later.Kishore Tiwari, director of Vasantrao Naik Swavalamban Mission, a state government task force on farmers, said the move only diverted attention from the core issue. This would help less than 1% of farmers as a majority of them would still sell through APMCs. The real benefit will be there if the reforms also covered foodgrains and cash crops, he said.In a nutshell* State government has ended monopoly of APMC yards* Farmers free to sell produce anywhere* Agents dealing in APMC yards see red, and announce indefinite strike* Those in Nagpur joined on Wednesday. Others on strike since three days* Agents have struck a truce with government, strike called off for a month* Government may allow even agents to buy produce anywhere* A day's strike leads to moderate increase in rates of vegetables* The reforms only cover vegetables and fruits"

The horticultural department attributes this to the introduction of high-yield hybrid variety seeds in the past few years.Five years ago, the total production of all the varieties of hill-grown vegetables in the Nilgiris stood at approximately 1.4 lakh metric tonnes. However, now the production has increased by 20% to 25% per annum and accounts for 1.72 lakh metric tonnes.""The horticulture department has introduced hybrid and high-yield varieties of vegetables, including carrot, beetroot, cabbage and potato in the past five years. Now, we can see a significant increase in productivity,"" N Mani, joint director, horticulture department told TOI. ""Nevertheless, the area for vegetable cultivation remains the same.""While high-yield varieties of potatoes like 'Kufri Gridhari' and 'Kufri Jothi' and 'Kufri Swarna' have been introduced to the farmers, hybrid varieties of carrot, beetroot and cabbage have also yielded good results for the farmers.""As far as beans is concerned, the native varieties are giving good yield and have good market support"", said Mani.There are over 70,300 farming families in the hill district who are cultivating vegetables on around 6,600 hectares of land.Earlier farmers used to go for two-three crops of vegetables in a year. But now, they go for four crops in one year.The department also renders the facility of micro irrigation system at 100% subsidy scheme, besides other subsidy schemes for vegetable cultivation. ""Hence, the farmers need not worry about monsoon failure, if at all it occurs,"" said Mani.C Sivalingam, a farmer in Ooty told TOI, ""The subsidies, rendered by the horticulture department are certainly encouraging the farmers. We see more yield per hectare with hybrid vegetables like carrot, beetroot and cabbage"".According to records, around 900 hectares of farming land, which was left without cultivation in the past, has come under active farming land as subsidies and hybrid and high yield varieties of vegetables attract the farmers.Recently Nilgiris collector P Sankar conducted an inspection tour to various farming lands in the district.He said, ""Agriculture and tourism are the backbones of the district. With increase in vegetable productivity, the district foresees a brighter future."""

""I have handed over the resignation letter to the CM.Though I'm yet see the vigilance court directive, I'm resigning from the post on moral grounds. I had said earlier that I would never cling on to the post citing technicalities if any court makes remarks against me... I hope the CM will accept my resignation,"" Babu said at a news conference in Kochi.Babu made his announcement after a closed-door meeting with Oommen Chandy and senior Congress leaders in Ernakulam.Sources said KPCC president VM Sudheeran's statement that the party considered the court directive very seriously, and that an appropriate decision would be taken soon, prompted Babu's quick response. Chandy, whose known confidant Babu is, speaking later in Kottayam acknowledged receipt of the resignation letter but said he will take a decision only after studying the vigilance court verdict and holding discussions with his colleagues.There might be worse to come. Bar Hotel Owners' Association working president Biju Ramesh threatened to reveal names of more ministers who accepted bribes from bar owners but only once the dates of assembly elections are declared.This, he explained, was not only to ensure that the electorate would punish them accordingly but also to minimise the incumbent government's ability to save its tainted ministers.Earlier in the day, in a scathing attack on the vigilance department for ineffective handling of the probe against the minister, vigilance inquiry commissioner and special judge S S Vasan directed VACB to submit a progress report on the probe by February 22.He also made it clear that the new probe should be a court-monitored inquiry as per the 2008 order of the Supreme Court. In his order, the judge recalled that Quick Verification Report (QVR) order was issued on December 9, 2015, and ""no result worth the name has come out after a lapse of one and a half months ... Considering the circumstances, I find that investigation has to be monitored by this court.""The inquiry has been ordered based on a complaint filed by social activist George Vattukulam. As per his complaint, Biju Ramesh had alleged that Babu had demanded Rs 10 crore as bribe from bar owners for reopening bars after the state government had decided to close them down.Biju Ramesh had also stated publicly that bar owners had paid Rs 50 lakh as advance to the excise minister on October 31 last. The judge has ordered filing of FIR against Biju Ramesh too since offering bribe is as culpable as accepting it.Claiming that there was no pressure on him to resign from any quarter, Babu dared LDF to make it clear they will not reopen the 730 closed bars.""Can the LDF announce in their election manifesto that they would not reopen the closed bars,"" he asked.Babu also alleged that he was `victim' of a conspiracy between bar owners and CPM leaders, particularly its state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.CPM leaders rebut conspiracy angleK Babu on Saturday said it was CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan who conspired against him with bar hotel owners. In a press conference held in Kochi, the outgoing minister said Kodiyeri held a meeting with five bar owners on December 15, 2015, at 7pm at the house of CPM MLA Sivankutty in Thiruvananthapuram.According to Babu, Kodiyeri demanded bar owners to drag the names of a few more ministers so as to topple the UDF government. Biju Ramesh's allegations were a result of this conspiracy, Babu said. Meanwhile, Kodiyeri and other CPM leaders including V S Achuthanandan and Pinarayi Vijayan dismissed Babu's allegations."

The presence of large number of students and their involvement in various activities, something very unusual for a government school, has led to parents making a beeline to get their children and wards enrolled here.While the state government made every bit effort to get maximum number of children enrolled in schools every year in June, the Kanya Shala number 4, located in one of the economically backward locality of Junagadh, hardly needs to make any efforts. All thanks to the innovative method of teaching introduced by its principal, Tarun Katbamna (32), parents are shifting their kids from private schools to this government one. In the last three years, 234 children from private schools have shifted to this school.""This year alone, 70 students from different schools have got admission in classes II to VII. Thirty of these students have shifted from private schools,"" said Katbamna. It took him three years to change the perception of the people and improve the quality of education with innovative methods.""When I was appointed principal in 2012, the attitude of parents towards the school was very bad. Students hardly attended schools regularly, especially on Saturday as they need to wake up in the morning. So, I started showing them feature films on large screen to attract them on Saturdays,"" said Katbamna about his techniques to get the attention of children.""I used to show the film for 15 minutes and next part was to be shown next Saturday. So, curious students came to see the film. However, there were still some students who did not attend the school,"" he said.Katbamna said, then we started 'Janta Raids' where he would go to children's home and pick them up from their beds and bring them to school. ""The methods may have been harsh but people saw our commitment for their children's education and their attitude towards government school changed,"" said Katbamna.Another problem faced by Katbamna after he took charge was the habit of school children eating packaged food including potato chips and other fried items. ""The first thing we did was to ban packaged food items. Then, we started our own 'Nasta house' (snack house) where we give snacks to students at nominal rates. We give snacks which are healthy. It also includes seasonal fruits. It solved two problems. Campus became free of plastic and school earned Rs 12,000 per annum by selling snacks. We decided to use the money for children and purchased 425 stainless steel lunch boxes. These were distributed among school children,"" said the 32-year-old principal.""Our first priority was to increase the number of students attending the school and ensure that they remain there,"" he added. To hold the attention of children and improve their writing skills, Katbamna learnt calligraphy.""I take classes on basic calligraphy to improve writing skills of kids. Parents are very impressed by the results of the activity. It helped in developing self-confidence. Now, parents of kids are our ambassadors and they tell others about the school,"" said Katbamna proudly.""My son Dev was studying in a private school till class VI. But last year, I shifted him to government school as I saw that he was feeling stressed. He is now happy here.,"" says Lata Devchandani, Dev's mother."

In the absence of power, purchase of diesel to run generators is dealing the already impoverished farmers a financial blow.There is focus on bringing relief to beleaguered farmers driven to starvation, debt and suicide with Rs 897 crore Samajwadi Kisan and Sarvahit Beema Yojana, Rs 240 crore for Krishak Durghatana Beema Yojana, Rs 709 for state disaster funds and Rs 2,057 for the drought affected farmers in 50 districts.To make farming at least productive if not profitable, the budget has emphasised on organic farming and mechanisation of farm sector by offering machines to cultivators on loan through clusters, apart from building kisan haats, bazaars and mandis and subsidies on machines, tools and seeds and fertilizers. ""Though direct benefit schemes of transferring subsidy into the bank accounts, more than 10 lakh farmers have benefited in the state like in no other state of the nation,"" said chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in his budget speech in the House on Friday.Unemployed youth have been offered support to start 'agri junctions', though this scheme was announced in the last budget and failed to take off. Exclusive market for potato in Kannauj and mango in Malihabad to the tune of Rs 102 crore and Rs 79 crore, respectively will be there to save cultivators from the market glut. In the absence of any such market, potato and mango growers feel depressed when market is hit in the peak season.Priority has been given to availability of potable water with an allocation of Rs 2,300 crore, while Rs 1,779 crore has been allocated for houses for homeless under the Lohia Gramin Avas programme, Rs 3,162 crore for Indira Avas and Rs 2,031 crore for village roads. Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for interlocking tiles and CC roads in towns and villages through the panchayati raj department and Rs 1,536 crore for clean toilets in the rural areas.Irrigation will get a leg-up with Rs 1,574 crore to new schemes, including Rs 100 crore for Arjun Sahayak canal and Saryu canal national projects to support the revival of dams and canals which had been lying closed or incomplete for over 30 years and provide water for drinking as well as irrigation in drought-prone areas."
58f20cb9a3d24b245e59e7cc,vegetable prices likely to soar before Chhath puja,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vegetable-prices-likely-to-soar-before-Chhath-puja/articleshow/55198081.cms,2016-11-02,"RANCHI: A steep hike in vegetable and fruit prices has become the trend ahead of festivals here. With Chhath festival around the corner, prices of veggies and fruits have increased and are only likely to soar further from Wednesday.On Tuesday, the price of bottle gourd (kaddu or gheeya) ranged between Rs 20-Rs 40 at the local markets. Anita Devi, a vendor at Peace Road , said she and her friends are planning to sell them at a higher price since it is one of the vegetables eaten on 'Nahay-Khay'.Sunita Pradhan, a resident of Hinoo and who is performing the puja for over five years, said on the second day, Lohanda and Kharna, which is about a day-long fast ending with eating chapatti (roti) or pancake (puri) with rice dessert (kheer), has also become an expensive affair. ""The price of one litre milk is above Rs 30 and one kilo rice is also the same. We prepare the menu considering the diet of each family member and keeping our budget in mind,"" she added.At present, the cost of carrot is Rs 80 per kilogram, ginger Rs 100 per kilogram, radish Rs 10 per 100 gram, cauliflower between Rs 40-50 per kilogram, new potato Rs 25-30, old potato Rs 20 and pointed gourd is Rs 30-40 per kilogram. Most of these items, apart from fruits, are essential for 'aragya soop', which is offered to the sun god during the festival.Nannu Devi, another vendor near Raj Bhavan said rpices of vegetables will increase by at least Rs 10 or Rs 20 ahead of Chhath puja.Even fruits such as small sized local apples are available for Rs 50-Rs 80. However, sugarcane which is a necessary fruit offered during Arghya, was not visible in the market. Shanti, a vendor at Birsa Chowk , said sugarcane will be sold from Wednesday onwards. Mohammed, a vegetable seller at Doranda market, said with the onset of winter, prices of vegetables is usually high but post-Chhath, the prices are likely to slide as per the demand customers."
58f21139a3d24b245e59e926,Just pop or bake your vada pav now,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Just-pop-or-bake-your-vada-pav-now/articleshow/53418769.cms,2016-07-28,"Schezwan vada pavMayonnaise vada pavPalak cheese vada pavButter-grilled vada pavMakka vada pavWhen it comes to the food-loving Puneite, nothing drives home the idea of comfort food better than the humble vada pav does. There's a certain magic that the golden fried potato fritter, tucked between tender bread, conjures, especially on a rainy day. Couple that with some piping hot kadak chai and voila; you're in seventh heaven.From the time it was churned out in the 1960s, as a result of Mumbai-based snack vendor Ashok Vaidya's innovative brainwave-to serve a hot vada between bread with garlic chutney, the vada pav has travelled from the Maximum City across the country. While this age-old preparation continues to be revered, Pune, for one, is seeing the snack take on various avatars, much to the delight of those willing to experiment.Call the potato and cheese vada version that he serves in Baner a deconstructed vada pav if you must, because Kanishka Kamat will have no qualms. ""In keeping with the city's love for the dish, offering vada pav on the menu was a must. However, while retaining the flavours, we've added our style to it,"" shares Kanishka. The dish isn't served in the same vada-in-pav manner, but is plated like a fine-dine one - vadas sitting on a plate with an artistic stroke of tamarind chutney, accompanied by garlic and curry-leaf-infused bread and the mandatory green chillies on the side. The potato vadas add more to the flavour carnival with their gooey mozzarella filling. Drooling already, aren't you?Rs 125Just when you thought the vada pav preparation was sacrosanct, there are others who believe that the humble snack is a playground for delectable experimentation. Head to Balewadi, where Chef Shailendra Kekade amalgamates the comforting goodness of the vada pav with, wait for it, bacon! ""The very twist lies in the trademark taste of bacon. We cook off the bacon bits infusing them with flavours of garlic, curry leaves, ginger and turmeric, spices that lend the traditional vada pav its familiar taste. The mass is then batter-fried and served in a home-baked bun,"" Shailendra shares. Total indulgence, this one comes doused in the goodness of pork juices.Rs 240A deceptive one, this variant looks just like the regular vada pav in appearance, but its distinct taste will validate why it's a carnivore's preferred option. There's no potato in the vada, but a rich mix of chicken, cheese, herbs and special spices enveloped in a crisp besan coating. ""We also tried a pasta vada pav along with this in the past, but the chicken variant has been the most popular among patrons till date,"" shares Harshad Bele, from the Baner-based cafe that serves this offering. Being vegetarian, are you feeling left out? The good news is they have a paneer version too.Rs 50If the thought of downing calories troubles you, fret not; there is a baked variant to enjoy. The vada makes way for spiced potato stuffed into a bun (not pav) and baked to perfection. ""This snack came to Pune around three years ago after it did well in Mumbai. It's a healthier rendition of the usually greasy snack,"" says Karan Vaswani, who runs the Viman Nagar outlet of the bakery serving this snack. Have Puneites warmed up to the variant? ""I happened to try it by chance one day and it challenged my set notion of the snack. Sans the besan coating, I felt something was missing at first, but for the most part, the flavours are bang on,"" says IT professional Nikhil Vidyasagar.Rs 20Who could possibly imagine the snack morphing into nibbles resembling the kernel-puffed popcorn? Well, you can find this avatar if you drive to Nagar Road. ""The idea of a vada pav popcorn was inspired by the humble street snack itself, but we chose to increase the fun quotient in the way it is presented and enjoyed,"" says chef Paul Kinny, the man behind the idea. So what should one expect? Cute and tiny vadas and toasted bread bits that are tossed together in some garlic thecha and green chillies, served in a paper popcorn bag.Rs 255"
58f22322a3d24b68099aa812,A need for balance,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/A-need-for-balance/article14506988.ece,2016-07-22,"As expected, a conversation with Kalki Koechlin begins on a wholesome note. As soon as we sit down for a meal together, she says, I dont look like it, but I eat a lot. The flexibility she shows in her choice of roles reflects in her choice of cuisines as well. From Kashmiri to Chettinad and from Japanese to French, Koechlin has a taste for all of them. She talks of her fondness for yakhni pulao and butter chicken in one sentence. As I come from south India, I have a special affinity with spices. Whether it is rasam or wasabi sauce, the actor likes it hot.For this meal, however, Koechlin opts for Mediterranean cuisine with a mezze sampler. It is an assortment of hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh and beet root labneh with grilled pita, marinated olives, feta and falafel.At once, she picks up a falafel (deep-fried ball made with ground chickpeas and fava beans) and calls it a Spanish vada. In fact, even when shes on sets, Koechlin says sge thinks about food! You think about food but very rarely do you get good food on the sets, she says. We are lucky that we get to travel a lot with our films and hence get to taste different cuisines. Like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara i ntroduced me to Spanish food. But if you are a vegetarian, Spain is not for you for they offer fish to vegetarians! she chuckles. The actor says she knows she needs to be healthy. So I drink carrot, beetroot and apple juice mixed together and of course lots of coconut water.Rather starve than cookHer appreciation of food and need to eat healthy hasnt resulted in motivation to enter the kitchen. I would rather go hungry than cook, she chuckles before adding that shed prefer baking though. I cant cook on a daily basis. But I can bake bread, apple pie and all sorts of cakes.Having spent her childhood in Puducherry, Koechlin has fondness for its cuisine. It is a mixture of French, Tamil and Vietnamese food. Spring rolls, fish curries and French baked potato with cheese dominate the scene. At home, I love to have fish prepared in coconut milk. And, then there is rasam which I could have throughout the year.For her last release, Waiting , the actor shot in Kochi and had her fill of fish curries.The film was was appreciated by critics. Reflecting on the experince while munching on tabbouleh, Koechlin says that director Anu Menon and she had to rework the character. We changed the lingo. We needed to arrive at the weird Hindi that a Mumbai girl speaks. Words like pakaoed entered the vocabulary. We also worked on the look. She wanted Tara to look desi , with kohl eyes, sharp eyebrows and black and curly hair. It was a different experience for me.Drawing from lifeAs for getting into the emotional core of the character, Koechlin maintains that she draws from life and from other peoples stories. But I think, ultimately, it has a lot to do with putting yourself in that situation while rehearsing with your co-actors which is possible when you have a co-actor like Naseer.Her process, she says, is about being genuine to the experience. I dont think you can prepare yourself for a scene like the first time you see your husband in a coma, she says. You cannot plan how you would react. I have had situations where my family members had to be in hospital for a long time but when I am actually shooting I dont recall those moments. Those memories are useful when you are preparing and rehearsing. By the time I am on the set, I am the character and not Kalki. So I could not refer to Kalkis personal experiences.Tara, Koechlin continues, was a reflection on how fast-paced life has become. We dont internalise ourselves very much. But then it could be seen as a stereotype of this generation. Anything can become a stereotype. We are all stereotypes. When we look at somebody in a salwar kameez we often say she is a Punjabi aunty type, a short skirt evokes a different reaction. It depends on how you play the character. If you find the humanness of that character, it will work.Similarly, the actor, who comes from a strong theatre background says, melodrama is often misunderstood. The same issue can be expressed in a subtle or melodramatic way. It depends on its treatment. It changes from independent to commercial cinema. In both cases, you have to be true to the character, you have to believe the emotion: only the ways of expression are different. The truth of the emotion remains the same, she says, citing the example of the recent Rajat Kapoor adaptation of Macbeth where she plays a dark clown. Dark humour is hard. The flow of the play is such that the three witches go on to become lady Macbeths.Theatre, particularly plays like these, keeps Koechlin on her toes. I dont take many holidays and when you enjoy your work, you dont feel like taking a break. I am lucky that I get to do what I want to. There are times when I have no work. So when you have lots of work, you better do it.But this attitude doesnt always work with the family. My mother usually stays with me for two months and after that we fight and she goes to stay with my brother, says the actor. And her concerns start from why I work so much. She would complain that I dont spend time with her, why I put so much stuff in the refrigerator.After the initial reluctance, the actor of French origin is now being accepted by all kinds of filmmakers. She feels she broke into the commercial mould with Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . It is another matter that most could not still pronounce her surname right. I have put it in Devanagari on my Twitter account but it doesnt help.Meanwhile, we talk about how women-centric films are on the rise. I hope it is not just a trend and is going to stay. It is a natural evolution. And it is not just actors; we now find a lot of female crew members and DOPs.But, the actor is careful to underline that she is for gender balance and not star balance. Shes alluding to directors penchant for a particular set of female actors who have delivered hits. It should not be about star worship.The increasing presence of women crew members ensures that there is a female perspective, she says.If Waiting had a male director, he would have had a different perspective and it could be equally relevant as well. My point is at present we have many male perspectives and [we] need a balance. Indeed!There are times when I have nowork. So when you have lots of work, you better do it"

(Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar) A three-part exercise is followed to ensure the rakes are freshin the morning. (Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar)Given the alacrity with which commuters in local trains throw around wrappers of potato chips and biscuits and eject the blood red pan residue from their overflowing mouths, it takes nearly 185 janitors employed on contract by the Railways to ensure that local trains do not look like overflowing spittoon bowls in motion.A three-part exercise is followed to ensure the rakes are fresh and raring to carry the weight of lakhs of commuters as they leave the yard every morning.According to a railway official, there are currently 145 trains, of which some are sick facing wear and tear to some parts, leaving around 122 trains that are operational on the Mumbai suburban network.All these trains, after completing their daily duty, are either sent to the three yards  located in Kurla, Kalwa and Sanpada  or the 17 sidings, which are comparatively smaller, where they are dry cleaned every night. Here, our men get in the train, sweep the floor, dust the fans and ensure that all the waste left behind is cleared. This happens every night either at the yard or the siding, said an official.It normally takes one person three to four hours to clean the entire train. Mostly, a few janitors work together to ensure that the cleaning is carried out quickly, said a janitor, adding, Normally, we take a longer time inside the ladies compartment as there are vegetables and foodstuff also lying around. Luggage compartment also takes a bit longer. Normally, we find the trains on the western lines carry lesser leftovers than the central and harbour lines.After this first stage is the mopping stage that is carried out only at the yard and not the sidings. Here, the trains are mopped with water, especially the outer sections. And it is here that the janitors come up with their most adamant nemesis: pan and tobacco stains.These patches are almost exclusively outside the general compartment. We really have to work hard to take these stains off. We wash it with soap water multiple times with our hands but some part of the stains always stays. Then someone else will spit on the same spot and the stain gets another layer, making it all the more difficult to wipe it out, said another janitor.A senior official blamed this on the people sitting on the window seat who would spit out through the gap between the grill and boundary of the window and stain the train. Another big challenge during the mopping stage is the luggage compartment.There are mostly vendors who carry things like fish that leaves behind a strong smell. We have to clean the luggage compartment with phenyl and we also spray deodorants to ensure there is no smell. If this mopping did not take place, over a period of time, people would not be able to travel in the luggage compartment, said a janitor.Here, however, there is a peculiar problem that the railway officials face.Some of the janitors are vegetarians and refuse to clean the luggage compartment. At a time, we have 50 per cent of the normal strength of janitors who are available to clean the luggage compartment, said the senior official.After these two basic stages of cleaning, the third stage involves spraying water from hoses at the trains every fortnight for its overall cleanliness. This facility too is available only at the three car sheds. We have a timetable in place for trains that ensures that each train reaches the yard at least once in three-four days.We do not have a single day off, be it a Sunday or a public holiday. On any given day, there is so much dirt in the trains that if we do not clean it even one day, the train travel of the lakhs of commuters wont be a pleasant one, said the janitor.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

File photo: Prakash HassanIn the State Budget 2016, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah earmarked Rs. 20 crore, to purchase private land for the elephant corridor. The Forest Department has proposed the elephant corridor project in Sakleshpur taluk to expand the elephant habitat as one of the steps to deal with the man-elephant conflict in the area.Frustrated by repeated incidents of elephants damaging crops and causing human deaths, the residents of villages in Sakleshpur taluk had stated, in writing, that they were ready to part with their land for the project. As many as 416 farmers had voluntarily come forward to part with around 2,361 acres of land. However, they demanded a good price for their property, from the government.The Hassan district administration conducted meetings with the villagers and recorded their opinions in 2015.The people were in favour of parting with their land, provided they got a good compensation package. The private land required for the project is located in Balehalla, Bettakumari, Jagata, Ettahalla, Boremane, Mankanahalli, Bisale and Arani villages. Except for a few, all the villagers had favoured the project.Recently Mr. A. Manju, minister in-charge of Hassan district, said that a team of officers from the Central government would also visit the place to study the proposed project.The farmers are expecting to get at least Rs. 15 to 20 lakh per acre of the land they will part with. Many of them have encroached upon government land and cultivated it. Now, they want compensation for the land they encroached upon. The officers have not given them any assurance on providing compensation for the land that they have encroached upon.In the budget, CM Siddaramaiah said that Rs. 20 crore will be set aside for the elephant corridor. Besides this, he also mooted encouraging non-governmental organisations and forest user agencies from purchasing private lands bordering forests, and suggested they hand over the same to the Forest Department.New cattle feed unitThe CM has proposed the establishment of a cattle feed unit in Arakalgudu. The Karnataka Milk Federation will make the investments for this unit. Arakalgudu is represented by Mr. Manju, minister for Animal Husbandry, in the Legislative Assembly.Subsidy on certified seedsHassan is one of the major potato producers of the state. The CM has announced a subsidy of up to 50 per cent or Rs. 10 per kg on certified seeds. This will benefit the potato growers, who are planning to purchase certified seeds for cultivation. All these years, the growers suffered huge losses by sowing non-certified seeds."
