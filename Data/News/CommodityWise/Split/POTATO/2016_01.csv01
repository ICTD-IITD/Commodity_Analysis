It is believed that Maa Shailputri, the first incarnation of goddess Durga, bestows peace, happiness, bliss and harmony on her devotees.Since early morning hours, people reached temples bare footed to pay obeisance to the goddess. They also did 'parikrama' of the temples by lying down with folded hands. Several followers of Maa Tapeshwari also set the Akhand Jyoti afire, which will continue to burn till the last day of Navratra.It is believed a person, whose wish has been granted by the goddess, has to put the Akhand Jyoti from the beginning of Navratra, which should continue to burn till Navami, the ninth day.People, who fast during Navratra, do not eat foodgrains but instead consume fruits, potato chaat, curd, milk and sweets. Many devotees who eat nothing throughout the day, dine at the end of the day.As it was the first Navratra, people went to shops to buy various items. They will continue to do shopping in the remaining days of Navratra because all these nine days are believed to be very auspicious."

A bundle of sugarcane consisting of 18 to 20 canes cost Rs. 400 to 550 now. The cost depends on the canes height and thickness. Last year, a bundle was sold for Rs. 300 to Rs. 500, Aslam, a shopkeeper said.Vellore gets most of its sugarcane supply from Salem, Chidambaram and Kumbakonam, he said, adding, The yield was good this year but the rains in November damaged crops severely. Now, it seems that the government is procuring the damaged canes, and hence, farmers have been able to breathe easy. Vendors sell single sugarcane for Rs. 50 to Rs. 70.There cannot be sweet Pongal without jaggery. With jaggery being another key ingredient for the festival, the districts own-made jaggery is up for sale in Vellam Mandi. A kilo of jaggery costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 depending on colour. Jaggery produced from various parts of the district is supplied to other parts of the State including Chennai and Kancheepuram, said Rajendran, shop keeper at the mandi.However, he said that the sales were dull now when compared to last year. The production itself is less this year, he added.Vegetables cost reasonableThe cost of vegetables is nothing worrying, say vendors. Prices have been stable for sometime now. The rates of most of the vegetables are normal. On some days, there is variation in cost due to dip in supply.

How will the State now go ahead with its proposed projects are the moot questions.All successive governments in AP have failed the people. Post-bifurcation, our leaders should have insisted on equal sharing of Hyderabad revenue for next 10 years since it will remain the common capital till then. Telangana Chief Minister KCR has clearly made the best of the bifurcation, says B. Ramakrishnam Raju, national convenor of National Alliance of Peoples Movement.It is clear that the BJP doesnt trust Chandrababu Naidu. It is trying to marginalise TDP and strengthen its presence in this region. Naidu had also used BJP in the past when it was strong and dropped it like a hot potato when he did not need its support. It is now BJPs turn to pay him back in the same coin, he said.In the given circumstances, he said, the government should shun ambitious projects and instead take the realistic route.Polavaram projectFormer Government whip Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao in Viaskhapatnam called it a great injustice the allocation of a meagre Rs. 1,850 crore to the State against the need for Rs. 1 lakh crore. Pointing to the fact that the revised estimates of Polavaram project cost is around Rs. 36,000 crore, he said a pittance of Rs. 100 crore was grossly unfair.The allocation for Visakhapatnam Metro is a big joke, he said.He said Mr. Naidu should take the Opposition parties and other peoples associations into confidence and fight for the States right.Development in AP is not commensurate with the Centres expectations. Much hype is generated on the new capital but projects have not been implemented, said O. Srinivas, an advocate from Visakhapatnam. AP also should start making its own efforts, he opines.SlowdownIn Srikakulam, leaders have expressed worry over the possibility of unrest among unemployed youth due to slowdown in economic activity as a direct result of inadequate funds at disposal. Industrialist B. Govinda Rajulu is an optimist who argues that the budget will usher in long-term development in the backward Srikakulam since the thrust is on agriculture sector.Productive activitiesEconomic principles and other priorities are the guiding factors for preparing a budget. Uneconomic expenditure in AP like the Rs. 2,000 crore allotted to Krishna Pushkarams, may not be compensated by the Centre. The government has very few avenues to generate funds. It should encourage productive activities, says L.S.N. Prasad, a Professor of Economics in Hindu College, Guntur.Former MP Yelamanchili Sivaji has a piece of advice for Naidu: Mr. Naidu must realise that it is not possible for a government to build cities. Across the world, cities have been built over years by public and private participation. Unless the AP government comes up with a clear road map for Capital construction and the Polavaram project, the Centre is not going to help it.Bleak futureExpressing concern over a bleak future, he says industrial development may not get the fillip it needs. The leader does not see the possibility of cordial BJP-TDP ties in future.The TDP has no intellectual depth to respond to issues like reservation or the debate on intolerance, he says. Mr. Jaitleys budget has triggered fresh worries for Chartered Accountants.There would be no job for Chartered Accountants in general and small accountants in particular. The budget is neither investor-friendly nor encouraging for the IT sector, says Seshagiri Varaprasad, a CA from Rajamahendravaram.Balanced allocationWhile the Centre is right in making judicious and balanced allocation to all States, the BJP government should have considered APs case which is at the crossroads post-bifurcation, said D. Sundar Ram, academician and social activist from Tirupati.Price riseSk. Arif Ahmad, a private employee, said the budget does not address the problems of an average employee who is at the receiving end of price rise."

Except some symbolic action, the State administration does not take any stand on issues, Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said.The Minister was speaking on the prevailing potato crisis in the State.Isnt it ridiculous that a government, which is in power for so long, is not in a position to ensure adequate supply of potato to the people, Mr. Pradhan asked.Instead of taking steps to address the crisis, Mr. Pradhan said the government was setting up commissions to find out the reasons for potato price hike.Not only this, the Ministers also blame each other over the potato issue. This is utterly deplorable, he said.As the potato is sold at the rate of Rs. 18 a kg in market during the harvesting period, the three departments involved in the matter blame each other, he said.While State Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy claimed that potato production was not less as estimated, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said there has been 30 per cent less production of potato due to climate change.The BJP workers in Sambalpur burnt effigies of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Agriculture Minister Maharathy over the States alleged inability to meet the potato requirement. - PTI"

Names of the party cadres have appeared in NFSA beneficiary list. We will obviously seek answer from the government on the issue, said party leader Basant Panda.The party will also raise the issue of farm distress following sudden increase in number of farmer suicides in the State. Besides, the party will highlight deteriorating law and order issue in the State.The newly-appointed party office-bearers were felicitated at the meeting.However, confusion continued over appointment of new BJP legislative party leader. After election of Basant Panda as partys State president, as per party constitution, the BJP will have to find another MLA for the top post. In BJP, a leader cannot hold two important posts.The selection became tricky after former State unit president K. V. Singhdeo informed the party not to consider him for the post. While Dillip Ray, another veteran MLA, appeared to be little interested in holding any post in the State, Duryadhan Majhi, Khariar MLA, is unwell. Most BJP legislators have been elected to Assembly for the first time.Party sources said Rabinarayan Naik, MLA from Kuchinda, was front-runner for the post.The Naveen Patnaik government has turned the implementation into a party affair"

But people heaved a sigh of relief as the cyclone passed by north coastal Andhra Pradesh on Friday afternoon.For the first time, probably, the people of the city were seen tracking the course of the cyclone closely.Being residents of a coastal city, we have experienced many cyclones. But Hudhud taught us a lesson and gave us a first-hand experience of what natures fury could be. And that is why we have been monitoring Roanu. We have not only been getting updates from the media and the IMD website but also visited the Cyclone Warning Centre to know about the latest, said B. Chatterjee, a resident.Many were seen stocking up provisions and eatables. People were seen rushing to rythu bazaars early on Friday morning, braving incessant downpour. Appa Rao, a vegetable seller, said, People turned up early and purchased vegetables such as potato and onion in bulk. Milk and bread were in high demand.Seventy-year-old Sudhakar, a retired government employee and resident of Akkayyapalem, went a step ahead by engaging a carpenter to reinforce the window panes with wooden poles.During Hudhud, six of my windows had been broken. I did not want to take risk. But now, I am a relieved man, he said.Maldivian wordIt has been a century-long convention to give a name to cyclonic systems across the world. And they are given the name suggested by the country that is close the basin where the storm develops.In this case, Roanu is a Maldivian word, meaning coir rope. The name was suggested by the Maldives.Sight to beholdBut Roanu did not deter the people of the city from going to the beach to witness the fury.

Telegraph picture Finally, things have started moving in the right direction at the Jharkhand Mega Food Park at Getalsud, on the outskirts of capital Ranchi, providing a much-needed impetus to the long-delayed facility that is eyeing debut in the next couple of months. Kitchenmate, a firm owned by Ranchi-based entrepreneur Seema Jain and one of the first six companies to have shown interest in setting up shops, held bhumipoojan at the food park in Angara block, around 25km from the city, on Sunday. The Rs 4.75-crore unit, which has been allotted a one-acre plot, is likely to come up in five-six months. Kitchenmate managing director Seema (51) said the unit would process tomato, green chilli, garlic, tamarind etc for preparing paste/pure, ketchup and batter for idli, dosa, and bada under ready-to-cook and ready-to-serve categories. ""It will take another five-six months to complete the construction and start operations. We will procure vegetables from Bundu and Tamar blocks of Ranchi district, apart from Gumla and Lohardaga, for the unit with an installed capacity of 5MT ready-to-cook produces per day and 4MT ready-to-serve products per day,"" she told The Telegraph.

She and her husband Suresh Jain, who is a PhD in environmental sciences, are very enthusiastic about this venture that proposes to employ 20 local people for operations and maintenance. Food park project manager Rakesh Sahay said the Kitchenmate unit would help farmers earn better returns on their vegetables grown in different parts of Jharkhand, apart from making better use of forest produces. Kitchenmate is one of the six food processing companies, with interests ranging from tomato puree to green peas and cashew nut processing, that are expected to set up units soon at the 56-acre park, which can accommodate as many as 30 units. The other five - Eastern Manufacturing & Exports (frozen potato patties), Raha Enterprises (frozen snacks), Vijay Cashew Processing (cashew nut processing) and Mishti Foods & Engineering (tomato powder and vegetable dehydration) and Jharkhand Green Peas (green peas processing) - are likely to follow suit soon.

Picture by Bhola Prasad Jamshedpur, Feb. 2: Volunteers joined forest department staff to patrol Gerua village all night long till the wee hours of today to instil a sense of confidence among villagers, traumatised by the mysterious deaths of two elephants at a wheat farm, barely 12 km from here, yesterday. The team, with all 18 members of Van Samiti (VS), a registered outfit of villagers who work in tandem with the forest department to protect the wildlife, went around the village on the foothills of Dalma wildlife sanctuary for nearly six hours from 10pm last night till 4am this morning. Armed with searchlights the team travelled in three forest department jeeps. ""Besides our men and Van Samiti members, we also engaged trackers (village youths employed as daily wagers to keep a tab on the movement of elephants and other animals) in the exercise. The joint patrolling will continue for some weeks,"" Dalma range officer R.P. Singh told The Telegraph. Two elephants, male and a female, were found dead at a wheat farm at Gerua village early yesterday morning. The exact cause of their deaths is yet to be ascertained with forest officials looking at twin possibilities _ either the animals had consumed pesticide or they had been electrocuted. Post-mortem reports are awaited, while viscera samples have been sent to the forensic laboratory of the animal husbandary department in Ranchi to ascertain the cause of death. The decision to launch joint patrolling in the village was taken at a meeting between Dalma officials and members of Van Samiti at Makulakocha village, the main entry point to the sprawling 192sqkm Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary late last evening. Besides Dalma divisional forest officer Kamlesh Pandey and ranger Singh, 15 Van Samiti members were also present at the meeting. Singh said they decided on joint patrolling to prevent elephants from damaging crops at Gerua. ""We intend to develop a sense of confidence among villagers. Gerua residents are aggrieved about yesterday's incident and have promised to co-operate with us,"" he explained. Samiti member Kanu Tudu said patrolling was carried out in the entire village. ""We also went near the farms and scanned the area with searchlights and torches. We also carried crackers with us to scare away elephants if they were there."" Gerua village, along the elephant corridor from Dalma to West Midnapore and Bankura in Bengal, is home to around 1,000 people. It has often been at the receiving end of elephant attacks. An elephant herd rampaged the village on January 28. Don, Dalma's maverick tusker, had devoured a potato farm in March last year."
58f4c48da3d24b0b70c19387,Requiem for the BDD chawls,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Requiem-for-the-BDD-chawls/article14017370.ece,2016-01-24,"t appears that by now it is well-nigh impossible to delink my two protagonists, Ravan and Eddie, from Central Works Department (CWD) chawl No. 17 in the public imagination. But the mother of all chawls in Mumbai has been that complex of 121 tenement buildings which went up in Worli in the 1920s and another 86 in Naigaon, Sewri, and N.M. Joshi Marg. Bombay was already turning into a booming metropolis and desperately needed housing for locals as well as migrant labourers who came in the thousands to the city. So the Bombay Development Directorate (aka Bombay Development Department) got into the act and built the three-storeyed BDD chawls. Each dark tenement was 160 square feet with common bathrooms and toilet facilities on each floor. Often, three generations, sometimes even four, lived under the same roof and at the same time. In all, the BDD chawls were home to 16,500 families.The BDD prototype was duplicated with variations all over Mumbai, especially by mill owners who were heavily dependent on migrant labour. There was a time before the cotton mills strike of the 1980s when a chawl too would have three shifts of people staying in a room. The chawls have always been a mirror image of the city. Various castes and outcastes, now called the Dalits, lived cheek by jowl though tensions ran deep under the surface. In 1974, the BDD chawls witnessed the worst Dalit Panther-Shiv Sena skirmishes. Somewhere in the third novel of the Ravan & Eddie trilogy, I mention that the CWD chawls were built as solidly as the pyramids. What I had at the back of my mind were the BDD chawls. You have to grant our past British masters one thing. There was no compromise on their workmanship. Unlike their later compromised counterparts, the BDD buildings are monumentally strong and the 1974 disturbances did them little harm. Forty-two years later, they are still in great shape.The water warsBy any standards, the BDD chawls are cramped, inhuman hovels. The two other major problems in the chawls have always been water and toilets. Heres a short excerpt from The Water Wars from my novel, Ravan & Eddie : . the prime mover of life is water. You snapped out of anaesthesia, interrupted coitus, stopped your prayers, postponed your sons engagement, developed incontinence, took casual leave to go down and stand at the common tap, cancelled going to church because water, present and absent, is more powerful than the Almighty... The municipal tap is the original cornucopia. It is plugged into the mains and supplies water twenty-four hours of the day. Twenty-four hours as you know, is a flexi-time concept in our country, and can stretch between three to four hours. Thats on the good days. The timings are fixed. When the water comes, you know its come.And heres a bit from Rest in Peace , the third novel in the trilogy, where Ravan and Eddies friend Asmaan is speaking: Ive yearned, and how, for a single toilet all to myself so that I could take a crap without ten or fifteen people knocking on the door telling me to hurry up even before I had squatted and often the knocking got so urgent, I had to close shop, barely managing to wash my arse. Dont blush (Ravan), you too have been through the same. I wanted to pee to my hearts content instead of always reminding myself not to drink too much water because then you cant control the faucet.No notion of privacyOne of the most traumatic and overlooked tragedies of the BDD way of life was sex. The notion of privacy is totally absent in chawl life. Perhaps the most successful creation of the legendary Marathi humourist, P.L. Deshpande, was Batatyachi chawl (the potato chawl). It is a celebration of the perpetually open and shared public life in chawls. But there is one taboo subject: sex. Remember that there are always anywhere between six to 16 people lying almost on top of each other in a tenement. And yet, what is never talked of in this sentimentalised version of chawls is the fact that sex in this set-up is always rushed, always stolen. Theres something underhand, unspoken and almost dirty about it. And the worst victims are almost always the wives.The coloniser and colonisedThe British colonisers were not interested in do-gooding and the amelioration of the local population. It is the nature of the beast called the coloniser to exploit the colonised to the hilt. In 1947, India won independence and the whole country, especially the poor chawl-dwellers, had good reason to think that in a few decades they would see better days. Surely their own leaders would recognise that even the poor have as much right to space, light, air and a full stomach as anybody else. And that architecture is about imbuing life with dignity. What they had not factored in was that their own leaders and politicians would turn out to be supra neo-colonisers who would seek every opportunity for their personal greed and gain to short-change their own people.When the mill owners were finally allowed to sell their mill lands, the precondition laid down by the courts was that one-third of the land should house the chawl-dwellers who worked in the cotton mills. Now how demanding or, rather, greedy can the poor get? The triad of politicians, real estate developers and the mafia grabbed almost all the land for fancy housing projects and generously packed the original residents into six-and-seven-storeyed, 200 or 250 sq. feet hellholes while building 40 and 60-storeyed luxury high-rises next to them for the privileged and gated rich.Over the decades one has often heard that the government would raze the BDD chawls to the ground and give more spacious housing to the former residents. Talk and promises come cheap in our country while the BDD chawls march towards a centenary. Now, once again, there is talk of knocking them down and replacing the 160 sq. ft with 500 or 550 sq. ft apartments. Who knows, maybe this time the government means business. There is much jubilation, we hear, in the BDD chawls. May I introduce a note of caution? Postpone the celebrations. Wait and watch whether all the talk is just hot air. Look at the small print  perhaps the right term is invisible print. The real estate developers along with our wonderful leaders from every political party may very likely be planning to do you out of hearth and home.(Kiran Nagarkar is a Mumbai-based novelist and playwright.)Somewhere in the third novel of the Ravan & Eddie trilogy, I mention that the CWD chawls were built as solidlyas the pyramids. What I had at the back of my mind were the BDD chawls"

PHOTO: PRAKASH HASSANPotato growers have a reason to cheer this year. It has been 60 to 70 days since sowing of seed potatoes began and so far, there have been no reports of late blight, a fungal infection that affects potato crops, anywhere in the district. Also, chances of the potato attracting late blight at this stage are rare.This year, potato has been cultivated on around 10,000 hectares of land in the district. The crop has been in a good state all over the district, prompting farmers to hope for good returns. As the crop has survived for 60 days, there are no chances of late blight again this year, A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, told The Hindu recently.The climate, this year, has been helpful. As there was no incessant downpour for days, the late blight could not spread. Growers have to be thankful for the climate. If there was a continuous downpour in July, there were chances of the occurrence of late blight this year too, the officer said.The Horticulture Department had procured 2,035 tonnes of certified seeds from Jalandhar and sold them to the farmers at a subsidised price. About the yield in the farms where certified seeds were sown, the tubers are uniform. On the other hand, over 9,000 tonnes of non-certified seeds were also sold in the district. Going by the yield this year, a good number of farmers may shift to potato next year, the officer said.Farmers of Hassan have been growing potato for years. In the recent years, the area covered by potato declined owing to late blight disease.This year, potatohas been cultivated on around 10,000 hectares inHassan district"

Photos: Special ArrangementWe walk briskly to the food counter at Star Anise Caf on Linking Road, nursing some anxiety.Surveying its contents, we heave a sigh of relief, retrace our steps and flop into a Rasna-coloured chair satisfied that Aimie is still there. I wouldnt remove her, Chef Anees Khan reassures us.In case you are wondering, who or what on earth is Aimie? Its a rose and lychee-flavoured white mousse named after Khans former colleague. We first tried it in a makeshift kitchen when Khan was launching his patisserie last year and were bowled over. Happy to note that there is room for her in the new caf avatar, we scan the new menu options.Best of both worldsTo begin with, Khan coaxes us to try the Chicken Tikka in a theccha burger bread (Rs. 180). The dish comes with thecha mayo, lollo rosso leaves, roasted tomatoes, tandoori chicken, onion laccha, chat masala, lemon juice and a generous dose of mozzarella. The grilled bread has a good outer crunch and we enjoy this crispy vada-pav-meets-burgers spicy fusion. Who can say no to the best of both worlds?We wash this down with a galangal green apple soda iced-tea (Rs. 140), while our partner-in-crime orders a Star Anise smoothie (Rs. 160): a thick drink with hazelnut paste, chocolate ganache, yoghurt, star anise, and a hint of honey. We only wish it didnt come with ice cubes.If you are bored of paneer tikka wrap, opt for the zighi wrap (Rs. 180), which is stuffed with muhammrah, chopped lettuce, tabbouleh salad, chickpeas, walnuts, micro greens, pickled vegetables and sumac powder in a spinach tortilla, served with a side of potato wedges. Although pre-fried, the potato chunks are grilled and heated at the caf, and retain their crunchy cover.We spot a baked vada pav (Rs. 70), and give into temptation, adding an indulgent order of mushroom black pepper petit (Rs. 110), which is a Danish open bread topped with mozzarella. The first one is an inside-out version of Mumbais staple street food item, sans the besan covering. The aloo stuffing is laden with coriander seeds, garlic and turmeric, and ismasaledaarwithout being overtly spicy. Its a must eat especially with the dry thencha chutney.Latest delicacyOur gut instinct signals we end the meal, but Aimie has a new friend, and we want to try it. Cerise (Rs. 180) is a chocolate bavaroise orb with cherries, candied pecans and quinoa. The cake base is a bit dry, with an outer soft covering of 80 per cent dark chocolate and a hint of chilli. We always leave out something to come back to. This time, it is a carrot cake with the flavour of curry leaves.The author is a freelance writer and was at a preview of the cafs menuStar Anise Caf, Bandra West; 65186666"

Biharsharif resident Suraj Prakash is ready to open his online medicine portal in Patna. Madhubani resident Ritesh Kumar Choudhary has started an e-commerce venture for household services. Patna's Amritanshu Shekhar, who has an online grocery store, is gearing up for competition to ensure better performance. These young men are slowly and steadily building their network and working hard to the road to success. ""I started my online portal for medicines and health services, www.dawaaii.com, in October 2014 from Delhi and the NCR. I always wanted to do something different and this was my ticket,"" said 25-year-old Suraj. ""We are established and doing well in Delhi and now, I have decided to expand to Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Jaipur. We will launch the service in Patna by April 1,"" Suraj added. The online portal not only delivers prescribed medicines and provides doctor-on-call, ambulance and consultation services but also gives useful tips on health. Suraj said: ""We sell only prescribed medicines. If someone places an order with us, s/he has to scan the prescription on to the website. The prescription is checked and verified by a team of doctors and pharmacists associated with us. We want to launch the venture in Patna to provide the people the same kind of infrastructure and network. If needed, we also contact the doctor who has prescribed the medicine to make sure the prescription is not fake. We have faced no problems in Delhi so far, and hope things will work out in Patna too. We are in talks with the government if we need any clearance."" Ritesh (32) started www.homezifi.com, in December last year. A graduate from Ranchi, Ritesh worked in different Patna companies for eight years before deciding to be his own boss. Now, his team provides Patna residents all kind of services. ""You need a technician for your air conditioner, we have it; you need pest control, we provide it. Working for myself and not just for a salary at the end of the month has been a different experience altogether. I started in December last year. We are getting four to five orders on an average a day,"" said Ritesh. ""For the services, 80 per cent of the charge goes to the technician and we keep the rest. We are still in the process of creating a database of technicians in almost every locality of Patna."" Amritanshu (34), a software engineer from Pune University, launched his online grocery store GangaFresh.com last Independence Day. Now, he looks forward to big names entering the market so that there is healthy competition in the sector. ""Right now, we do not have a local storehouse but are connected with grocery stores and collect things and deliver to the people's doorsteps. We are in the midst of developing a mobile application for our customers. We are building the business from scratch and we reached an average 10 deliveries a day in the second month of operation. Besides, we offer dry cleaning services too,"" said Amritanshu. ""We have come to know that Bigbasket (online grocery store operating in several cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and Mysore) is coming to Patna. It will have a local storehouse too. The entry of big players is a good sign and will be good for business. Patna already has Gotmybasket and it is functioning well,"" added Amritanshu who has earlier worked in Microsoft among other companies. Industrialists welcomed the coming up of these new entrepreneurs. Satyajit Kumar Singh, who started an e-commerce venture for selling gorgon nuts two years ago, said: ""It is a good initiative and these men should strive to search for new ventures. If they are shunning traditional jobs and venturing into startups, it is a positive sign for society. But they will have to work very hard and try and develop a model which will allow them to make profit from day one."""

That was the magic recipe for the second edition of Young Chef Olympiad, presented by IIHM and held in association with t2. And after the rigorous six-day competition - cooking and plating countless dishes, making friends, exploring new cities - Canada girl Daniella Germond emerged victorious. ""I didn't think I would win but then they announced my name and I couldn't believe it... it was crazy!"" said the 21-year old from Ontario's Canadian Food and Wine Institute. The girl who likes spicy food beat 10 other contestants from USA, Hong Kong, Mauritius, UAE, Switzerland, Finland, Romania, Paris, Kenya and Mexico, and pocketed a cool $10,000. Last year, 15 countries participated in YCO, the numbers ladle-vaulting to 51 this year. From Australia to Armenia, Philippines to Peru, South Korea to Spain, multiple cultures blended and bonded. ""I'm proud and humbled to see the whole world assembled together in Calcutta for this historic occasion. This platform is for bringing all the young chefs from the culinary institutes under a common mandate, a mandate to learn, teach and network and to grow together,"" said Suborno Bose, the chief mentor and CEO of IIHM and the IndiSmart Group, at the closing ceremony on Monday at Wet-O-Wild, Nicco Park. The Olympiad began in Delhi on January 27 where all the contestants were divided into three groups and sent to three different cities - Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai - for the first leg. All 51 contestants were then brought to Calcutta for two rounds of the final heats. The top 11 contestants battled it out for the YCO trophy at a final cook-off on February 1 at Sector V's IndiSmart Hotel where Daniella brought home the bacon. Each contestant had to cook one chicken dish, one fish dish and a common dessert (Floating Islands also called Oeufs a la Niege in French) within three hours. ""Time always gets the best of you, but I had a game plan and managed to overcome my hiccups. I had to come up with a different application of my chicken at the last minute but I figured it out,"" Daniella told Metro, before she knew she was the winner. Her first winning dish was Confit Chicken Leg with Braised Cabbage, Potato Gnocchi and Balsamic Reduction, and the second was Pan Seared Sea Bass with Kaffir-scented Rice, Roasted Cauliflower, Crisp Leek and Spinach Yogurt Puree. If that sounds like quite a mouthful, it was. ""The taste of the Confit Chicken Leg was exceptional. She actually did two types of chicken in one dish - one was the crispy chicken with a skin on and the other was a roulade that took a lot of time but it came out really well. The fish was perfectly cooked and the presentation stood out. Her dessert was well set. The anglaise sauce went really well with the strawberries and the meringues were perfect,"" said YCO judge Andy Varma, whose London-based company Maia by the AC is the official caterer to the British royal household. Fernando Andres Guajardo Moguel from Mexico and Johan Kurkela from Finland took home the bronze, while UAE's Gabriela Aleksandrova Hristova was declared first runner-up. The winners took the stage at the prize distribution ceremony at Nicco Park, with some gurus of the culinary world - Sanjeev Kapoor, Andy Varma, Udo Leick, Shaun Kenworthy, Kunal Kapur, Sabyasachi Gorai (Saby), Abhijit Saha, Manjit Singh Gill, Andreas Muller, Ranveer Brar and David Foskett. If the Olympiad trophy went to Canada, Calcutta was applauded for making an event of this scale happen. ""The Young Chef Olympiad is a fantastic initiative coming out of Calcutta. What the judges looked for in these six days was how the chefs of the future are going to take this industry forward. We were looking for that special star - someone with the real techniques and skills to be a global success - who can be a role model and inspiration for all young people to join the hospitality industry,"" said David Foskett, the chairman of the YCO jury, at the closing ceremony. Young chefs aside, the other star of the evening was Usha Uthup, who crooned Skyfall, the lyrics echoing the essence of YCO - Skyfall is where we start/ A thousand miles and poles apart/ Where worlds collide.... Now, that's some food for thought to, well, bond over."

BJP state executive committee members met in Puri to chalk out its future plans today, while the BJD held an orientation camp in Bhubaneswar asking its leaders to become tech-savvy and take advantage of social media platforms. ""Our leaders should make best possible use of social media,"" said chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik while addressing the party workshop here. Naveen asked the party leaders to reach out to the people with the message of achievements of his government. The state BJP unit, on the other hand, prepared a blueprint for the coming days at its state executive meeting today. This was the first meeting of the state executive after the reconstitution of the state team headed by Basant Kumar Panda. The state executive passed a political resolution expressing concern over the slow pace of development in the state, while it thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for paying special attention to the ""backward"" state. Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram and Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan attended the meeting. ""The 2016-17 state budget has presented a dismal economic scenario of the state. Out of the Rs 94,000 crore estimated budget proposals, the lion's share is central grants and tax devolution, which account for 48 per cent. On the other hand, the state's own revenue income has been estimated at Rs 45,104 crore. The state government has proposed to avail a loan of Rs 16,000 crore to meet the revenue shortfall,"" said the political resolution. Referring to the poor performance of the state in agriculture and allied sector, the state executive observed that the state was facing acute scarcity of potato as the state is able to produce 2 lakh metric tonnes against the demand of 10 lakh metric tonnes, which has triggered price rise of the tuber. The milk production in the state only accounts for 2 per cent of the country's production. Criticising the BJD government, the BJP executive said it had been able to rule the state for more than one and half a decade as the main opposition party Congress has failed in its constitutional responsibility. ""The party will expose the failures and misdeeds of the state government through a series of agitation programmes. It will also highlight the ""pro-development"" stand of the Modi government at the centre,"" said state BJP president Basant Kumar Panda."

The Krishi Bhavan gives the support and farmers follow their traditional method of cultivation.A sum of Rs.22,500 has been given to the farmers under the Additional Tribal Sub-Plan scheme of the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) for each hectare. The tribal people, mostly women, are engaged in farming  from clearing the land to harvesting the crops.This provides additional income to the families and ensures timely harvesting.The climatic condition of the area is suited for vegetable cultivation in two seasons. Though it is in a rain shadow area, it receives two seasonal rains.The southwest monsoon is the best suited for vegetable cultivation as it rains mildly,' he said adding that the main cool season cultivation starts during this season.The vegetables for the Onam market is the prime business in Kanthallur.It has been found that the soil and climatic conditions in the tribal settlements are also suited for fruit production, he said adding that lemon, apple, and plums sapling developed by the horticulture research stations at Kodaikanal and Thandikudi are given to the settlers.However, one major problem to be faced by the farmers is transportation of the harvested crops from remote areas to the main market at Kanthallur.Mr. Murugesan said there are plans for providing transportation cost to the tribal farmers."
