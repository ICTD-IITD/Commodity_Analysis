58f4d0a960de470aa339c11c,‘Please have some mercy’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/odisha/story_76448.jsp,2016-03-26,"An internal rebellion has been cooking up in your party for the past two years. The difference of opinions among leaders, even ministers, have come to the fore. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout raised his voice against you on potato scarcity. What is happening? Our party is democratic. We may have some difference of opinion. Our outlook on a particular issue may be different. But, there is no question of dissension. When the leadership decides something, we all stand by it. Besides, Rout is a senior leader. If he advises something, we try to follow it. Sometimes, I give my views. But it should not be treated as serious difference of opinion. But, Rout has said that the potato crisis was caused by lack of co-ordination among various departments Ours is a potato-consuming state. We have 10 agro-climatic zones and each zone is identified with certain crops. We have not been able to produce the required amount of potato to meet our demands. Besides potato production has come down by 30 per cent in the neighbouring Bengal. With the launch of Potato Mission, we have come up with an integrated planning to meet the needs of tuber. This year, there will be a constant flow of potato to the market, but the price of potato will remain on the upper side. To overcome shortage of potato in the future, we are coming up with a number of cold storages. But will our dependence on Bengal continue? We have to depend on Bengal as it is a neighbouring state. Both on transport and economic grounds, it is advisable to bring in potato from Bengal. We have already told the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to rethink the issue and see how more trucks of potato can come from other parts of the country. Besides, the Centre has brought potato and onion under the purview of essential commodities. So now, there will be barrier-free movement of these two products. People are not getting rice under public distribution system as there are lapses in the distribution of ration cards. Genuine beneficiaries are not getting ration and bungling of ration cards has been a major issue As we have taken up the exercise, many lapses may occur. But we are trying to make it error-free. Once digitisation of ration cards is complete, all these issues will be sorted out. If mistakes are noticed, we will rectify those. But to bring 3.5 crore people under Food Security Act is a huge task. The state is demanding more rice. Do you expect the Centre to oblige? The people prefer rice. If the Centre forces us to take wheat, what can we do? We have put pressure on the Centre to give us required rice and not wheat. The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG) has found out a number of lapses in the technical education imparted even in government-run colleges. How do you react to the charges? After placement of the report in the Assembly, I have asked for compliance of the report from the department, particularly on the loopholes. Once it is over, I will be able to give you a clear picture on this issue. Question marks have been raised on the quality of technical education We are taking a number of steps to reform the technical education sector. Earlier, our students had to appear the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) and all-India JEE. But we have now opted for JEE so that our students compete at the all-India level. We have got the desired results as well. But technical education at the national level faces a number of hurdles. Employment opportunities have come down in the core subjects. But, there is a demand in computer and software-related subjects and the situation is not alarming. You had started a special recruitment drive for the technically qualified people. But it has been stopped midway We had prepared a vision chart taking 10 factors into account. We have been able to achieve five targets, such as winding up of the diploma entrance test, opting for the JEE (Mains) and a few other things. But in the case of recruitment drive, we have not achieved success so far. When we were preparing to move ahead in this matter and hold discussions with 23 industrial houses, a lot of politics took place over the issue. We had an aim that the government would provide the platform. As it has not been possible so far, the deemed universities and the respective colleges are doing their own campus recruitment. However, I agree that unemployment is still a major problem. You are in the news as your opponents have alleged that you had taken undue favour from money collection company Artha Tatwa by accepting an SUV I expect the media to be just. I have taken loan from Vijaya Bank to buy the SUV. This can be checked from the bank and from the regional transport officer (RTO) as well. If anyone has any doubts, they can approach the CBI. But people think that you had taken favour from the deposit collection company Please have some mercy. If I had taken the vehicle as gift from the company and someone proves it, I will consume poison and not show my face to anyone. Have some sympathy for me. Why are you not examining the documents which were circulated by my political opponents? Please verify the authenticity of the documents from the advocate generals office or from the CBI. Nearly 4,000 people from your constituency had taken out a rally from Brahmagiri and demanded arrest of Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra who had made these allegations The Congress had called a 12-hour Brahmagiri bandh on the issue. But the people of Brahmagiri have reposed their faith in me and they want to take the case to a logical end. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra had used some harsh words against you... The people of Brahmagiri and Odisha will decide this issue. But I will wait and will take proper action at the proper time. I express my deep regrets if I have ever used any foul language against my opponent in the media. I dont want to stoop to such a level where people will equate me with Mohapatra. I had also lost election in Brahmagiri in the past, but had never done any vilification of anyone. After I won the election, I was expecting the same democratic values. But no due recognition was given to the democratic process. What can I say if somebody crosses the limits and behaves like a mad person? Did you raise the issue with your party president? I have already informed him about all these political developments, particularly how I had got the SUV by taking loans from the bank. There is no need to explain to him in details as he had already experienced a bit of the political heat during his tour to Brahmagiri. You have been the BJD youth wing president for nine years. You are also closely associated with the decision-making processes of the party. There is a perception that both the BJD and the BJP have a tacit understanding even though your party continues to oppose some of Centres decisions We are maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Being a regional party, we have our regional aspirations. Our prime and foremost duty is to see that we should get our due from Centre. The tax should be equally distributed among the states and there should not be any regional disparity. Our demand for special category state should be given due importance and other issues, such as Polavaram irrigation project, which will submerge vast swathe of area, be addressed. That means you will continue with your demand for a special category state status? Yes. We will do it to fulfil the aspirations of the people of this region. While you are saying you are opposing the BJP-led government at the Centre, your actions dont show it. All of you, including your partys 20 MPs, remained silent on the issue of shifting of wagon factory from Narla in Kalahandi district to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh till it came to light through an RTI activist The chief minister had personally written to the Centre regarding the wagon factory. When it was made public, we had also raised the issue in the Assembly. We had made our stand clear in the Assembly and later it was supported by the Congress. So there is no need to be suspicious about the states motive. Though Naveen Patnaiks leadership remains undisputed, has he created a second rung of leaders within the party? The people of Odisha have reposed their faith in Naveen babu and with his inspiration everyone is trying to take Odisha forward to fulfil Biju Patnaiks dreams. The BJD does not need an alternative leadership at this moment."
58f4d7c060de470aa339cc37,A Sweet and bitter harvest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160106/jsp/opinion/story_62272.jsp,2016-01-06,"Christmas and New Year celebrations are synonymous with cakes. Busy feasting on this delicacy, India's urban citizens would not have fathomed that the world of baked goodies, and indeed of food, obeys the Darwinian principle. Plum cakes, fruit cakes, pan cakes, and what have you, have led to the near extinction of the humbler, and now endangered, Madua cake. Most of the local bakeries in Ranchi, Jharkhand, stocked and sold very few Madua cakes even though it was Yuletide season. This variety of cakes was once relished by India's tribal people. Ironically, its popularity reveals the harsh challenges to adivasi life. The Madua cake is prepared from the flour of finger millet - considered to be a variety of 'super food' - which has a high nutritional value, remarkable sustaining power and an impressive productivity. Finger millet is rich in iron and calcium. It can survive droughts and pests, and, with a one-tonne yield per hectare, it is considered to be one of the most fecund species in the millet family. It used to be in high demand in Garhwal, the Deccan as well as in Jharkhand. Some fear that the finger millet now falls under the category of 'forgotten' food grains. Part of the reason of its fate is its obscurity. During the raj, finger millet - a staple of the poor and the working class - was considered to be a coarse grain unfit for the consumption of those with refined taste. Just like their aesthetics and values, the vast and diverse food of the tribal people remains a pariah to post-colonial taste buds. The future of the finger millet - and that of the Madua cake - remains inextricably tied to the fate of the battle over global diet and taste. It is instructive that globalization, supposedly a hallmark of diversity, has been characterized by a sharp decline in crop diversity in India. Millets, rye, yams, to name a few crops, are yielding worrisome space to wheat, rice, potato and sugar. More damagingly, public imagination, and, consequently, the discourse is being stripped of the memory of some such food to weaken an admittedly fragmented movement that is fighting to save them from oblivion. A State initiative to protect these indigenous food crops is not an act of altruism: economic logic fortifies the initiative. The yield and nutritional value of the finger millet, to cite just one example, could provide food security programmes with necessary capital. Its resilience would also curtail expenditure in initiatives such as crop insurance. It would not be enough to boost commercial production only. One has to think up ways of incentivizing traditional produce and crop diversity and of integrating them into modern cultural practices. Tribal handicraft has made it to opulent drawing rooms. Why not make our kitchens more accommodating of the staples of India's indigenous people? A battle has to be waged simultaneously to reclaim space for such food in the memory of even the marginalized. One way of going about it would be to make the public distribution system - as well as school mid-day meals - layered and representative of the wondrous diversity of indigenous food."

Before we know it, they are making out. While they are at it, they make fart jokes and Jyoti remarks on Kerrys pan-stained teeth, Itna masala kyun khaate ho? before engaging in a long smooch.This scene from the film stands out as it bends the rules of the standard lovemaking scene in Hindi cinema. It is more carnal desire than genteel lovemaking. And the embracing of the inappropriateness, albeit done in a comical way, is a welcome change. In Kerry on Kutton , there are many such moments, dialogues that border on the profane: a heart-to-heart about mens urinal problems or a tooth found in a gulab jamun, most probably the halwais. But most of them are used for effect. It becomes a problem for the film when the quirks overpower dramatic tension.Kerry on Kutton belongs to the breed of post- Gangs of Wasseypur Hindi films that is so enamoured by the mofussil cool of its subject that it ends up nowhere: much like last years Meerutiya Gangsters . The film isnt even artful in the way it draws inspiration from Anurag Kashyaps two-part gangster saga. There is Piyush Mishras raspy voice as the sutradhar in the trailers and it casts Aditya Kumar, who played the hugely enjoyable Perpendicular, as an important character here.Set in Baliya district of Uttar Pradesh, Kerry on Kutton banks on colourful, rustic characters to tell a story of a new generation of youngsters. All Kerry wants in life is to get laid, Kadambri (Kumar) wants to break out of his family profession of running a brass band and start the seemingly lucrative business of dog-breeding. Tunnu (Prashant Tiwari) is possessive and aggressive about a girl who seems to be getting away from him. Kerry and he develop a rivalry over the materialistic Jyoti who uses her sexuality to exploit the two men.Our Hindi heartland films have echoes of Westerns, and the seemingly lawless countryside seem to lend a landscape to it. In Kerry on Kutton , the theme of violence propagated by the gun-culture in the region runs through. All the main three male characters are looking to break out from their fathers shadows and the only answer to their problems seem to be a tamancha (gun). The women of Baliya wear their desire on their sleeves (or salwar kameezes or saris). The film does well to show us how much more bold and frank people from small towns can seem to be compared to the urban blandness we see in films set in cities.The acting isnt bad. Dubey has an easy charm: a little too genial perhaps. But he makes use of his tall, athletic body to play the strapping man-boy who seems to have a way with the womenfolk. I was beginning to get fidgety about Jagota being too glamorous for the role, but as I spent more time with the character  it did make sense.But all these elements never come together in Kerry on Kutton . For all its merits, it ultimately feels like an empty film that depends more on the quirks of the characters than the characters themselves. As a film that describes its protagonists as wannabe gangsters, it almost ends up being a victim of its own joke.Kerry on KuttonDirector: Ashok YadavStarring: Satyajeet Dubey, Aradhana Jagota, Aditya Kumar, Prashant TiwariRuntime: 125 mins"

Singh, who visited the spot, said, ""The pachyderms, returning from the jungles of Bankura and West Midnapore in neighbouring Bengal, damaged five single-room houses at Gerua and six at Narga. They belonged to a Jamshedpur resident Bimal Agarwal, who had rented them out.""He added the elephants partially damaging a grill and a glass window of an ashram belonging to the disciples of Asaram Bapu.Singh further said the forest department had distributed firecrackers among the villagers to ward off elephants.""I don't think they belong to Dalma. They must be from Chaibasa or Seraikela forest range,"" the range officer said, adding that the villagers who had suffered losses would be compensated.Hiren Kushwaha, a farmer from Gerua, said he was sleeping when elephants started trumpeting. ""I peeped out of my room to see the elephants damaging the brick wall. I was very scared and ran from the rear of my house,"" he recalled.Another farmer, Jiten Mahto of Narga, said the elephants wiped out potatoes from his farm.A forest staffer said the villagers had been asked to remain alert.""The elephants must be stationed somewhere near Gerua,"" he added.The pachyderms migrated to Bengal in August-September last year.

Pictures by Gautam Dey Around half a dozen shanties and over 36 makeshift vegetable shops were gutted in a fire on Monday night at a vegetable mandi at Purana Bazar in Dhanbad, causing damage worth over Rs 30 lakh. No lives were, however, lost in the incident. Residents saw flames coming out of around half a dozen godowns of scrap materials around 11pm. The blaze then spread to the sabzi mandi situated at Bank More. Five fire tenders, which took at least 30 minutes to reach the spot as the area is densely populated, tamed the fire after over three hours. Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha, DSP (law and order) D.N. Banka and subdivisional officer (SDO) Mahesh Kumar Santhalia supervised the fire control exercise. ""The fire might have been caused due to a candle being lit by labourers at one of the godowns,"" president of Purana Bazar Chamber of Commerce and Industry Md Sohrab, a resident of the same locality, told The Telegraph on Tuesday. ""The weather was windy and it might have propelled the fire to spread to different parts. Over three dozen makeshift vegetable shops and half a dozen shanties were reduced to ashes,"" Sohrab added. The fire also engulfed a eatery in the area, leading to the explosion of at least four LPG cylinders. ""We were very concerned about the presence of at least 600 litres of kerosene at a PDS shop as well. But we put in our all efforts to prevent the fire from reaching to the shop,"" said Santu Singh, a social activist of Barmasia, who also joined in with the locals to control the blaze. However, the worst hit in were the 50 vegetable sellers. Mahesh Ram, an onion and potato vendor, cried he lost his entire stock in the fire before Holi. ""My entire stock and makeshift shop was destroyed in fire and that too before the festival,"" he rued. Another ginger and chilli seller, Sanjay Paswan, said: ""Had the incident taken place during the day, we could have saved some of our goods but the incident took place in the night. We came to know about it in the morning when everything had been burnt and reduced to ashes."" But timely intervention by local residents, he said, prevented the fire from spreading further as they took out inflammable materials like LPG cylinders, kerosene from their shanties. ""At least lives were spared,"" he said. ""The sabzi mandi should be shifted to Agriculture Produce Market Committee Complex at Barwaddah, 5km from Purana Bazar, as it is less congested. If the market is shifted to a less congested place, fire tenders also would not face difficulty in reaching the spot, if such incident takes place ever again,"" Sohrab said."
58f4e2b460de470aa339d9f6,Police knock on photocopy shops in JNU hunt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160301/jsp/nation/story_72182.jsp,2016-03-01,"Cards put up on the JNU campus to express solidarity with the students jailed on sedition charges. (PTI) New Delhi, Feb. 29: On Friday, plainclothes police picked up a photocopy machine operator in Ber Sarai, a crowded settlement between JNU and IIT Delhi known for its bookshops and eateries, and detained him for the night at a police station. ""They asked him if he had printed 'anti-national' posters for JNU students. Many JNU students come here to photocopy pamphlets - we don't even read them,"" said a friend of the operator. The detainee, who didn't want to speak, was picked up again this evening by the police's special cell as this copy was being filed. The special cell investigates terrorism-related cases and is now handling the JNU sedition case. Since Saturday, Ber Sarai's shops have been refusing to photocopy pamphlets. ""We know the students, they are all familiar faces. We've done this work for several generations of students, often on credit. The loss of business will hurt us but it's better than going to jail,"" a photocopy shop attendant said. ""Times are bad."" Last night, as the owner of a photocopy shop inside the JNU campus was downing shutters, a man in plainclothes approached him and introduced himself as a police officer. ""He asked if I print anti-India posters. I said, 'Sir, I know nothing about this. We just photocopy books, pamphlets, whatever the students give us',"" the shop owner told this newspaper. ""He asked me if I had taken the vice-chancellor's permission before printing anything. I didn't know what to say. I folded my hands and said, 'Sir, pardon me'."" Today, the shopkeeper delivered a bunch of photocopies of pamphlets the students had ordered and told them he wouldn't photocopy pamphlets any more. ""From now on, please get the VC's signature, I told them."" The JNU students' union has condemned the police ""clampdown"" on photocopying of posters. ""This blanket order banning the printing of pamphlets and posters in JNU smacks of a brutal clampdown on the culture of free speech, debate and discussion in our campus,"" it said in a statement. ""We see this as the latest episode in the continuing assault on JNU's plural, democratic spaces.... This (the agitation) has clearly irked the powers that be."" Police sources said no such ban order had been issued. The large wall posters seen at the university are usually hand-painted but the smaller pamphlets are designed on computers and printed out. These are photocopied and pasted. Students, individually or in groups, bring out pamphlets and cartoons on everything - from the political history of the potato to the gender perspective of Chinese communist Lin Biao's political thought. Students' union vice-president Shehla Rashid said the immediate difficulty was in publicising the march to Parliament on Wednesday. ""We're getting it (photocopies) done in shops in north Delhi (more than 20km away). This shows the level to which the State can stoop."" University registrar Bupinder Zutshi denied any role by the administration. ""We've had no communication with the police. Individual shop owners are free to do what they want - the JNU administration has not sent them (those on the campus) any notice,"" he told reporters. New police chief Senior IPS officer Alok Kumar Verma today assumed charge as the new commissioner of Delhi police at a time the force is battling widespread criticism of its handling of the JNU controversy. Verma succeeds B.S. Bassi, who had found himself at loggerheads with the state's Aam Aadmi Party government on a range of issues. The Delhi police report to the Union home ministry. A 1979-batch officer from the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory cadre, Verma had been director-general of Tihar jail since August 6, 2014, after having served as special commissioner of police (administration). The St Stephen's graduate has 17 months before he retires. Verma has served the Delhi police in several positions, including deputy commissioner (south), joint commissioner (crime branch) and special commissioner for intelligence and for vigilance. He has been inspector-general of police in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and director-general of police in Puducherry. Additional reporting by Imran Ahmed Siddiqui"
58f4e32ca3d24b0b70c1aa48,Everybody loves a good quota,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/everybody-loves-a-good-quota/article8548789.ece,2016-05-03,"I sometimes feel sorry for the governments of Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan, which are plagued by demands for reservation from powerful and aggressive communities. Patidars, Jats and Gujjars feel that communities that first managed to board the reservation train are uniting to keep them out. State governments would be perfectly happy to include them in the reserved category if they were not worried about the electoral backlash. Other Backward Classes (OBC) classification for Jats brings a similar demand from Rajputs; Scheduled Tribes (ST) classification for Gujjars brings about protests from the powerful Meena community unwilling to share the ST classification. Gujarat seems to have found a novel way to address these demands: be so inclusive that hardly anyone is left to protest. A 10 per cent quota for the economically backward among upper castes that is, those with family incomes of less than Rs.6 lakh per annum (p.a.)  spreads the net so wide that the excluded group is minuscule.Data on incomeSince income data are hard to come by, let us look at three different sources of data to derive estimates of those with incomes above Rs.6 lakh p.a. First, data on income tax filers in 2012-13 show that only 13 per cent of individual returns have incomes higher than Rs.5.5 lakh p.a.; once we take into account people who do not file the returns at all, this forms about 3.5 per cent of total individuals in the country aged 18 and above. Since incomes may be hidden on tax returns, we must look to alternative data. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) collects information on consumption expenditure, not incomes. If we apply household savings rate of about 25 per cent, a Rs.6 lakh income p.a. cut-off would result in a cut-off of about Rs.4.5 lakh consumption. NSSO data (2011-12) show that less than 1 per cent of the population falls in this category. A third source of data is the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2011-12, organised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and University of Maryland. It collects data for both income and expenditure. It shows that less than 2 per cent of the population had household consumption of Rs.4.5 lakh p.a. and about 2.5 per cent had incomes of Rs.6 lakh p.a. in 2011-12. This suggests that whatever statistics we use, a Rs.6 lakh p.a. cut-off will exclude less than 5 per cent of the population from being eligible for reservations if the Gujarat example is followed nationwide.These statistics should calm the passions around this new wrinkle in the battle for reservation in Gujarat. Appeasement tactics used by the Gujarat government are mostly ineffective; they will neither reduce options for middle-income Indians nor will they really expand benefits for the poor among forward castes.Can we devise a narrower band that might really benefit the poor among groups currently ineligible for reservations? Here, our spectacular failure in identifying the poor for issuing Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards gives us reason to be wary. The IHDS survey found that in 2011-12, only 50 per cent of the poor had a BPL card while nearly a third of the non-poor had BPL cards. Almost all observers agree that identifying the poor is a difficult task resulting in errors of both inclusion and exclusion. This is particularly the case when incomes are growing rapidly and a household that is poor in one year may well climb out of poverty the following year. So focussing on just the poor among the general category may be more difficult than we anticipate.Moreover, the demands for expansion of reservation have little to do with the poor among the so-called general category. Most of these demands are emerging from angry young men  many of them with college education  among agriculturalist communities that have historically held considerable political clout (for instance, the Navnirman movement of the 1970s, which the Gujarat government is acutely aware of).Future of reservationIn order to get out of this quagmire, we need to think of the immediate concerns of educated youth and the broader future of reservation in India. What fuels the anger of young men from agricultural communities? As they see it, investing in education has got them only minor monetary benefits. With massive growth in private and distance education programmes of questionable quality, most college graduates today lack the skills for high-paying private sector jobs. They may well be qualified for lower-level clerical or support positions, but for these jobs salaries are far lower in the private sector than the public sector. The ratio of government salary to private sector salary for a college graduate has consistently increased; the IHDS data show that in 2004-05, a college graduate earned 62 paisa in the private sector for each rupee in the public sector; by 2011-12 it had dropped to 57 paisa. With implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, this difference will grow. Not surprisingly, competition for government jobs is fierce. As Prabhat Mittal, Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, noted, in 2015 nearly 2.3 million applications were received for 368 low-ranking positions in the State government. Is it surprising that frustrated young men try to beat this insane competition by demanding inclusion in the reserved category? If government salaries were more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this strident demand may subside. If current initiatives for increasing employability and creating more manufacturing jobs succeed, this will also reduce the pressure.A longer-term solution, however, requires re-evaluation of the fundamental nature of Indias reservation regime. Affirmative action to make space for communities that have historically been subject to discrimination fits well with the Indian ethos of creating a level playing field and is part of the Indian Constitution. But the patchwork implementation, particularly for the OBC classification that is currently in place, makes little sense and leaves room for powerful lobbies to unite around demands for inclusion.One of the ways of dismantling the quota raj is to ensure that the reserved category certificate is not a currency that is hoarded by groups who no longer need it. This involves periodic recertification into the reserved category. Unfortunately, the current system has an established, if imperfect, procedure for notification of new groups into the reserved category but not for moving groups out of the reserved category. A first step towards establishing such a process may be to ensure that we collect data on caste/tribe affiliation along with data on basic demographic and housing characteristics in the 2021 population census. This would allow us to move past the exclusive reliance on the 1931 census and obtain information on the current socio-economic conditions of all castes and communities in India.Frankly, I have never understood the resistance from the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (ORGI) for collecting caste data in national population census. If the colonial census could do this in 1931, why cant we do it today? Collecting data on thousands of castes is difficult, but it is by no means impossible. Perhaps, the collection of data on caste is a hot potato that the ORGI hopes someone else will handle. But surely national interest demands that this caution be put aside to develop a long-term solution to an issue that has gained such visibility. While we are destined for periodic eruptions of demand for reservations by groups like the Jats, without timely and accurate data we have no way of developing a rational system for responding to these demands.Sonalde Desai is Senior Fellow, NCAER, and Professor of Sociology, University of Maryland.

58f4ee8a7be9e0185109f9d0,Rome revives marine demand,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/nation/story_77465.jsp,2016-03-31,"New Delhi, March 30: Italy today asked an international court to order India to return a detained Italian marine to Rome, in a fresh chapter of a four-year-old diplomatic battle New Delhi wants to end amid hits to its global aspirations and to trade with the European Union. The request to a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague came hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi held summit talks with the EU, which has criticised India repeatedly in its spat with Italy. India had arrested two Italian marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone in February 2012 after they shot dead two Indian fishermen, mistaking them for pirates, off the coast of Kerala. Latorre was allowed to return to Italy by the Supreme Court after he was diagnosed with brain ischemia - a condition that restricts blood flow to the brain. But Girone cannot leave New Delhi under his bail conditions and lives at the residence of the Italian ambassador. His inability to return home remains a political hot potato in Italy, where a foreign minister had to resign over suggestions that Rome botched negotiations with New Delhi. India began secret negotiations with Italy late last year to find a diplomatic compromise under which the two nations would agree to a series of steps to rebuild bilateral relations while they wait for the outcome of litigation at the international tribunal. Those negotiations remain ongoing. Even while negotiating, India has made clear that any diplomatic deal with Italy will not involve an out-of-court settlement. But crucially, Indian officials have also confirmed to The Telegraph that New Delhi will not challenge the United Nations tribunal at The Hague if it does order India to lift restrictions on the movement of Girone. ""The only reason Girone is not allowed to leave India is so that he can act as a de facto guarantee of Italy's obligation to return him for trial,"" Italian ambassador to The Hague, Francesco Azzarello, told the tribunal today. ""A human being cannot be used as a guarantee of the conduct of a state."" The International Tribunal for the Law of the Seas (ITLOS) had last August ordered India to stop all legal proceedings against the two marines till the UN court at The Hague decides on Italy's larger assertion - that New Delhi has no jurisdiction to try the case. The firing occurred outside India's territorial waters - 12 nautical miles from the coast - and Italy argues that Indian courts have no authority to punish the marines. India rejects this assertion. The ITLOS stay on any legal proceedings against the marines means India can't begin a trial against them till the UN tribunal comes to a verdict. The National Investigation Agency, which probed the allegations against the marines, has said it has completed its investigations. ""If the two marines are allowed to stay in Italy, India will suffer no prejudice,"" Azzarello argued in a written submission to the PCA. ""India anyway cannot try them in the meantime."" If Girone remains in New Delhi, however, he could stay separated from his family for a total of more than seven years, given the average time past cases at the PCA have taken, Italy argued today. India has, however, called Italy's demand ""tendentious"" in a previously secret written deposition to the PCA, made public by the UN tribunal today. In the deposition, New Delhi has articulated its concerns over allowing Girone to return to Italy. Italy has committed that it will ensure the marines are brought to India if the tribunal rules that New Delhi can try them. India remains sceptical of the commitment because Italy once refused to return the marines when the Supreme Court had allowed them to visit Rome to vote in national elections. The marines eventually returned after the apex court ordered restrictions on the Italian ambassador in India. ""India's concern relates to securing his presence in India during trial,"" India has said in the deposition. ""It would be necessary for India to be assured that in case the tribunal finds that India has jurisdiction, the presence of Sergeant Girone in India would be ensured."" But in recent months, India has increasingly weighed these concerns against larger strategic and economic losses because of the tussle with Italy. A member of the world's four major export-control regimes, Italy last year vetoed India's membership to the missile technology control regime (MTCR). Membership of these regimes is critical to end restrictions on India's access to cutting-edge technology in nuclear, defence and research sectors. Italy has held back on key investments in India. The tensions have also spilled over into India's relationship with the EU, one of New Delhi's biggest trading partners. Former Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini, now the foreign relations chief of the EU, had in January last year criticised India's handling of the marines case on the floor of the European parliament. Negotiations on a free trade agreement stood stalled through last year, after the EU blacklisted hundreds of Indian drugs that it said did not meet its phytosanitary standards. The EU also responded coldly to a proposal from India for a visit by Modi to Brussels last April, when he was travelling to Germany and France. Leading up to today's summit, the foreign office made clear it wanted to put the past with Italy behind. ""We have always wanted a vibrant, robust partnership with Italy,"" Nandini Singla, joint secretary in charge of relations with western Europe at the foreign office, said earlier this week, adding that India had committed to ""abide by whatever decision the arbitration tribunal gives."""

Telegraph pictureBhubaneswar, April 20: Faced with potato scarcity, the government today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Utkal Tubers India Private Limited to augment potato seed production.The state has been facing potato scarcity every year as its domestic production does not meet its demand. At present, the state produces two lakh metric tonnes of potato as against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes. Hence, the state is dependent on other states, especially Bengal, to meet its potato requirements.The state had faced a severe potato shortage when Bengal government restricted its supply to Odisha and other states this year and previous year. At that time, potato was selling at Rs 60 per kg in retail market.The state government has now set a target to increase potato production from the existing level of two lakh metric tonnes to 11.25 lakh metric tonnes by 2017-18.On December 27, 2014, the state government launched a Potato Mission for planning ahead to avoid tuber shortage in the state. The mission has initiated several measures to make the state self-reliant in potato production.The task force set up by the state government has estimated that the state will require 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds by 2017-18.However, there has been a big gap between the demand and supply as the domestic production is very low. So, the state government has to procure seeds from states, such as Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.According to plans, 1.10 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds will be produced in the state by 2020-21. The potato producers will get the seeds at reasonable rate, said the officials of the state horticulture directorate."

Many farmers, who cultivated tobacco for decades, have been moving to other crops after a fall in income from tobacco. They find cultivation of potato or maize to be more profitable, given the labour cost and work hours that the commercial crop demands.India is one among the signatories to the UN-framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which mandates phasing out tobacco cultivation by 2020, and the growers here are ready to give it up if they are offered a comprehensive package, besides waiving of loans.Ninge Gowda, a farmer in Belavadi in Arakalgud taluk, said his father started tobacco cultivation in the late 1970s when cigarette manufacturers promoted the crop in the region. In our family, we have three licences. Of them, only one is active now, he said. The Tobacco Board issues licences to the grower, and with each licence, a grower can produce 1,750 kg of tobacco leaves a year. In the last 30 years, the price of tobacco has gone up 10 times, whereas the labour cost has gone up 100 times. Besides that, we have to spend on constructing barns and fuel necessary to dry the leaves, Mr. Ninge Gowda said.Raje Gowda of Kurana Koplu said he had stopped tobacco cultivation for the past two years. With minimum expenses and least labour cost, we get good income from potato or maize. I have borrowed over Rs. 4 lakh to cultivate tobacco. Overburdened with loans, I stopped growing it, he said.Of the 8,000 licence holders in Hassan, nearly 1,000 have stopped cultivating tobacco. S.V. Yoganna, a tobacco grower and Arakalgud taluk, and president of Raitha Sangha, said, Many have stopped cultivating tobacco, and the rest are ready to give up the crop, provided the government gives us a package. How can the Prime Minister give a call for Swachh Bharat all the while allowing tobacco cultivation to continue in farm fields? he added."
58f4f53b7be9e018510a0409,"In Grain Bowl, farmer distress is gnawing at Trinamul confidence",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160421/jsp/bengal/story_81331.jsp,2016-04-21,"Burdwan, April 20: Madhumita Ghosh, a widow in her early thirties, has taken a vow. The daughter of a farmer, who was married to a farmer's family, would not let her two sons - Kuntal and Soumyodeep - to till land. Sitting in her in-laws' home at Hitta village in Burdwan's Galsi, Madhumita, whose husband Sushanto committed suicide in January 2012, unequivocally declares: ""They will never be farmers."" Her father-in-law Bikash Chandra Ghosh nods in agreement as the two boys, who study in Classes VI and VIII, stand next to her wearing blank looks. Life is full of uncertainties for the Ghoshes as they do not know how to pay back the banks Rs 3 lakh. The future of the two boys is uncertain as their mother does not have the resources to fund their education. Sushanto's parents don't have money to buy medicines. The family members of Sushanto Ghosh, who committed suicide. Picture by Partha Protim Koner The exact reason behind Sushanto's suicide is not known as the family's version that he killed himself to escape indebtedness has no takers in the administration and hence, no government support. ""What do I say? We lost everything because we are farmers,"" she says. Her torn green sari bears signs of penury. Some neighbours listen to her conversation with this correspondent with rapt attention on a sultry afternoon of April, the harvesting time for the boro crop. Asked why they aren't in the fields, most of them say they haven't sown the seeds. ""Why should we? Farming means losses,"" replies Panchu Gopal Ghosh, who has been farming for at least four decades. The veteran offers a rough calculation to explain the lack of incentive in farming. Such answers from members of farmer families in Galsi block - the top rice producer for years in Bengal and regarded as the Granary of Burdwan, which itself is the state's granary - may surprise outsiders but not the people of the district, where 70 per cent of the population has something or the other to do with agriculture. ""There is no point talking about what it was before and how happy and prosperous we farmers were.... Today, it is even better to be a manual labourer,"" says Swapan Ghosh, who has given up farming and become a mason. This approach of farmers - seen and heard in the rice belt of the district, including Galsi, Bhatar, Raina and Khandaghosh, and the potato belt covering Memari, Manteswar and Jamalpur - has become a worry for the ruling Trinamul ahead of tomorrow's elections, when 16 Assembly constituencies of rural Burdwan will go to the polls. If slogans in Burdwan are any indication, the writing on the wall captures the mood. Sample this: "" Kake vote dilam kaka? Mill- e dhan, bank-e taka, chashir haat sudhui fanka (Whom did we vote, dear friend? Mills are stocked with paddy, banks stashed with money, but the farmers' hands are empty)."" In the 2011 Assembly polls, Trinamul had won nine of the 16 seats. Mamata Banerjee's Maa-Mati-Manush slogan had worked wonders in the district as Trinamul swept the panchayat polls of 2013. There were, however, complaints of electoral malpractice. The trend continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with Trinamul candidates leading in 13 of these constituencies. Aroop Biswas, the Trinamul observer for the district, says the summer of 2016 will not be an aberration either but several lower-level party functionaries feel otherwise. ""The CPM is building its campaign on the agrarian distress and it's striking a chord with common people.... Our target of sweeping the district will not be met,"" a Trinamul leader in Burdwan said. According to him, the CPM's campaign, highlighting a list carrying names, addresses and other details of over 140 farmers who committed suicide in the past few years, has caught on in the region. Trinamul sources concede the chief minister is aware of the discontent brewing in rural Burdwan and she tried to tackle it by holding Mati Utsav in the district, where some farmers were given cash awards and certificates for excellence in production. ""But that hasn't helped much,"" admits the source, adding that the list of problems has only grown for farmers. One of the recurring complaints heard across rural Burdwan is the Mamata government's failure to ensure remunerative price for farm produce while the cost of agriculture has galloped because of a rise in fertiliser prices and a subsequent increase in electricity tariff. ""A 60kg sack of rice used to yield anything between Rs 850 and Rs 900 till 2011. But now the farmers are getting between Rs 620 and Rs 650 per sack. There is genuine discontent,"" says Arup Kumar Chattopadhyay, a professor of economics at Burdwan University. Although on paper the farmers are getting Rs 814 a sack because that's the minimum support price for paddy, price realisation is much less, several farmers have said. ""Now that the panchayats play a role in procurement, they deduct charges like cost of collection of paddy from farmers' homes and various other handling expenses.... Such deductions weren't made during Left rule,"" says Abdur Rezzak Mondal, the district secretary of the CPM's peasant wing. The state government's plan to ensure payment through cheques has boomeranged as most farmers are complaining of delay in payment, which adds to their interest burden on the capital they borrow from money lenders. Scarcity of water is the other problem. The ripples of the discontent in rural Burdwan can be felt in Burdwan town as well. Traders complain of poor sales in the past few years because of the agrarian distress. ""Burdwan doesn't have any industry.... The surplus from agriculture sustains trade here but the flow of money has stopped and all the traders are suffering,"" said Sumit Dutta, the convenor of a traders' body in Burdwan. Agrarian distress and its negative impact on the economy are not unique to Burdwan or any other district in Bengal as a host of factors - some beyond the control of the state government - have made agriculture unviable. But the CPM has made it a poll issue in Burdwan and the hope for the party's revival is riding on the farmers' discontent. The focus on farmers' issues has already helped the CPM as its leaders have managed to build up resistance against Trinamul in the run-up to the polls by campaigning in areas like Raina and Khandaghosh and even finalising the list of polling agents to be stationed in the booths tomorrow. In contemporary Bengal, the finalisation of the list in itself is an achievement. ""We have made a turnaround because we have exposed how the ruling party has ruined agriculture in Burdwan.... Tomorrow is the final and we are ready to resist Trinamul goons if they try to loot votes,"" said CPM state committee member Amal Halder. The similarity with the summer of 2011 cannot be missed. Mamata had then played the farmers' card to her advantage. Amid questions whether the CPM can reap similar benefits, it is almost certain that Trinamul will fare worse than in 2014 in rural Bengal and it will be a blow to Mamata in central Bengal.

The JDU's candidate here - Mohammad Arshad (47), a sociologist well known in Delhi's academic circles - is adept at articulating his point of view on development, illiteracy, backwardness, communalism and gender sensitivity. But the senior professor and head of department of sociology at B.R. Ambedkhar University, Agra, faces two problems. First, he is a candidate of the JDU whose leader Nitish is thoroughly devoid of influence among the electorate in this part of Bengal. Second, Kanhaiya Lal Agrawal, a businessman and chairman of the Islampur Municipal Corporation, has bagged the Congress ticket, won over local CPM cadres and sympathisers if not leaders and succeeded in driving home the message that he is the ""actual"" Cogress-Left alliance nominee. ""Our top leadership and I have made it clear that Arshad is the actual Left Front-backed candidate in Islampur,"" said North Dinajpur CPM secretariat member and seniormost party leader in the region, Swapan Guha Niyogi. ""I am telling you that we are backing Arshad and have nothing to do with Kanhaiya."" But Niyogi also wondered how Bengal Congress president Adhir Choudhary issued the party symbol to Kanhaiya after top CPM leaders, in consultation with their counterparts in the Congress and the JDU, had agreed to spare two seats - Islampur and Howrah - to the JDU and two others to the RJD. Kanhaiya's campaign vehicles far outnumber Arshad's and are bedecked with CPM posters and banners. He is seen with hundreds of CPM cadres and supporters cheering him on. ""Left cadres and those who want to see Mamata out of power know that I am capable of defeating Abdul Karim Choudhary (veteran of many battles and TMC nominee) in the seat. Speak to anyone. You will get the same answer,"" Kanhaiya said. ""It is a queer situation,"" said Arshad. ""I belong to Gaisal and did my schooling at Islampur High School. I went to Aligarh for higher education. I am a son of the soil, fired with the desire to use my education and learning to develop my region. ""Unfortunately, the mafiosi have established their stranglehold on the largely innocent and uneducated people here. But my battle against mafia-dominated politics will go on. We have tried to change the political discourse. We want more educated people to join politics."" Arshad said it was necessary to open industries related to maize and potato - prime yields of the region. He said he is ""connected"" to top Left leaders, including Sitaram Yechuri and Saleem Parvez, and top academics like Amartya Sen and his ""contacts"" will help him bring quality educational institutions to Islampur. Md Tazibuddin, an old CPM cadre, pointed out where the fault lies. ""His (Arshad's) problem is he is hardly known to residents. He is a political rookie,"" said Tazibuddin. ""We all are fond of Nitish and his party. There is a lot of goodwill for Nitish and Lalu Prasad. But they do not command voters in Bengal. It will be risky to vote for Arshad. It will tantamount to wasting our vote and giving the Trinamool Congress an escape route."" As a voter said: ""Arshad is the right man in the wrong party"". The electorate feels the battle will boil down to Karim verus Kanhaiya. ""Despite doing everything right theoretically, Arshad might end up vying for a third slot with the BJP,"" said an employee of a local restaurant. ""Arshad definitely isn't the vehicle that will spread Nitish's reach in Bengal,"" a bookseller said."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."
58f4ff607be9e018510a1309,"India, US seal military pact on hold for 14 years",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160413/jsp/nation/story_79909.jsp,2016-04-13,"New Delhi, April 12: The Modi government today announced it has picked up the political hot potato of a military logistics pact with the US nearly 14 years after successive Indian governments fought shy of signing it. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar said he had reached an ""in-principle"" agreement with his US counterpart, defence secretary Ashton Carter, on the ""Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement"" (Lemoa), confirming the first report in The Telegraph on April 8. Parrikar and Carter jointly addressed a news conference this afternoon that was followed by a joint statement from the two defence establishments. The Lemoa is a re-christened version and a Cold War leftover of the ""Acquisitions and Cross-Servicing Agreement"" or ""Logistics Support Agreement"" that the US originally designed for its Nato allies. ""But there will be no stationing of (US) troops in our bases,"" said Parrikar in defence of the Centre's decision. He said the Lemoa would be signed in the ""coming months"" and later amended that to ""about four weeks"". Parrikar explained that frequent military exchanges have necessitated the Lemoa. ""As our engagement deepens, we need to develop practical mechanisms to facilitate such exchanges. In this context, Secretary Carter and I agreed in principle to conclude a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (Lemoa) in the coming months,"" he said in his opening remarks. The Opposition, particularly the Left, has been against the agreement - described as ""foundational"" by the Pentagon - because it could give the US military access to Indian military bases. They argue that the US could use Indian military logistics - supplies of fuel, equipment and rest and recuperation for US troops - to pursue unjust wars. The government says the agreement will facilitate coordination with the US in times for humanitarian operations - such as those that followed the earthquake in Nepal last year - and during joint exercises between the armed forces of the two countries. However, the US military is deployed worldwide and has more frequent visits to India and its neighbourhood than India has to the US or its bases. The agreement has also been reached at a time when the US is deploying more military assets nearer to India in an exercise called ""rebalancing"". Just before embarking on his current tour, Carter had said in New York that more than 60 per cent of US military assets, including submarines, were deploying to the Asia-Pacific. The statement from the defence ministers and the joint statement leaves open the possibility that India will also consider signing two other ""foundational"" agreements, the Cismoa and the Beca. The alphabet soup of US military pacts also contains abbreviations beyond the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum or the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo Spatial Cooperation. The joint statement noted that Parrikar and Carter would ""continue working toward other facilitating agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer"".Parrikar and Carter also referred to a Joint Vision Statement on the Asia Pacific by Prime Minister Modi and Barack Obama during the US President's visit to New Delhi in January 2015. The statement, the first of its kind, largely referred to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea where China is locked in territorial disputes with five other nations. Secretary Carter announced that the US and Indian navies will now on cooperate also in exchange of information on submarine development and anti-submarine warfare. The US has the largest submarine fleet in the world and China's submarine fleet also dwarfs India's. In addition, the two sides have decided to institute a regular ""Maritime Security Dialogue"". Parrikar is slated to visit China next week. The cooperation in submarine development would run alongside an enhancement in an aircraft carrier joint working group. India and the US are now in talks on a secrecy pact to exchange classified data on the project.Carter said US relations with India should not always be seen through the prism of the past and the US is ""trusted"", when asked if it was aware of New Delhi's concerns over military supplies, such as F-16 fighter aircraft, to Pakistan. Parrikar said he had conveyed the concern during the delegation-level talks. The US was also supporting proposals by Boeing and Lockheed Martin to make F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets in India. Carter said the US is in talks with India for joint naval patrol. However, Parrikar said India was now only interested in ""deepening naval engagement""."

Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, March 18: The state government has earmarked Rs 300 crore towards its premium share of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The premium rates, to be paid by farmers, have substantially been brought down, so that more farmers can get insurance cover against crop loss on account of natural calamities. Finance minister Pradeep Amat announced the government's decision while tabling the agriculture budget of Rs 13,181.89 crore in the Assembly. The amount is 20.89 per cent more than the outlay for the previous year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his February visit to Bargarh, where from the largest number of farmer suicides has been reported, had urged the farmers to adopt the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme. He also urged the state governments to support the programme. The scheme will come into effect from the coming kharif season this April. Under the new scheme, farmers will have to pay a uniform premium of 2 per cent for all kharif crops and 1.5 per cent for all rabi crops. For annual commercial and horticultural crops, farmers will have to pay a premium of 5 per cent. The remaining share of the premium, as in the previous schemes, will continue to be borne equally by the Centre and the respective state governments. Amat also announced that the state would provide Rs 800 crore towards its premium share of the existing National Agricultural Insurance Scheme, which is implemented in the state on a modified version. ""There is a need for quick relief through adequate compensation and insurance cover to mitigate their financial hardships,"" said Amat. The state government has been bringing a separate budget on agriculture since 2012-13 fiscal. The agriculture budget includes budget for water resources, co-operation, fisheries and animal resource development and agriculture departments. The highest budgetary allocation was made for the water resources department, which stood at Rs 7,241.66 crore in 2016-17 - an increase of about 16.57 per cent. To provide water to farmers, the state government has planned to revive the defunct lift irrigation projects. It aims to revive the irrigation potential and ayacut created over the years that has been lost due to siltation of reservoirs, deterioration of the distribution system and drying up of the water sources of lift irrigation projects. To encourage the tribal to go for production of millets, the state government has decide to launch special programme for millet in the tribal areas to enhance production and productivity of millet. Another scheme has been launched to support the integrated farming system in tribal districts to enhance the farmers' income in the watershed areas. Amat also announced that a new programme, called development of agriculture in collaboration with international institutions, would be launched. The government will take help of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, International Rice Institute, International centre for Agriculture Research Dry Areas and the International Potato Centre for this on knowledge sharing basis. The agriculture department also decided to launch special programme for ""Promotion of Gender Friendly Tools for Farm Women in Odisha"" to improve their efficiency. The government also introduced a new scheme ""Support to Farmer Producers Organisations"" with the objective of mobilisation of farmers to enhance their production. It has also earmarked Rs 100 crore to build godowns. The panchayati raj department will be the executing agency for this instead of the co-operation department.

Standalone concerts featuring bands have almost ceased to exist. Reality spells a Puma-this, a Converse-that and a Budweiser-so-and-so, mainly just brand activations masked as concerts aimed at the youth, or in other words, the target market for a new line of shoes, clothes or beer. This, while electronic dance music, for better or worse, has all but taken over whats left of the music performance space.So why have we been set so far back in terms of independent music in the city? Among the various arguments to be made is the hot potato issue of originality. As a defining characteristic of a bands work, originality is a subject contested, yet rarely discussed in the open. And even more so since serious discussions of bands have gone from impassioned debates in watering holes and online forums to calculated moves in agency boardrooms. Are bands with particularly popular Western influences even capable of bodies of work that are wholly unique in this increasingly competitive creative space? Heres an analysis of this phenomenon with a look at last weeks most talked about album, Triggerpunkte by Chennais The F16s.Back in October 2015, The F16s, in conversation with Rolling Stone India , stated, Our music so far was more like a tribute to the bands we listened to. Fans and casual consumers of the material in question, EPs Kaleidoscope and Nobodys Gonna Wait , immediately likened them to UK chartbusters Arctic Monkeys, New York indie darlings The Strokes, and eventually English dance-punk outfit Foals (the F16s had borrowed rather liberally the last-named bands palette of sound).Consequently, The F16s rode a wave of success and recognition that resulted in a trip to the Rubber Tracks studio in New York courtesy of shoe conglomerate Converse. Eventually, they landed up at Londons iconic Abbey Road Studios, where their subsequent music was recorded.As for their latest effort, The F16s say, As a band, were now finding our niche and we understand what we want. This album is way more F16s than any other artist weve been listening to, which is awesome, because we have our own sound.So then, the proof of this statement must be extricated from the pudding, Triggerpunkte , their debut full-length album released recently via Bandcamp. In a week since its release, it has already gained some accolades. Besides their diehard fans, high praise has come equally from genre-agnostic blogs and magazines like Rolling Stone India .To this critics ear, The F16s new, original direction is, to put it bluntly, once again a mosaic of sounds already explored, and in many cases championed by another set of Western bands. Traces of the old F16s happen to remain on a couple of Triggerpunkte s songs, particularly opening duo Summer In My Lungs and Moon Child. The bulk of the album, however, plays out like a tapestry of F16-ised songs by other bands. These include art-rockers TV On The Radio, synth-pop trio Future Islands, festival circuit regulars Mutemath, self-described ambient-punk band Deerhunter, dance-punk icons LCD Soundsystem and notably English supergroup, The Last Shadow Puppets.The album isnt without its meritorious moments though, particularly in the kink of the slinky, slowed-down Cannibal Life II, the more abrasive Digital Dead and the delayed euphoria of closer You Could Use Me As A Weapon. If anything, you cant fault The F16s for keeping it diverse along the length of Triggerpunkte s nine songs.It probably doesnt help the bands cause that their lyrics, though possibly honest and even heartfelt, are still quite arbitrary and often indecipherable. They dont so much play the role of messenger but rather settle for being accessories to the instrumentation.Either way, little in Triggerpunkte asserts itself as a bold, original sound and vision. Not, at least, the kind thats ready to represent modern, Indian band music on the world stage.And if a critic with only a middling interest in Western rock music can pick their influences apart, it does make for a cogent statement on what the word original has really become stretched out to mean.A critical beat down of popular, conglomerate-backed rock bands album will not affect listens or sales. In any case, Triggerpunkte is a free download.Still, it seems that in contemporary Indian rock music, were still stuck paying clothed homage to our influences. The emperor, his lack of clothes notwithstanding, will be just fine so long as nakedness is evidently the flavour of the year.The author is a freelance music journalistDownload Triggerpunkte at thef16s.bandcamp.com"

Of these, three APMCs will go online on April 14, when prime minister Narendra Modi launches the move across the nation under the Rashtriya Krushi Bazar. Others will go online by the end of this month.The three APMCs which have been included in Phase-I by the government of India include Himmatnagar market yard, which will offer online market for wheat, the Botad market yard will offer grams and Patan market yard, which will offer castor.For a year, as a pilot project, the Union government will subsidize the project and bear costs. The Centre has decided to give Rs30 lakh as subsidy to APMCs going online, said the officials.Government officials said that the digital platform will help farmers to sell their product across the state. So far, farmers were forced to sell their produce at the taluka-level irrespective of market demand in other parts of the state.""If price of potato was over Rs10 per kg in Porbandar and Rs3 in Unjha, the farmers can sell their produce online through this digital platform,"" said Babu Bokhiriya, state agriculture minister. Buyers and sellers will need to register in market yards to get benefit of this programme. So far 50 have registered for e-market in Himmatnagar market yard.Officials in agriculture department said that to register, a farmer will need to produce Aadhar card copy, bank passbook copy and a photograph. For online trade, laboratory report of produce will have to be furnished. The prices of a stock will be decided according to the laboratory report."

UP State Horticultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Hofed) plans to open outlets taking supplies from its 900 farmer cooperative societies. This is aimed at doing away with middlemen, which will on one hand keep retail price of produce in check and on the other get farmers a fair price.""We began with sale of potato at government outlets in September last year and while it was selling at around Rs 14 or so in the market, we sold it for as less as Rs 8 to 10 a kilo,"" said S P Joshi, director, UP horticulture.Lucknow might be the starting point with outlets being opened on horticulture directorate's premises. It will be extended to other spots in the city as also to other districts depending on public response. The department might rent space and even build facilities, as per public response.Similar effort are likely to be made for sale of fruits which suffer for lack of proper and profitable market. Some 'desi' varieties of mango are almost extinct now. Government retail outlets can revive many such crops by facilitating farmers and developing a connect between buyers and suppliers.Opening of outlets will be facilitated by Hofed through 876 farmers' cooperative societies that it owns. ""We will open outlets for potatoes this year too,"" said P Saxena, managing director.Each of these cooperative societies in all districts of the state has at least 25 farmers as members."

Finance minister Arun Jaitley stressed that all the controversial loans to Mallya were made under UPA and reminded Rahul about how Bofors middleman Ottavio Quattrocchi was allowed to escape by a Congress regime.Mallya, who left India on March 2 just as a consortium of banks sought attachment of assets and his arrest as well as a judicial order preventing him from leaving the country, dominated proceedings in the Rajya Sabha and also came up in the Lok Sabha.As Congress alleged Mallya escaped despite a 'lookout notice' by CBI, Jaitley said, ""That day, there was no order of any agency to stop him (from leaving the country)."" He said Mallya left before the banks moved the Supreme Court for seizure of his passport.The discussion in the Lok Sabha happened after Speaker Sumitra Mahajan rejected notices for adjournment motions submitted by several Congress, Left and Trinamool MPs even as the opposition accused the NDA government of a ""criminal consipracy"" in allowing Mallya to fly out.In both Houses, Jaitley emphasised that it was under UPA that Mallya got all the controversial loans, listing dates when public sector banks gave money to the flamoyant liquor baron beginning in 2004 and a restructuring in 2010. ""You need to introspect,"" Jaitley told leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad who had attacked the government for letting Mallya leave the country.""We asked Mr Jaitley to tell us how Mallya ran away from India. If there is action against him and a lookout notice has been issued against him, then what is he doing in the Rajya Sabha,"" a combative Rahul asked outside Parliament.As the government and opposition clashed over him, Mallya's transformation from someone whose company was coveted by politicians of diverse hues into someone who was to be shunned seemed to be complete. The confrontation amid intense public scanner also shrank the scope for any room for sympathy.In the Rajya Sabha, SP's Naresh Agarwal demanded action against Mallya, alleging he had violated qualification norms to become a member of the Upper House.As the RS assembled, Azad said high hopes that the government had created of getting black money back stood demolished. He said the government could not get former cricket czar Lalit Modi back and now Mallya had fled too.In the Lok Sabha, junior parliamentary affairs minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that Mallya was ""no saint for us"" and that he had ""not been given a single penny"" by the NDA government, before Jaitley walked in and decided to reply."
