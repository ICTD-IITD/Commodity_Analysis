Now that Trinamool Congress has taken to theatre for its poll campaign, can BJP be left behind? No, says actor-turned-secretary of BJP's state committee Locket Chatterjee. She has already begun work on scripting four street plays for the upcoming poll campaign.State BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said that street plays have been a part of political campaigns in the Delhi, Maharashtra and Bihar elections. ""In Bengal, we tried to include them in our 2014 polls too. But this is the first time we have decided to do it in such a big way.""Speaking on the issues that are dealt through the plays, Majumdar explained that the main target of their act will be Trinamool Congress. ""We will highlight the failures of the party and showcase the achievements of the Modi government. We will also speak about our development plans,"" Majumdar said.According to Chatterjee, the 20-minute plays will be staged by eight teams, each of which will have five actors.""Unlike the Trinamool that is only interested in praising one individual in their 'Joyotu' campaign, our plays will rip apart their false promises. Our campaign's catchline is 'Din Bodle Din'. The prefix will be added depending on the theme of the dayDepending on the theme of the play, we will add a prefix to the title,"" Chatterjee said.So, if the day's play is is a play on corruption, it will be called 'Durnitir Din Bodle Din'. If it is on rape or rigging, it will be called 'Dhorshoner Din Bodle Din' or 'Rigging-er Din Bodle Din' respectively.The party plans to rope in professional actors, who will be paid approximately Rs 500 per show., are being roped in for the campaign. Every team will have around five plays scheduled for it everyday. players As many as four shows are being planned per day for every team.Unlike Trinamool, which has a strong base in the theatre world, BJP is gardually foraying into taking babysteps in this territory. ""As a child, I did one play. Few years back, I did a play in Toronto that was based on a Dulal Lahiri story. This project Acting in the plays for BJP's political campaign is my first such serious theatre involvement in Bengal. But I will not act here,"" Chatterjee said.The scripts have packed in sarcastic barbs that relates at all to almost all the recent goof-ups in Bengal. Take for example a script on the dialysis of a dog at a premiere government hospital. ""Taking cue from an incident where a 'VVIP' dog of a senior Trinamool leader was allegedly referred to the hospital for dialysis, we came up with a fun script,"" she said.The 'fun script' has funnier dialogues. ""On the recommendation of a certain Mr Maji, someone called Banerjee Babu is shown to have taken a dog for dialysis. When an ordinary citizen also approaches the same hospital for dialysis, he is refused because everyone is busy treating the dog,"" Chatterjee said.The spoof on the controversy regarding the Teachers' Eligibility Test (TET) examination will depict how shows how the money given in dowry has been used by the groom's family to bribe the officials.""But that is of no help since the bride is shown waiting for her jobless husband to get work,"" the actor said.The party has also planned a parody of Sukumar Ray's 'HaJaBaRaLa' has also been planned. The scriptwriters have been working hard to include subjects like the chit fund and the potato scheme scams. Then, of course, there are the recent controversies related to Jadavpur University.""Our party has zero tolerance on anti-nationals. For us, our nation is above everything. Irrespective of the intellectual masks that politicians wear, any party that doesn't hold such a view is a misfit. We will certainly highlight that in our street plays,"" Majumdar concluded."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives. RSN MKJ ABI"

We have increased the total storage capacity of our two godowns at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, from existing 2,500 metric tonnes to 4,000 metric tonnes. Moreover, we are also planning to take onion storage facilities with capacity of 4,000 metric tonnes on lease.""Patil, who is also a chairman of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, ""The Union government has asked us to create buffer stock of summer onions, which is expected to arrive in the market from next month. Last year, we had procured only around 2,500 metric tonnes of onions during April and May due to lack of storage capacity; although the Centre had asked us to procure 10,000 metric tonnes under the PSF to tackle scarcity and stabilise prices.""Last year, the Centre created buffer stock of around 12,000 metric tonnes of onions through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the PSF. Last year, Nafed procured only 2,500 tonnes of summer onions under PCF due to lack of storage capacity. Now, it has increased the storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes and is planning to take storage facilities on lease for additional 4,000 metric tonnes.The summer crops, which have a shelf life of around six months, cater to market till the arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September-end. The kharif and late-kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected.Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year when there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby prices reporting an upward trend. Considering this, the Centre has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of only around 25 days. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest-free loans to central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees considering the possible scarcity of onions and price rise in future. Initially, the scheme is to be implemented for the current fiscal and the next financial year 2016-17 for onion, potato and pulses."

Though I'm yet to see the vigilance court directive, I'm resigning from the post on moral grounds. I had said earlier that I would never cling to the post citing technicalities if any court makes remarks against me...

The incident took place on Monday.The elephant had raided a potato field near the village near Khuttimari forest. The field located at Kerani Para in Duramari belongs to one Dhwajen Adhikary, who had allegedly hooked power from high tension line and laid the open wire on the ground to prevent the jumbos from raiding , said a forest official.. The elephant died on the spot on coming in contact with the wire.On Monday morning, villagers of Duramari saw the carcass of the elephant lying on the field electricutedwith electric wires on its trunk. Primarily Foresters are certain of electrocution. It was the villagers who informed the forest department about the incident. ""The signs on the body indicated that the elephant died of electrocution. The department has lodged an FIR against the land owner,"" honorary wildlife warden Seema Chowdhury said. Dhwajen is on the run from police.Tapping of power from high tension wires and laying of electric traps for jumbos is a common practice in this part of the state, especially in Dooars and Terai. People living in the forest villages and on the fringe areas do this to stop elephants from sneaking into their habitat and paddy fields, especially during the time of harvesting.Over the past few years, the practice has also gained popularity among villagers in the Baundangi area of Nepal's Kakarvitta, a place which is often raided by elephants that cross over the Mechi river on the Indo-Nepal border and enter that village.In Bengal, as many as 18 jumbos were electrocuted in Dooars and Terai over the past decade.Environmentalists blame it on the indiscriminate growth of human settlements in and around forestlands. ""Having their land occupied, elephants have started sneaking into human habitat. The behavioural change in elephants is a result of the continuous man-elephant conflict,"" said Animesh Basu, a member of state wildlife advisory board.An adult elephant requires 200 kilogram of green fodder and 100 litres water every day to survive and due to the continuous reduction in green cover, they raid villages in search of food."

The VMC standing committee in its meeting on Thursday forwarded the matter to the general board without deciding for or against it.The VMC administration had suggested steep hike in removal charges collected from handcarts owners that are commonly used for hawking in the city.The number of such handcarts used for selling food is particularly high. It is estimated that 20,000 to 25,000 street vendors operate in the city and a bulk of them use handcarts.Till now, VMC used to collect Rs 500 as removal charges from handcarts up to the size of two meters. It was proposed to raise the charges to Rs 5,000. For handcarts over two meters, the removal charges were to be increased from Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000. The administration had also proposed that instead of releasing handcarts, cabins and other items within 15 days as per present norms, these should be detained up to 45 days.The standing committee had kept the matter pending in its meeting last week and it was said that the elected wing needed more time to consider the matter as several aspects were involved. On Thursday, the committee forwarded it to the general board without taking a call on it.It is expected that the proposal will meet with stiff opposition in the general board meeting.

Spread over on the southern and northern banks of River Bhavani, the town with over four lakh population has been struggling hard to balance environment protection and development.The Mettupalayam Assembly constituency includes the Mettupalayam Municipality, the town panchayats of Sirumugai, Karamadai, Gudalur, No. 4 Veerapandi and village panchayats in the Karamadai Panchayat Union.Agriculture is the primary occupation  banana, vegetables and areca nut being the important crops. The farmers there face challenges in clean water for cultivation, crop destruction from wild animals, and good price. T.T. Rangasamy of the Bhavani River Water and Groundwater Protection Council says that effluents discharged from the textile and paper industries have made the river water unfit for cultivation. That the water is also polluted by sewage from households and the Mettupalayam town residents dont get clean drinking water is another issue.The farmers in forest fringes face the threat of crop destruction by wild animals, particularly wild boar. For the farming community, this is an important issue, which the next representative in the Tamil Nadu Assembly should address, he says.For the residents, supply of polluted water and that too at irregular intervals is a big problem, says N. Venkataraman of the Mettupalayam Consumer Protection Organisation. The town does not have underground drainage facility. The result is that untreated sewage enters River Bhavani, from where the municipality draws water for drinking water supply.This is the most important issue for not only the towns residents but also those in other towns and villages who depend on the river for water.The other issue that comes to the fore from voters is de-congesting the Mettupalayam town. They want the next elected representative to take steps to complete the road-over bridge at Karamadai railway crossing, Mettupalayam bypass road from Karamadai through Guddaiyur and extend the road leading to Ooty.The other solution that the next MLA should try is for increasing the frequency of the Mettupalayam-Coimbatore train service as that will decongest the road, says L.S. Sidduram, advisor, Mettupalayam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.The vegetable traders, who are an economic pillar for the town and nearby areas, have shifted mundies to outside the town. The potato traders are the ones who still remain in Mettupalayam. The next government should take steps to move them and also workshops and scrap merchants to further decongest Mettupalayam, he adds.The voters other demands include an industrial estate or park in Karamadai to encourage entrepreneurs to set shop there, a marketing society for farmers to protect prices and facilities for handloom weavers in Sirumugai and Chikkadasampalayam.Politically, this constituency has been with the AIADMK since 2001. AIADMKs A.K.Selvaraj won that election by over 40,000 votes. Since then it has been a direct contest between the AIADMK and DMK. In the 2006 election, the DMKs B.Arunkumar lost by a wafer-thin margin of 142 votes.This time, the AIADMK has fielded incumbent O.K. Chinnaraj. DMK has fielded S. Surendran and the TMC has given T.S. Shanmugasundaram as part of the Peoples Welfare Alliance."

The list is expected to include products like chips, pizzas, burgers, ready-to-eat noodles, sugar-sweetened carbonated and non-carbonated drinks, potato fries and confectionery items.The move comes in the wake of rising burden of diabetes and obesity among children and youngsters. In October, the food regulator had also issued draft guidelines on wholesome and nutritious food availability in schools to control junk food consumption among children in India. The draft guidelines suggest restricting sale or availability of food items high in fat, salt or sugar within 50 metres of a school's premises.The number of diabetics in India has doubled from 32 million in 2000 to 63 million in 2013. It is projected to increase to 101.2 million in the next 15 years. Globally, at least 41 million children under five years were estimated to be obese or overweight in 2014.While the prevalence rate of obesity in this age group is still low in India at less than 5%, public health agencies have cautioned that the trend is fast catching up in low- and middle-income countries with companies targeting market space in developing countries like India."

On Monday, one kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 40 to Rs. 50, while it reduced to Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 on Tuesday, he said.Further fall likelyHe added that there were chances that the price may continue to dip further as the supply from Andhra Pradesh has started to arrive in Vellore.The prices of many other vegetables continue to be normal except a few such as beans and drumstick.For the last 10 days, a kg of beans continue to be sold at Rs. 80. Drumstick was sold for Rs. 60, an increase by Rs. 5 to 10 from previous weeks, Mr. Balu noted.The cost of other vegetables is (per kg):Onions  Rs. 10 to Rs. 20, potato  Rs. 24, carrot Rs. 30, ladys finger  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, brinjal (thorny variety)  Rs. 30, cabbage Rs. 30, green chillies  Rs. 30 and ginger  Rs. 70, he said."

But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

As compared to the price of Rs5-6 per kg in 2015, local farmers are currently fetching Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets, thanks to lower production in other states.Top potato growing states -Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal -have seen production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. Although the yield in Gujarat, too, has dipped by 10% this year, unlike other major states Gujarat has registered an increase in potato production on account of higher acreage. In fact, the potato output has galloped substantially over the last two years.The potato production in an area of one lakh hectare was around 35 lakh tonnes as against 31 lakh tonnes of 2015 and 23 lakh tonnes in 2014.Agriculture minister, Babubhai Bokhiriya, said, ""There is low potato production in the country, barring Gujarat, and hence the farmers are getting good prices. The other reason being that the state has, in the last one year, increased its cold storage capacity, which has led to better storage facilities, and hence the farmers expecting a higher price later are storing their produce, rather than selling on spot,"" he said.""Last year, there was a glut in the market. The supply is higher this year, but the excess output has been absorbed by increase in storage capacity providing a much needed cushion to the farmers. The prices would have fallen this year, too, had there been a rise in potato production across the country,"" said Ashish Guru, president, Gujarat Cold Storage Association.The cold storage capacity in Gujarat saw addition of approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50 kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes, while the annual consumption of potato in the state is 20 lakh tonnes. The lower output in other states kept the prices of vegetable firm, and farmers in Gujarat are able to reap the benefits due to availability of cold storages. ""The wholesale prices had plummeted to Rs 5-6 per kg in Gujarat last year due to glut in the market. However, the prices have remained at Rs 10-13 per kg in 2016 much to the relief of farmers,"" Guru added.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Gujarat potatoes are supplied to Maharashtra and states in south India, and are exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

Last week, Bharatiya Janata Party minister Chandrakant Patil, who is public works department minister, had said that the APMC must ensure that farmers get proper price for their agricultural produce.Explaining the rationale behind putting up the proposal to the cabinet, industries minister Desai said: ""It is natural for the APMC or traders to oppose the move, but we thought of farmers and direct consumers. So, we will not back off,"" said Desai, expressing hope that the proposed draft is discussed and cleared within two or three weeks, so that it can be implemented.He also said that housing societies or residents can order vegetables or fruits directly from farmers as it be a mutually beneficial move. ""Consumers will get fresh farm produce while farmers will get a better price,"" said Desai.The Union government has proposed de-listing of fruits and vegetables, especially potato and onion, from the APMC regulation, which has been accepted by three statesMadhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.After meeting APMC traders, Patil said they will consider traders' side and APMC should not lose out. He raised doubt that direct selling would eliminate cheating of farmers."

Damodar said of the 18 cold storages under is department 12 are not working since 1998.""I had taken due steps at a high-level meeting for the revival of 10 cold storages and informed the registrar of cooperative societies in writing to start the process of seeking expression of interest through advertisements from private entrepreneurs, but in vain. Nothing has been done yet. What can I do?"" Damodar said.Pratap countered the minister's attempt to dissociate himself from the potato crisis. ""By throwing the blame on the bureaucrats the minister cannot shirk his responsibility. It is his job to make his department function sincerely and solve the problem,"" Pratap said.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan after reaching Bhubaneswar on Saturday joined the potato row, much to the discomfiture of the BJD. ""It is unfortunate that after 15 years of being in power, the BJD government is not able to solve recurring potato shortage in the state. This government only knows how to claim credit over schemes announced by the Centre, but does nothing to address the problems faced by common people,"" Dharmendra said.Potato production in Odisha is officially stated to be around 2.5 lakh tonnes per annum, much less to meet the annual consumption of about 9 lakh tonnes. The low output is largely attributed to farmers' fear of distress sale of the crop due to non-availability of cold storage facilities. At present, potato price rules at Rs 20, almost double of last week's rate, hitting the general public severely.Leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra asked why the potato mission launched by the government last year failed to yield the desired results. The mission flopped because any scheme launched for acquiring political mileage is bound to fail, Narasingha said.Meanwhile, the BJP organised a demonstration at Sambalpur on Saturday protesting against the rising potato price."

Presently, we have two godowns at Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon with total 2,500 tonnes capacity. We have godowns at Lasalgaon with 1,500 tonnes storage capacity, while Pimpalgaon godown has capacity of 1,000 tonnes. Now, we have increased the onion storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes.""He added, ""The storage capacity of Laslagaon godown of NAFED has been increased from 1,500 metric tonnes to 2,500 metric tonnes, while the storage capacity of Pimpalgaon godown has been increased from 1,000 metric tonnes to 1,500 metric tonnes. This year, we are planning to create buffer stock of 10,000 metric tonnes of summer onions during April and May. We are planning to lease out storage facilities in district to store additional 6,000 metric tonnes of onions.""The summer crops with a shelf life of around six months, cater to market until arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September end. The kharif and late kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year where there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby hike expected in the prices.Considering this fact, the central government has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of around 25 days and they get rotten thereafter. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The central government has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest free loans to central agencies like NAFED and SFAC, to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) considering possibility of the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future."

Kannauj has nearly 10 hectares of agricultural land, where roses are grown.In the district, there are two categories of farmers, one who cultivate rose shrubs exclusively in their plots and have made it their main occupation, while others grow rose bushes in their agricultural lands for extra income.""We have instructed the horticulture depart to prepare a list of farmers interested in learning advanced techonology in rose cultivation. The agriculture department will bear all the expenses. We will assure farmers there is a good return and encourage them to undergo training in Etah and Hathras districts from where rose buds are being currently supplied to local 'attar' manufacturers,"" the district horticulture officer said.Training and pruning of crop is one of the most important practices which influence flower production significantly.""In roses, this practice will be recommended from mid-December to mid-January in which farmers can get good yield. In the district, there are few, who have adopted an innovative practice of 'alternate year pruning'. In this practice, the crop is trained and pruned one year and kept unpruned in second year. Through this practice, second year crop gives higher number of branches and flowers,"" deputy director, agriculture, Rajesh Kumar said.This technology is cost effective and more remunerative in areas like Kannauj, where distillation of flowers is commercially done for extracting essence and its marketing. The farmers could save the money and increase his profit, he added.""Also, we will increase the area under rose cultivation which at present is 10 hectare. The aim is also to introduce diversity in agriculture so that farmers can choose from value crop instead of usual cash crops like paddy, wheat, potato or jowar,"" another officer of the agriculture department said."

For, the taluk in Bengaluru Rural district is fast growing and turning into an urban jungle from a vegetable bowl, thanks to the Kempegowda International Airport, the gateway to the country's Startup Capital.With prominent realtors building apartment complexes and government planning industrial parks, the taluk is becoming a sought-after location for many companies and also individuals searching for tranquil atmosphere away from the chaos of the city .However, that's the scene only in areas along the KIA Road; a visit to the interior areas gives a different picture. The taluk with diverse demography but prominently Vokkaliga population, still retains its agriculture roots. Staving off land sharks, people are fighting tooth and nail to save their farmlands.Raghavendra, a farmer, said urbanization is fast killing his source of livelihood. ""Five years ago, the government started acquiring our lands for the construc tion of the Devana halli R i n g Road. While the government is yet to complete the acquisition process by issuing notices and bringing us to the table, we are trying to save our lands. We don't know anything apart from agriculture,"" the 35-year-old farmer from Bommavaru village said.Raghavendra grows potato and bottle gourd. They are sold in Bengaluru and Mumbai.At the other end, Marakka, an agriculture labourer, fears losing her job if her employer decides to sell his farmland to builders. ""I have been a farm labourer since I was nine or 10. Things are fast changing, and I am nearing 65 now. We do not know what our future is going to be like,"" said Marakka while plucking kohlrabi in the field.The story resonates across the taluk, where diverse crops are grown. From ragi, the primary foodgrain grown in this belt, to roses and grapes, you name it and Devanahalli grows it.According to the agriculture department, the cultivable land has shrunk to 10,000 hectares in 2016 from 16,000 hectares in 2006. However, this is only on paper as the revenue department estimates that the taluk has only 8,000 hectares of farmland. The department blames the drop in agriculture land on lack of water and increasing urbanization.""Close to the city , the taluk is seeing unprecedented growth. Each year we are losing around 200 hectares to development and land acquisition. Under such circumstances, farmers are forced to sell their land, fearing they may lose out on the opportunity to make a quick money and be a part of the development story ,"" said a senior agriculture department official.The villagers say the government is the primary culprit robbing Devanahalli of its traditional roots and rendering farmers unemployed and subservient to MNCs that employ them as watchmen or cleaners.In Bommavaru alone, at least 77 farmers are likely to lose 62 hectares of land for road construction, which will bring them money but render them unemployed.Raghavendra said, ""The government will give Rs 60 lakh for an acre while others will offer Rs 1.2 crore.But this money , considering that we never see such hefty sums, will only last for a few years. What then?"""

On the first day of procurement on Wednesday, it collected 90 tonnes of vegetables.However, farmers at Kanthallur are up in arms against the delay in payments for earlier procurements and the low prices fixed for vegetables. P.T. Mohandas, president of the Kanthallur Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society which procures vegetables from the farmers, said private traders were giving farmers a higher price and only 250 kg of garlic was procured by Horticorp from Kanthallur.There are allegations that vegetables grown on estates are reaching the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralams (VFPCK) market at Kanthallur to be procured by Horticorp.Horticorps procurement prices fluctuated throughout the day, which was a concern for the farmers. Following their protest on Wednesday, Horticorp decided to fix prices for vegetables for the day from Thursday. The prices fixed on the day for a kg of carrot was Rs.27.50, cabbage Rs.15.40, potato Rs.26.40, beans Rs.31, and garlic Rs.135. A Horticorp official on Thursday said procurement would continue till September 11. He said there was no basis for the allegations that the prices fixed by private traders were higher than those fixed by Horticorp. It is Horticorps intervention that ensured fair prices for the farmers, saving them from exploitation by middlemen, he said.Large-scale arrival of vegetables was reported on Thursday from Vattavada, the main market. Jayaprakash, president of the Vattavada Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society, said Horticorp had paid all dues. Farmers received better prices this season."
