58f54eeca3d24b0b70c1fbed,Will Congress wrest the seat from AIADMK?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-congress-wrest-the-seat-from-aiadmk/article8598274.ece,2016-05-18,,The Hindu,"Plagued by infrastructure inadequacies on one side and mounting pressure caused by increasing tourism on the other, Udhagamandalam is all set to see the battle of ballots with Congress making a bid to wrest the seat from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).Udhagamandalam, a most sought after hill station by domestic and international tourists, is reeling under various infrastructure inadequacies and people in the hills have started migrating to the plains for the sake of higher education and healthcare. Continued neglect in terms of infrastructure by the successive governments has resulted in the Queen of Hills loosing her sheen.Since 1957, the constituency has returned Congress nominees eight times, nominee of the Swatandra party once besides giving the AIADMK and DMK a chance twice each. In 2011, the constituency returned sitting MLA M. Budhichandran who was inducted into the cabinet for a brief period.Fund-starved Udhagamandalam Municipality had not been able to make any progress in terms of infrastructure and the constituencys demographic profile includes a mixture of Badagas, Christians, Keralites, Kannadigas and Muslims.Ban on issue of patta on one side and rampant building rule violations on the other are the major issues that the electorate hold against the successive ruling parties. Tourism, horticulture and plantations remain the key economic factors for this hill-station.K.A. Bhojan, a resident of Udhagamandalam for the last 26 years, says that there is a burgeoning vehicular population, but the town roads remain very narrow without any adequate parking space resulting in congestion becoming the order of the day. The town had been growing vertically and horizontal growth was very minimum, he added.Similarly, the water supply schemes that the Municipality depends are proving to be grossly inadequate. In the absence of a strong political leadership in the district, despite change of governments, MLAs were not able to get sanctions for any foresighted projects taking into account the long term requirements. Many of the projects were envisaged and implemented by the British.With cup of woes overflowing, Dharmalingam Venugopal of Nilgiris Documentation Centre has entered the fray taking on the Dravidian majors, national and regional party nominees.His campaign remains very simple Vote for Ooty. Mr. Venugopals campaign also focuses on renaming Udhagamandalam as Ooty as it is popularly known to the rest of the world.He pointed out that the hill district needs a lot of infrastructure as it attracted close to 25 lakh tourists an year and more than 50 per cent of them from Southern States and the rest from all over India and from abroad. He also calls for reasonable price for tea and for the vegetables that are grown here such as carrot, cauliflower, potato and broccoli.Political leaders and top bureaucrats, who come to Udhagamandalam for vacations, promise to do something for betterment of the town but seldom remember that on their return from vacation, says a leading hotels manager on condition of anonymity. The hill district capital is yet to get an engineering college and the trauma care facilities at Government Hospital at Udhagamandalam requires a lot of improvement.Interestingly, the constituency which is a sought after spot for film shooting has only three theatres and promises of the past namely introduction of rope car and many other infrastructure to aid tourism is yet to translate into reality on the ground, Mr. Bhojan added.There is no scientific study or a permanent solution to the problem of land slips which at some times cuts off the connectivity for the district with the plains.The much talked about proposal for a third route to the Nilgiris (besides the one via Kotagiri and the other via Coonoor) has not seen the light of the day owing to issues of environment clearance.Promising to resolve all or at least many of the issues, the candidates locking horns are R. Ganesh of the Indian National Congress (INC) D. Vinodh of AIADMK, K. King Narcissus of DMDK and J. Raman of BJP."

Another 41 nursing students were treated as out patients. Nursing students who take up duties at OGH and turn up for academics from 11 am to 3 pm simultaneously -- blamed the unhygienic food being served by a private contractor at the hostel mess for their sickness.""The students fell ill soon after they consumed tomato rice and onion curry, served at our hostel mess on Friday,"" complained a nursing student, on condition of anonymity, while blaming a private mess contractor for the incident. In fact, unsafe water is being suspected for the food contamination as several students pointed out how that the overhead tank used for storing water for cooking purposes, was not cleaned even once in the last one year.""With the Rs 12,00 per month they collect from us, they not just serve us unhygienic food but also use cheaply available vegetables in the market like onions, ivy gourd (dondakaya), potatoes and lady fingers for making curries,"" said another student.The students expressed fear that other students too may show symptoms of food poisoning as a total of 179 nursing students had consumed the same food served at the hostel. When contacted, Dr Mohd Rafi, resident medical officer (RMO), Osmania General Hospital, said that condition of all the admitted nursing students are stable.""There appears to be bacterial contamination in the food that the students consumed at their hostel mess. We are questioning the mess caretaker,"" said Dr Rafi, adding that they have administered intravenous fluid to the admitted students.Meanwhile, water samples from the hostel mess of the school of nursing has been sent for testing to the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) on Saturday."

On entering the tribal district, one can see multi-storied houses, lush green fields along with hotels, guest houses and home stays. The rapid growth in tourism has already sparked discussions on having a master plan for sustainable tourism. However, not many would know that some five decades back the snowbound district was deprived of even the most basic facilities, and that its people's fortune changed only after they took the cooperative route in the 1960s and worked together.At 2 persons per sq km, Lahaul and Spiti district has India's lowest population density. It has a population of 3.31 lakh for a geographical area of 13,833 sq kms. Though the district remains cut off from the rest of the world for six months in winter, people here have made rapid development and many of them not only own properties in the district but also in Kullu, Manali and other parts of country.Before the Centre thought of constructing a road to connect Manali with Lahaul and Spiti and then Ladakh, people used to walk over a 13,050-foot mountain pass to reach Manali. A Lahaul and Spiti-based historian, Chhering Dorje, said that before the 1962 war, Lahaul was deprived of road connectivity and people used to cross Rohtang Pass out of compulsion only, either for trade or for employment. ""In summer, it would take 3-4 days to travel between Lahaul and Manali. In winter, the journey wuld extend to 5-6 days and even more in case of bad weather,"" he said.Dorje said construction of the road from Manali to Ladakh started turning the wheels of development in the district. A former MLA from Lahaul-Spiti, BJP's Dr Ram Lal Markanda, said had people not taken the cooperative route, the valley would not have witnessed the prosperity visible today. ""Seeds of development were sown on May 28, 1966, when Lahaul Potato Growers Co-operative Marketing cum Processing Society Limited (LPS) was formed with initial an membership of 20 growers, under the then Punjab State Cooperative Societies Act,"" he said. ""With passage of time, almost every house in Lahaul had a member in LPS. Their united efforts helped ensure better marketing of seed potato. This help fetch a good price for farmers.""At present, LPS is known for varied activities, ranging from basic necessities of people to secondary needs like supply of petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, and even procurement of agricultural and horticultural produce. After witnessing the success of LPS, Lahaul residents had formed another cooperative society to market hops. ""Through the society, people had started selling their produce to beer-producing companies for a good price. But, later, farmers stopped producing hops and tuned towards sowing green pea and apple,"" said Premjeet Phurpa, a resident of Phura village in Lahaul.A retired block development officer, Balbir Singh Yarki, after seeing big hydro power companies showing interest in tapping the hydro power potential of Lahaul valley, had motivated the people to form a cooperative society to generate hydro power through their own projects. Today, residents of around 30 villages of Chandra Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district have scripted a new story of empowerment as around 850 members have become shareholders of the Chandra Valley Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society Limited, which has bagged a small hydro power project in the valley.Sonam Dolma of Shashin village and one of the shareholders in the society said the society was leap for Lahaul residents from producing potatoes and green peas to producing electiricity. ""When big hydro power companies can come here to exploit our resources, then cannot we step forward to reap the benefits of development?"" she added.Yarki said other residents of Lahaul had formed Shansha Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society, which has 140 members to venture into hydro power. He said the cooperative movement in Lahaul was deep-rooted and people knew its benefits. ""It is only through the cooperative movement that we have been successful so far,"" he said."

IAF has shot off a communique to state forest department to get rid of this innocuous enemy.Speaking to TOI, divisional forest officer, Gwalior, Vikram Singh Parihar, said, ""There are around 70 of them inside the airbase. IAF wants us to shift them to some other location. We have already had a meeting with them and another meeting will be held in next few days for remedial measures."" Forest department recommended IAF to raise height of their boundary wall to 8 feet or go for chain fencing. ""It's not easy to capture these animals given its herd size. Initially we advised air force officials to use chain link fencing or raise boundary wall,"" said the DFO.There had been several communications between IAF and state forest department on this matter in last four years. A letter was also sent on May 21 this year reporting the blue bull menace.Though there had been instances of blue bulls venturing onto the runway, posing a threat to the fighter jets during take-off and landing, defence spokesman Group Captain B B Pande told TOI that the menace is limited to the domestic area of Maharajpur airbase.""The technical (working) and operational area is completely free of blue bulls, but there are many in the domestic area. We have written to forest department to remove them from our premises for safety of people living there and have also assured them cooperation in operations,"" said Group Captain Pande. The only solution is to chase them out, he said.Forest department had been expressing helplessness, stating that rules allow killing or translocation of antelopes only if they damage crops. IAF had also carried out an aerial survey to find out the number of wild animals around the air base that led to mishaps in the past. Blue bulls also pose danger to movement of aircraft, but also vehicular traffic within the campus. Two persons on a two-wheeler were injured by bluebulls in the IAF premises a few days ago, said sources.A portion of IAF's Maharajpur airstrip is shared by Airports Authority of India (AAI) for parking planes. Blue bulls, said sources, move across the runway to the adjacent farm land of Central Potato Research Centre (CPRC), located close to the boundary wall of the airstrip. CPRC has farm area of 179.5 ha and is primarily engaged in seed production.This centre has two research programmes, including development of low-input technology for potato production and to work on stem necrosis diseases of potato. The bulls jump across the boundary wall to reach the farm. In 2003, IAF had come up with an unusual idea to check the menace at their Bakshi-ka-Talab air base on outskirts of Lucknow by using tiger excreta, obtained from the Lucknow Zoo. They littered it around the runaway after being informed that smell of tiger droppings will keep blue bulls away, but to no avail."

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166. The maximum prices of tomato and potato was Rs 80 and Rs 35/kg, respectively."

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying 'Jai Shri Ram' at Lucknow on Dussehra day, national BJP chief Amit Shah followed in his footsteps and begun his address with the same chant.Shah, who was at Etawah to address the party's Sankalp Rally, went on to exhort those present to chant it loud enough to be heard not only in the neighbouring Saifai but even by Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. And what obviates that it was done to polarise the votebank was the fact that Modi 's chant was better suited for the time and occasion of Dussehra and Ramlila grounds, while Shah was addressing a political rally. On previous occasions, Shah has begun his speech with 'Bharat Mata ki jai' or Vande Matram.Shah also tried to get mileage out of the Indian Army's recent surgical strike in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir by presenting Modi as a strong and decisive leader. Before elections, BJP had promised that if voted to power, terrorist and enemy forces from across the border would not dare to attack India, said Shah and added that the first surgical strike post-Independence by the Indian Army was proof of the promise being delivered.""The borders are now secure, unlike during the Sonia-Manmohan Singh regime when Indian soldiers were beheaded by enemy forces who crossed the border with the slain heads,"" said Shah. Speaking in the poll-bound state, Shah said the party might contest without declaring any chief minister face.""In the last over two years, no one even in the Opposition has blamed the BJP government at the Centre of any corruption,"" said Shah, claiming it to be the second poll promise of the party fulfilled, adding that UPA government got the support of SP and BSP to become partners in scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore. The amount of scam was equal to three years of total budget of UP, said Shah and added that it could have helped make three schools in every village of UP and created so many jobs.Referring to a recent gaffe, Shah said a big leader like Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi didn't know whether potato is grown in a farm land or in a factory, so what can he do for the welfare of farmers. ""He (Rahul) is here only to help SP or BSP come back to power,"" Shah alleged."

Among the many British soldiers deputed in Dehradun was young Captain Frederik Young from Ireland, who commanded the first Gorkha Battalion in its founding years. Young - who joined the East India Company as a 15-year-old and went on to retire as a General after 44 successive years' service - is said to be the founder of Mussoorie.The Irishman - whose 142nd death anniversary falls on May 24 - not only built St Peter's Church, but also the entire Sister's Bazaar area. But as it often happens, he has received little mention in the pages of history and his contributions lie largely forgotten. Historian Gopal Bharadwaj echoes this view and says, ""Young was indeed a visionary and deserves a little more attention than he gets.""Given Irishmen's love for potatoes, the young Captain is said to have gone exploring higher up in the hills in search of suitable locations to grow the vegetable. Little did he know that the rolling hills would not only provide him with venues to farm, but also remind him vividly of home.Soon after, in 1834, he built himself a shooting lodge in Landour - making it the first official residence of Mussoorie and paving the way for today's picturesque hill station. True to his Irish roots, Young named the lodge Mullingar after a town in Westmeath, Ireland.""He was an exceptionally brave man and the pahadis certainly owe him for the potatoes that grow here and for the entire town of Mussoorie that he set up,"" says author Ganesh Saili who lives in a lovely cottage on the ramp of the Mullingar Hill where Captain Young's potato field probably once stood.So in love was the Captain with Landour that even after he retired and went back to Ireland where he breathed his last on May 24, 1874, his ghost, many say, still comes to visit his old haunt on moonless nights.""Legend has it that on dark, moonless nights, a ghostly rider astride a white horse arrives at the old Mullingar lodge, ties his steed to the remnants of the old wrought iron railing, snaps to attention and... waits for the parade of Redcoats to begin,"" writes Saili in his book 'Tales of Yesteryear, Mussoorie Medley'."

They erupted in joy and the ambience of the sleepy agrarian town changed dramatically.The villages of Baraberi, Khaserbheri and Goplanagar were the worst affected by land acquisition.

People shouted, sang and danced on the streets.We are all overjoyed, extremely happy, said Badal Santra, a farmer whose two and half bighas of land was acquired for Tatas small car project. Look at my thatched house, she said turning emotional. Does someone who owns so much land deserve a home like this? In the past ten years, how much rice and potato I could have cultivated. How many lakhs I could have earned, said the farmer who had refused to accept any compensation.I have been waiting for this day since 2006, said Manorajan Malik, father of Tapasi Malik, who was raped and killed for protesting the land acquisition.

The presence of such pathogens in food could lead to severe digestive tract problems,"" said Dr Sudarshan, a scientist from the institute.Another mistake that scientists pointed out was the idea of thawing food after taking it out of the fridge. ""The most hygienic practice is to heat food as soon as it is taken out of the fridge, not wait for it to thaw. When it is kept in the open to reach room temperature, it attracts more microbes,"" said Subba Rao.In view of the disturbing revelations, medical experts spoke about extremely risky food storage practices. ""We have substantial proof that there are chances that digestive tract infections could stem from consumption of such (improperly stored) foods. I suggest that people start using proper ziploc bags to safeguard their ve getables from contamination,"" Dr Zeenat Fatima, a dietician of Continental Hospitals, told TOI.Scientists said since temperature is one of the major factors determining food quality, proper refrigeration could be the first line of defence against food-borne illnesses.

The back-to-roots programme comes in the backdrop of many young members leading a fast-paced modern life without giving much space to their beliefs and ways, said community leaders.There are 80,000 to 90,000 GSB community members in Ernakulam and their major occupation is business. The grama sabhas have members drawn from 50 families in each area. Community leaders are of the view that food habits bring out the Asura nature or sattvic character in a person. At weekend grama sabha meetings, the elders and community leaders are urging youngsters to mind the strictures laid down by their forefathers.Youngsters are told to give up alcohol, onion and potatoes that are prohibited by the community. ""Many are forced to eat these vegetables when they go outside after securing a job. But this is a taboo since it fuels dark emotions like anger and greed. Degradation of moral values are reflected in the attitude of this generation. We want to nurture moral values in them,"" said Sanjay Pai, secretary of GSB Vikas Pariksha.He said that there was a time when young men used to recite evening prayers and Gayatri mantra. ""This has forced the community leaders to create awareness about the tradition,"" Sanjay said.C G Rajagopal, president of the GSB Kshema Sabha said: ""Young GSB community members are becoming alcoholics.

The lemon prices has seen a sharp increase in the last few days. Earlier, the lemon was available for Rs80 per kilogram, now it costs Rs150 to Rs200 per kilogram.APMC Surat secretary Nilesh Thorat told TOI, ""Every day more than 60 trucks arrive at the market yard from Chaklasi, Deesa, Anand, Kheda and Prantij. The transporters have hiked the tariff due to heavy traffic jam on NH-8 near Bharuch. This has led to hike in retail prices of vegetables in the city. There is a short supply of potatoes and lemons.

Against Rs 28 per kg for the best ladysfinger in the wholesale market, the retail market is selling it at Rs 80 per kg.

Often the vegetables are in various stages of rot. The wholesale rates are much lower, so why are we paying twice as much in retail?"" asked Suman Gupta, a resident of Patparganj.Wholesalers said that the high prices will remain for some more time, especially since more rain has been predicted for the coming days.""It is not unusual for vegetable prices to rise during the monsoon. Fields are flooded and it is very difficult to bring vegetables out of the fields,"" said Mahinder Sanpal, member, APMC Azadpur.""Also, the vegetables start rotting because they get wet. It is the green vegetables that are affected the most. Another problem is that vehicles carrying vegetables are not being able to reach Delhi in time due to waterlogged roads,"" Sanpal added.The other reason for shortage of vegetables and consequent rise in price is the flooding of the Yamuna banks because of which local produce has been ruined."

That's changing now as village youths head for the cities to find better paying work in services and factories.Experts say the shortage of farm labour and its rising cost are among the main reasons for the increasing mechanisation of Indian farming. ""This is not restricted to pockets but spread all across,"" said T R Kesavan, chairman of the technical committee and immediate past president of Tractor Manufacturers' Association. While tractors still outsell other farm equipment like power tillers and combine harvesters, the gap has closed in recent years.The market for specialised machinery, such as threshers, rotavators, transplanters, reapers, zero till drills, laser levellers and power weeders, is worth Rs 32,000 crore now, said Surendra Singh, technical adviser to industry body Agricultural Machinery Manufacturers' Association (AMMA). He added that the industry could touch the Rs 37,000-40,000 crore level in three-five years, growing at its present yearly rate of 5-8%. That will make it as large as the tractor market is now.""Currently, the tractor market is around Rs 40,000 crore while the implements market is around Rs 32,000 crore,"" said Singh.While local players like Tirth Agro Technology that makes Shaktiman brand of implements have cornered 85-90% of the market in the initial shift to mechanisation, the organised players have started paying closer attention to this segment. ""Till recently, the segment was reserved for the small-scale sector,"" said Kesavan. ""Now that it has been thrown open, technologically superior implements and equipment will be introduced.""Tractor market leader Mahindra & Mahindra, for instance, has acquired 33% stake in Mitsubishi Mahindra Agri-Machinery and 35% stake in Finland-based Sampo Rosenlew, which, analysts say, will increase its presence in the agri-implements business in India.Similarly, tractor major Escorts is considering a more significant presence in this market. Ravi Menon, CEO of Escorts' agri-machinery business, said, ""Currently we have tie-ups to pick up implements as part of the total solution package we offer our customers, but we are evaluating options.""German company Lemken and Italian Maschio Gaspardo have set up manufacturing facilities in India. Grimme India, another MNC subsidiary, is offering implements for potato crops. Experts say it's a matter of time before other big global players enter the field as India is a vast opportunity.The size of the global implements business is estimated to be $131 billion in 2018.The migration of unemployed village youths to cities is unlikely to stop now. ""The younger generation is shunning farming because it feels it is a menial job and the remuneration is not commensurate with the effort put in,"" said Kesavan, adding that, ""Studies have shown that 50% of India's population will live in urban areas by 2030. This migration from villages to cities will lead to a lot of proxy farmers taking care of multiple plots of land. When you have large landmasses, you have to mechanise.""Farmers' push for higher crop density is also driving the increasing use of farm implements. It is expected to increase yields by 25-30% in states with a low level of mechanisation at present, and by up to 10% in states like Punjab that are already highly mechanised."

As one explores deep into the neighbourhood, some of the original residents talk about how the colony has been witnessing accelerated growth in terms of urbanisation for the last six decades. Though the entire colony stretches up to four acres, there are about 7,000 people who live in this locality. Today, there is no trace of the natural stream as it has been replaced by a number of concrete structures. Cattle rearing and farming used to be the prime sources of income for majority of people.However, with urbanisation taking a toll on the natural rural setting, there is barley any original landmark existing in Peethalavanipalem, says Peethala Sanyasi Naidu, who has been living here for decades.There are several multi-storeyed group houses that dot the area. Sri Krishna Nilayam school, a Shiva temple, a number of grocery stores, health clinics, and a cancer screening prevention research centre cum Translational Research Institute of Molecular Sciences form a part of the map. People say major portion of the site was once owned by Peethala Paidiah, a colony resident. His descendants, who continue to live in the same place, reveal that the neighbourhood suffers from poor sanitation.Since there is no proper drainage system in place, the area is flooded with sewage water during rainy season. In addition to this, the open drains that pass through the lanes have been blocked at several points as many residents conveniently dump their domestic waste into them. Sanitation workers who visit the area are not equipped with adequate bins, brooms and other necessary equipment. As a result, the cleaning process takes a beating, says Botta Neelima, former corporator who plans to create awareness campaign on health and hygiene involving GVMC workers across the ward.Zone II Commissioner: P.

Nearly 210 metric tonne of lady's fingers are grown in 3,000 hectare of land in Surat district but the vegetable is being sold for Rs1 per kg here.The production cost of lady's finger in Surat district comes to about Rs 3.5 per kg but it sells for Rs 3 per kg in wholesale market, says horticulture department of Gujarat government. However, the lady's finger sells at Rs 40 per kg in retail market, which benefits brokers more than the farmers.""Farmers are compelled to throw the lady's finger crop as they are not getting anything. Can we survive like this? We would want to ask this question to chief minister Vijay Rupani. We would gather at APMC market in Surat and plan to present him the stock of lady's finger. We would demand global rate for it,"" Gujarat Khedut Samaj president Jayesh Patel said.Dinesh Padaliya, assistant director, horticulture department, said, ""There is abundance of lady's finger in the market and hence brokers rule the roost. They are setting the rate as per their wish because competition among farmers to sell the crop is high. Plantation of lady's finger in the district has gone up from 2,000 to 3,000 hectare in the past few years. There has been increase in production per hectare too.""Gujarat Khedut Samaj leaders alleged that some people in APMC were fleecing farmers. They alleged that these people have made it difficult for the farmers to get good price for their produce be it onion, potato, lady's finger, etc. These leaders want the state government to ensure farmers are not exploited. APMC market officer-bearers were not available for their comment on the issue."

Besides the newborn, there are three female and three male hippos at the zoo.We dont know if the newborn is a male or a female as gender identification can take up to six months with hippos, said K.S.S.V.P. Reddy, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Zoo Director. This hippo was born to four-year-old Trisha and 16-year-old Vaamburi, the oldest of the herd.The newborn and its mother are kept in separate enclosures to enable veterinarians to provide additional care to the calf. It will be two months before it is allowed to join the herd  that too, after taking the calfs health into consideration, zoo officials said.So far, the baby hippo, which is yet to receive a name, has been enjoying bits of everything, from bread and bananas to potatoes and elephant grass.Female hippopotamuses generally keep their offspring in their custody for at least a year, a forester said. Hippos normally do not breed in captivity and they need pure water courses. Provision of a congenial atmosphere for breeding and constant monitoring of the pairs living space and health have helped them breed successfully here at the zoo, said Mr. Reddy.While a female hippo is ready for mating after three or four years, a male hippo must be seven or eight to be successful. Hippos deliver their calves under water.The baby hippo has been enjoying bits of everything, from bread and bananas to potatoes and elephant grass"

A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest. He said that imported tomatoes should be randomly checked for infection and infected fruits destroyed. He also said that farmers should be trained to detect the symptoms of attack by tuta absoluta.Deploying pheromone traps in all stages of the crop has been found effective against leaf miner.Use of sticky traps or water-oil traps with pheromone bait; deployment of parasitoids and predators too are effective."

The award would be conferred to KVK Harnaut by PM Narendra Modi in the presence of Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh at the foundation day function of ICAR to be held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, on July 16, said its head and senior scientist Dr Sanjeev Kumar. Interestingly, Nalanda is the home district of CM Nitish Kumar.KVK Harnaut has been chosen for the prestigious award for the promotion and spread of the practice of organic farming of vegetables in Nalanda district on a big scale, besides the two other equally spectacular achievements of setting the world records in paddy and potato production by two different farmers, among other achievements.The significance of promotion of organic farming of vegetables among the three notable achievements could also be gauged from the fact that today - even in the age of the use of high dose of pesticides and chemical fertilisers for increased agricultural yield - the ""organic farming"" is the buzzword the world over. 265 farmers of Nalanda have formed a federation of producers of organic vegetables, called 'Shere Bihar Farmers Groups,' which has received C-3 certificate from the organisation Ecocert for the export of their vegetable yield.KVK Harnaut senior scientist Dr Kumar said the vegetables produced by them through organic farming methods are exported to the Middle East countries and Bangladesh, as well as to metropolitan cities of Maharashtra, West Bengal, and even to neighbouring Jharkhand for the high-end customers.Dr Kumar said KVK Harnaut is the ""child"" of CM Nitish, as he opened it in 1992 when he was Union agriculture minister. Initially, the method of organic farming of vegetables was started by 30 farmers in Sohdih village over 15 hectares of land in 2010-11, but the acreage has spread to 5,900 hectares of land by 2015, he added.In several ways, KVK Harnaut also became a part of the saga of Bihar turnaround story from 2006, especially in the first term of CM Nitish.Sumant Kumar, a farmer from Darveshpura village, set a world record in paddy production by getting a yield of 224 quintals of paddy per hectare of land for which he was given the award of best farmer by ICAR in 2012-13, apart from awards by the Punjab and Bihar governments.Similarly, Rakesh Kumar from Sohdih village also set world record in potato production by producing 1,088 quintals of potato per hectare of land that also brought to him best farmer award at International Potato Expo, New Delhi, in 2014, apart from recognition from Punjab government and Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour (Bhagalpur)."

They all owe their bodies to Phil Maffetone , a health and fitness trendsetter from New York , who has handheld them into the MAF Method, his unique approach to slim down, lose body fat, raise energy and ramp up performance.On a whirlwind trip to India, Maffetone spent a quiet morning at MIG Cricket Club in Bandra on Friday after spending a week in Hyderabad and Kochi before heading to Delhi to continue motivating runners, athletes, health professionals and corporates to take appropriate lifestyle actions.""They might quiz me at the immigration,"" he smiled. ""This is my first time in India and I haven't shopped. Oh, except some spices that someone got me."" He also has to his credit dozens of recipes where meatballs, burgers, tacos and shakes are not a forsaken part of the diet.The MAF Method, in the literal sense stands for ""Maximum Aerobic Function"", is one of the most widely practised endurance training in the world that focuses on three key factorseliminating sugar and refined carbs from the diet, fat-burning aerobic exercises and stress management. ""My most important focus is the aerobic system which includes the heart, lungs, blood vessels and muscle fibres. The idea is to burn fat which when stored offers inefficient, short-term energy. This allows runners to 'slowly' win the race,"" explained Maffetone, who also devised the 180 Formula to monitor heart rate, a direct reflection of the body's oxygen need, during aerobic training.In between his India tour, a look at the public health website caught Maffetone's concern. ""It seems instead of coconut oil or ghee, people eat vegetable oil? That's the worst thing you can do to the body.""Though impressed by the control of tobacco in India, the researcher-author-educator pointed out the new bad habit that is turning out to be equally hazardous is consumption of sugar, white flour and processed food. ""It is surprising how in one generation people have gone from starvation to obesity,"" he said. ""The number of obese people in the world is 700 million. Add to that overweight people who aren't obese; that's 2.9 billion. Plus, those who are old and have too much fat around their organs and bones. That's 5.5 billion people. It means 75% of the world is over fat and that nutrition transition is happening in India. It's changing the body's genes,"" Maffetone said, reasoning why East Africans' stranglehold in distance running is gradually loosening. ""It was evident at this year's Olympics that saw few Top 10 finishes.""Indian athletes, he said, have good fitness levels, but not necessarily health levels, as he makes a clear distinction between the two and the need for both. ""This is a paradox. That's why a lot of people running marathons are fat and get injured quite easily. The extreme of that are athletes who die in the middle of a race,"" he explained. ""I'm happy to see so many people in India running marathons because most of them were couch potatoes before that. Now, they have to take the next step forward and turn healthy.""Now 64, with a thatch of milky white hair touching his ears, Maffetone reminisced about his own journey from unhealthy to healthy to developing a passion to help others after an epiphany as a teenager standing in the school cafeteria with a tray full of ""junk"".The other big realization happened 12 years ago when he woke up to his other sidea songwriter. Maffetone spent several years in Los Angeles doling out a blend of pop, folk and rock over six albums. That's also when he met music stars Ri-ck Rubin and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers who he helped defy the wild and wayward tag and got Johnny Cash off his wheelchair. ""Doing a performance for two hours, five days a week is like running a marathon and they all realized they'd be more creative if they're healthy."""

58f58bb67be9e01a357a2de7,Season’s eatings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Seasons-eatings/articleshow/53026389.cms,2016-07-03,,The Times Of India,"If a time traveller somehow landed in a Goan kitchen, would she be able to tell the season from the vegetables being cooked? In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"
58f58bc1a3d24b0b70c227fa,Courtroom drama haazir ho!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/courtroom-drama-haazir-ho/article8060588.ece,2016-01-03,,The Hindu,"Court , that brilliant and grittily real film about a Dalit activist trapped in the chakravyuha of the Indian judicial system, didnt make it past the Oscars turnstile. A pity, because here was an entry that was really original, both conceptually and aesthetically, which actually negotiated the minefield of the Indian selection committees famous for sending duds to Los Angeles.Court has a lot worth recommending, but what I found particularly interesting was its subversion of a very popular cinema genre in both Hollywood and Bollywood: the courtroom drama. It is a genre that allows, particularly in Bollywood, for grand oratory, life-and-death issues and edge-of-the-seat excitement.Court s young director Chaitanya Tamhane, however, chose to turn it on its head with an absolutely authentic portrayal of a tedious and never-ending Indian trial, albeit with a psychological violence embedded in the dreariness. No, this surely isnt the way it would have been in mainstream Bollywood.Bollywood, bless its cheery soul, has regaled us for decades with its imaginative idea of what a courtroom is like.Anyone whos watched a reasonable number of old Hindi films will testify to the entertainment quotient of the black-robed lawyers striding up and down the courtroom, flinging Milord and Your Honour in the direction of the judge, who invariably vacillated between looking introspective and pounding the bench with a gavel while shouting Order, order.Bollywood courtroom jargon, suffused with Urdu, was equally delightful, including  sazaa-e-maut ,  mauka-e-waardaat ,  ba-izzat bari  and several other majestic-sounding triptych words.The dialogue clichs too were awesome. (Asks the judge in at least 10 films: Par iska is case ke saath kya tallukh hai ? Replies the lawyer: Tallukh hai milord, bahut gehra tallukh hai !) Or take the solemnly pronounced guilty verdict:  Saare gavaahon ke bayanaat aur sabooton ko madhya nazar rakhte hue, adalat is nateeje par pahunchi hai ki mujrim kusoorwaar hai aur use Tazirat-e-Hind, Dafaa 302 ke tahet sazaa-e-maut di jaati hai . Give or take a few words, this breathlessness-inducing tongue-twister has enriched more courtroom capers than one can keep count of.If Bollywood acquainted every layperson with IPC section 302, it similarly popularised other dry concepts like judicial adjournments with flaming drama (yes,  Tareekh pe tareekh, tareekh pe tareekh, tareekh pe tareekh !). At least five films Ive seen had one similar line that tapped into real-life litigants extreme frustration with never-ending adjournments:  Na court, na kachheri, na appeal na date direct sazaa ! A vigilantism loved by audiences that that would no doubt raise liberal hackles.Offbeat cinema has the occasional offering where fighting a legal case isnt about high-octave histrionics. Saeed Mirzas Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho about an old tenants quest for justice (in which, pricelessly, the prosecution and defence lawyers are literally in bed together) was one such, as was Basu Chatterjees thought-provoking Ek Ruka Hua Faisla about a jury deliberating a homicide trial.India had long abandoned the jury system when Chatterjee made this adaptation of Sidney Lumets 12 Angry Men, but that didnt deter him. Incidentally, the last jury trial in 1959 on the famous Nanavati murder case was also the subject of a film called Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke .Of late, Bollywood has been inching that much closer to real life with films like Hansal Mehtas Shahid , based on real-life lawyer Shahid Azmi who was the defence counsel for many Muslims accused in terrorism cases. Or Jolly LLB , a comedy about a small town lawyer clearly derived from the Sanjeev Nanda BMW hit-and-run case.In these films, the courtroom became more authentic and judges and lawyers moved out of the caricature mould. Indeed, Saurabh Shuklas and Boman Iranis superb turns as the harried magistrate and snooty, upper-crust defence lawyer in Jolly LLB were so true-to-life they could have emerged straight from a real courtroom.Yes, Jolly LLB wasnt flawless on the legal front, but that really is small potatoes compared to what some films have done to the law in the past.Of the totally whacko legalities conjured by Bollywood, two are unbeatable for sheer imagination. One is the climax of Damini, in which the evil, mane-tossing defence lawyer is sentenced to imprisonment along with the accused. The second, from Rajiv Rais Mohra , is my favourite.Here, a newspaper reporter sets out to help a man whos been sentenced to life for killing his sister-in-laws rapists after the court lets them off.The newspaper proprietor holds a special conference in which the judge who had presided over the trial, the police commissioner, a minister and others are jury members. By the end, the judge writes to the law ministry, and lo and behold, the convict walks free.I wonder how Court s protagonist Narayan Kamble would have behaved had he been airdropped into a masala film. Would he have burst into a folk song in court lambasting the judge? Or strangled the public prosecutor for reading out the full four dreary pages of a law? Perhaps. Because, Objection Milord, death by boredom is just not acceptable in Bollywood.(The author is a freelance writer and editor)"
58f58bd67be9e01a17c9c254,"Tomatoes, not onions, bring tears to the eyes",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Tomatoes-not-onions-bring-tears-to-the-eyes/articleshow/52754311.cms,2016-06-15,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: After onions brought tears to consumers, tomatoes are making them see red. Acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to Rs80 a kg. Although it is much less than the record high of over Rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. There may be no respite till the winters. Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar."

Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter. The dish brings out the flavour of Bombay duck like never before.Are you bored of eating the same old burgers? So, here's a twist.

It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack."" He also sells ragi gola and Pandarpur ragda pav.

He says, ""We wanted to create a new taste and serve a different recipe to our guests. It is difficult to acquire a new taste, however when you mix two yummy connotations (read paneer makhni and noodles) you are bound to get a winner.""Creamy, rich and tangy, paneer makhani gravy tossed together in a wok with noodles. The bland noodles get a lift in taste and aroma with the makhni gravy. You can experiment a little more by adding dollops of butter or fresh cream.Nothing can go wrong with tandoori chicken. A favourite among everyone the, dish gets a twist when combined with dimsums. Chef Vishwesh Khanna, from Pimpri, shares, ""The USP of a tandoori dimsum is the texture and flavour. The meat is cooked just right and the soft, slightly roasted covering adds to this flavour.""Tandoori dimsums are stuffed with shredded bits of tandoori chicken. The brownish tinge on the covering adds to the flavour. The strong flavours tickle your palate and the soft cover of the dumpling melts in your mouth. It is a perfect combination of spices."

The prices of several vegetables like tomato and lady fingers are about to touch Rs 50 a kilo in the wholesale market, while they will retail for between Rs 80 and Rs 100.""This year, because of the heatwaves, vegetable production has been hit and this has resulted in the increased prices. Supply of the vegetable is already low and hence prices are rising steadily,"" said Deepak Patel of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Patel said that this year, due to the excessive heat, there flowering was affected and this has led to a shortage in vegetables supply of about 20% to 25%.He said that prices are likely to stabilize after the arrival of fresh vegetables once the monsoon sets in.Nareshbhai Baghwani, a vegetable trader in Panchvati said: ""The rise in price was extremely sudden. Only last evening I was selling tomatoes for Rs 60 a kg. When I went to buy a fresh stock this morning, they had jacked up the price to Rs 70 per kg, compelling me to raise prices as well.I suppose the reason for the increase is that most crops have failed due the heat. I have to discard almost 3 or 4 kg of every 10 kg because of quality problems.""Laccharam Jagaji, a vegetable trader in Vastrapur says, ""We sell at very close to wholesale prices, which are 60/kg. Raising prices will only drive our customers away, so we aren't raising them unnecessarily. We get our produce from Jamalpur.

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man.

At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses.

Besides the newborn, there are three female and three male hippos at the zoo.We dont know if the newborn is a male or a female as gender identification can take up to six months with hippos, said K.S.S.V.P. Reddy, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Zoo Director. This hippo was born to four-year-old Trisha and 16-year-old Vaamburi, the oldest of the herd.The newborn and its mother are kept in separate enclosures to enable veterinarians to provide additional care to the calf. It will be two months before it is allowed to join the herd  that too, after taking the calfs health into consideration, zoo officials said.So far, the baby hippo, which is yet to receive a name, has been enjoying bits of everything, from bread and bananas to potatoes and elephant grass.Female hippopotamuses generally keep their offspring in their custody for at least a year, a forester said. Hippos normally do not breed in captivity and they need pure water courses. Provision of a congenial atmosphere for breeding and constant monitoring of the pairs living space and health have helped them breed successfully here at the zoo, said Mr. Reddy.While a female hippo is ready for mating after three or four years, a male hippo must be seven or eight to be successful. Hippos deliver their calves under water.Zoo officials told The Hindu that the quality of pond water is constantly monitored, as hippos mate in water, with the female staying submerged during much of the process.Keeping freshwater fish tilapia partly ensures the water is clean, say the staff.The baby hippo has been enjoying bits of everything, from bread and bananas to potatoes and elephant grass"

As farmers cannot sell their produce at APMC markets, they can sell them at PCMC-owned vegetable markets, Jagtap said, in a memorandum submitted to municipal commissioner Dinesh Waghmare.Delisting fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act has allowed farmers to directly sell their produce without the need for middlemen. The move aims to safeguard farmers' interests and keep a tab on price rise, which is mostly blamed on middlemen.Over 1,000 truckloads of fruits and vegetables, including potatoes and onions, are unloaded at the Market Yard in Pune daily. Several trucks carrying fruits and vegetables are also unloaded at the APMC at Moshi in Pimpri Chinchwad. The offloaded goods are distributed to over 20 vegetable markets owned by PCMC. One of the main markets is near the Pimpri railway station. Jagtap rued that even before the rule was implemented, the traders have gone on a indefinite strike.""Most farmers in and around villages in Pimpri Chinchwad send their produce to Vashi, which is Asia's biggest agriculture produce market committee. PCMC can help farmers by allotting them space at its markets,"" Jagtap said.He The Chinchwad MLA further said that many vegetable markets, reserved in the development plan, have not been developed. ""PCMC can allot these plots to farmers. EventuallyIn the coming weeks, the number of farmers selling agriculture produce directly to people will increase. The farmers as well as as the common man will benefit from the move,"" Jagtap added."
58f59660a3d24b0b70c22e26,A fiery affair,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-fiery-affair/article8165785.ece,2016-01-29,,The Hindu,"I still remember, in technicolor, the first time I saw chillies growing in the kitchen garden in Dehradun on my first visit to the in-laws. Until then, I had never thought about where they came from. Ive been in a flaming love affair with them ever since. For me, chillies are the epitome of passion in cuisine. Fresh, dried, ripe, unripe, cooked, raw: however you use them, they make everything better.There is a big difference in the properties of each chilli. Green or red, fresh or dried, fried or boiled, they all have a different effect. For instance, fresh chillies, particularly if unripe, have a biting pungency, whereas the ripe dried ones taste more spicy and balanced. In Central and South American, where chillies originated, each region has its own set of local, traditionally grown fruits that differ not only in hotness but also, and more importantly, in flavour. Each variety is used for specific dishes. Removing the seed-bearing veins reduces pungency and allows the flavour to come forth. In Asia, though, there is no such fuss. If you want less heat, you simply use fewer chillies. The subtleties of flavour are added with a selection of additional spices. Indian, Italian, Mediterranean or South East Asian: whatever the cuisine, chillies blend in perfectly.Thai cuisine is anchored on curry pastes made with chillies. Thai green curry harnesses the cutting spiciness of green chillies, while red curry delivers a slower burn from riper red variants. The Chinese infuse oil with dried chillies; its a staple in their food and has become a mainstay on my kitchen shelf over the years, for when I want subtle heat in soups and stir-fries. Capsaicin, the element in chillies that makes them hot, is an irritant alkaloid found in chillies that has at least five separate chemical components. Their natural defence mechanism comes into play when chillies are pounded or pureed. They also fool the taste buds into thinking they are burnt.Every cuisine in the world has a favourite chilli condiment: the Maharashtrian thencha, the Naga mirch chutney, middle-eastern Harrissa, Thai nam pla. Could you imagine Andhra or Kolhapuri curries without chillies? Without Maharashrian mirchi thencha, Gujarati lasan ni chutney, or Bharva mirch achar? Life would be boring without Jaipurs legendary mirch pakoras and mirchi vadas, Kashmiri rogan josh, Rajasthani laal mass, or Goan fish recheado.Wild chillies were domesticated as early as 6500 BC; Spanish conquistadors carried them to Europe in 1514 and it was only in the 1600s that the Portuguese first planted them around Goa. Indian cuisine embraced chillies with fervour: they had a lot more fire power at a fraction of the volume of pepper, the only source of heat in Indian cuisine until then.So intrinsic are chillies to Indian cuisine that in many parts of India, they are the sole means to enliven simple meals of rice and rotis. For something that came to India so recently, we have so many different kinds of chillies. Beyond the ubiquitous Kashmiri and the legendary Naga, every area has a local variant. They cross pollinate easily, so are hard to classify but some varieties include Mizorams Dhani, Dharwars Byadagi, Khedas Jwala, and Kanthari, a short, ivory white, highly pungent variety from Kerala and parts of Tamil Nadu.Most often a little more chilli is all it takes to transform a dish. Crush a handful in a mortar, mix in some extra virgin olive oil or butter and brush onto fresh bread or toss through warm potatoes. You will find that the natural flavours are enhanced by the heat of the chillies. They are clearly intrinsic to my cooking, so much so that I am hard put to not use them, lest people think I cannot cook without them. I wonder myself sometimes...."

But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up. The purple coloured kala khatta which is sweet and tangy is a universal favourite. We procure the ice from the Besant Nagar depot. It is made with clean water,"" says Shaktivel."

Oh, and his misal sold for an anna a plate!Much has changed in the last 65 years. Except, swear Munniya's legions of fans, his savoury street snack.Poha, murmura, crispy chana, peanuts, sev, boiled potato, boiled jowar (who would have thought?), onion, green chilli, coriander, raw mango or lemon and various seasonings and spices go into Munniya's misal. It's not even close to the Maharashtrian misal of misal pav fame. Yet, it is utterly moreish. So good, in fact, that there's a steady stream of people from the time he sets up his cart at 6pm until he winds up around 11pm. He says he is 80 or 85 years old now, but his jet black hair, alert mind and ramrod frame insist otherwise.""I came to Nagpur from Allahabad with my maternal aunt's son when I was 13 or 14. He used to run a snacks cart but I am the one who got popular,"" he says without a trace of irony, adding that Nagpurians who live in 'Dubai and America' tell him they still crave his misal.That's probably because there's something strangely intimate about the way he goes about putting the misal together. Each person has a special preference, an extra green chilli here or a 'skip the peanuts' there. Munniya does it faithfully. Then, the person gets a fistful of the misal for approval or further adjustments. The fully customized, relatively healthy snack is now ready, its contents much more interesting than those of the newspaper squares it is served on.The misal's appeal is universal. Naved Siddiqui grew up eating the mouth-watering delicacy and his children now love it. ""From humble rickshaw-wallahs to doctors, from school kids to housewives and dada-dadi generation people, everyone likes his recipe,"" he says.At Gandhi Chowk, Munniya has been as steady a presence as the Gandhi statue that presides over the knot of narrow bylanes. He knows several families that have been living here, and eating his misal, since generations. He remembers how a certain Mr Patel likes his misal with a lot of crispy chanas and how a Mr Kanojiya prefers it a bit spicier than usual.He also remembers his boyhood back in Allahabad. ""When Nehru was contesting the election from Phulpur near Allahabad, I remember running with a flag in my hand in his support at a rally,"" he says, nostalgia halting his gnarled hands ever so slightly. He even recalls that a Congress session had taken place in the city 'many years ago' (it was the one in 1959) and that he had taken his cart all the way to Subhash Road, near the venue, for all the three days.Nehru did attend the session, proposing a resolution for introduction of cooperatives in agriculture. Unfortunately, he didn't get to taste Munniya's misal."

The end result is a spread that even the regular non-vegetarian eaters can't tell apart from what they are used to.

Now, the department and PepsiCo want to grow potatoes in nearly 1,000 acres from October 2016.Confirming this news to TOI, Visakhapatnam district horticulture assistant director G Prabhakara Rao said the FC3 variety is cultivated in Himachal Pradesh and specially meant for potato chips. PepsiCo is keen on using the potatoes for its chips units across the globe. ""Our department and PepsiCo conducted trials in Kuppam in Chittoor and Vizag Agency last season and the MNC representatives were satisfied with the results from Vizag Agency and have confirmed that they will go ahead with cultivation in 1,000 acres in the Agency area. The ITDA Paderu financially supported us in the trial run by sharing 50% of the input cost which is around Rs 30,000 per acre,"" Prabhakara Rao said. The department will procure around 1,000 tonnes of seeds from Himachal Pradesh.A PepsiCo representative said, ""Vizag Agency's weather is most favourable for the FC3 potatoes. We hope that we will get a good yield in Vizag. We will start the work from October this year.""Prabhakara Rao further said that they got nearly 4 to 5 tonnes of potatoes per acre in the trial session and they hope to generate 7 to 8 tonnes per acre during actual cultivation. ""Farmers will get good profits from the crop. A Rs 50000 investment will be required for an acre's crop and the returns are likely to be Rs 1 lakh. Priority will be given to local tribals to grow the potatoes. Only three agency mandals, namely, Araku, Dumbriguda and Hukumpeta are viable for the FC3 potatoes cultivation,"" the officer said.""These FC3 potatoes are not good for commercial purpose like local market. However, the potatoes which get rejected by PepsiCo will be given to commercial markets,"" Prabhakara Rao said.According to horticulture scientists, the FC3 potato is resistant to diseases, gives good yields than ordinary varieties, has thin skin, is easily washable and boiled and needs less fertiliser. All these qualities make it ideal for making chips.Horticulture officials said the MNC may set up a potato chips manufacturing unit in Vizag if they are satisfied with the potatoes cultivation here in the long run. The state government is also planning to give sops to various MNCs for their units in the state, the officer added."

Mamata's support is important because the BJP doesn't have the numbers to ensure the safe passage of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha.According to experts, the switch-over from VAT (value added tax) to GST is likely to benefit consuming states like West Bengal more than producing states such as Gujarat. Mitra has been holding a series of meetings with the state finance ministers to arrive at a golden mean. One of the major issues coming in the way of a seamless rollout of the GST is the proposed 1% extra GST on producing states. The Congress has opposed it as the proposal has come from Gujarat. Besides, there are other issues like some states have demanded that percentage of revenue-neutral rate of GST should be put into amendment.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and state FM Amit Mitra will be pushing hard for a consensus by bringing in some amendments over the tax proposal to reach a consensus to marry the polarities between states and political parties. Other than the economic considerations, GST has also become a political hot potato with the Narendra Modi government trying to gain confidence of the India Inc through this major tax reform. On Tuesday, Mitra will be placing the seventh GST draft in the meeting where as many as 20 state finance ministers will be present. When contacted, state FM and chairman of GST panel, Amit Mitra said, ""With Mamata Banerjee taking charge for the second term, such a national event on a significant reform agenda in city makes us proud.""With the Bengal chief minister taking a lead role among states to introduce GST, Kolkata has been chosen the venue of the meeting. This is the first time that a national-level tax reform meeting is being held in the city, a state official said. Even the VAT panel led by former state finance minister Asim Dasgupta didn't ever have a meeting in Kolkata.While giving a push to the GST initiative at the meeting of the chambers, the Bengal chief minister held that the micro, small and medium industrial units in Bengal will gain out of the unified tax procedure, bringing relief to a whole lot of people engaged in this sector."

Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop. The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

The agreement is aimed at bridging the current demand and supply gap.""This is a unique initiative as the company would set up a tissue culture laboratory at Deras near Khurda. The laboratory will produce over one lakh metric tonne of potato seeds, which will cater to the demand of Odisha and other eastern states, by 2020-21,"" said horticulture director Susant Nanda.The company would also set up a seed multiplication centre on 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput. ""The firmwill establish the required infrastructure. The government is not required to invest anything,"" Nanda added.The state requires around one lakh metric tonne of potato seeds a year. At present, these are being produced in limited quantity. To meet the demand, large quantities of potato seeds are being procured from Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.""Though National Seed Corporation sends us seeds, they are not suitable for Odisha's weather conditions and a large amount of these are damaged during transportation,"" an officer in horticulture directorate said.In 2014, the government had signed similar agreements with National Seed Corporation, International Potato Centre and Lima in Peru. Besides, Potato Mission was launched last year to tackle the crisis, but nothing much has changed on the ground."

Dipped in the tamarind chutney that you only get at the cafe, it's heavenly, fans say.So popular have the chops been over the years, they attracted not only the intermission crowd and walk-in customers, but even movie stars. But more on that later.The soft-spoken Niranjana Nandi, along with her son Parth, runs the cafe now. It was Niranjana's father-in-law Shailendranath, originally from Calcutta, who started the cafe and put the dish on the menu, at the same time the cinema hall was inaugurated around 1932. Shailendranath passed away when his son Prabhat was just eight years old. He took over a few years later and ran it for a long time. When Prabhat, too, died over a decade ago, Niranjana, his wife, took over. ""But it was my father-in-law who made the chops famous,"" she says.So famous, in fact, that there was a time before independence, when only the British would visit the cafe, and Indians would stay away. ""Partly because we served non-vegetarian food and partly because they felt uncomfortable in the company of the sahibs,"" Niranjana reasons. The firangs loved the mild flavour of the chops so much, they would tip the servers generously. ""The servers would be able to save their entire salary,"" Niranjana recalls the apocryphal tale with a smile.In later years, the snack became legendary, attracting film legends. ""Shammi Kapoor was very fond of them. He would accompany his father Prithviraj who would come to Nagpur to stage plays. Shammi ji would help him set up the tent on the premises on Variety theatre and then come to the cafe to dig into the chops and kheema samosas,"" Niranjana says, recounting something she has heard but not seen. Another of these stories: ""Once, Dilip Kumar ji came too. But he remained inside a black car and his driver came inside to get the chops."" And Niranjana remembers seeing Jalal Agha at the cafe herself. ""He even suggested to my husband to open a branch in Bombay,"" she recollects. Former Union minister Vasant Sathe and former state minister Satish Chaturvedi were fans of the chops too.Shammi Kapoor would make it a point to call for the chops on his visits to Nagpur, where his sister Urmilla is married into the Sial family. ""I've heard he would love to have them with his drinks,"" Niranjana says. Urmilla's nephew Gagan, a businessman and foodie, also grew up eating the chops. ""Oh, they are really fresh and addictive,"" he says, adding that many picnics in the old days would be incomplete without a parcel of the chops. ""Even today, I have to carry them when I visit my out-of-town relatives,"" he says.The consistent taste comes, in no small part, due to the fact that the Nandis have had the same meat supplier ever since the cafe began, says Niranjana. Since the recipe is from Kolkata, has she ever tried the original version in the City of Joy? ""Yes, of course,"" she says. ""But there, they call it mutton cutlet. They keep asking me why we call it chops."" Chops, chaap, cutlet.

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe spiralling cost of tomatoes may make shopping for vegetables costlier for consumers. The price of this staple vegetable has shot up by nearly three times from last week, leaving many consumers in shock.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, a kilo of tomatoes was priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 last week.This week, a box of tomatoes consisting of 25 kilos cost Rs. 1,250. In the wholesale market, the price is Rs. 50 per kilo. Retailers sell a kilo at Rs. 60, he said.Like tomatoes, the cost of a number of vegetables has skyrocketed. This was mainly due to less production in summer, he said, adding, Vellore gets its supply of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh. Supply is hit due to low production due to the heat conditions.Vegetables such as brinjal, beans and avarakkai cost more as the yield is low.A kilo of brinjal (thorn variety) costs Rs. 40, while buying beans could burn a hole in the pockets of consumers. A kilo of beans is priced at Rs. 80 to 100, while avarakkai costs Rs. 60, he said.Onions offer consolation for consumers as the price continue to be normal at Rs. 10 to 15. In fact, this was less when compared to last months rate, Mr. Balu noted.The cost of other vegetables are (a kilo): small onion Rs. 40, potato  Rs. 20 to Rs. 24, drumstick Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, carrot  Rs. 40, cabbage  Rs. 20, ladys finger  40, snake gourd Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, bitter gourd  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, green chillies  Rs. 50, ginger  Rs. 50, beetroot  Rs. 30 and a bunch of coriander is Rs. 30 to Rs. 40.Mr. Balu added that it was not the season for peas and cauliflower. Cauliflower might be sold but it will not be of good quality, he added.For consumers, there might not be any relief from these skyrocketing prices for now.He said that the rates of vegetables would continue to be high for at least a month."

On a Thursday evening in June 2015, Reddy, a 20-something systems analyst, was part of a throng of thousands jostling through the temple, seeking divine intervention for what would turn out to be a successful, if nervy, visit to the American consulate in Mumbai.For Reddy (who requested his name be changed) and thousands of others targeting an onsite stint or, better yet, a relocation with a technology outsourcer, divine intervention is the last-gasp step to sealing the deal. Reddy now lives in San Francisco. But for many others, the challenges remain daunting. ""The process of moving to the US was nerve-wracking,"" says Reddy. ""Even now, there's always a concern, at the back of the mind, about how much time you have in the US and whether your visa will be renewed.""Still, not everyone is quaking with fear at potential changes to immigration norms  and resultant aftershocks to the visa system. While presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be making shrill claims on immigration and job losses in the US, Indians working in the country aren't overly concerned. ""Trump is saying all this to get Americans' attention,"" says a 30-something engineer at TCS, who is based in the US.She does not believe much will come of his stand against outsourcing. However, she thinks, the fear Trump is tapping into is not unfounded. ""In India, too, there are concerns in many states about outsiders taking away the jobs of locals."" She can't understand how Trump has come this far in the presidential race as no American she knows supports him.Another Indian engineer who works with a tech giant in Silicon Valley believes that even if Trump wants to do something about outsourcing as president, it may not be easy. ""I am told getting a bill on this passed through Congress is going to be hard. Also, if he becomes president, this may not be top priority for him.""India's outsourcing industry is in the midst of a painful transition and growth has slowed  industry lobby Nasscom has forecast 12% growth for 2016-17, down from 20% in the rah-rah 2000s  even as wildly fluctuating immigration rhetoric in the ongoing US presidential elections, led by Trump, has muddied the waters further.The industry has based its growth on the ability to remotely deliver software services to clients and use a small number of employees on site to help customers roll out the software and systems they have built.While an on-site (on the customer premises) job has been a much-sought-after perk for coders for decades, immigration and visa norms have been a growing hindrance, with costs rising and caps being placed on their issue. In early April, the cap of 85,000 for H1-B visas (including 20,000 for students with a US master's degree or higher) was quickly hit and a lottery system was triggered to select applicants.Companies are aware of the immigration tightrope they walk with their technology talent. In October 2013, Infosys agreed to pay $34 million to end a US investigation into improper use of these visas, even if the company didn't publicly admit to any wrongdoing. The company agreed to take steps to improve its internal processes and outside monitoring too. Infosys declined interview requests for this story.For India's outsourcing industry, trouble is on two fronts. First, immigration concerns (which are seemingly denting the image of companies more than its financials Infosys says higher visa costs will result in a 0.3% erosion in margins); and second, the essential but painful shift in strategy. With automation primed to eat into the Indian outsourcing industry's bread-and-butter business, companies are scrambling to reboot themselves, to focus on higher-value tasks.Industry observers admit that there are concerns on both fronts. ""US elections have always been a hot potato for the Indian outsourcing industry,"" says Avinash Vashistha, former chairman and MD of Accenture India and author of The Offshore Nation. ""Immigration, work visas and exports have always been an emotional leverage that US presidential candidates use to churn emotions.""While these statements have largely been described as election rhetoric by some observers, there could be some pain for the outsourcing industry soon.""We can expect certain restrictive measures as a result of constant lobbying over the years,"" says Vashistha, while arguing that the industry shouldn't make any hasty move because of statements by candidates. Vashistha should know this well. For four years, he helmed the India operations of Accenture, leading the growth in headcount from 50,000 to over 1,30,000, as the company made India its largest presence globally.""Indian companies have been hearing a lot of rhetoric around the immigration issue and visa... and as in the past the companies may end up having to recruit more locally and use sub-contractors more,"" says Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy & marketing officer for Tech Mahindra, India's fifth largest software exporter. ""The only concerns we see are procurement fees and the complexities and cost attached to hiring attorneys (to manage any legal action around this subject). That will remain a painful area for our industry unless the government intervenes.""Mitra contends that proposed legislations to cap short-term H-1B visa numbers would be counter-productive. ""A legislation to cut down the number of H-1B visas by 15,000 and proposing a priority parameter for the highest wage-earner will be counterproductive for the growth of the US technology industry,"" he adds. ""American policy has compensated for the shortage of skilled workers in the country with a carefully calibrated approach that balances immigration with various measures to encourage STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) education and training for Americans.""For companies like Accenture and its peers, the big challenge is decoding what Trump and his rivals mean with their statements on immigration. For example, the billionaire candidate went, in just six months, from being a staunch opponent of outsourcing (and the claimed job losses as a result) to offering to fly in skilled labour to the US.""Trying to understand Trump seems to be a national pastime in the US and no one knows what he really stands for,"" says Peter Bendor-Samuel, chief executive of outsourcing advisory Everest Group. ""There is clearly a growing streak of populism in today's US politics, with both Republican and Democratic parties talking about reexamining long-held assumptions around trade.""As candidates  and the future president among them  reexamine these trade norms, rules around visas and immigration could be tightened. ""What could happen is that visa laws may be changed to make H1-Bs and L1s (temporary work visas that allow American firms to hire foreign workers) more difficult and expensive to get... this would affect the profitability of the Indian firms but not stop their progress,"" adds Bendor-Samuel.What the Trump-led hysteria over immigration and job losses could do is worsen the anti-India sentiment, say experts. ""What Trump has done is to make racism and xenophobia socially acceptable. He is whipping up anti-immigrant, religious, and nationalistic hysteria... this is having a negative effect on businesses and will hurt India,"" says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at the Arthur & Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance, Stanford University. ""Things have changed for the worse in America because of this election campaign and Trump. There will be scars long after the elections are over and the popular sentiment will be anti-Indian IT,"" adds Wadhwa.While he contends that Trump has little chance of being elected US president, it is the anti-foreigner, antitrade hysteria that he is whipping up that is harmful. ""He is saying whatever the least educated and most ignorant people in the electorate want to hear,"" adds Wadhwa. ""Trump is a ruthless businessman himself  he does whatever he has to minimise costs and has outsourced projects himself.""Outsourcing veterans such as Raman Roy, who sold his BPO venture Spectramind to Wipro in July 2002 and then founded Quatrro, think that outsourcing has gone too mainstream for the industry to be impacted heavily. ""In IT and BPO, close to a million people would be working out of the US today,"" says Roy. ""Offshoring and outsourcing are a part of life now, they are part of the American DNA. You can rave and rant, shout and make noises, but you can't wish them away.""Despite Trump's anti-trade tirade, Roy reckons that it is premature to be bothered by his over-the-top statements. ""Rhetoric is one thing, reality is another. After all, when they offshore, it is making American companies more profitable,"" he adds. ""It's not like 'India is a poor country, so let's give 5,000 jobs to India'. It doesn't work that way."" Agreeing with Wadhwa on Trump's doublespeak, Roy argues that eventually companies  and not the government  will take a call on jobs.Wadhwa on Trump's doublespeak, Roy argues that eventually companies  and not the government  will take a call on jobs.According to Shivendra Singh, Nasscom's VP for global trade, India's outsourcers make a huge positive impact in making many American corporations globally competitive. ""Low cost is not the rationale for bringing in employees,"" Singh says.""There is a severe shortage of STEM talent in the US  the country's own labour department said there were 3.4 million unfulfilled jobs in this field.""Despite these contentions, India's outsourcers are hit hard, with ""50:50 companies"" (which have over 50 employees and at least half of them on H-1B visas in the US), paying a higher visa fee, under the Omnibus Appropriation Act. ""We protest these moves and have even raised these anti-competitive measures with the WTO,"" says Singh.Away from the immigration hullabaloo, India's outsourcers are also trying to recast their businesses in these challenging times  and the rejig couldn't come any sooner. ""The Indian industry needs to transform itself before it is too late,"" says Wadhwa. ""It is in serious trouble.""Others such as Everest's Bendor-Samuel ascribe this struggle to advances in service delivery automation (SDA), which makes labour arbitrage less important and the ability to embrace new technologies and ways of doing business vital. ""It is highly unlikely that Trump or (Bernie) Sanders' populism will affect the Indian industry,"" he argues. ""But when combined with the industry disruption being driven by SDA, it is likely that the industry is going to change over the next few years.""Companies are already racing to keep pace with these changes. Mitra of Tech Mahindra says his company is focusing on implementation of non-linear initiatives using automation and software platforms, by enabling its clients to digitise their processes and by incubating disruptive solutions internally and by partnering with startups externally.In-house, Tech Mahindra works with a dozen ""startups"" and has a couple of partners outside to try and devise breakthrough technology solutions for customers and the firm even has a start-up garage to incubate out-of-the-box thinking by employees.Former Accenture India chief Vashistha thinks this recast  and the growing noise over visas and immigration -- is a good opportunity for the industry to overhaul itself. ""The digital transformation is increasing the demand for cloud-based services; driving consumers, services and businesses towards mobility; making businesses and consumers more connected through social media; and throwing a plethora of data that can provide very valuable insights,"" he says. ""Yes, it is time for innovation to boost growth.""(Additional reporting by Indulekha Aravind, G Seetharaman, Ishani Duttagupta and Rajiv Singh)"

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe price of tomatoes has been dipping in Vellore, touching as low as Rs. 5 per kilo this week.After soaring to almost Rs. 80 per kg a few months ago, the price of tomatoes dropped to Rs. 20 and this week, it came down to Rs. 8 and then to Rs. 5. This is because of an increased supply due to the high yield in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.A major chunk of tomatoes that arrives at Vellore comes from Andhra Pradesh. The drop in prices might be good news for consumers, but it is not so for shopkeepers.Selling tomatoes at such low rates is not profitable for traders. As the supply is more, tomatoes are available everywhere. So, if it does not sell well, vendors end up selling the produce for cheaper rates, keeping in mind that it perishes quickly, he said.And, its not just tomatoes. The prices of most vegetables have come down, he said. The popular thorny brinjal, which is locally produced, is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while brinjal varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Ottanchatiram in Dindigul cost Rs. 6-7 this week.Onion costs Rs. 5 to Rs. 15 a kg, while potato costs Rs. 20 -Rs. 25.The cost of other vegetables is: ladiess finger (Rs. 10), beans (Rs. 15), carrot (Rs. 20-Rs. 30), avarakkai (Rs. 20), beetroot (Rs. 15), cabbage (Rs. 10-Rs. 15), peas (Rs. 50-Rs. 60), drumstick (Rs. 20), snake gourd (Rs. 15), bitter gourd (Rs. 20), radish (Rs. 15), ginger (Rs. 40 (new) and Rs. 60 (old)).

In the past 12 months, rates of tur dal and urad dal have almost doubled.On Wednesday, association members held a meeting aimed at controlling the retail prices. Currently, the retail price of tur dal is Rs 150 per kilogram which is affecting the pockets of common man. The association is planning to cut the prices by 15-20% for the consumers.Madhya Pradesh Pulses Association chairman Suresh Agrawal said, ""Skyrocketing prices of pulses in the retail market have forced us to enter into the retail sector. Those consumers who were buying 2 kg pulses per month are now buying only 250 grams. Unfavorable weather conditions have hit production drastically. Also, the supply of quality pulses from Burma has been less compared to the previous years. Consumers are now buying more of potatoes, okra and other comparatively cheaper vegetables which are affecting pulses market as well.""""Government should have taken steps to control the price. We are planning to sell two kilograms of pulses per head at a lower rate which would be affordable for a common man,"" Agrawal said.Recently, income tax department officials carried out search operation on the premises of city-based pulses traders and commodity brokerages.""Hoarding of stock is having an impact on the market. Speculations and manipulations in prices in the future market through National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) is affecting the trade,"" a senior official from income tax department said. Whole future trading and speculations is a combination of financial market and commodity market. Shortage of pulses, especially tur dal across major markets in the country has triggered these raids."

Potato can be exported to many countries if pest related issues are addressed and standard operating procedures are put in place.In a meeting held last week, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman discussed ways to increase potato exports and other related issues with Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh.""In the meeting, the Commerce Minister emphasised the need to identify pest-free zones for export of potatoes in the production clusters. Both ministries have decided to take further course of action soon on this issue,"" a senior government official told .The Commerce Ministry has suggested that concerned stakeholders such as Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Central Potato Research Institute, National Plan Protection Organisation (NPPO) and the state horticulture departments need to interact and prepare an action plan for identification of pest free zones for potato.That apart, it has also stressed on preparing the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for export of potatoes to various countries in order to address the quarantine pest concerns, the official added.It may be noted that though there is huge demand for Indian potatoes from Russia, the country has not been able to tap the export opportunities fully due to pest related issues.Identification of pest-free zones in producing areas will help export of quality commodity from India and avoid any rejection of consignments, the official said.India exported 1.80 lakh tonnes of potatoes in 2014-15 fiscal, which was lower than 3.05 lakh tonnes in the previous year, as per the government data.

Last year, when a group of homeopathy students from Malaysia and Iraq were in the city at the Shaad Homoeopathic Hospital and Research Centre for their residential training, an informal visit to a village in Umrer triggered an experiment in using homeopathy in agriculture.During the visit organized by Rotary Club of South East, the students happened to compare the size and quality of Bhiwapuri chillies at Manora village near Umrer, just for fun. Then, suddenly one of the students thought aloud whether homeopathy would work on plants. This led to the experiment to check the effect of homeopathic medicines in improving yield and quality of vegetable crops. The experiment got reasonably good results in six vegetables.""I had heard and read some basic literature about Vaikunthanath Das Kaviraj from Netherlands using homeopathy for agriculture diseases. Hence, when this idea came, I decided to give it a try. Agro-homeopathy is in its infancy. But I feel that in the days of organic farming, homeopathy could improve yield and minimize costs,"" said Dr Aadil Chimthanawala, who has published the team's findings in the National Academy of Homeopathy, India (NAHI) Times.The entire Chimthanawala family; Aadil's father Dr Kasim Chimthanawala, wife Dr Fatema Chimthanawala, and mother Dr Sagira Chimthanawala, was excited with the idea. They first experimented in the laboratory at Shaad Hospital in Itwari, and then replicated it in the fields and obtained good results there too.The father-son duo, Dr Kasim and Dr Adil, both are qualified allopaths but have been practicing homeopathy for decades, are very open to any scientific criticism or trials by others. ""We wish some agriculture scientists takes up the project and validates the findings. We are not agriculturists or even scientists. We wish the department of Ayush nominates some university or scientist to further the research,"" said Dr Kasim.The two doctors have always believed in scientific treatment of patients. Hence, they studied basic medicine (MBBS degree) to understand the functioning of the human body, the anatomy and physiology. Now, they want science to take its own course in establishing their findings and hence are not making any tall claims.The experiments included use of potentized doses of silicea (silica), sulphur, magnesium pros, phosphorous, calcarea carbonicum on methi or fenugreek, tomatoes, green chilli (capsicum annum), brinjal, French beans and spinach or palak respectively as liquid sprays. The experiments resulted in not just increase in yield of vegetables, but also bigger, thicker and greener leaves in the leafy vegetables.Dr Aadil doesn't hesitate in admitting that, for reasons unknown to him, homeopathic medicines didn't work in certain crops. ""We got very bad results with potato. They didn't germinate. But there is no harm in continuing the experiment further on other crops like grains and fruits etc. We would be happy if some agriculture scientists join us and guide us. At present, we have just tried to increase the yield but can try them for controlling diseases too,"" he said.Explaining some of the homeopathic medicines used, Dr Kasim Chimthanawala said in animals or humans use of silicea helps improve assimilating capacity of any substance or elements in the body of the person. For example, in human body it helps absorb calcium better.* Homeopathic medicines were either dissolved in water or applied to the plants or used as sprays* All experiments were conducted using non-manured soil* In fenugreek or methi, plants became stunted but their roots had much better grip in soil and leaves were greener and thicker* In chilli, use of magnesium pros couldn't produce any changes and could not control the leaf curl syndrome in plants* In French beans, medicine instilled enough immunity to survive rust disease with better yield"

But when it comes to Goa's range of desserts, the bebinca undoubtedly rules the roost. For those uninitiated in Goa's culinary traditions, the bebinca may be a simple looking layered dish, but in reality it is a huge complexity of flavours with a labour-intensive preparation process.While it is made up of ingredients that are almost always accessible in any Goan kitchen - coconut milk, egg yolks, sugar, white flour, ghee and a hint of nutmeg or vanilla essence for flavouring, the making of a bebinca, which is often referred to as the queen of Goan desserts, is a rather long and tedious process as it has to be cooked one layer at a time. Yes, the bebinca, whether you choose to make just one at a time or many, will take its maker anywhere between one and a half to two hours of hard work to prepare.Restaurateur and author of 'A day in the Goan Kitchen' Ivo Coutinho fondly recalls his mother preparing the bebinca using the traditional burning coconut husk method. ""The kind of smoky flavour that this imparts to the bebinca cannot be replicated in the ones prepared in ovens,"" he says. Another key difference between the two cooking methods is the texture of the end product. ""Earlier bebinca was prepared for festive occasions and consumed on the same day. Since preservation was not an issue, the ratio of flour used was much lower. This gave the sweet it a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture,"" he says.As for the layers , while tradition says seven layers, Coutinho says that this number can vary from four to 13. ""There is no hard and fast rule that it has to be a certain number of layers. It depends on the preference of thickness of each layer,"" he says.Yet another version of the dessert is made in Goa wherein the core ingredient is a universal favourite, the potato. The potato bebinca aka Bebinca de Batata, may not be as popular as it's seven-layered cousin, but those who've tasted it or who make it rave about the delicacy. One of them is Vasco-based Melissa Martins. While Martins prepares her version using regular cooking potatoes, she says that it can also be prepared using sweet potatoes.Elaborating on the differences between a regular bebinca and the potato bebinca, she says, ""The main difference is that while the former is cooked and in layers, the potato bebinca is baked and in one solid layer. Otherwise, like the regular bebinca, the potato version too is characterized by the richness of its taste. Also, for a potato bebinca, the boiled and mashed potato has to be mixed with the rest of the ingredients - coconut milk, sugar, flour, essence and a dash of colour - and once it forms a smooth consistency, it had to be cooked out for a bit to thicken the consistency, before it is poured into a lined tray and baked."""

This is a part of government strategy to create buffer stock through central agencies like Nafed under Price Stability Funds (PSF) to stabilise onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity of onions, which are expected for a period of three months from August to October.Speaking to TOI, a Nafed official said, ""Last year, we could procure only 2,500 tonnes of onions under PSF due to lack of storage capacity. This year, we increased the capacity of the existing storage centres, besides getting storage facilities on lease. We have decided to increase onion procurements under PSF gradually every year.""The official said, ""We have procured 4,500 tonnes of onions so far at three APMCs - Lasalgaon, Kalwan and Pimpalgaon.

Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium.

The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

On entering the tribal district, one can see multi-storied houses, lush green fields along with hotels, guest houses and home stays. The rapid growth in tourism has already sparked discussions on having a master plan for sustainable tourism. However, not many would know that some five decades back the snowbound district was deprived of even the most basic facilities, and that its people's fortune changed only after they took the cooperative route in the 1960s and worked together.At 2 persons per sq km, Lahaul and Spiti district has India's lowest population density. It has a population of 3.31 lakh for a geographical area of 13,833 sq kms. Though the district remains cut off from the rest of the world for six months in winter, people here have made rapid development and many of them not only own properties in the district but also in Kullu, Manali and other parts of country.Before the Centre thought of constructing a road to connect Manali with Lahaul and Spiti and then Ladakh, people used to walk over a 13,050-foot mountain pass to reach Manali. A Lahaul and Spiti-based historian, Chhering Dorje, said that before the 1962 war, Lahaul was deprived of road connectivity and people used to cross Rohtang Pass out of compulsion only, either for trade or for employment. ""In summer, it would take 3-4 days to travel between Lahaul and Manali. In winter, the journey wuld extend to 5-6 days and even more in case of bad weather,"" he said.Dorje said construction of the road from Manali to Ladakh started turning the wheels of development in the district. A former MLA from Lahaul-Spiti, BJP's Dr Ram Lal Markanda, said had people not taken the cooperative route, the valley would not have witnessed the prosperity visible today.""Seeds of development were sown on May 28, 1966, when Lahaul Potato Growers Co-operative Marketing cum Processing Society Limited (LPS) was formed with initial an membership of 20 growers, under the then Punjab State Cooperative Societies Act,"" he said. ""With passage of time, almost every house in Lahaul had a member in LPS. Their united efforts helped ensure better marketing of seed potato. This help fetch a good price for farmers.""At present, LPS is known for varied activities, ranging from basic necessities of people to secondary needs like supply of petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, and even procurement of agricultural and horticultural produce. After witnessing the success of LPS, Lahaul residents had formed another cooperative society to market hops.""Through the society, people had started selling their produce to beer-producing companies for a good price. But, later, farmers stopped producing hops and tuned towards sowing green pea and apple,"" said Premjeet Phurpa, a resident of Phura village in Lahaul.A retired block development officer, Balbir Singh Yarki, after seeing big hydro power companies showing interest in tapping the hydro power potential of Lahaul valley, had motivated the people to form a cooperative society to generate hydro power through their own projects. Today, residents of around 30 villages of Chandra Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district have scripted a new story of empowerment as around 850 members have become shareholders of the Chandra Valley Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society Limited, which has bagged a small hydro power project in the valley.Sonam Dolma of Shashin village and one of the shareholders in the society said the society was leap for Lahaul residents from producing potatoes and green peas to producing electiricity.

In their death throes, some of the canines who ate the poisoned bait apparently fell into the canal, and their bodies lay there  the prime source of water for the Government Medical College Hospital in Thrissur and households in the area.Complaint by dog-ownerSince stray dogs dying generally escape popular attention, the incident came to light only after four pet dogs died after chewing on the meat dumped along the canal side in the Gramala area in Mulankunnathukavu. One of the dog owners, C.K. Ravi, lodged a police complaint on May 31, in which he accused a Chinese potato farmer in the vicinity of setting the poisoned meat trap to get rid of stray dogs.A bigger concern stems from the fact that the putrid dog carcasses found on the canal bed could contaminate drinking water as it has just been released into the canal from the Peechi reservoir.It appears that several dogs were killed there in this manner, said Sally Kannan, honorary animal welfare officer of the Animal Welfare Board of India and outreach coordinator of the India chapter of Human Society International.Case registeredP.P. Joy, sub-inspector of the Thrissur Medical College station, said the police had registered a case under Sections pertaining to polluting water in a way that triggers contagious diseases, and causing general environmental pollution.The police are awaiting the post-mortem and chemical analysis reports to ascertain the cause of the dogs death, he said.Incident came to light when 4 pet dogs died after chewing on the meat strewn around"

Ahmedabad, where eating out is almost like a norm, can be easily described as a foodie's paradise. With newer cuisines and tastes now ruling the palate of global Gujaratis, even the traditional Gujarati thali has gone through a delectable tranformation. From Chinese samosas, manchurian, dal-bati, nachos , Punjabi to Bengali sweets to churma laddoo and more, the thali has embraced essential elements of a melting pot  combining both modern and traditional in a delicious spread. AT checks out the thali.""For the longest of time the Gujarati thali was all about, two sabzis (green vegetables and pulses) one potato sabzi, 1-2 farsan (savories), dal/kadhi , rice, assorted Indian bread basket (chapattis, biscuit bhakris, puris ) one sweet dish along with chutneys, salad, buttermilk and pickles,"" say food industry observers. ""The thali was a mix of various textures ranging from flat, coarse, crunchy blended with an array of varied tastes. While there are dining halls in the city that still serve the original thali , other places have started including non-Gujarati elements to please the changing food habits and palate of the people.""With many restaurants and even food wagons dishing out some delicious different cuisines, the market for food has expanded making it a tough place to survive. While there are many thali joints that have stayed true to their original menu, there are other places who have included different cuisines to maximize their profit.""One of the major reasons why the thali has undergone such an evolution is because the city is witnessing a cosmopolitan population. Along with people from other states, you also see foreigners travelling to Ahmedabad quite frequently. So the restaurants have started including items that these people can easily relate to along with enjoying some new tastes,"" says restaurateur Abhay Mangaldas.Praveen Purohit, city based restaurateur feels that items like mini idli, Mexican tacos , nachos, spring rolls et al are there to fulfill the demand. He says, ""Not only our guests come from different parts of the globe, they also have good knowledge about food and are open to try something different. So we make it a point to include a few items that suit their taste buds as well. Another major reason is that majority of people find the thali too sweet for their taste, be it dal/kadhi or even the sabzi. So, we started infusing elements that balance out their taste.""While the city's population is going multicultural, there are many new thali places that are coming up at newer and posher locations, says Dilip Thakkar, founder of one of the Gujarati thali dining halls in the city. ""Initially, dining halls and restaurants serving authentic Gujarati thali were restricted to areas like Ashram Road, Usmanpura, Navrangpura and certain areas in the walled city. But now these restaurants have expanded to newer areas. And infrastructural cost goes up when you expand your business to a more expensive locality. To break even, or to make profit, you need more attractive dishes, which then amounts to the addition of popular and exotic dishes.""I love to indulge in fusion food. I have also been to restaurants and dining halls, where there are lot of items that are not there in the traditional Gujarati thali. Although, I wouldn't mind indulging in such a fusion thali occasionally, I still prefer the authentic Gujarati thali that has all the elements of Gujarat.Eating out means trying out something different or maybe a different version of your favourite cuisine. I have had Gujarati thali that had starters like samosa and manchurain and I think this inclusion is great as foodies from various parts of the world can relate to such items. They can relish the authentic Gujarati tastes whilst still having something that they love to indulge in.I love gorging on the authentic Gujarati thali, as it has many different textures and tastes. Although I'm not fond of fusion food, I would prefer if varied varieties of the same dish that are made in different parts of Gujarat are included instead of including different dishes that are not even a part of the traditional thali."

This disclosure could become a political hot potato in the upcoming West Bengal polls.Documents belonging to the PMO on the Justice Mukherjee commission of inquiry mention that some files, including a proposal to keep Bose's ashes in a memorial at Delhi's Red Fort, were either not ""readily traceable"" or ""destroyed"". Most of the files are likely to have been destroyed in the 60s and 70s, one file noting points out.The commission had sought photocopies of orders regarding destruction of filesdocuments concerning Netaji as also photocopies of the lists of files documents destroyed.The PMO had informed the commission that ""one file no. 12(226)56-PM has been destroyed on 6.3.1972; certain documents of file no. 23(156)51-PM have been destroyed while recording that file; and one file no. 2(381)60-66PM (proposal to bring Shri Subhas Chandra Bose's ashes from Tokyo to put up a memorial to him in front of the Red Fort in Delhi) is not readily tracea ble in our records"". It is not immediate ly clear why these documents were de stroyed or what their exact contents were, though there have been reports that Bose's death in the 1945 aircrash was a smokescreen allowing him to es cape to the then USSR.Author Anuj Dhar, who has done ex tensive research on Netaji, said, ""I hate to draw this parallel, but just as the gov ernment is making an inquiry into missing correspondence concerning the Ishrat Jahan case, they should find out how documents of historical im portance were destroyed by Congress governments. Under which rule of the official manual was a file concerning Subhas Bose's death destroyed in 1972 when the matter was under investiga tion by a judicial commission?"" The 50 files declassified on Tuesday include 10 from the PMO, 10 from MHA and 30 from MEA, and pertain to the period 1956-2009. The declassification of files on Netaji was started on his 119th birth anniversary, January 23, this year, when PM Modi released the firs lot of 100 files."

Photos: Special ArrangementSixty-five-year-old Chandre Gowda of Adavi Bantenahalli in Salagame Hobli of Hassan taluk has been in distress for the last two weeks.The Forest Department took over the four-acre land that he and his family tilled for the last six decades.Chandre Gowda and his wife Vimalamma criticised the department arguing that they lost the land despite possessing documents to claim it as their own.Assistant Conservator of Forests Ravindra Kumar and his staff took over 10 acres of land, including four acres reportedly belonging to Chandre Gowda on June 15.The officials dug trenches to identify the boundaries and did plantation on the same day. Chandre Gowda and his family members argued, requested the officers but to no avail.Chandre Gowdas father Range Gowda began tilling the four-acre land in Survey No 74/3 in Sigegudda Kaval decades ago.Chandre Gowda continued with this and applied for grant of the same land in 1990s as per the Karnataka Land Reforms Act. After all mandatory procedures, the land was granted to me on February 17, 2001, said Chandre Gowda, who has a copy of land grant certificate, signed by Lakke Gowda, then tahsildar of Hassan. He continued to grow potato, jowar and other crops in the land, till 2007, when the Forest Department issued a notice.Chandre Gowda moved the local court and succeeded to get an order in his favour, restricting the Forest Department from interfering in his land.The department moved the District and Sessions Court and got the order setting aside the lower courts order on April 25, this year.Mr. Ravindra Kumar told The Hindu , The land in Survey No 74/3 belongs to Sigegudda Kaval forest. Forget tahsildar, nobody in the State government has the authority to grant it for the non-forest purposes. Granting of the land itself was against the norms. Today, the farmers family is at loss, because of the Revenue Department.In fact, the forest officer has written to the tahsildar of Hassan seeking names of the village accountant, revenue inspector and others responsible for grant of forest land to the villagers. Those granted forest land for agriculture purposes should be held responsible for the loss caused, the officer maintained."

Now, the 86-year-old is back in the city she was born taking the community count up by one. And, she has taken upon herself the onerous task of keeping the authentic Jewish flavours alive for her nine-member strong community. Yes, you read it right: nine.Demographers put the strength of the Jewish community in the city at less than 20, but the members are rather strict about who they call ""pure"". Those that have married ""outside"" the community are strictly not ""pure"" Jews.""I have come back to the city because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most...but I am keeping the flame alive,"" she says.Silliman also happens to be among the last keepers of the community's ancient recipes and has decided to chronicle the unique tastes for posterity.""Even the food that Jews here have today is not what we are permitted by our religion. There's so much of mix and match that most of the authentic cuisine that is over 5,000 years old and has its roots in the Middle East, is lost. I am trying to keep the tradition alive by documenting the recipes and rustling up dishes for feasts,"" says Silliman.Jewish food is special because Jews just can't eat cause Jews just can't eat anything and everything, Silliman says. Their food -kosher -has to abide by strict dietary laws which not only lay down what is forbidden but also the process of cooking, the ingredients and the kitchen specifications. Kosher, for example, does not permit meat to be mixed with milk or milk products.So, neither can you mix the two while cooking, nor can you consume milk or milk products after having meat. Flower Silliman says: ""Judaism has a great similari ty with Hinduism so far as its antiquity and dietary specifications go. It's another matter that most followers of both religions have drifted away from these guidelines... perhaps because they have often found it difficult to cope with such restrictions. I am not saying this by way of criticism, but the fact is that cuisines, and even cultures, become extinct because of such interpolation.""A traditional sit-down Jewish feast on Friday night can ideally start with beet khatta with koobah (beet soup with chicken or vegetable balls), followed by Jewish roast chicken, which is different from the European roast in the kind of marinades and spices used. ""The authentic Jewish roast will be far milder, both in flavour and sharpness, compared to the European roast,"" Silliman says.Kosher allows Jews to only have fish that have scales, and not those with shells (prawns, crabs or lobsters). ""So you have items like fish shoofta, which is minced fish skewers. Vegetable lovers have choices like vegetable mahashas, which is stuffed tomatoes and capsicum.But the magic is in the recipe for the stuffing. The authenticity of the dish is heightened when served with aloo makalla (a special potato fry), hulba (a sort of fenugreek, mint and coriander chutney) and cucum ber zalata. Another speciality is mutton or vegetable ingree -a layered meat dish baked with brinjals, tomatoes and potatoes -not unlike the Greek moussaka, but without dairy to keep within kosher limits,"" Silliman explains with the lucidity of an expert.And why not? While abroad, Silliman served as a souschef at the Plaza in Jerusalem and launched the world's only kosher Jewish restaurant, Maharaja. She taught cooking and ran masterchef shows in US and London and authored two books. ""I have come back to Kolkata because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most... but I am keeping the flame alive."""

The Centre announced that it is looking at importing pulses from Myanmar as India stares at a huge gap between demand and domestic availability. ""If the private players are not importing enough, then we have to take the necessary steps to reduce the gap,"" food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.In 2015-16 crop year, production of pulses is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes while demand is pegged at 23.5mt. Even after imports by private firms, the country is staring at shortage of about 18 lakh tonnes.Soaring food prices, particularly pulses, vegetables and dairy products, has been the key driver of both retail and wholesale price inflation.Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 5.8% in May from previous month's 5.5% increase. The food price index jumped 7.6% in May from April's 6.4% year-on-year increase.The increase was led by a surge in price of pulses and products, which shot up 31.6% in May while sugar and confectionery prices rose 14% year-on-year.Prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish also firmed up, exerting pressure on overall numbers.Prices of vegetables jumped 10.8% year-on-year in May .""The three steps decided at the meet will be taken immediately. Though price of pulses is comparatively little less than last year, we are taking necessary steps. States must also do their bit, put their demand to get pulses from the central buffer stock,"" Paswan said.He said the Centre is ready to provide unmilled pulses at subsidised rate to states and they must sell the processed dal at not more than Rs 120 per kilogram. In recent weeks, prices of arhar and urad have touched Rs 170 and Rs 196 per kg respectively . The food minister said that prices of no other food item was discussed at Tuesday's meeting.""Prices of tomato and other vegetable increase for a few months because of seasonal issues. But we must understand that the prices differ from place to place and that can only be addressed when we have common agriculture market enabling farmers to sell their produce according to their choice,"" Paswan said.In fact, prices of tomatoes across the country showed wide variation with 1 kg tomatoes costing between Rs 20 and Rs 80. In cities including Kota, Nasik, Gwalior, Ludhiana, Meerut and Bhopal, tomatoes were retailing between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg and in Surat and Thiruvananthapuram 1kg tomato cost Rs 80. In the case of potatoes, while the average price was Rs 15 and maximum Rs 35 a kg, the key kitchen item was selling at less than Rs 10 in Nashik and Indore.Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre for ""unprecedented"" inflation, saying there was ""highest-ever surge in food prices"" while the Modi dispensation was busy spending crores of public money on its second anniversary bash. Party spokesman Ajay Maken said food inflation at 7.55% in May had hit a 21-month high."

But strangely enough, in the case of Santa Banta Pvt Ltd, it isn't the state government but the theatre owners in Delhi who have chosen to take note of the protests by some groups. After the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) claimed that the film pokes fun at the Sikh community, most Delhi cinemas have decided not to screen the film, fearing protestors.Owing to the threats of protests and petitions by some Sikh groups, the film comes with a huge disclaimer that its characters are fictitious and bear no resemblance to anyone in reality. You can, however, read the disclaimer only if you are able to watch the movie. Anticipating protests, most Delhi cinemas have scrapped shows of the movie. Only a few single screen theatres are going ahead with their shows discreetly - you won't be able to book their tickets online as they are not publishing their showtimes online. However, the film is being screened in all other parts of NCR - Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Faridabad. Therefore, clearly, the UP and Haryana governments do not foresee a law and order problem, neither do the theatres in the states.READ ALSO: ` Santa Banta' screenings halted by Sikh groups A multiplex owner, declining to come on record, says the film was not released to avoid any untoward situation. He tells us, ""Some members of the community have been protesting before the release of this film, they did not have any clue what was going to be in the film. If they are already attacking the film before the release, what will happen when we release it? Delhi is the only place of controversy in this case. The film is showing in theatres in Punjab and Chandigarh without any protests.""When asked who decided to not screen the film in the theaters, another cinema owner tells us, ""It's a mutual decision taken by distributors and cinema owners to not show the film in Delhi. All the multiplexes in Delhi, including PVR, Wave and DT Cinemas are not showing the movie. A few single screen theatres decided to screen it, but had to take it off."" Officials at M2K Rohini and Pitampura say that the movie was being taken off due to pressure from Sikh organisations. Another single screen theatre, Abhishek cinema in Chandni Chowk, cancelled its shows. When contacted, the cinemas refused to comment.A cinema owner who is screening the film in his NCR theatres, but not in Delhi, told us, ""We could have taken the risk to show the film in Delhi too, but it's not worth it. The film doesn't seem promising enough for us to take the risk. And we already have big-budget films running in the cinemas, why divide the screens for no profit and more panga?"" Tinku Singh, chief strategy officer and group president of SRS Cinemas, agrees, ""We don't have a cinema hall in Delhi, but we have released Santa Banta Pvt Ltd in Faridabad and Ghaziabad and even in our theatres in Punjab, but on the first day, the occupancy was only 8%, while in a few other cinemas of SRS it was only 1-2%.""Even though the cinema hall owners and distributors had mutually decided that they will not hold screenings of Santa Banta Pvt Ltd in Delhi, there were some religious and political groups who tried to take advantage of the situation and protested outside some cinema halls in the city. On Friday morning, messages were circulated saying that some Sikh groups will be protesting outside various cinema halls in South, North, West and East Delhi. According to police officials, the protesters were claiming that it was because of their threat that the film was withdrawn from the theatres. Pushpendra Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (West), told us, ""The theatres had decided not to screen the film on Thursday evening, but there were some protesters outside Pacific Mall (Subhash Nagar). It was a symbolic protest and they wanted to take the credit for the film not being screened. The protest was a peaceful one and in fact, they asked us to allow them to click pictures while they were protesting. We told them, 'When the film is not being screened, what is the protest for?' We had assured the theatres that there wouldn't be any issue if they screen the film but they decided not to have any screenings. In fact, there wasn't any pressure on the halls and they hadn't received any threat from any groups. But they thought that there might be issues and as a precautionary measure, they didn't screen the film at all.""Mandeep Singh Randhawa, deputy commissioner of police (South East), told us, ""There were some protests outside Satyam Cineplex, but we were informed by the cinema halls on Thursday evening that the film had been withdrawn. The protest went off peacefully."""

Traders blame poor supply and the holy month of Ramzan for the sudden hike in prices. Onion is the only commodity which isn't bringing tears to consumers with it being priced Rs 16 per kg.Tomatoes are priced at Rs 65 to Rs 75, beans at Rs 80 to Rs 125, lady's finger Rs 60, cabbage Rs 40 and potatoes Rs 26 to Rs 31. Merchants say excessive rain damaging crops in some parts and dry spell in other parts is the reason behind this price hike.Central Market merchant David D'Souza says: The prices of many vegetables have gone up though not many functions are happening due to excessive rains in Chikkamagaluru which has resulted in crop loss.The price of tomato which was Rs 40 per kg last month has gone up to Rs 65 to Rs 75 in the retail outlets.The price of beans varies across retail and super markets. While the wholesale rate of beans are at Rs 80, its retailing at Rs 90 to Rs 125 depending upon the place from where the beans are purchased.Hoteliers are also a worried lot. ""We don't have any other option than to accept it like we do when there is a seasonal variation,'' a hotelier averred. Homemaker Sunitha from Valencia said, ""Looking at the prices of vegetables and fruits I now buy them in small quantities. Though it means that I have to visit the stores twice or thrice a week, but it does not pinch that much when small quantities are consumed without getting wasted.Fruits have seen a significant rise in prices by at least 25%. Washington red apples retailing at Rs 150 per kg last week is now selling at Rs 200 a kg. Bananas too are pricey.

Every day since 2005, she has been setting aside Rs 5 out of her earnings from selling vegetables to buy books. By now, she has an enviable collection of 900 books and thousands of newspaper supplements, all bought from her hard-earned money.""I was in Std V when I read the entire collection of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule's writings. It changed my life. I had to leave school after Std IX to look after my siblings in our 20-member joint family. But my parents, who were illiterate, encouraged me to continue reading,"" Babytai says. She was the first woman in the family who could read.In April 1993, Babytai married arts graduate Anil Gaikwad from a village in Pathardi taluka. Within a year, husband and wife had to migrate to Ahmednagar because of the severe drought. ""My husband got a job in a factory, but the salary was meagre. I started selling vegetables near the school where I had enrolled my four-year-old daughter, Ashwini. In 2005, my husband lost his job as the factory closed down and we were literally on the streets. It was then that we set up this vegetable business,"" she says.Babytai's husband used to give her Rs 10 to buy biscuits for Ashwini and son, Gaurav. ""I used to buy only one packet and spend Rs 5 on buying two newspapers. Soon, I started saving Rs 5 every day to buy books. During Diwali, I would tell my husband to buy me books instead of a new sari,"" she recalls with a smile.The first three books she bought were 'Krishnakath', an autobiography of Yashwantrao Chavan, 'Agnipankh' (the Marathi translation of Wings of Fire by A P J Abdul Kalam) and 'Aai Samjoon Ghetana' by Uttam Kamble.Soon, Babytai started telling women customers, her daughter's friends and even the farm labourers who came to shop for vegetables to read books. ""I started lending them my books. I now ensure that each book is read by at least 10 people before it comes back to me. I tell them that books can change one's life. They have taught me to never give up hope and fight against adversities. In fact, I now plan to approach drought-affected farmers with the same message. I want to tell them not to commit suicide,"" Babytai says. She has also started spreading the word about various government schemes for the poor.Another turning point came in 2012, when she read about the work of reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. ""That year, I invited only widows for my Sankranti 'haldi kumkum' ceremony (tradtionally, a get-together for married women) and gifted them books. There was a tremendous backlash and my vegetable shop lost almost half its customers. As a protest, I stopped putting on the toe rings that every married woman is supposed to wear. Women taunted me, but I did not give up. It took me four years to turn them around. I recently resumed wearing the toe rings when I saw that society is now accepting widow remarriages,"" she reveals.Babytai set up Krantijyoti Mahila Sanstha and Swayamsiddha Foundation in 2000 and 2015 respectively to nurture the reading habit among rural women. ""Marathi language is so rich and beautiful. Unfortunately, many of us feel ashamed to speak in Marathi. I don't understand why children are taught to address their parents as mummy and daddy instead of 'Aai' and 'Baba'. Our love for Marathi is displayed only on Marathi Language Day. We need to change this,"" she adds.Babytai is often invited to schools and colleges to give lectures on books and the habit of reading. ""I tell them I am no PhD holder, but a simple vegetable seller. I tell them how books have helped me in life. And I always gift a book to the school or college before I leave,"" she says, adding that till date she has given 200 lectures.Last month, the state government presented the first Mangesh Padgaonkar State Award for nurturing Marathi language to Babytai.

Nashik caters to the vegetable supplies to Mumbai and the district is known as major onion producer.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman, Lasalgaon APMC said, ""The market remained closed today as traders and mathadi workers went on strike. The average daily turnover of Lasalgaon APMC is nearly Rs 3 crore, while that of all the district APMCs is around Rs 30 crore. We lost this business today.""Holkar added, ""Although the government delisted vegetables from APMCs, farmers will bring their produce to APMCs as there is no parallel system for farmers to sell their produce. In APMCs, there is an open auction and farmers get money immediately after the auction. Even grape-growers are seeking to start auction of grapes in Lasalgaon APMC. The farmers want guarantee rates to their commodities and emergence of APMCs was for the benefit of farmers. I don't know why the state government is taking such decision that will affect all farmers, mathadi workers and traders.""""There are 1,195 licensed traders, 205 commission agents and 105 mathadi workers at Nashik APMC.

Potatoes which were available at Rs16 a kg in the bulk market touched Rs22 on Tuesday as the agents planned a strike. Onions were up at Rs12-13 a kg as against Rs8-9 a kg. With this, the retail rates are expected to touch Rs30 and 20 per kg, respectively.The commission agents operating from Kalamana are on a strike from Wednesday against the government's move to end the monopoly of agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) run markets.Sheikh Ahmedbhai , the chairman of APMC said the management has received notice for a three-day strike. Though agents say they have planned an indefinite agitation, traders expect that the strike may not last beyond three days.Earlier, farm produce of all kind was supposed to be sold through the APMC market yard where business is dominated by the agents. They buy the stock from farmers and sell it in the trade channel. The APMC, on the other hand, is managed by a politically elected body. Jaiprakash Wasani , an agent dealing in onions and potatoes, said though agents in other APMC yards have already gone on a strike, those in Kalamana waited for three days so that the maximum number of farmers could sell their produce.A section of traders say that the strike itself will be a test of how APMCs' monopoly can be ended. There was no change in the rate of grains so far. As far as fruits and vegetables are concerned they can be traded even outside. Cotton Market where bulk dealers in vegetables operate will remain open. The major commodities available at Kalamana include onions, potatoes, fruits, vegetables and dry chilli.A chilli trader said even otherwise chilli trade takes place only on Mondays and Tuesdays. So a three-day strike from Wednesday will not make any difference.""The market is dominated by fruit traders. Now that the monopoly of APMC is over, the farmers may sell it directly to the consumer,"" the source said."

Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."

The agenda was also ignored such other centrally-sponsored schemes like Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan.Even as the state continues to be heavily dependent on central assistance to the tune of about 51%of its budget, there has not been appreciable growth in its own revenue collection, which ironically has come down to around 14 per cent in the last six years from nearly 26 per cent earlier, strengthening critics' view of large-scale corruption in the administration. But the agenda has no plan to discuss the issue, let alone chalking out strategies to increase the revenue base or plugging of the loopholes.Panchayatiraj minister Arun Sahoo on the side lines of the conference told mediapersons that the government has set a target to construct around 15 lakh houses under different rural housing schemes in the next three years.He also said that the government has decided to set up model panchayats with modern facilities like Kalyan Mandaps, internet cafe and market complex in all the blocks.The minister said on the first day only two programmes, rural housing and model gram panchayat, were listed for discussion. Energy minister Pranab Prakash Das said the government is committed to provide power for all by 2019.The BJP and Congress mounted attacks on the government saying that the collectors' conference had been organised to warm up officials to work for BJD's victory in the panchayat elections. ""In an important meeting of collectors schemes that really address the core livelihood problems of the people should be taken up for discussion. But the government has political agenda in mind,"" BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said. Rural development minister Badri Narayan Patra rubbished the allegations. ""Panchayat poll is six months away from now. So, there was no basis on the opposition allegations,"" he said."

They found that sedentary behaviour increases in children in this period.The scientists considered sedentary behavior as the time spent sitting or lying down and using low amounts of energy.Girls were found to become more sedentary than boys, found the researchers. The study's author Dr Xanne Janssen said children who regularly went to sports clubs were more likely to be active.""While some of the factors, such as season and gender, aren't modifiable in themselves, interventions could help deal with sedentary behaviour. This could include providing children with more opportunities to attend sports clubs, particularly in winter, or encouraging them to break up their sedentary behaviour more often - this doesn't have to be a big increase in activity but can simply be walking or standing up and moving around,'' she said."
58f5da99a3d24b0b70c25676,The Paraphoniks’ sonic accidents,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/The-Paraphoniks%E2%80%99-sonic-accidents/article14618985.ece,2016-09-02,,The Hindu,"The Paraphoniks have, in a sense, a meat-and-potatoes approach to their music. Even before the musical ideas or direction materialise, there is a commitment to the physical sounds driving the music. Its obsessive in a way. Of course, it helps that the Mumbai-based electronic duo  23-year-old Shatrunjai Dewan and 24-year-old Siddhant Shirodkar  is proficient with modular synthesisers (virtual and physical ones that allow for analogue manipulation of sound using different modules present in them). It could start from scratch, with a simple sine wave, says Dewan explaining their work. You then shape that sound into, say, a percussion or a drumline or a bassline.Setting up shopThey have an intimidating analogue live-set up, consisting of said modular synths, which will be displayed in all its glory on Friday night at the launch gig for their new five-track EP, Yarns (which released on August 31). Its the second Paraphoniks release, following last years full-length, Handwired , although its the first collective release by this particular incarnation of the band.Theres already considerable novelty in their use of hardware to perform live over the far more common set-up that producers tend to have. This is usually a digital audio workstation that runs through a laptop along with maybe a MIDI controller to trigger sounds and bring in a live component as well. But on top of that, this gig will feature 8.1 surround sound, an experience not often associated with live gigs. For most of us, surround sound is something we know of vaguely, thanks to those Dolby ads in movie theatres and the existence of home theatre systems.Setting it up involves eight different speakers, each of which can be wired to circulate different sound in the mix. Normally, the sound system at a venue (the public address system, or the PA) will have a stereo output, which means you can control what you hear on the left and the right channels. Here, instead of the usual two, there could be eight different sounds hitting the listener from different locations: patches and melodies slithering, forming circles, jumping out from different parts of the room, disappearing and reappearing. You can literally take a sound and move it around in a space, says Dewan. Take, like, a vocal melody in your track and you can just spread it around the audience. Weve spent a lot of time figuring this whole thing out. It may even become a regular feature at their gigs if the experiment works out.Crafting soundscapesBut while its easy to get lost in the novelty of these formal experiments  the nerd quotient of sound, as we discuss  the duo wants to use these elements in service of the music. I certainly get the nerdy component to modular synths, says Shirodkar. But I wouldnt fetishise it. The more you get into it, the more sonic accidents you find. You could be using these things for decades and still be nave, like a child. It can also be frustrating and intimidating, especially in a live setting where things can go wrong, but its a person-to-person thing.Dewan adds, It directs you creatively. You get that unique character and sound out of them, which keeps the inspiration going. Its like working on a blank canvas, with no predetermined direction. Its an exciting process. They build atop that original sound, crafting new sounds around it, complementing whatevers been laid out.The writing and recording process of Yarns had an urgency to it, where the two would move on from ideas if they felt they werent working. Calling himself and Shirodkar musicians before producers, Dewan plays the keys while his band mate plays the guitar and the piano. Dewan talks of how theyd lay down an arrangement and improvise on top of it to direct the song. We kind of just follow our instincts more than anything. Very little thought is given to what we want the end result to be; it happens more in the moment. The live set-up also features the two of them playing the guitar and keys, as well as taking turns singing. That said, this release has very few vocals, developing an instrumental sonic palette instead.Spinning YarnsThe EP has a quavering, almost unsteady quality to it. The songs, filled with distant, lulling synth melodies and blip-bloopy sounds set over rickety percussion, tread many different territories. The song-writing opens up multiple avenues, only for about-face departures, withdrawing before the threshold appears. A sense of dance-y urgency appears from time to time, but it stays for only as long as its creators find desirable, before a shift in tone. As on Polymath, where the vocals (with a sprinkling of the vocoder on them), take the song elsewhere. Echoing that wandering sensibility, Shirodkar isnt too keen to label the music too strictly, calling it cross-genre. Further, theyve written some more music to complement the five songs on Yarns for their live shows, which they will debut this evening.Dewan had originally started Paraphoniks with Aman Nath, a result of the two of them just messing around with synths and writing a whole library of music in a matter of two months. So they thought, Might as well start a band. Shirodkars entry into the fray was, again, almost incidental. He was in attendance at a gig that the original duo was playing at Boveda Bistro in Andheri West. Impressed with their live handling of the gear and the music, he got talking with Dewan and the two decided to jam. We had great chemistry; we were coming up with some cool stuff, says Shirodkar. Nath had to leave the band because of other commitments, and Shirodkar then took his place.Theyre both full-time musicians. In addition to the Paraphoniks, Dewan does live sound engineering often, and has a solo project (Monophonik), while Shirodkar writes music for ads from time to time. They will be promoting the EP with a four-city tour that kicks off in Mumbai. They want to continue playing live for a while, maybe hit the festival circuit, after which they intend to start work on a new EP.The author is a freelance writerYarns is available on paraphoniks.bandcamp.com. Paraphoniks will perform this evening at Antisocial in Khar at 9.30 p.m. onwards."

The north corporation, which owns the Civic Centre, had given the space for a monthly charge of Re.1.After councillors raised concerns that this deal may be causing the civic body financial loss, the Remunerative Projects (RP) Cell clarified that market rent of the space would have been Rs.6,32,082 per month. The rent was cut to a nominal amount as the cafe was offering food and beverages at subsidised rates to municipal employees, an official document of the RP Cell stated.Unsatisfied with the reason, former Mayor and BJPs Dev Nagar councillor Yogender Chandolia raised concerns at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Wednesday about the way the project was awarded to the private company running the cafe.We understand that a canteen will not get us Rs.6 lakh in rent. But, when the first tender was floated, there were companies willing to pay us Rs.1 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh in rent. Instead of negotiating with them, our officials picked someone else for Re.1 without following due process, Mr. Chandolia told The Hindu .According to the RP Cell, however, the earlier two bidders were rejected as they did not have the required technical capabilities. As per the RP cell, the present contractor was the only one that responded when the corporation advertised the project on its website on March 23, 2015.BJPs Rajendra Nagar councillor Rajesh Bhatia, who was the first to raise concern, said that other provisions of the agreement were also shocking.Extra goodiesWhat is more astounding is that the corporation has provided the company with inventory worth lakhs of rupees free of cost, said Mr. Bhatia.As per the agreement, the corporation gave refrigerators, boilers, burners, microwave ovens, a double tank fryer, a sandwich griller, a 10-kg capacity potato peeler and a 300-kg weighing scale to the cafe operator."
58f5dc6aa3d24b0b70c257fd,The low-carb debate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-low-carb-debate/article14986595.ece,2016-09-18,,The Hindu,"A few years ago, Dr. Richard Kahn, the now-retired chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organising a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes.When you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak, he said in a recent interview.Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss  and for weight loss, there is no magic diet.But people want diet advice, Dr. Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agricultures food pyramid.Why? Its a diet for all America, he said. It has lots of fruits and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat.That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Dr. Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Dr. Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss programme at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School.Carb restrictionThere is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts  or, according to Dr. Hallberg, severely restricts  carbohydrates.If the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan, she said in an e-mail. This would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method. She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a start-up developing nutrition-based medical interventions.But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that low-carbohydrate diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a low-carbohydrate diet  it can vary from doctor to doctor.There have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Richard Kahn. But, he said, the answer isnt so straightforward.In support of a diet like Dr. Hallbergs, there is one recent short-term study, by Dr. Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical centre where they ate carefully controlled diets. The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50 per cent with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.Since diabetes results when the body cant produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating very low carbohydrate diets, Dr. Hall said.Some longer-term studies, though, failed to show that low-carbohydrate diets benefited glucose control.Even if diets are effective in the short term, he said, the difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term.In the short term, the low-carbohydrate diet sometimes does better on glycaemic control, he said. But as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with long-term weight loss.Issue of overall healthAnother issue with low-carbohydrate diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.) Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, co-director of Columbia Universitys Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a benefit. In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks.But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss  the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term  there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates.Experts like Dr. David Nathan, director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes. But, he said, when we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight.What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Dr. Nathan said, is how much weight you lose.

Apart from whole sale traders in the Gandhi Market, a large number of vendors had set up at every lane and by-lane in various parts of the city.The produce cultivated in Tirukattupalli was much sought-after among members of the public, though it is a bit dearer.R. Murugan, a vendor at Khajapet in Sangiliyandapuram, said he had invested Rs. 24,000-Rs. 21,000 towards the cane and Rs. 3,000 for expenditure for transit by carriage van from Tirukattupalli to the city to purchase 1,000 canes. Thus my investment on a single cane is Rs. 24 and I sell it for Rs. 30, he says.As compared to last years rates, the price had shot up by Rs. 10 a cane. Mr. Murugan says the rise in price was because of inclusion of sugarcane as one of the Pongal gift in the State governments package.Another dealer from Iluppur C. Vendan says he had to invest Rs. 16,000 this year against Rs. 10,000 last year to buy the sugarcane. He had brought the cane from Andakulam in Pudukottai district and has set up his sales units in four centres in the city.The sudden spurt in the price has come as a shock for the customers who make a hard bargain, he said.Stiff competitionBoth Mr. Murugan and Mr. Vendan say they face stiff competition from the new entrants. I have utilised my experience in selling eateries near a school, for marketing the sugarcane, he says.Traders say although the sale would continue for three more days, it was during the Bhogi and Pongal festival they can realise maximum sales.The prices of vegetables shot up by 20 to 30 per cent over the usual rates. Traders said that bulk and simultaneous demand for horticultural crops particularly vegetables and flowers would register an increase with the dawn of Thai month.

Taken in by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), the siblings' parents said they would come back for them, but never did.The duo was then sent to the care of Annapoorna Charitable Trust in Jnana Ganga Nagar where they were nurtured and educated.

Under the revised norms, companies with ""cutting edge"" technology would be exempted from the 30% domestic sourcing norm for three years before getting up to five years to meet the requirement.Similarly, Das told TOI, food retailers would automatically invest in creating back-end infrastructure and local processing and supply chain although the government had not mandated any norms while allowing 100% FDI. ""No one is going to import potatoes from Australia but retailers will work with farmers to make their business model viable. It will happen automatically. I expect a strong interest from foreign companies,"" Das said. Food retailers have to mandatorily sell only food which is produced, processed or manufactured in India. The food processing ministry was insisting on mandating investment in back-end infrastructure as one of the conditions for the entry of overseas retailers. Das said that the opening up of this segment of the retail business would help stabilize prices to some extent.Expanding on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement of India being the ""most open"" investment destination, Das said that even some of the advanced countries did not allow 100% FDI in sectors such as airlines.Further, he said that domestic players did not have to fear foreign competition as they were robust enough to take them on globally. ""The entry of global food chains has helped our home-grown brands prosper because they have modernised, adapted to competition and improved quality.""Asked about the government's decision to do away with the need for government approval in several cases  from acquisition up to 74% in existing pharma companies to 100% for DTH services and brownfield airports  the economic affairs secretary said the move was part of the exercise to do away with human interface and make it process-driven. He said that nearly 95% of the FDI proposals would not require government approval, as against 90-91% at present. ""Once the budget-related proposals for non-banking finance companies are implemented, FIPB's work load will reduce further,"" he said. The government is looking to do away with the need for government permission for all NBFC activities that are regulated by various regulators."

The 22-year-old, an MA student at Delhi University , will be the first blind athlete to represent India in the Paralympics - an achievement that's been 30 years in the making. The Blind Relief Association will see him off on August 31, when he leaves for the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. If he qualifies in the heats, he will compete in the 1,500 metre final on September 13.Dhama, a St Stephen's College graduate, has a personal best of in 4:17 minutes over the distance, which he recorded at Sonepat last July. He hopes to shave five seconds off that in Rio. ""If it's a very slow race, I don't mind leading. But if it's only slightly slow, I'll pick up pace in the last 200 metres,"" says Dhama of how he is approaching the race. However, he and his coach will finalise the strategy only at Rio.For the blind, middle-distance running is a team sport. Vipin Kumar , a 20 year-old Nagpur University student, will keep Dhama on track - tied literally to him with a rope. No pushing or dragging is allowed. A high level of coordination is necessary, says coach Satyapal Singh , a Dronacharya Award winner and teacher at Acharya Narendra Dev College. He explains, ""Four legs have to function as two and two pairs of arms as one. The slightest mismatch will lead to injuries.""Dhama acknowledges, ""You can't do anything without a guide."" Kumar, from a farming family in a village near Modinagar, met Dhama in 2011. They have run more races together than they care to count. ""To be a guide, I have to be 10 seconds faster than the runner. I compete independently and with him,"" says Kumar. His support extends beyond the track. He has helped Dhama find his feet at camps, stadiums, athlete housing and dining halls across the world. It's a huge responsibility, Kumar concedes, that is paid for in friendship.While living in Baghpat in UP, Dhama went completely blind over a week when he was around six years old. Once his family reconciled themselves to the reality that no surgery would resurrect his vision, he was sent to JPM Senior Secondary School for the Blind on Lodhi Road in the capital. Dhama thrived on the school's strong sporting culture, and started competing internationally. It was a start that culminated in two bronzes and a silver at the Asian Para Games in 2014. He qualified for the Paralympics at the Asia-Oceania Championships in Dubai in March.""It has taken 30 years to get here,"" says KC Pande, vice-chairman of the Indian Blind Sports Association . ""We began organising sports meet when sport for the blind meant three-legged and potato-races."" The association tightened its participation policies and in 1998, became a member of International Blind Sports Association, adopting global norms and standards."

Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce.

Last month, inflation as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) was at 0.34 per cent, its first gain in 18 months, according to data released by the Centre.The acceleration in WPI, coming as it does after a quickening of retail inflation in the same month, makes it even more unlikely that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates shortly, according to economists.Retail syncThe WPI rose due to food inflation which shot up to 7.9 per cent from 4.2 per cent in April. The same trend could be seen in retail inflation as well where only the food category accelerated inflation.Inflation at the wholesale level rose in sync with trends witnessed in the retail print, Richa Gupta, Senior Economist, Deloitte said.Food continued to push the headline print higher while the effect of rising global commodity prices was also larger in the index due to its close correlation with domestic prices. Vegetable prices rose to take inflation in the category into double digits with potato prices rising by 21.54 per cent, Ms.Gupta said.Within the primary articles basket, while food inflation accelerated, non-food inflation eased considerably in May to 4.5 per cent from 7.1 per cent in April.Supply side responsePolicymakers need to check and address through supply-side responses, the continuous rise in prices of commodities like pulses, food articles, cereals, wheat and other items of national interest , said D.S. Rawat, Secretary General, The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, India.The fuel and power segment in the WPI contracted 6.1 per cent in May compared to a contraction of 4.8 per cent in April. This was led bythe mineral oil segment, which contracted 9.6 per cent in May compared to a contraction of 7.9 per cent in the earlier month.Manufactured goodsInflation in manufactured goods rose marginally to 0.9 per cent in May from 0.7 per cent in April.Manufacturing inflation is unlikely to be a cause of concern as weak demand across the globe is likely to keep prices subdued, Ms Gupta said.Mr.Rawat said the WPI figures may give some relief to manufacturers and producers since earlier it was hampering their pricing power, profitability and limiting their potential to increase capital expenditure.Worrying trendOverall, the view is that rising inflation coupled with poor industrial growth is a worrying trend. The declining trend in index of industrial production (IIP) and rising WPI may have a negative impact on the countrys economy in the long run, Mr. Rawat said.Overall, the view is that rising inflation coupled with poor industrial growth is a worrying trend"

Located at the lowest deck in the ship, the fourth class was meant for soldiers and poor labourers who could not afford the higher compartments. Rationed food comprising boiled potatoes, millet, groundnuts and buns was served twice to the passengers. The man had just recovered from a fever and was troubled with occasional cough. He hailed from a wealthy family and could have easily afforded a comfortable cabin in ship. But he chose to travel in the fourth class as his trip was neither for business nor for pleasure.He was on a mission to learn about the functioning of the political and social movements of different nations and how these factors contribute to the socio-political and economic development of their respective societies.The man was none other than Periyar E V Ramasamy .On December 13, 1931, Periyar accompanied by S Ramanathan and Erode Ramu embarked on a ten-month visit to Europe. En route, he halted at Colombo for a few days and addressed several meetings there, talking mainly against superstition, caste and religion. He addressed the Adi Dravida Association much against the wishes of caste Hindus. In his speech he asserted that the empowerment of Adi Dravidas would be possible only when the entire community joined hands and fought against caste prejudices and atrocities.The next months went in visiting countries like Egypt, Greece, Turkey , Russia, Germany , England, Spain, France, Portugal and Russia. Reading the Communist Manifesto had sparked his interest in the Russians and Periyar was impressed with the functioning of the government in Russia. In June 1932, at Barnsley, England, he addressed a his toric gathering of 30,000 workers affiliated to the labour party in the presence of Geroge Lanbury , a social reformer who led the British Labour Party . Interestingly in his address, Periyar mockingly told the labour leader how contrary to their ideals in England, the British government meted out ill-treatment to the `labour-class' people in India. Periyar also visited the offices of the various communist fronts in Great Britain and met Shapurji Saklatvala, the first British Communist member of parliament. In Germany , Periyar visited various socialistic organisations and a nude society to understand their perspective of life.For Periyar, the primary motive behind the trip was to understand the functioning of other progressive movements in the world before setting out his own Self-Re spect Movement. On his return, he wrote articles on the political, social and economic scenario, administration and justice system of the countries he visited in his party organ `Kudi Arasu'.Earlier in 1929, Periyar had visited Malaysia at the invitation of friends who had shown keen interest in strengthening the Self-Respect Movement in the country .He sailed from Nagapattinam port on December 15. More than 50,000 people had received him at Penang port. In his address to people in several cities of Malaysia and Singapore, Periyar was vociferous in demanding people to discourage religion and religious practices and concentrate on economic growth instead. He appealed to the Malaysian Tamils not to return to India and instead become citizens of Malaysia.It was during this trip that Periyar started to grow his trademark long white beard, which he never parted with until his death. Periyar visited Malaysia again in 1954, with the trip coinciding with the International Buddhist Conference in November, 1954 in Burma. After a two-week stay in Burma he came to Penang on December 11. Incidentally , at a conference in Burma he met B R Ambedkar. While Ambedkar tried persuading Periyar to embrace Buddhism, Periyar told him that strategically he preferred to remain in the `Hindu' fold to challenge it from within.Periyar never completely relied on secondary data. He believed in his own exploration and sought knowledge with the bent of a researcher. In the pursuit of that knowledge, he was never hesitant to travel either within India or abroad despite the discomforts of the journey . After all he had chosen a path less travelled by others.(The author is a treasurer of Book Sellers and Publishers Association of South India)"

This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain. K Arumugam, agriculture officer, in-charge of Chockikulam farmers' market said the unseasonal rains had resulted in poor production of vegetables grown in hill stations."

Farmers, who started sowing operations by the end of May, had to wait until the end of June first week to begin cultivation. They waited for weeks keeping the land prepared.Around 80,000 quintals of non-certified seeds, supplied by merchants in Punjab, and 2,065 tonnes of certified seeds provided by the National Seed Corporation have been purchased by farmers in the district. While the certified potato seeds were priced at Rs. 27 a kg, the non-certified seeds were sold at up to Rs. 17 a kg. The State government gave Rs. 10 subsidy per kg of certified seeds.Normally, we keep the seeds procured in open air for 15 days before sowing. This time, we waited long because of delayed monsoon. We sowed the seeds soon after the first monsoon showers last week. From then on, there have been no rains. If it does not rain for a few more days, our seeds will start decaying, causing huge loss, said Ninge Gowda, a potato grower of Belavadi in Arkalgud taluk. Hassan district received an average rainfall of 45.36 mm since June 1. In the first week of this month, up to June 7, the district received an average of 25 mm rainfall, which is 6 per cent less than the normal expected for the duration.B. Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, on Wednesday, Seed potatoes are sown between May 15 and June 15, depending on rainfall. Farmers keep the land ready and start cultivation soon after the rains. As there were no pre-monsoon rains this year, farmers had to wait, she said.The officer said that late sowing might end up the crop attracting late blight disease. If it rains heavily in July, plants become vulnerable to late blight, she added. Potato is one among the cash crops cultivated by many farmers in Hassan. In the last five to six years, the yield in potato fields has come down drastically due to late blight, a fungal infection."

Kanthallur Agriculture Officer Murugan told The Hindu on Monday that there was a major shift to garlic as its price had gone up the last season. Most farmers who cultivated potato had shifted to garlic as there was a slump in the potato price following a bumper production in the last season. Potato used to be the main crop in Kanthallur. Areas under grantis cultivation were brought under potato cultivation through a government project.Farmers mainly cultivate the Mettupalayam variety of garlic, which, though small, is of high quality. Mr. Murugan said the farmers sold it at the Vadukapatti garlic market in Tamil Nadu, for want of a selling space in the State.The present price for garlic is around 200 per kilogram.The growth period for garlic is three months and Kanthallur is all set to start the harvest within two weeks, said P.T.

Shoots back Santosh from a neighbouring kiosk: ""Ganda hai par dhanda hai, aur dhanda toh badha hai (though it has turned dirty, fact is that trade has grown).""According to some excise department officials, the IMFL and beer shops at the Bharauli border have posted 900% and 600% growth in business, respectively, between April 1 and 25.Traders in the area revealed that if chilled water and soft drink bottles were in demand for the dilution of liquor for immediate consumption, non-chilled bottles were being purchased to ferry liquor back across the border into Bihar-since carrying liquor bottles ran the high risk of being caught by excise department personnel or the police in Bihar."

58f613ac7be9e031f13ae0e2,Where water is hallmarked gold,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Where-water-is-hallmarked-gold/articleshow/52276574.cms,2016-05-15,,The Times Of India,"What worries 22-year old Jamnaben Dashratbhai, a resident of Kundalia, is not whether Gujarat Lions will win the IPL or whether BJP will win the Kerala assembly polls. It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days. Asked how they were coping with the water crisis Maniben Bhurabhai, 30, says, ""How does anyone care about us? If you go without taking bath for a week and walk down six kms with three pots on your head, you'll now how we are coping up."""

The port of Pisco is in Peru"" in the city that eventually gave its name and commercial designation to the drink, said Jose Moquillaza, a Peruvian pisco specialist.The leader of the team behind the new research, Argentine specialist Pablo Lacoste, insisted Chilean pisco was the original article, distinct from other forms of ""aguardiente"" or ""fire water.""""What they have in Peru is aguardiente, which is distilled,"" he told AFP. ""What we have here is pisco.""Chile and Peru fought a war against each other in the 19th century. They also quarrel about which country discovered potatoes and which invented a caramel dessert known as a ""Lima Sigh.""Despite the squabbles, Chile remains one of the biggest export markets for Peruvian pisco along with the United States, Peruvian newspaper El Comercio reported, citing local industry data.pa-mav/rlp/dw"

Rajabhau Survase is just about to enter his hut, when his two children, Rahul (13) and Vishal (11), stop him at the doorstep. ""What have you brought for us from Latur?"" they ask.Rajabhau helplessly looks at his wife Lubja who is baking rotis on a chulha outside the hut in scorching heat. ""Go play. Don't trouble your father. Let him rest,"" she nearly shouts at the children when they search the cloth bag in Rajabhau's hand. He promises to get them something the next day.""I can't even afford a Re 1 chocolate. Every day, I come back empty-handed and make promises, I know I can't keep. It cannot get worse than this,"" he said, breaking down.The Rs 4 in his pocket will go towards paying for the two pots of water from a landlord's borewell. ""Water is more important than their chocolate, but how do I explain it to them?"" he said, quite helplessly.Rajabhau's (35) and Lubja's (31) lives are at a standstill. Both are farm labourers from tiny Bhuisamudraga village, about 15 km from Latur. Drought has deprived them of work and their children of education.Rajabhau has a degree in Hindi, doubles up as an LIC agent and works on a farm. But the drought has deeply affected his life. ""In the last three months, hardly anyone has approached me for a policy. There is no work in agriculture as there is no sowing due to the drought,"" he added.His old parents, Nagujirao and Gajabai, are well aware of the situation. They have taken to asking people who pass by their hut for work to support the family.Rajabhau has taken up work in a bar in Latur. ""I work as a waiter and do whatever work the bar owner gives me.""His workday begins at 6pm. ""The bar opens around 7 pm and I work till late in the night. In the morning, I go to some places hoping to sell some policies and by noon I am back in my village,"" he said. After lunch, he goes out looking for water.As he prepares to eat, Lubja nudges him to wash his hands, ""Forget it. Serve whatever you have,"" he says. Today, the family has roti and potatoes. ""We get pulses and grain from the ration shop. But he often tells us the government has not provided grain because of drought,"" Lubja said.""Nobody can speak against them. They are big shots,"" Rajabhau said, hushing up Lubja.As Rajabhau starts eating, his third son Shantanu (15) nags him for fees. ""Sir has told that he will not allow me to attend dance classes. Please give me some money. I have collected some of my own,"" he begs.Shantanu aspires to become a dancer. He has appeared for his standard X exam and has enrolled for a dance class. He teaches dance to some children and may get Rs 5-10 per child.Lubja is soaked in sweat as she continues to cook on the chulha outside. ""We have a gas cylinder, but it is empty,"" she said, wiping her sweaty face.Rahul's fingers work magic on the tabla. The Survases belong to the Mang community, considered backward. They areknown for musical knowledge, especially the tabla and the dholak. The community is into tanning, traditionally.""Music comes to us naturally. But there is poverty between our music and success,"" Lubja said. Rahul had joined tabla classes, but quit when his father could not pay the fees.It is 3pm and the vasti has a flurry of activity. The only water pump will start working as the electricity is back. It is available only between 4pm and midnight.As the women scurry for a place in a queue, Lubja runs with two pots. As she arrives, the other women keep distance from her and ensure that their pots don't bump into hers.""They are Mang-untouchables,"" an elderly women, calling herself a Buddhist, said.Lubja will get two pots of water late in the evening. But that is insufficient. She has to walk some 3-4 km to get potable water and buy water from the landlord when no free water is available. ""People are cruel. They don't even give drinking water,"" old Nagujirao said.He is worried about his bulls.""We had bought this pair for Rs 80,000 hoping that we will get some ploughing work. But because of the drought, there is no sowing. We have taken a loan at 22% and now these bulls are standing without work. We don't have money for fodder and water is another headache,"" Nagujirao said.Lubja takes every effort to care for her family. She recalls that she was good in school but her parents married her off when she was in standard IX. ""I used to get 70-80%. I have passed my SSC. I can't sit still and see my family suffer,"" Lubja said.She has completed a beauty course conducted by an NGO and has some sewing skills and tried her hands at selling solar energy products.There is no money to start a beauty parlour but she has managed to buy a beauty kit. A small shed in front of her hut covered by sacks stitched together has a broken chair and a small mirror. ""This is my beauty parlor. Now you may ask do women come? They do because everybody wants to look beautiful,"" she said with a smile on her face.Upper class women won't step in, but their daughters come without the knowledge of their parents. ""I tried to sell solar products, but the caste factor became a hurdle and I had to stop. My parlor would have attracted more customers if I were not a Mang,"" she added.It is twilight. Rajabhau has left for the bar. Lubja is walking to get a pot of water and her children help her. Nagujirao is waiting for his wife to return from a marriage.A gasping Lubja arrives with a pot of water on her head. She sits on the threshold of her hut with her kids around her.Since morning, they have had just roti and potatoes, but no one complains. There is nothing to cook in the house. Lubja gathers her youngest boy close to her chest and kisses him on his forehead. She holds Shantanu's and Rahul's hand.It is growing dark. ""I am there for you. You will all become big personalities and earn money and respect. After darkness, there is always light. Knowledge and skills are for everyone. So, don't worry, we will pay your fees,"" she tells them firmly, before starting a story about how in school she had won oratory competitions and had played kabbadi.In a few minutes, there will be no electricity, but Lubja shows her family the light at the end of the tunnel."

He has sent a picture of two simians rummaging through the wastes, thrown right on the platform at Tadepalligudem, captured on his mobile phone.Coming to the AP AC Express, the train and the running were good but it stopped at many places en route. It was stopped at Duvvada Railway Station for about 15 minutes to give way to another Super fast Express. Finally, our train reached Visakhapatnam at 7.30 p.m., 45 minutes behind schedule, says Mr. Srinivasa Rao.The normal fare from Tadepalligudem to Vizag on this train was Rs.540. I had booked my ticket, three days prior to my journey and the fare was normal. But, my cousin, Balaji was puzzled to note that the Tatkal fare was Rs.1,200, when he tried to book the ticket on Saturday, he says.Dr. Pradeep, who had travelled by the II AC coach in the Visakhapatnam-Kollam weekly express, a few weeks ago, was perturbed by the collection of variable rates from passengers for food by the supplier.There is no pantry car in the long distance train.A woman, who was travelling with her daughter in the same coach, ordered for vegetarian food when the supplier came to take the order.The supplier charged Rs.70 for the rice, potato curry, sambar and curd. Later, she came to know from the passenger, sitting opposite her after his berth was confirmed, that the supplier had taken Rs.170 for the same menu.Though the coach was clean, the water in the toilet ran out in about an hour after the train started from Visakhapatnam. The water was filled in the overhead tank only at Vijayawada Junction.The woman passenger was shocked when the stall keeper on the platform at Vijayawada, charged Rs.40 for a packet of chips and a 1-litre water bottle, which normally would cost not more than Rs.25. When she pulled him up, he returned Rs.10."

The hospital which was started by the British in the 19th century to mainly help the village that had just begun growing in Mettupalayam, today serves almost 18 panchayats along the foothills of the Western Ghats. It has now grown as a popular maternity centre for women.The hospital was built and started on a piece of land donated by a Kannadiga Gowder, named Ramai Gowder, in the year 1884. Historians say the story of the hospital is closely linked to the story of growth of Mettupalayam itself. ""It was in the 1800s when the British began discovering Ooty and began building many estates in the hill station. They had also slowly begun cultivating vegetables like potato, cabbage, raddish, carrots and beetroots. Once the Nilgiris Mountain Railway was built, Mettupalayam became the market place where they would send vegetables from the Nilgiris, and it would be evaluated, priced and bought by traders.Historian C R Elangovan says even 75 years ago, Mettupalayam was just a small village, compared to the then bigger Karamadai and even bigger Chikkadasapalayam. ""Initially the route to Ooty was through Sirumugai, but after the Coonoor to Mettupalayam Road was built, Mettupalayam also became a junction, thus leading to its development,"" he said. ""It was then that many kannadiga Gowders who used to live in Chikkadasapalayam, and worked or dealt with the British, started building many facilities,"" he said.In the Mettupalayam Government Hospital's case, the land was donated in 1884 by Ramai Gowder, also known as Rama Gowder in a few culverts. A small dispensary for medicines and drugs was set up to cater to people in the Nilgiris and the growing community around the junction. It was only 1962 that it was converted to a 10-bed hospital, offering basic services for simple illnesses.44-years-later, the centre is now 110-bedded hospital offering a range of services right from gyneacology and surgery to tuberculosis quarantine, HIV antiretro viral therapy and siddha medicines. ""We are also going to have a comprehensive obstetric emergency and newborn care (CEMONC) with 30 beds added soon,"" said the hospital's chief medical officer Dr S Seralathan. ""We cater to 19 panchayats and perform orthopaedic and other surgeries regularly,"" he said.On Thursday, the hospital authorities had a small function inviting three descendents of Rama Gowder. They also said they plan to release a postal stamp and envelope in the name of Rama Gowder."

In an administrative meeting of North 24-Parganas at Salt Lake's EZCC on Friday, the CM warned the district administration and the police against unchecked infiltration, deteriorating law and order and uncontrolled cattle smuggling.""What are you doing? Infiltration is increasing, law and order has touched the bottom, anti-socials are moving freely. I won't tolerate this. Don't see colours (read political) of the culprits. Arrest them,"" the CM said.Banerjee cautioned against the rising syndicate business that had turned into a political hot potato during the recently concluded assembly polls. In order to curb the role of supply syndicates that have become a money-spinning machine, Banerjee announced a Rs 45,000crore investment for the district, which has the potential to create 1.40 lakh jobs.Mamata's warning against infiltration comes after Trinamool's impressive victory in North 24-Parganas, particularly in South Basirhat where the party wrested the seat from BJP. Banerjee said, ""There is a new DM and SP in the district. I have told them to increase vigil in the bordering areas. Cattle smuggling should be checked. They should take extra initiative to check the deteriorating law and order condition. The traffic system should also be improved and there should be increased police presence on the streets."" This may raise eyebrows in the opposition, but the CM had said she would support the Centre on a case-to-case basis, even though she is ideologically opposed to BJP.The CM also pulled up municipal affairs secretary Omkar Singh Meena Roy for poor functioning of the municipalities. When Roy complained of paucity of funds, the CM said: ""You will have to do with whatever money we have. See how KMC is working. Learn from them. Utilize the central funds. I have a lot of plans for the district. But I won't accept syndicate raj and promoting racket"".Banerjee later said, ""The municipalities will have to be given funds to regain health."" I have many plans for this distirct. There will be 45000 crore investment in the next few days which will generate 140000 jobs"".The CM didn't spare the MLAs from the district - Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Sujit Bose, Sabyaschi Dutta and Purnendu Bose - either. ""I have warned you before. Stop infighting and work for the people,"" she said.Incidentally, BJP took out a rally in the city during the day, accusing the state of promoting Bangladeshi infiltration. All senior BJP leaders, including Dilip Ghosh, Rahul Sinha, Roopa Ganguly and Locket Chatterjee, were present. This is nothing new for BJP. During election campaign top BJP leaders including Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh had alleged that Trinamool congress and CPM had been promoting infiltration from Bangladesh to get political mileage out it. Shah told in a meeting that BJP would stop infiltration if voted to Nabanna."

In one of the plays early scenes, an old widow slips away from the corner in which she is deposited each night like a sack of potatoes by her grandson. In the deathly stillness of night, she crawls inch by inch on the floor of the family mansions sprawling courtyard, calling out, perhaps to the husband who died, or the son who left home, or to the benign god of lesser beings who is most certainly a man, to take her away. And it does. The scene poignantly underlines what it would all amount to for women in the household, and with never an utterance except in these dying moments, the actor in question bodily evokes with remarkable precision the senility of a once sentient person. This is the nature of loss the play deals with: the loss of womens lives.Later, her daughter-in-law, the households complaining matriarch, Aai, finds herself slowly losing agency in her own home. She tries to protect her turf by unquestioningly siding with her sons in each domestic matter. The men hold the balance of power and will be her keepers. Her unmarried daughter, the idealistic Prabha, is thus marginalised and pushed towards a self-inflicted incarceration in the attic. The scenography by Deepan Sivaraman recreates every aspect of a traditional feudal household in Vidarbha. The stage of performance is a replica of actual living quarters, with a courtyard, a kitchen, and several sleeping chambers. Around this are included seats for the audience, creating several avenues of spectatorship. You could watch from a distance in the rows behind, or peek in from an open window, or curl up in the recesses under a makeshift staircase, with the aromas of the freshly cooked meal of poha (that the play begins with) wafting in. The urgency of the drama in such a hyper-real setting is certainly compounded. Prabhas descent into an impenetrable silence confronts us with a searing immediacy.The play, which runs into four long hours, nonetheless features several time collapses. When a long-lost son arrives at the doorstep, we suddenly find Aai bent over with age and infirmity, reduced to a forlorn figure who flashes a torch into peoples faces to figure out who they are, whilst idling her time away in the shadows. We miss the strident woman who stood upright and seemingly spoke in her own voice, entreating and cajoling.Viraasat is about the laws of inheritance that exclude women. These are themes often regurgitated in our stories, but under Kapurs direction, they become palpable and aesthetically larger than life, and the beauty crystallises into an unmistakable poignancy that makes the production a moving experience for those who manage to stay till the end.In another powerful sequence, the men return from Aais funeral, and engage in ablutions, attempting to rid themselves of the toxicity of death. The youngest boy, who we see growing up before our eyes during the running time of the play (always played by the same actor), emerges a man from the pit. The play leaves us with a sense of optimism when yet another woman marries into the household, bringing with her the whiff of a new progressiveness. Nanda is a woman of breathtaking self-sufficiency and her husband, who is perhaps pre-destined to be a boorish sort like the men who came before him, finds himself no stranger to the idea that a woman asserting herself, however gracefully and non-confrontationally, is a good thing, and its something he might have expected of his own mother, or aunt, or sisters. Viraasat allows us some disdain at the spinelessness of those women, their silences and their complicity in the squashing of their own hopes and aspirations. But, it is the callous disregard for women exhibited by the men that is ultimately indicted. The tempers and rhythms of the women percolate this space, in which their own volition was severely compromised. That this can be turned around, is the greatest hope Viraasat leaves us with.The writer is a playwright and stage critic"

Rajabhau Survase is just about to enter his hut, when his two children, Rahul (13) and Vishal (11), stop him at the doorstep. ""What have you brought for us from Latur?"" they ask.Rajabhau helplessly looks at his wife Lubja who is baking rotis on a chulha outside the hut in scorching heat. ""Go play. Don't trouble your father. Let him rest,"" she nearly shouts at the children when they search the cloth bag in Rajabhau's hand. He promises to get them something the next day.""I can't even afford a Re 1 chocolate. Every day, I come back empty-handed and make promises, I know I can't keep. It cannot get worse than this,"" he said, breaking down.The Rs 4 in his pocket will go towards paying for the two pots of water from a landlord's borewell. ""Water is more important than their chocolate, but how do I explain it to them?"" he said, quite helplessly. Rajabhau's (35) and Lubja's (31) lives are at a standstill. Both are farm labourers from tiny Bhuisamudraga village, about 15 km from Latur. Drought has deprived them of work and their children of education.Rajabhau has a degree in Hindi, doubles up as an LIC agent and works on a farm. But the drought has deeply affected his life. ""In the last three months, hardly anyone has approached me for a policy. There is no work in agriculture as there is no sowing due to the drought,"" he added.His old parents, Nagujirao and Gajabai, are well aware of the situation. They have taken to asking people who pass by their hut for work to support the family. Rajabhau has taken up work in a bar in Latur. ""I work as a waiter and do whatever work the owner gives me.""His workday begins at 6pm. ""The bar opens around 7 pm and I work till late in the night. In the morning, I go to some places hoping to sell some policies and by noon I am back in my village,"" he said. After lunch, he goes out looking for water.As he prepares to eat, Lubja nudges him to wash his hands, ""Forget it. Serve whatever you have,"" he says. Today, the family has roti and potatoes. ""We get pulses and grain from the ration shop. But he often tells us the government has not provided grain because of drought,"" Lubja said.""Nobody can speak against them. They are big shots,"" Rajabhau said, hushing up Lubja. As Rajabhau starts eating, his third son Shantanu (15) nags him for fees. ""Sir has told that he will not allow me to attend dance classes. Please give me some money. I have collected some of my own,"" he begs. Shantanu aspires to become a dancer. He has appeared for his standard X exam and has enrolled for a dance class. He teaches dance to children and may get Rs 5-10 per child.Lubja is soaked in sweat as she continues to cook on the chulha outside. ""We have a gas cylinder, but it is empty,"" she said, wiping her sweaty face.Rahul's fingers work magic on the tabla. The Survases belong to the Mang community, considered backward. They are known for musical knowledge, especially the tabla and the dholak. The community is into tanning, traditionally.""Music comes to us naturally. But there is poverty between our music and success,"" Lubja said. Rahul had joined tabla classes, but quit when his father could not pay the fees. It is 3pm and the vasti has a flurry of activity. The only water pump will start working as the electricity is back. It is available only between 4pm and midnight.As the women scurry for a place in a queue, Lubja runs with two pots. As she arrives, the other women keep distance from her and ensure that their pots don't bump into hers. ""They are Mang-untouchables,"" an elderly women, calling herself a Buddhist, said. Lubja will get two pots of water late in the evening. But that is insufficient. She has to walk some 3-4 km to get potable water and buy water from the landlord when no free water is available. ""People are cruel. They don't even give drinking water,"" old Nagujirao said. He is worried about his bulls.""We had bought this pair for Rs 80,000 hoping that we will get some ploughing work. But because of the drought, there is no sowing. We have taken a loan at 22% and now these bulls are standing without work. We don't have money for fodder and water is another headache,"" Nagujirao said.Lubja takes every effort to care for her family. She recalls that she was good in school but her parents married her off when she was in Class IX. ""I used to get 70-80%. I passed my SSC. I can't sit still and see my family suffer,"" Lubja said.She has completed a beauty course conducted by an NGO and has some sewing skills and tried her hands at selling solar energy products.There is no money to start a beauty parlour but she has managed to buy a beauty kit. A small shed in front of her hut covered by sacks stitched together has a broken chair and a small mirror. ""This is my beauty parlor. Now you may ask do women come? They do because everybody wants to look beautiful,"" she said with a smile on her face.Upper class women won't step in, but their daughters come without the knowledge of their parents. ""I tried to sell solar products, but the caste factor became a hurdle and I had to stop. My parlor would have attracted more customers if I were not a Mang,"" she added.It is twilight. Rajabhau has left for the bar. Lubja is walking to get a pot of water and her children help her. Nagujirao is waiting for his wife to return from a wedding.A gasping Lubja arrives with a pot of water on her head. She sits on the threshold of her hut with her kids around her. Since morning, they have had just roti and potatoes, but no one complains.It is growing dark. ""I am there for you. You will all become big personalities and earn money and respect. After darkness, there is always light. Knowledge and skills are for everyone. So, don't worry, we will pay your fees,"" she tells her grandchildren.In a few minutes, there will be no electricity, but Lubja shows her family the light at the end of the tunnel."

A huge gap in the demand and supply of the vegetables has led to this huge increase in prices and homemakers are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance between keeping the daily menus healthy and not letting the budget go haywire. Experts have claimed that for the next one month condition of the vegetable market would remain same. ""Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra are the biggest importers for state from where a major share of vegetables is received. But looking at the present conditions we expecting that the prices would continue to be the same,"" said Arvind Hatia, Executive member, Indore vegetable association.Across the nation, farmers produce has been affected due to adverse weather conditions.Vegetable association claimed that the sowing season has commenced, soybean is emerging the most preferred crops for the farmers in this region. ""Lesser vegetables would be sown this year and major share of vegetables in state is dependent on the imports from other states,"" added Hatia. Sources have claimed that the prices of potatoes might increase in the next one month. ""As the schools have re-opened, kids usually prefer potatoes and okra so we cannot deny the possibility of increase in its cost at the retail market,"" said Mukesh Sharma, a retailer.As the monsoon has commenced but for the harvesting of vegetables minimum 50 days are required. So it is almost difficult to bring down the prices in the next few days. Wholesalers have claimed that till July 20, there won't be any dip in the prices of vegetables. In the past one month prices of vegetables has gone up by almost Rs 40 at the retail market and wholesale market as well. ""Poor quality of vegetables has affected the flow in the wholesale market.There aren't proper storage facilities for the farmers to store their produce for long enough and get a good price,"" said Indore vegetable wholesale association vice president Farooq Raien. Speaking to TOI, farmer Ramesh Singh said, ""The demand is increasing but we are not in a condition to store the vegetable for long. Quality of the vegetables has depreciated and we are not able to sell it off. Because of this, prices of good quality vegetables have gone up,"""

Most of them are being sold for Rs 50 a kilogram. The price of green chilly has gone up to Rs 180-200/kg, up from Rs 100 last week. Beans now come for Rs 65 a kg.Drought in neighbouring states and heatwave in several parts of Odisha has destroyed harvest and pushed up the prices of vegetables, said sellers.""If prices were to go up like this, how will one manage the family expenses? Potatoes and onions are being sold for more than Rs 20 for the last few months. Now even the vegetable prices are burning a hole in our pockets,"" groused homemaker Mamta Rath, who shopped from a wholesale market in Unit-I instead of the retail shops next to her house, to save some extra bucks.As such vegetable prices remain high during summer months every year, but this season has been bad as the harvest of green vegetables was affected. The production in most vegetable-growing areas in the state has gone down significantly, thereby affecting supply to the city market.The quantity and quality of vegetables has gone down in the last few weeks due to severe heatwave condition and water scarcity in most parts of the state.""The supply of green vegetables from Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal has also gone down due to drought-like situation in these states,"" said Susant Samantray, a vendor of Unit-I market.While vegetables like tomato, beans, brinjal, pointed and bitter gourd have gone beyond the reach of common people, even the humble pumpkin and papaya are selling for Rs 20 and Rs 30 per kg, respectively.Meanwhile, the state horticulture department expressed helplessness over the rising prices. ""The government does not have any control over the vegetable market as it is highly unregulated,"" said an official of the department."
58f627de7be9e031f13af8c3,Why veggie rates rise 400% between farm & mkt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-veggie-rates-rise-400-between-farm-mkt/articleshow/53217148.cms,2016-07-15,,The Times Of India,"Take a guess how much veggie prices get marked up as the produce moves from farm to market . In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

Fruit prices, on the other hand, stayed high as merely 25 truckloads arrived compared with around 300 on regular days.As many as 270 trucks of onions and potatoes arrived on Thursday. This saw retail prices of onions fall to Rs 18-22 from Rs 20-25 on Wednesday and potatoes to Rs 24-30 from Rs 30-35. Market experts say prices will return to normal with additional supplies on Friday.Sanjay Pansare, a leading fruit trader in the APMC , said, ""Unlike vegetables, fruits could not reach the market today as producers learned late on Wednesday that the strike had been called off. As most fruits come from other states, they will reach the market by Friday. We had only 25 truckloads sent by local growers.""Prices of tomato fell to Rs 60-80 in the retail market against Rs 80-100 during the strike. Green chilli stayed high, though, at Rs 160-200 due to less-than-expected supplies.Meanwhile, retailers who had bought vegetables at high prices during the stir, failed to get them sold. ""We incurred losses from leftover stock,"" said Sachin Gavas, a vendor.As the vegetable market reopened for the day's transaction in APMC, Vashi, on Thursday, a day after the indefinite strike was called off, retailers voiced opposition to the idea of paying commission to wholesalers. This delayed the auctioning process for over an hour. Later, the intervention of APMC officials resolved the issue.To break the deadlock, it was decided that though farmers have been exempted from shelling out commission, retailers were also given relief from commission for the day. ""Why we should pay commission on purchase,"" protested a Bhiwandi-based retailer Anish Shaikh.Rajaram Dhondkar, deputy secretary of APMC, Mumbai, who was present when the crisis erupted toldthat, ""From today farmers have been exempted from paying commission to the traders for selling their produce. At same time retailers were given exemption too from new commission to be paid to the traders for the day.

It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon. Logic dictates that they would despatch the produce quickly before the bandh begins and cut their losses.Consumers are furious that middlemen should continue their strike plan despite the dire situation. ""Already , dal is selling for Rs 120-180 per kg, vegetables for Rs 100-200 and dry condiments have come to cost the earth. Now the APMC has decided to go on strike and halt supplies completely . The government or courts should either outlaw this bandh or ensure alternative arrangements for supply ,"" said Andheri resident Neerja Kajale. Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly . Farmers will soon learn how to manage transportation and supply logistics.""Across Mumbai, cauliflow er, green chillies, garlic and capsicum are being sold for up to Rs 200 per kg. Fruits have become dearer too. Apple and pomegranate rose to Rs 180-200 from Rs 150-170.Matunga is among the costliest markets in the city . On Monday , French beans sold for Rs 200, bitter gourd, carrot and tomato Rs 80, onion Rs 30 and potato Rs 40. Prices were two to three times that of last week, said resident K A Viswanathan. Matunga has nearly 100 vegetable shops. Vendor Shiv Pande said fresh produce won't come on Tuesday .Dilip Yadav, a retailer at Navi Mumbai's Mafco retail market said, ""(We were) forced to stock only cheap vegetables to cater to our regular consumers. Even common vegetables are selling above Rs 100.""""Consumers are at the re ceiving end due to the sparring between the government and middlemen,"" said Aarti Jambolkar, a homemaker.The onion and potato market began its strike from Monday. Prices promptly witnessed a jump of Rs 2-5 per kg.Onions with surplus production this season rose to Rs 18-22 from Rs 15-18 earlier.With inputs from Bella Jaisinghani"

Because of their competitive prices and discounts, these online groceries are the current favourites of customers.In fact, according to e-grocery players, there have been a significant rise in sales of tomatoes particularly over the last seven to 10 days ever since the prices spiked. ""We have noticed a sudden surge in sales of basic fruits and vegetables, especially tomatoes, onions, potatoes in the range of 20% to 30%,"" said Rahul Hari, owner and founder, Satvacart.""While tomatoes in the offline market are selling at Rs 70-80 per kg, we have been able to offer rates in the range of Rs 40-Rs 50 a kg,"" he added.K Radhakrishnan, co-founder at GrocerMax, said that there has been a 50% in his sales volume for tomatoes in the last four days itself due to better pricing.Explaining the logic for lesser online prices, Radhakrishnan said he is flexible on the margins to ensure that the customer does not take the hit because of the high prices. ""We might shrink the rupee margin, but the increase in volume covers the cost which makes it a win-win situation,"" he added.However, the models might vary from one player to another. Satvacart, for instance, explains the lower prices due to the price point availability because of the optimised supply chain and cut-down of middlemen in procurement.""Yesterday I was reading about the price hike and then I checked online and found out I was getting half a kilo of tomatoes at just Rs 20,"" said Pooja Garg, a communications professional working with a finance company.However, some suspect the portals are also witnessing heavy traffic as customers get curious and compare prices across portals."

Tomatoes were missing from her favorite dish - 'Tomato-Onion Uttapam'. The restaurant manager claimed that rising prices of the vegetables has affected the cuisines at hotels and restaurants in city. With an increase of almost 100 per cent in the prices of vegetables within a month, the monthly budgets of the restaurants have gone haywire. Speaking to TOI, Sumit Suri, President, Indore hotels and restaurants association, said, ""Constant increase in the prices of vegetables do affect the budget of hotels. Generally the hoteliers tie-up with vegetable vendors for a month or so and they get their regular supply from them,"" Some of the city based hotels, restaurants and tiffin centers have changed their cuisines and are even eliminating some of the vegetables from their dishes. ""For the tiffin centers it is even more difficult. Every day menu is a fixed affair and to deliver it is a difficult job,"" said Mohan Singh, who runs a tiffin centre at Mahalakshmi Nagar.Vegetables like potatoes, okra, tomatoes, cauliflower are the most preferred ones in tiffin for the youngsters. ""To fulfill the demand of college students and working professionals is a difficult task when you know that prices are soaring every day. I have asked my chef to stop using capsicum frequently,"" said the owner of a tiffin centre. City based cafes and hotels are facing the pinch of high prices and as per the members of vegetable association prices won't go down at least for a month from now. ""Lesser production of vegetables across the country has created a nation-wide crisis. Large amount of vegetables are imported to Madhya Pradesh and the harvesting season for the new crop hasn't yet began,"" said a member of the Indore vegetable association."

Karippayi told The Hindu that an effective marketing intervention saved the local farmers from exploitation by middlemen. There was a practice of Vattavada and Kanthallur vegetables reaching Tamil Nadu before reaching Kerala markets.He said that Rs.80 lakh was given in advance to procure vegetables through the Swayasraya Karshaka Vipani of the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and the two Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Societies at Vattavada and Kanthallur. Horticorp will continue the procurement till Friday and all the dues to the farmers will be settled by then, he said.Horticorp also procured 5 tonnes of Marayur jaggery and Rs.3.5 lakh was given in advance for it. All retail markets in the State can be used for selling the cool season vegetables, known for their least use of pesticides and fertilizers.During the previous Onam season, Horticorp procured 150 tonnes of cool season vegetables from both the villages. In the previous years the procurement was 451 tonnes. This time, Horticorp could procure a variety of vegetables from the two villages. The main produce included potato, cabbage, carrot, beetroot, beans items, garlic, and cauliflower.The procurement was stopped during the holidays and is all set to restart, Mr. Karippayi said. The procurement was mostly hassle-free. The main issues raised by the farmers were delay in payment and that only selected items were being procured by Horticorp. This time both the issue were tackled effectively.Bindu Mathew, district manager, VFPCK, said there was apprehension among the farmers over future procurement by Horticorp, which owes the VFPCK Rs.33 lakh. Once the dues are cleared, the procurement would be more effective.As per official estimates, 2, 927 hectares of land at Vattavada and 711 hectares at Kanthallur are under vegetable cultivation.Ms. Mathew said that there was ample produce this season to ensure supply of vegetables to the State markets till December.Vattavada Farmers Society president Jayaprakash said they were happy to provide vegetables to Horticorp and their only demand was continuous procurement and timely clearance of dues."

Similarly, the number of loads of other vegetables have also come down drastically over the past one month resulting in a 150% spike in prices for some vegetables.Poor monsoon last year and sparse summer rain has reduced yield. Meanwhile, as demand from northern states is up, Coimbatore is running low on vegetable stock.All these factors have led to a steady rise in prices since March.

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

There has been a rise in food consumption occasions during the day. What used to earlier be four meals daily, including a snack, has doubled to 8-10 meals among urban consumers. While breakfast, lunch and dinner have been the established occasions for consumption with an evening snack thrown in, industry experts say new occasions like a pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, evening, pre-dinner and an after-dinner are gaining in popularity.A pre-lunch snack is said to be the preferred meal among young, on-the-go professionals and the blue-collared workforce. On the other hand, increased health consciousness, especially in the metros and tier I cities, has led to consumers having smaller portions through the day, albeit, more frequently. The culture of putting in longer hours at work and in commute has resulted in late dinners, which makes space for a pre-dinner snack.The shift in consumption patterns has triggered innovation in the packaged foods market. Sanjay Sharma, CEO, MTR Foods , said a professional today spends around 10 hours at work and an average of two hours commuting. This has given a boost to in-between snacking habits. ""This change in behaviour gave us an opportunity to tap this occasion by innovating and launching our traditional snacks portfolio, the on-the-go dessert portion packs and our breakfast-in-a-cup range which gives a quick meal in 3 minutes by just adding hot water.""There is also a significant increase in the women workforce, resulting in a change in food habits. Arabind Das, COO, Godrej Tyson Foods, said the consumer is looking for convenience and she wants to manage her time well, but expects the taste of food to remain intact. ""We are innovating to cater to such needs of the consumer. So while we already offer her a packaged pre-cut chicken, we have also provided her the option of a marinated chicken as well as ready-to-cook chicken nuggets. We see this trend not only in SEC A and B markets, but beyond that as well,"" said Das.Das said the growing number of occasions is driven by the consumer's desire to 'munch on something', with the evening snack emerging as the fastest growing space with a greater variety.Devendra Chawla, group president (food FMCG brands), Future Group , views food as the new entertainment. ""We live in times where instant gratification rules. No other category can provide better instant gratification than food.Whether it's IPL or Bollywood movies, we need food and without food everything seems incomplete. We reward ourselves with food even when alone. When tired, we eat or drink to feel charged up and to meet people, we create food as an occasion. So every occasion now has food intertwined in it,"" said Chawla.Categories like frozen snacks, instant pasta, soups and granola bars are being built as ""in-between meals"". Ready-to-cook packs, including gourmet dishes, too, are making their presence felt. Chawla said while this is largely a big city phenomenon, data reveals that metros such as NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata and even Punjab, to an extent, are over leveraged on these categories.""At home, too, thanks to freezers and microwaves, everyone is a mini chef. It's common to see kids making their own potato fries after school hours. On the other hand, changes in lifestyle and health consciousness, trainers, nutritionists and dietitians are coming up with plans of 6-8 meals a day. This has increased occasions to consume food."""
