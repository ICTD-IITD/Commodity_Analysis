Continued neglect in terms of infrastructure by the successive governments has resulted in the Queen of Hills loosing her sheen.Since 1957, the constituency has returned Congress nominees eight times, nominee of the Swatandra party once besides giving the AIADMK and DMK a chance twice each. In 2011, the constituency returned sitting MLA M. Budhichandran who was inducted into the cabinet for a brief period.Fund-starved Udhagamandalam Municipality had not been able to make any progress in terms of infrastructure and the constituencys demographic profile includes a mixture of Badagas, Christians, Keralites, Kannadigas and Muslims.Ban on issue of patta on one side and rampant building rule violations on the other are the major issues that the electorate hold against the successive ruling parties. Tourism, horticulture and plantations remain the key economic factors for this hill-station.K.A. Bhojan, a resident of Udhagamandalam for the last 26 years, says that there is a burgeoning vehicular population, but the town roads remain very narrow without any adequate parking space resulting in congestion becoming the order of the day. The town had been growing vertically and horizontal growth was very minimum, he added.Similarly, the water supply schemes that the Municipality depends are proving to be grossly inadequate. In the absence of a strong political leadership in the district, despite change of governments, MLAs were not able to get sanctions for any foresighted projects taking into account the long term requirements. Many of the projects were envisaged and implemented by the British.With cup of woes overflowing, Dharmalingam Venugopal of Nilgiris Documentation Centre has entered the fray taking on the Dravidian majors, national and regional party nominees.His campaign remains very simple Vote for Ooty. Mr. Venugopals campaign also focuses on renaming Udhagamandalam as Ooty as it is popularly known to the rest of the world.He pointed out that the hill district needs a lot of infrastructure as it attracted close to 25 lakh tourists an year and more than 50 per cent of them from Southern States and the rest from all over India and from abroad. He also calls for reasonable price for tea and for the vegetables that are grown here such as carrot, cauliflower, potato and broccoli.Political leaders and top bureaucrats, who come to Udhagamandalam for vacations, promise to do something for betterment of the town but seldom remember that on their return from vacation, says a leading hotels manager on condition of anonymity. The hill district capital is yet to get an engineering college and the trauma care facilities at Government Hospital at Udhagamandalam requires a lot of improvement.Interestingly, the constituency which is a sought after spot for film shooting has only three theatres and promises of the past namely introduction of rope car and many other infrastructure to aid tourism is yet to translate into reality on the ground, Mr. Bhojan added.There is no scientific study or a permanent solution to the problem of land slips which at some times cuts off the connectivity for the district with the plains.The much talked about proposal for a third route to the Nilgiris (besides the one via Kotagiri and the other via Coonoor) has not seen the light of the day owing to issues of environment clearance.Promising to resolve all or at least many of the issues, the candidates locking horns are R. Ganesh of the Indian National Congress (INC) D. Vinodh of AIADMK, K. King Narcissus of DMDK and J. Raman of BJP."

On entering the tribal district, one can see multi-storied houses, lush green fields along with hotels, guest houses and home stays. The rapid growth in tourism has already sparked discussions on having a master plan for sustainable tourism. However, not many would know that some five decades back the snowbound district was deprived of even the most basic facilities, and that its people's fortune changed only after they took the cooperative route in the 1960s and worked together.At 2 persons per sq km, Lahaul and Spiti district has India's lowest population density. It has a population of 3.31 lakh for a geographical area of 13,833 sq kms. Though the district remains cut off from the rest of the world for six months in winter, people here have made rapid development and many of them not only own properties in the district but also in Kullu, Manali and other parts of country.Before the Centre thought of constructing a road to connect Manali with Lahaul and Spiti and then Ladakh, people used to walk over a 13,050-foot mountain pass to reach Manali. A Lahaul and Spiti-based historian, Chhering Dorje, said that before the 1962 war, Lahaul was deprived of road connectivity and people used to cross Rohtang Pass out of compulsion only, either for trade or for employment. ""In summer, it would take 3-4 days to travel between Lahaul and Manali. In winter, the journey wuld extend to 5-6 days and even more in case of bad weather,"" he said.Dorje said construction of the road from Manali to Ladakh started turning the wheels of development in the district. A former MLA from Lahaul-Spiti, BJP's Dr Ram Lal Markanda, said had people not taken the cooperative route, the valley would not have witnessed the prosperity visible today. ""Seeds of development were sown on May 28, 1966, when Lahaul Potato Growers Co-operative Marketing cum Processing Society Limited (LPS) was formed with initial an membership of 20 growers, under the then Punjab State Cooperative Societies Act,"" he said. ""With passage of time, almost every house in Lahaul had a member in LPS. Their united efforts helped ensure better marketing of seed potato. This help fetch a good price for farmers.""At present, LPS is known for varied activities, ranging from basic necessities of people to secondary needs like supply of petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, and even procurement of agricultural and horticultural produce. After witnessing the success of LPS, Lahaul residents had formed another cooperative society to market hops. ""Through the society, people had started selling their produce to beer-producing companies for a good price. But, later, farmers stopped producing hops and tuned towards sowing green pea and apple,"" said Premjeet Phurpa, a resident of Phura village in Lahaul.A retired block development officer, Balbir Singh Yarki, after seeing big hydro power companies showing interest in tapping the hydro power potential of Lahaul valley, had motivated the people to form a cooperative society to generate hydro power through their own projects. Today, residents of around 30 villages of Chandra Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district have scripted a new story of empowerment as around 850 members have become shareholders of the Chandra Valley Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society Limited, which has bagged a small hydro power project in the valley.Sonam Dolma of Shashin village and one of the shareholders in the society said the society was leap for Lahaul residents from producing potatoes and green peas to producing electiricity. ""When big hydro power companies can come here to exploit our resources, then cannot we step forward to reap the benefits of development?"" she added.Yarki said other residents of Lahaul had formed Shansha Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society, which has 140 members to venture into hydro power. He said the cooperative movement in Lahaul was deep-rooted and people knew its benefits. ""It is only through the cooperative movement that we have been successful so far,"" he said."

IAF has shot off a communique to state forest department to get rid of this innocuous enemy.Speaking to TOI, divisional forest officer, Gwalior, Vikram Singh Parihar, said, ""There are around 70 of them inside the airbase. IAF wants us to shift them to some other location. We have already had a meeting with them and another meeting will be held in next few days for remedial measures."" Forest department recommended IAF to raise height of their boundary wall to 8 feet or go for chain fencing. ""It's not easy to capture these animals given its herd size. Initially we advised air force officials to use chain link fencing or raise boundary wall,"" said the DFO.There had been several communications between IAF and state forest department on this matter in last four years. A letter was also sent on May 21 this year reporting the blue bull menace.Though there had been instances of blue bulls venturing onto the runway, posing a threat to the fighter jets during take-off and landing, defence spokesman Group Captain B B Pande told TOI that the menace is limited to the domestic area of Maharajpur airbase.""The technical (working) and operational area is completely free of blue bulls, but there are many in the domestic area. We have written to forest department to remove them from our premises for safety of people living there and have also assured them cooperation in operations,"" said Group Captain Pande. The only solution is to chase them out, he said.Forest department had been expressing helplessness, stating that rules allow killing or translocation of antelopes only if they damage crops. IAF had also carried out an aerial survey to find out the number of wild animals around the air base that led to mishaps in the past. Blue bulls also pose danger to movement of aircraft, but also vehicular traffic within the campus. Two persons on a two-wheeler were injured by bluebulls in the IAF premises a few days ago, said sources.A portion of IAF's Maharajpur airstrip is shared by Airports Authority of India (AAI) for parking planes. Blue bulls, said sources, move across the runway to the adjacent farm land of Central Potato Research Centre (CPRC), located close to the boundary wall of the airstrip. CPRC has farm area of 179.5 ha and is primarily engaged in seed production.This centre has two research programmes, including development of low-input technology for potato production and to work on stem necrosis diseases of potato. The bulls jump across the boundary wall to reach the farm. In 2003, IAF had come up with an unusual idea to check the menace at their Bakshi-ka-Talab air base on outskirts of Lucknow by using tiger excreta, obtained from the Lucknow Zoo. They littered it around the runaway after being informed that smell of tiger droppings will keep blue bulls away, but to no avail."

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166. The maximum prices of tomato and potato was Rs 80 and Rs 35/kg, respectively."

Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has also advised the farmers to use such traps.Yellow traps made by the CPRS cost 4-5 times less than those available in the market. Research station director J S Minhas said the traps available in the market cost Rs 50-60 per piece but those developed by the CPRS innovation cell cost Rs 10-15 a piece.""This is a cheap and effective method to control the white fly menace,"" he said, adding 50 traps of 60cm x 40cm per hectare would be sufficient for controlling the pest.""The farmers can make these traps from white fibre sheet and paint it with golden yellow colour. These sheets are cut into pieces of specified size and are then coated with a thin layer of grease or castor oil. The farmers should then tie these traps on wooden sticks in such a way that they remain just above the canopy of the plant. These are equally effective as the ones available in the commercial market and are reusable,"" Minhas saidFor more information on low-cost yellow sticky traps the farmers could contact him or CPRS assistant chief technical officer Kapil Kumar Sharma, he added."

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying 'Jai Shri Ram' at Lucknow on Dussehra day, national BJP chief Amit Shah followed in his footsteps and begun his address with the same chant.Shah, who was at Etawah to address the party's Sankalp Rally, went on to exhort those present to chant it loud enough to be heard not only in the neighbouring Saifai but even by Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. And what obviates that it was done to polarise the votebank was the fact that Modi 's chant was better suited for the time and occasion of Dussehra and Ramlila grounds, while Shah was addressing a political rally. On previous occasions, Shah has begun his speech with 'Bharat Mata ki jai' or Vande Matram.Shah also tried to get mileage out of the Indian Army's recent surgical strike in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir by presenting Modi as a strong and decisive leader. Before elections, BJP had promised that if voted to power, terrorist and enemy forces from across the border would not dare to attack India, said Shah and added that the first surgical strike post-Independence by the Indian Army was proof of the promise being delivered.""The borders are now secure, unlike during the Sonia-Manmohan Singh regime when Indian soldiers were beheaded by enemy forces who crossed the border with the slain heads,"" said Shah. Speaking in the poll-bound state, Shah said the party might contest without declaring any chief minister face.""In the last over two years, no one even in the Opposition has blamed the BJP government at the Centre of any corruption,"" said Shah, claiming it to be the second poll promise of the party fulfilled, adding that UPA government got the support of SP and BSP to become partners in scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore. The amount of scam was equal to three years of total budget of UP, said Shah and added that it could have helped make three schools in every village of UP and created so many jobs.Referring to a recent gaffe, Shah said a big leader like Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi didn't know whether potato is grown in a farm land or in a factory, so what can he do for the welfare of farmers. ""He (Rahul) is here only to help SP or BSP come back to power,"" Shah alleged."

Among the many British soldiers deputed in Dehradun was young Captain Frederik Young from Ireland, who commanded the first Gorkha Battalion in its founding years. Young - who joined the East India Company as a 15-year-old and went on to retire as a General after 44 successive years' service - is said to be the founder of Mussoorie.The Irishman - whose 142nd death anniversary falls on May 24 - not only built St Peter's Church, but also the entire Sister's Bazaar area. But as it often happens, he has received little mention in the pages of history and his contributions lie largely forgotten. Historian Gopal Bharadwaj echoes this view and says, ""Young was indeed a visionary and deserves a little more attention than he gets.""Given Irishmen's love for potatoes, the young Captain is said to have gone exploring higher up in the hills in search of suitable locations to grow the vegetable. Little did he know that the rolling hills would not only provide him with venues to farm, but also remind him vividly of home.Soon after, in 1834, he built himself a shooting lodge in Landour - making it the first official residence of Mussoorie and paving the way for today's picturesque hill station. True to his Irish roots, Young named the lodge Mullingar after a town in Westmeath, Ireland.""He was an exceptionally brave man and the pahadis certainly owe him for the potatoes that grow here and for the entire town of Mussoorie that he set up,"" says author Ganesh Saili who lives in a lovely cottage on the ramp of the Mullingar Hill where Captain Young's potato field probably once stood.So in love was the Captain with Landour that even after he retired and went back to Ireland where he breathed his last on May 24, 1874, his ghost, many say, still comes to visit his old haunt on moonless nights.""Legend has it that on dark, moonless nights, a ghostly rider astride a white horse arrives at the old Mullingar lodge, ties his steed to the remnants of the old wrought iron railing, snaps to attention and... waits for the parade of Redcoats to begin,"" writes Saili in his book 'Tales of Yesteryear, Mussoorie Medley'."

Men, women and children sat glued to the television sets in their homes from morning.Finally, at around 2 p.m. they learnt that the land acquisition by the Left Front government had been cancelled. They erupted in joy and the ambience of the sleepy agrarian town changed dramatically.The villages of Baraberi, Khaserbheri and Goplanagar were the worst affected by land acquisition. Women in these villages came out of their homes blowing conches. People smeared green abir [coloured powder] on each others faces and burst into slogan-shouting.Every locality of Singur was celebrating. People shouted, sang and danced on the streets.We are all overjoyed, extremely happy, said Badal Santra, a farmer whose two and half bighas of land was acquired for Tatas small car project. Look at my thatched house, she said turning emotional. Does someone who owns so much land deserve a home like this? In the past ten years, how much rice and potato I could have cultivated. How many lakhs I could have earned, said the farmer who had refused to accept any compensation.I have been waiting for this day since 2006, said Manorajan Malik, father of Tapasi Malik, who was raped and killed for protesting the land acquisition. I am grateful to God that the farmers have finally got what they fought for."

Raising a child to be vegetarian or dealing with one while one parent enjoys meat can be confusing, says Anuradha Varma For Iftar, each city has its own rich culinary legacy Concluding Iftar with a delectable meal serves as a much-needed reward for the day-long roza without food or water. Though this ritual of breaking the Ramzan fast at dusk usually comprises khajoor (dates) and sherbet, a tradition dating back to the Prophet Muhammads era, special meals tend to vary from one place to another Dessert recipe: Baklava The world famous dessert from TurkeyRamzan calls for a chance to unite over food. As alleys light up to the resounding azaan, abundant delicacies right from luscious Russian kebabs and the pasty goodness of Hyderabadi haleem, to succulent quail spiced and grilled to perfection, are laid out.An overwhelming part of the spread caters to the carnivores out there and the vegetarians are left being mere spectators. Pune Times embarked on a quest to find vegetarian iftar fare in the city and fortunately, didn't come back disappointed. From recipes you can try at home for an iftar party, to delicacies you can indulge in while walking the iftar trails in the city, here's your guide to a vegetarian Ramzan celebration.Vegetarian fish, we read somewhere. Now, isn't that a contrasting name? City-based food and lifestyle blogger Sania Siddiqui feels otherwise. She recently posted a picture of interesting 'vegetarian fish' preparation and obviously, foodies were intrigued by the simplicity of the preparation. Sania shares that it was her mother's recipe. ""My mother used to experiment a lot with various dishes. The Vegetarian fish is an outcome of one of those. It's a variation of samosa, where the cover is shaped like a fish, while the filling can be vegetables or paneer. Non-vegetarians can simply make it with minced meat. The photo I posted was that of a paneer-filled preparation,"" she says.Sania quips that contrary to the customary belief, staple iftar dishes are vegetarian as it is followed by a hearty dinner, which is mostly non-vegetarian. ""Dishes like dahi phulki, made with besan instead of urad dal, vegetable cutlets, chana, matar or chhole chaat and a platter full of various pakoras are typically present on every iftar dastarkhan,"" informs Sania.If you are on a food trail through the city and want to start off with something healthy, head to the bustling Shivaji Market. Isakh Bagwan here serves fresh fruit platters comprising the usual watermelon, pineapple and pear, and the more unusual plum and dragon fruit. ""We begin serving at 4 pm. Fruit plates cost Rs 30, Rs 50 and Rs 100, depending on the quantity,"" says Bagwan, who sells over 100-150 plates a day. These also come with a serving of dates that you can break your fast with.Kafil Anwar Shaikh's famed vegetable samosas are a must-have during Ramzan. His stall is stationed at the Bootee and Sachapir street junction. ""We get customers from all faiths. It is difficult finding vegetarian snacks during Ramzan which is why we've always focused on vegetarian options,"" says Anwar, who records a sale of 500-600 samosas daily during Ramzan. One can also find iftari items like Bombay wadas (Rs 12), kaanda and palak bhajjis (Rs 20) and dal wadas (Rs 8) at his stall.At Azam Campus, New Modikhana, one can only find stalls stocked with non-vegetarian fare, but there's one that caters solely to vegetarians. Shafique Sayyed's stall offers a spicy dum aloo, a tangy chana preparation and piping hot ragda, dressed with spices and chopped onions and coriander, all Rs 20 per portion.To end your vegetarian iftar experience on a sweet note, you can either opt for the halwa paratha, shahi tukda, phirni and falooda, or head to Kausar Baug in Kondhwa. Here, the Middle-Eastern sweet baklava (Rs 30) is available at Abdullah Siddiqui's stall. Abdul also serves varbad (Rs 30), a sweet triangular pastry with a rich and creamy kishta filling, the rawa-based basbousa (Rs 20), baked and topped with desiccated coconut and the fried vermicelli-coated kunafa (Rs 30). ""I might add one more sweet to the table before Ramzan ends,"" says Abdullah, who advises foodies to enjoy while the stocks last.For the DoughMaida (refined flour) - 1 cupSalt - 1 teaspoon or as per tasteAjwain - 1 teaspoonOil - 2 tablespoonWater as requiredFor the FilingPaneer - 150 gmBoiled potato - 1 smallCheese, grated -  cupOnion, capsicum, green chilli (finely chopped) - 2 tablespoonsMayonnaise - 1 tablespoon (optional)Salt and black pepper to tasteKnead a tight dough and keep it aside, covered for 2-3 hours.In another big bowl, mix together paneer, grated cheese and all other ingredients.Take a ball of dough (of table tennis ball size) and flatten it like a puri.

The lemon prices has seen a sharp increase in the last few days. Earlier, the lemon was available for Rs80 per kilogram, now it costs Rs150 to Rs200 per kilogram.APMC Surat secretary Nilesh Thorat told TOI, ""Every day more than 60 trucks arrive at the market yard from Chaklasi, Deesa, Anand, Kheda and Prantij. The transporters have hiked the tariff due to heavy traffic jam on NH-8 near Bharuch. This has led to hike in retail prices of vegetables in the city. There is a short supply of potatoes and lemons. Most of the transporters are not willing to come to Surat due to heavy traffic jam on NH8.""Rasik Patel, a vegetable wholesaler at APMC, said, ""If the trucks have to reach Surat early in the morning, they have to start from their destination a day earlier, due to heavy jam on NH8 near Bharuch. The transporters are demanding more money and we have no other option. We pass on the hike to the customers."""
58f5801d7be9e01a17c9b2bb,Costly labour boosts farm machine sales,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Costly-labour-boosts-farm-machine-sales/articleshow/54009461.cms,2016-09-05,"Across the world, farm machinery outsells tractors two to one, but the availability of abundant and cheap labour has confined farm mechanisation in India to tractors, largely. That's changing now as village youths head for the cities to find better paying work in services and factories.Experts say the shortage of farm labour and its rising cost are among the main reasons for the increasing mechanisation of Indian farming. ""This is not restricted to pockets but spread all across,"" said T R Kesavan, chairman of the technical committee and immediate past president of Tractor Manufacturers' Association. While tractors still outsell other farm equipment like power tillers and combine harvesters, the gap has closed in recent years.The market for specialised machinery, such as threshers, rotavators, transplanters, reapers, zero till drills, laser levellers and power weeders, is worth Rs 32,000 crore now, said Surendra Singh, technical adviser to industry body Agricultural Machinery Manufacturers' Association (AMMA). He added that the industry could touch the Rs 37,000-40,000 crore level in three-five years, growing at its present yearly rate of 5-8%. That will make it as large as the tractor market is now.""Currently, the tractor market is around Rs 40,000 crore while the implements market is around Rs 32,000 crore,"" said Singh.While local players like Tirth Agro Technology that makes Shaktiman brand of implements have cornered 85-90% of the market in the initial shift to mechanisation, the organised players have started paying closer attention to this segment. ""Till recently, the segment was reserved for the small-scale sector,"" said Kesavan. ""Now that it has been thrown open, technologically superior implements and equipment will be introduced.""Tractor market leader Mahindra & Mahindra, for instance, has acquired 33% stake in Mitsubishi Mahindra Agri-Machinery and 35% stake in Finland-based Sampo Rosenlew, which, analysts say, will increase its presence in the agri-implements business in India.Similarly, tractor major Escorts is considering a more significant presence in this market. Ravi Menon, CEO of Escorts' agri-machinery business, said, ""Currently we have tie-ups to pick up implements as part of the total solution package we offer our customers, but we are evaluating options.""German company Lemken and Italian Maschio Gaspardo have set up manufacturing facilities in India. Grimme India, another MNC subsidiary, is offering implements for potato crops. Experts say it's a matter of time before other big global players enter the field as India is a vast opportunity.The size of the global implements business is estimated to be $131 billion in 2018.The migration of unemployed village youths to cities is unlikely to stop now. ""The younger generation is shunning farming because it feels it is a menial job and the remuneration is not commensurate with the effort put in,"" said Kesavan, adding that, ""Studies have shown that 50% of India's population will live in urban areas by 2030. This migration from villages to cities will lead to a lot of proxy farmers taking care of multiple plots of land. When you have large landmasses, you have to mechanise.""Farmers' push for higher crop density is also driving the increasing use of farm implements. It is expected to increase yields by 25-30% in states with a low level of mechanisation at present, and by up to 10% in states like Punjab that are already highly mechanised."

Radhamma, a resident of Excise Colony, said this was the season when vegetables should be available in good quantity and at cheaper rates. If vegetables are costing so much now, it is going to be very tough next summer, she opined.A farmer, N. Venugopal Reddy, said the sudden spurt in prices was due to stoppage of vegetable supplies from Guntur and Krishna districts.Since the trucks transporting them have to pay road tax, they stopped coming to Telangana districts.The AP government is offering subsidy on transport tax and more farmers are supplying their produce  vegetables and flowers  to Bengaluru, he pointed out.According to him, four trucks used to come to Hyderabad carrying Okra everyday. Now they stopped.Naturally, the price of Okra goes up. That is what is happening to other produce as well, he said."

A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest. He said that imported tomatoes should be randomly checked for infection and infected fruits destroyed. He also said that farmers should be trained to detect the symptoms of attack by tuta absoluta.Deploying pheromone traps in all stages of the crop has been found effective against leaf miner.Use of sticky traps or water-oil traps with pheromone bait; deployment of parasitoids and predators too are effective."

The award would be conferred to KVK Harnaut by PM Narendra Modi in the presence of Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh at the foundation day function of ICAR to be held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, on July 16, said its head and senior scientist Dr Sanjeev Kumar. Interestingly, Nalanda is the home district of CM Nitish Kumar.KVK Harnaut has been chosen for the prestigious award for the promotion and spread of the practice of organic farming of vegetables in Nalanda district on a big scale, besides the two other equally spectacular achievements of setting the world records in paddy and potato production by two different farmers, among other achievements.The significance of promotion of organic farming of vegetables among the three notable achievements could also be gauged from the fact that today - even in the age of the use of high dose of pesticides and chemical fertilisers for increased agricultural yield - the ""organic farming"" is the buzzword the world over. 265 farmers of Nalanda have formed a federation of producers of organic vegetables, called 'Shere Bihar Farmers Groups,' which has received C-3 certificate from the organisation Ecocert for the export of their vegetable yield.KVK Harnaut senior scientist Dr Kumar said the vegetables produced by them through organic farming methods are exported to the Middle East countries and Bangladesh, as well as to metropolitan cities of Maharashtra, West Bengal, and even to neighbouring Jharkhand for the high-end customers.Dr Kumar said KVK Harnaut is the ""child"" of CM Nitish, as he opened it in 1992 when he was Union agriculture minister. Initially, the method of organic farming of vegetables was started by 30 farmers in Sohdih village over 15 hectares of land in 2010-11, but the acreage has spread to 5,900 hectares of land by 2015, he added.In several ways, KVK Harnaut also became a part of the saga of Bihar turnaround story from 2006, especially in the first term of CM Nitish.Sumant Kumar, a farmer from Darveshpura village, set a world record in paddy production by getting a yield of 224 quintals of paddy per hectare of land for which he was given the award of best farmer by ICAR in 2012-13, apart from awards by the Punjab and Bihar governments.Similarly, Rakesh Kumar from Sohdih village also set world record in potato production by producing 1,088 quintals of potato per hectare of land that also brought to him best farmer award at International Potato Expo, New Delhi, in 2014, apart from recognition from Punjab government and Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour (Bhagalpur)."
