Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter. The dish brings out the flavour of Bombay duck like never before.Are you bored of eating the same old burgers? So, here's a twist. Chef Manu Nair, from a Kondhwa-based restaurant, shares, ""With the introduction of Uthly we hope to get young consumers intrigued about the cuisine. Uthly is an innovative healthy alternative to a burger made from healthy South Indian ingredients.""A lip-smacking combination of seven layers of authentic South Indian goodies, right from toasted rice cake on the base, topped with crispy lettuce, garden fresh salad, Malabar croquettes, special sauce, podi-coated lentil cakes and finally covered with a toasted rice cake on top.A vada pav needs no introduction. It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack."" He also sells ragi gola and Pandarpur ragda pav. ""People were sceptical at first, but now they come from across the city to relish this,"" he adds.Palm-sized modaks in bowls with soaked layers of tamarind and mint chutney, curd, spicy groundnuts and a sprinkle of chaat masala and coriander leaves. The dumpling is filled with carrots, potato, capsicum and more.Imagine a Chinese twist to your favourite paneer makhni. Delicious? Chef Vishwesh agrees. He says, ""We wanted to create a new taste and serve a different recipe to our guests. It is difficult to acquire a new taste, however when you mix two yummy connotations (read paneer makhni and noodles) you are bound to get a winner.""Creamy, rich and tangy, paneer makhani gravy tossed together in a wok with noodles. The bland noodles get a lift in taste and aroma with the makhni gravy. You can experiment a little more by adding dollops of butter or fresh cream.Nothing can go wrong with tandoori chicken. A favourite among everyone the, dish gets a twist when combined with dimsums. Chef Vishwesh Khanna, from Pimpri, shares, ""The USP of a tandoori dimsum is the texture and flavour. The meat is cooked just right and the soft, slightly roasted covering adds to this flavour.""Tandoori dimsums are stuffed with shredded bits of tandoori chicken. The brownish tinge on the covering adds to the flavour. The strong flavours tickle your palate and the soft cover of the dumpling melts in your mouth. It is a perfect combination of spices."

The quintessential Indian snack, weighing 332 kg, was made at Gopal Nagar colony of Maharajganj district. Thousands of people thronged the venue where the feat was being achieved. The group, led by 20-year-old Ritesh Soni, has now approached the Guinness Book Committee to get their feat ratified.Soni , who runs a small roadside restaurant at Gopal Nagar, says that he was inspired by the world's largest jalebi which was made by another group in the district.

58f591937be9e01a17c9c98b,"With mercury, veggie prices too going up",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/With-mercury-veggie-prices-too-going-up/articleshow/51674123.cms,2016-04-04,"Nagpur: The summers are beginning to burn a hole in the consumers' pockets. With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses. The government really needs to bring down the budget of kitchen, especially of basic food itemsSheela Brahmankar, 50, govt employee"

Vegetables like tomato and potato are being sold at Rs 60 and Rs 20 per kg while most green vegetables are priced above Rs 40 per kg. Lack of rain has badly affected the local harvest as well as supply from other states, and is the main reason for the price rise, insiders said.""It is nearly a fortnight or more the prices of all vegetables are going over the roofs. It has become really unmanageable to give a balanced diet to children these days as pulses and vegetables have gone beyond the reach of common man,"" said Bandita Kar, a school teacher.At a time when there should be continuous rain a drought-like situation prevails at most parts of the state. ""The rainfall in the second week of June was inadequate for crops and affected cultivation. The situation is similar in other states, leading to a drop in the supply of green vegetables,"" said Sudarshan Sahu, a vegetable vendor in the Unit-I market here.Prices of most vegetables doubled in the last few weeks. Beans are being sold for Rs 100 per kg while drumsticks fetch Rs 140 for every kilo. Brinjal is selling at Rs 50 per kg while lady finger, bitter gourd and ridge gourd comes with a tag of Rs 40, spiny gourd and parval at Rs 50.For vegetables the city generally depends on nearby rural areas like Nimapada, Balianta, Pipili, Niali and so on. Vegetables also come from districts like Jajpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack, Nayagarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj and Puri districts.""Odisha is one of the largest producers of green vegetables but due to lack of proper crop management and storage facilities it has to depend on other states for 20% of its vegetable consumption,"" said an officer in the state horticulture department."
58f597aa7be9e01a357a3c9e,Bites by the beach,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Bites-by-the-beach/articleshow/53155465.cms,2016-07-12,"Navigating through the Elliot's Beach Road on a typical Sunday evening can not only be a daunting task, but can also leave you hungry at the end of it. But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up. The purple coloured kala khatta which is sweet and tangy is a universal favourite. We procure the ice from the Besant Nagar depot. It is made with clean water,"" says Shaktivel."

Now, the department and PepsiCo want to grow potatoes in nearly 1,000 acres from October 2016.Confirming this news to TOI, Visakhapatnam district horticulture assistant director G Prabhakara Rao said the FC3 variety is cultivated in Himachal Pradesh and specially meant for potato chips. PepsiCo is keen on using the potatoes for its chips units across the globe. ""Our department and PepsiCo conducted trials in Kuppam in Chittoor and Vizag Agency last season and the MNC representatives were satisfied with the results from Vizag Agency and have confirmed that they will go ahead with cultivation in 1,000 acres in the Agency area. The ITDA Paderu financially supported us in the trial run by sharing 50% of the input cost which is around Rs 30,000 per acre,"" Prabhakara Rao said. The department will procure around 1,000 tonnes of seeds from Himachal Pradesh.A PepsiCo representative said, ""Vizag Agency's weather is most favourable for the FC3 potatoes. We hope that we will get a good yield in Vizag. We will start the work from October this year.""Prabhakara Rao further said that they got nearly 4 to 5 tonnes of potatoes per acre in the trial session and they hope to generate 7 to 8 tonnes per acre during actual cultivation. ""Farmers will get good profits from the crop. A Rs 50000 investment will be required for an acre's crop and the returns are likely to be Rs 1 lakh. Priority will be given to local tribals to grow the potatoes. Only three agency mandals, namely, Araku, Dumbriguda and Hukumpeta are viable for the FC3 potatoes cultivation,"" the officer said.""These FC3 potatoes are not good for commercial purpose like local market. However, the potatoes which get rejected by PepsiCo will be given to commercial markets,"" Prabhakara Rao said.According to horticulture scientists, the FC3 potato is resistant to diseases, gives good yields than ordinary varieties, has thin skin, is easily washable and boiled and needs less fertiliser. All these qualities make it ideal for making chips.Horticulture officials said the MNC may set up a potato chips manufacturing unit in Vizag if they are satisfied with the potatoes cultivation here in the long run. The state government is also planning to give sops to various MNCs for their units in the state, the officer added."

Mamata's support is important because the BJP doesn't have the numbers to ensure the safe passage of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha.According to experts, the switch-over from VAT (value added tax) to GST is likely to benefit consuming states like West Bengal more than producing states such as Gujarat. Mitra has been holding a series of meetings with the state finance ministers to arrive at a golden mean. One of the major issues coming in the way of a seamless rollout of the GST is the proposed 1% extra GST on producing states. The Congress has opposed it as the proposal has come from Gujarat. Besides, there are other issues like some states have demanded that percentage of revenue-neutral rate of GST should be put into amendment.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and state FM Amit Mitra will be pushing hard for a consensus by bringing in some amendments over the tax proposal to reach a consensus to marry the polarities between states and political parties. Other than the economic considerations, GST has also become a political hot potato with the Narendra Modi government trying to gain confidence of the India Inc through this major tax reform. On Tuesday, Mitra will be placing the seventh GST draft in the meeting where as many as 20 state finance ministers will be present. When contacted, state FM and chairman of GST panel, Amit Mitra said, ""With Mamata Banerjee taking charge for the second term, such a national event on a significant reform agenda in city makes us proud.""With the Bengal chief minister taking a lead role among states to introduce GST, Kolkata has been chosen the venue of the meeting. This is the first time that a national-level tax reform meeting is being held in the city, a state official said. Even the VAT panel led by former state finance minister Asim Dasgupta didn't ever have a meeting in Kolkata.While giving a push to the GST initiative at the meeting of the chambers, the Bengal chief minister held that the micro, small and medium industrial units in Bengal will gain out of the unified tax procedure, bringing relief to a whole lot of people engaged in this sector."

But more on that later.The soft-spoken Niranjana Nandi, along with her son Parth, runs the cafe now. It was Niranjana's father-in-law Shailendranath, originally from Calcutta, who started the cafe and put the dish on the menu, at the same time the cinema hall was inaugurated around 1932. Shailendranath passed away when his son Prabhat was just eight years old. He took over a few years later and ran it for a long time. When Prabhat, too, died over a decade ago, Niranjana, his wife, took over. ""But it was my father-in-law who made the chops famous,"" she says.So famous, in fact, that there was a time before independence, when only the British would visit the cafe, and Indians would stay away. ""Partly because we served non-vegetarian food and partly because they felt uncomfortable in the company of the sahibs,"" Niranjana reasons. The firangs loved the mild flavour of the chops so much, they would tip the servers generously. ""The servers would be able to save their entire salary,"" Niranjana recalls the apocryphal tale with a smile.In later years, the snack became legendary, attracting film legends. ""Shammi Kapoor was very fond of them. He would accompany his father Prithviraj who would come to Nagpur to stage plays. Shammi ji would help him set up the tent on the premises on Variety theatre and then come to the cafe to dig into the chops and kheema samosas,"" Niranjana says, recounting something she has heard but not seen. Another of these stories: ""Once, Dilip Kumar ji came too. But he remained inside a black car and his driver came inside to get the chops."" And Niranjana remembers seeing Jalal Agha at the cafe herself. ""He even suggested to my husband to open a branch in Bombay,"" she recollects. Former Union minister Vasant Sathe and former state minister Satish Chaturvedi were fans of the chops too.Shammi Kapoor would make it a point to call for the chops on his visits to Nagpur, where his sister Urmilla is married into the Sial family. ""I've heard he would love to have them with his drinks,"" Niranjana says. Urmilla's nephew Gagan, a businessman and foodie, also grew up eating the chops. ""Oh, they are really fresh and addictive,"" he says, adding that many picnics in the old days would be incomplete without a parcel of the chops. ""Even today, I have to carry them when I visit my out-of-town relatives,"" he says.The consistent taste comes, in no small part, due to the fact that the Nandis have had the same meat supplier ever since the cafe began, says Niranjana. Since the recipe is from Kolkata, has she ever tried the original version in the City of Joy? ""Yes, of course,"" she says. ""But there, they call it mutton cutlet. They keep asking me why we call it chops."" Chops, chaap, cutlet.

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe spiralling cost of tomatoes may make shopping for vegetables costlier for consumers. The price of this staple vegetable has shot up by nearly three times from last week, leaving many consumers in shock.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, a kilo of tomatoes was priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 last week.This week, a box of tomatoes consisting of 25 kilos cost Rs. 1,250. In the wholesale market, the price is Rs. 50 per kilo. Retailers sell a kilo at Rs. 60, he said.Like tomatoes, the cost of a number of vegetables has skyrocketed. This was mainly due to less production in summer, he said, adding, Vellore gets its supply of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh. Supply is hit due to low production due to the heat conditions.Vegetables such as brinjal, beans and avarakkai cost more as the yield is low.A kilo of brinjal (thorn variety) costs Rs. 40, while buying beans could burn a hole in the pockets of consumers. A kilo of beans is priced at Rs. 80 to 100, while avarakkai costs Rs. 60, he said.Onions offer consolation for consumers as the price continue to be normal at Rs. 10 to 15. In fact, this was less when compared to last months rate, Mr. Balu noted.The cost of other vegetables are (a kilo): small onion Rs. 40, potato  Rs. 20 to Rs. 24, drumstick Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, carrot  Rs. 40, cabbage  Rs. 20, ladys finger  40, snake gourd Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, bitter gourd  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, green chillies  Rs. 50, ginger  Rs. 50, beetroot  Rs. 30 and a bunch of coriander is Rs. 30 to Rs. 40.Mr. Balu added that it was not the season for peas and cauliflower. Cauliflower might be sold but it will not be of good quality, he added.For consumers, there might not be any relief from these skyrocketing prices for now.He said that the rates of vegetables would continue to be high for at least a month."

58f5af177be9e01a357a58e0,Why Donald Trump is spooking Indian outsourcers with his flip-flops on immigration,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Why-Donald-Trump-is-spooking-Indian-outsourcers-with-his-flip-flops-on-immigration/articleshow/52061247.cms,2016-05-01,"More than his 20-minute visa interview, Kaladhar Reddy remembers a 90-minute visit to 'The Visa Temple', officially called the Chilkur Balaji Temple on the banks of the Osman Sagar in Hyderabad. On a Thursday evening in June 2015, Reddy, a 20-something systems analyst, was part of a throng of thousands jostling through the temple, seeking divine intervention for what would turn out to be a successful, if nervy, visit to the American consulate in Mumbai.For Reddy (who requested his name be changed) and thousands of others targeting an onsite stint or, better yet, a relocation with a technology outsourcer, divine intervention is the last-gasp step to sealing the deal. Reddy now lives in San Francisco. But for many others, the challenges remain daunting. ""The process of moving to the US was nerve-wracking,"" says Reddy. ""Even now, there's always a concern, at the back of the mind, about how much time you have in the US and whether your visa will be renewed.""Still, not everyone is quaking with fear at potential changes to immigration norms  and resultant aftershocks to the visa system. While presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be making shrill claims on immigration and job losses in the US, Indians working in the country aren't overly concerned. ""Trump is saying all this to get Americans' attention,"" says a 30-something engineer at TCS, who is based in the US.She does not believe much will come of his stand against outsourcing. However, she thinks, the fear Trump is tapping into is not unfounded. ""In India, too, there are concerns in many states about outsiders taking away the jobs of locals."" She can't understand how Trump has come this far in the presidential race as no American she knows supports him.Another Indian engineer who works with a tech giant in Silicon Valley believes that even if Trump wants to do something about outsourcing as president, it may not be easy. ""I am told getting a bill on this passed through Congress is going to be hard. Also, if he becomes president, this may not be top priority for him.""India's outsourcing industry is in the midst of a painful transition and growth has slowed  industry lobby Nasscom has forecast 12% growth for 2016-17, down from 20% in the rah-rah 2000s  even as wildly fluctuating immigration rhetoric in the ongoing US presidential elections, led by Trump, has muddied the waters further.The industry has based its growth on the ability to remotely deliver software services to clients and use a small number of employees on site to help customers roll out the software and systems they have built.While an on-site (on the customer premises) job has been a much-sought-after perk for coders for decades, immigration and visa norms have been a growing hindrance, with costs rising and caps being placed on their issue. In early April, the cap of 85,000 for H1-B visas (including 20,000 for students with a US master's degree or higher) was quickly hit and a lottery system was triggered to select applicants.Companies are aware of the immigration tightrope they walk with their technology talent. In October 2013, Infosys agreed to pay $34 million to end a US investigation into improper use of these visas, even if the company didn't publicly admit to any wrongdoing. The company agreed to take steps to improve its internal processes and outside monitoring too. Infosys declined interview requests for this story.For India's outsourcing industry, trouble is on two fronts. First, immigration concerns (which are seemingly denting the image of companies more than its financials Infosys says higher visa costs will result in a 0.3% erosion in margins); and second, the essential but painful shift in strategy. With automation primed to eat into the Indian outsourcing industry's bread-and-butter business, companies are scrambling to reboot themselves, to focus on higher-value tasks.Industry observers admit that there are concerns on both fronts. ""US elections have always been a hot potato for the Indian outsourcing industry,"" says Avinash Vashistha, former chairman and MD of Accenture India and author of The Offshore Nation. ""Immigration, work visas and exports have always been an emotional leverage that US presidential candidates use to churn emotions.""While these statements have largely been described as election rhetoric by some observers, there could be some pain for the outsourcing industry soon.""We can expect certain restrictive measures as a result of constant lobbying over the years,"" says Vashistha, while arguing that the industry shouldn't make any hasty move because of statements by candidates. Vashistha should know this well. For four years, he helmed the India operations of Accenture, leading the growth in headcount from 50,000 to over 1,30,000, as the company made India its largest presence globally.""Indian companies have been hearing a lot of rhetoric around the immigration issue and visa... and as in the past the companies may end up having to recruit more locally and use sub-contractors more,"" says Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy & marketing officer for Tech Mahindra, India's fifth largest software exporter. ""The only concerns we see are procurement fees and the complexities and cost attached to hiring attorneys (to manage any legal action around this subject). That will remain a painful area for our industry unless the government intervenes.""Mitra contends that proposed legislations to cap short-term H-1B visa numbers would be counter-productive. ""A legislation to cut down the number of H-1B visas by 15,000 and proposing a priority parameter for the highest wage-earner will be counterproductive for the growth of the US technology industry,"" he adds. ""American policy has compensated for the shortage of skilled workers in the country with a carefully calibrated approach that balances immigration with various measures to encourage STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) education and training for Americans.""For companies like Accenture and its peers, the big challenge is decoding what Trump and his rivals mean with their statements on immigration. For example, the billionaire candidate went, in just six months, from being a staunch opponent of outsourcing (and the claimed job losses as a result) to offering to fly in skilled labour to the US.""Trying to understand Trump seems to be a national pastime in the US and no one knows what he really stands for,"" says Peter Bendor-Samuel, chief executive of outsourcing advisory Everest Group. ""There is clearly a growing streak of populism in today's US politics, with both Republican and Democratic parties talking about reexamining long-held assumptions around trade.""As candidates  and the future president among them  reexamine these trade norms, rules around visas and immigration could be tightened. ""What could happen is that visa laws may be changed to make H1-Bs and L1s (temporary work visas that allow American firms to hire foreign workers) more difficult and expensive to get... this would affect the profitability of the Indian firms but not stop their progress,"" adds Bendor-Samuel.What the Trump-led hysteria over immigration and job losses could do is worsen the anti-India sentiment, say experts. ""What Trump has done is to make racism and xenophobia socially acceptable. He is whipping up anti-immigrant, religious, and nationalistic hysteria... this is having a negative effect on businesses and will hurt India,"" says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at the Arthur & Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance, Stanford University. ""Things have changed for the worse in America because of this election campaign and Trump. There will be scars long after the elections are over and the popular sentiment will be anti-Indian IT,"" adds Wadhwa.While he contends that Trump has little chance of being elected US president, it is the anti-foreigner, antitrade hysteria that he is whipping up that is harmful. ""He is saying whatever the least educated and most ignorant people in the electorate want to hear,"" adds Wadhwa. ""Trump is a ruthless businessman himself  he does whatever he has to minimise costs and has outsourced projects himself.""Outsourcing veterans such as Raman Roy, who sold his BPO venture Spectramind to Wipro in July 2002 and then founded Quatrro, think that outsourcing has gone too mainstream for the industry to be impacted heavily. ""In IT and BPO, close to a million people would be working out of the US today,"" says Roy. ""Offshoring and outsourcing are a part of life now, they are part of the American DNA. You can rave and rant, shout and make noises, but you can't wish them away.""Despite Trump's anti-trade tirade, Roy reckons that it is premature to be bothered by his over-the-top statements. ""Rhetoric is one thing, reality is another. After all, when they offshore, it is making American companies more profitable,"" he adds. ""It's not like 'India is a poor country, so let's give 5,000 jobs to India'. It doesn't work that way."" Agreeing with Wadhwa on Trump's doublespeak, Roy argues that eventually companies  and not the government  will take a call on jobs.Wadhwa on Trump's doublespeak, Roy argues that eventually companies  and not the government  will take a call on jobs.According to Shivendra Singh, Nasscom's VP for global trade, India's outsourcers make a huge positive impact in making many American corporations globally competitive. ""Low cost is not the rationale for bringing in employees,"" Singh says.""There is a severe shortage of STEM talent in the US  the country's own labour department said there were 3.4 million unfulfilled jobs in this field.""Despite these contentions, India's outsourcers are hit hard, with ""50:50 companies"" (which have over 50 employees and at least half of them on H-1B visas in the US), paying a higher visa fee, under the Omnibus Appropriation Act. ""We protest these moves and have even raised these anti-competitive measures with the WTO,"" says Singh.Away from the immigration hullabaloo, India's outsourcers are also trying to recast their businesses in these challenging times  and the rejig couldn't come any sooner. ""The Indian industry needs to transform itself before it is too late,"" says Wadhwa. ""It is in serious trouble.""Others such as Everest's Bendor-Samuel ascribe this struggle to advances in service delivery automation (SDA), which makes labour arbitrage less important and the ability to embrace new technologies and ways of doing business vital. ""It is highly unlikely that Trump or (Bernie) Sanders' populism will affect the Indian industry,"" he argues. ""But when combined with the industry disruption being driven by SDA, it is likely that the industry is going to change over the next few years.""Companies are already racing to keep pace with these changes. Mitra of Tech Mahindra says his company is focusing on implementation of non-linear initiatives using automation and software platforms, by enabling its clients to digitise their processes and by incubating disruptive solutions internally and by partnering with startups externally.In-house, Tech Mahindra works with a dozen ""startups"" and has a couple of partners outside to try and devise breakthrough technology solutions for customers and the firm even has a start-up garage to incubate out-of-the-box thinking by employees.Former Accenture India chief Vashistha thinks this recast  and the growing noise over visas and immigration -- is a good opportunity for the industry to overhaul itself. ""The digital transformation is increasing the demand for cloud-based services; driving consumers, services and businesses towards mobility; making businesses and consumers more connected through social media; and throwing a plethora of data that can provide very valuable insights,"" he says. ""Yes, it is time for innovation to boost growth.""(Additional reporting by Indulekha Aravind, G Seetharaman, Ishani Duttagupta and Rajiv Singh)"

The drop in prices might be good news for consumers, but it is not so for shopkeepers.Selling tomatoes at such low rates is not profitable for traders.

The prices will also remain at the same level.""Vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, okra, ridge gourd and potato have become costlier in the retail market, but prices of coriander, spinach ( palak) and fenugreek ( methi) are stable and have not shown an increase.Chillies, on the other hand, have become cheaper by around 28%, with the retail price falling from Rs 70 per kg last month to Rs 50 per kg this month.The price rise has affected household budgets, with many people tweaking their diet to meet expenses.Sonali Khairnar, a homemaker, said, ""The vegetable prices have increased a lot in the last three four weeks. It has really become difficult to meet expenses. Instead of vegetables, I have been cooking dishes like pithla and paratha.""Despite the overall increase in vegetable prices, the onion has become cheaper and is being sold at Rs 10-12 per kg in Nashik's retail markets. The retail price of onions had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik and Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other metro cities in August last year. But now, it is one of the cheapest vegetables in retail market and its price is likely to remain the same for around a month."

But when it comes to Goa's range of desserts, the bebinca undoubtedly rules the roost. For those uninitiated in Goa's culinary traditions, the bebinca may be a simple looking layered dish, but in reality it is a huge complexity of flavours with a labour-intensive preparation process.While it is made up of ingredients that are almost always accessible in any Goan kitchen - coconut milk, egg yolks, sugar, white flour, ghee and a hint of nutmeg or vanilla essence for flavouring, the making of a bebinca, which is often referred to as the queen of Goan desserts, is a rather long and tedious process as it has to be cooked one layer at a time. Yes, the bebinca, whether you choose to make just one at a time or many, will take its maker anywhere between one and a half to two hours of hard work to prepare.Restaurateur and author of 'A day in the Goan Kitchen' Ivo Coutinho fondly recalls his mother preparing the bebinca using the traditional burning coconut husk method. ""The kind of smoky flavour that this imparts to the bebinca cannot be replicated in the ones prepared in ovens,"" he says. Another key difference between the two cooking methods is the texture of the end product. ""Earlier bebinca was prepared for festive occasions and consumed on the same day. Since preservation was not an issue, the ratio of flour used was much lower. This gave the sweet it a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture,"" he says.As for the layers , while tradition says seven layers, Coutinho says that this number can vary from four to 13. ""There is no hard and fast rule that it has to be a certain number of layers. It depends on the preference of thickness of each layer,"" he says.Yet another version of the dessert is made in Goa wherein the core ingredient is a universal favourite, the potato. The potato bebinca aka Bebinca de Batata, may not be as popular as it's seven-layered cousin, but those who've tasted it or who make it rave about the delicacy. One of them is Vasco-based Melissa Martins. While Martins prepares her version using regular cooking potatoes, she says that it can also be prepared using sweet potatoes.Elaborating on the differences between a regular bebinca and the potato bebinca, she says, ""The main difference is that while the former is cooked and in layers, the potato bebinca is baked and in one solid layer. Otherwise, like the regular bebinca, the potato version too is characterized by the richness of its taste. Also, for a potato bebinca, the boiled and mashed potato has to be mixed with the rest of the ingredients - coconut milk, sugar, flour, essence and a dash of colour - and once it forms a smooth consistency, it had to be cooked out for a bit to thicken the consistency, before it is poured into a lined tray and baked."""
