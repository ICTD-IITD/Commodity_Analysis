The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

On entering the tribal district, one can see multi-storied houses, lush green fields along with hotels, guest houses and home stays. The rapid growth in tourism has already sparked discussions on having a master plan for sustainable tourism. However, not many would know that some five decades back the snowbound district was deprived of even the most basic facilities, and that its people's fortune changed only after they took the cooperative route in the 1960s and worked together.At 2 persons per sq km, Lahaul and Spiti district has India's lowest population density. It has a population of 3.31 lakh for a geographical area of 13,833 sq kms. Though the district remains cut off from the rest of the world for six months in winter, people here have made rapid development and many of them not only own properties in the district but also in Kullu, Manali and other parts of country.Before the Centre thought of constructing a road to connect Manali with Lahaul and Spiti and then Ladakh, people used to walk over a 13,050-foot mountain pass to reach Manali. A Lahaul and Spiti-based historian, Chhering Dorje, said that before the 1962 war, Lahaul was deprived of road connectivity and people used to cross Rohtang Pass out of compulsion only, either for trade or for employment. ""In summer, it would take 3-4 days to travel between Lahaul and Manali. In winter, the journey wuld extend to 5-6 days and even more in case of bad weather,"" he said.Dorje said construction of the road from Manali to Ladakh started turning the wheels of development in the district. A former MLA from Lahaul-Spiti, BJP's Dr Ram Lal Markanda, said had people not taken the cooperative route, the valley would not have witnessed the prosperity visible today.""Seeds of development were sown on May 28, 1966, when Lahaul Potato Growers Co-operative Marketing cum Processing Society Limited (LPS) was formed with initial an membership of 20 growers, under the then Punjab State Cooperative Societies Act,"" he said. ""With passage of time, almost every house in Lahaul had a member in LPS. Their united efforts helped ensure better marketing of seed potato. This help fetch a good price for farmers.""At present, LPS is known for varied activities, ranging from basic necessities of people to secondary needs like supply of petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, and even procurement of agricultural and horticultural produce. After witnessing the success of LPS, Lahaul residents had formed another cooperative society to market hops.""Through the society, people had started selling their produce to beer-producing companies for a good price. But, later, farmers stopped producing hops and tuned towards sowing green pea and apple,"" said Premjeet Phurpa, a resident of Phura village in Lahaul.A retired block development officer, Balbir Singh Yarki, after seeing big hydro power companies showing interest in tapping the hydro power potential of Lahaul valley, had motivated the people to form a cooperative society to generate hydro power through their own projects. Today, residents of around 30 villages of Chandra Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district have scripted a new story of empowerment as around 850 members have become shareholders of the Chandra Valley Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society Limited, which has bagged a small hydro power project in the valley.Sonam Dolma of Shashin village and one of the shareholders in the society said the society was leap for Lahaul residents from producing potatoes and green peas to producing electiricity. ""When big hydro power companies can come here to exploit our resources, then cannot we step forward to reap the benefits of development?"" she added.Yarki said other residents of Lahaul had formed Shansha Hydro Power Project Cooperative Society, which has 140 members to venture into hydro power. He said the cooperative movement in Lahaul was deep-rooted and people knew its benefits. ""It is only through the cooperative movement that we have been successful so far,"" he said."

In their death throes, some of the canines who ate the poisoned bait apparently fell into the canal, and their bodies lay there  the prime source of water for the Government Medical College Hospital in Thrissur and households in the area.Complaint by dog-ownerSince stray dogs dying generally escape popular attention, the incident came to light only after four pet dogs died after chewing on the meat dumped along the canal side in the Gramala area in Mulankunnathukavu. One of the dog owners, C.K. Ravi, lodged a police complaint on May 31, in which he accused a Chinese potato farmer in the vicinity of setting the poisoned meat trap to get rid of stray dogs.A bigger concern stems from the fact that the putrid dog carcasses found on the canal bed could contaminate drinking water as it has just been released into the canal from the Peechi reservoir.It appears that several dogs were killed there in this manner, said Sally Kannan, honorary animal welfare officer of the Animal Welfare Board of India and outreach coordinator of the India chapter of Human Society International.Case registeredP.P. Joy, sub-inspector of the Thrissur Medical College station, said the police had registered a case under Sections pertaining to polluting water in a way that triggers contagious diseases, and causing general environmental pollution.The police are awaiting the post-mortem and chemical analysis reports to ascertain the cause of the dogs death, he said.Incident came to light when 4 pet dogs died after chewing on the meat strewn around"

Ahmedabad, where eating out is almost like a norm, can be easily described as a foodie's paradise. With newer cuisines and tastes now ruling the palate of global Gujaratis, even the traditional Gujarati thali has gone through a delectable tranformation. From Chinese samosas, manchurian, dal-bati, nachos , Punjabi to Bengali sweets to churma laddoo and more, the thali has embraced essential elements of a melting pot  combining both modern and traditional in a delicious spread. AT checks out the thali.""For the longest of time the Gujarati thali was all about, two sabzis (green vegetables and pulses) one potato sabzi, 1-2 farsan (savories), dal/kadhi , rice, assorted Indian bread basket (chapattis, biscuit bhakris, puris ) one sweet dish along with chutneys, salad, buttermilk and pickles,"" say food industry observers. ""The thali was a mix of various textures ranging from flat, coarse, crunchy blended with an array of varied tastes. While there are dining halls in the city that still serve the original thali , other places have started including non-Gujarati elements to please the changing food habits and palate of the people.""With many restaurants and even food wagons dishing out some delicious different cuisines, the market for food has expanded making it a tough place to survive. While there are many thali joints that have stayed true to their original menu, there are other places who have included different cuisines to maximize their profit.""One of the major reasons why the thali has undergone such an evolution is because the city is witnessing a cosmopolitan population. Along with people from other states, you also see foreigners travelling to Ahmedabad quite frequently. So the restaurants have started including items that these people can easily relate to along with enjoying some new tastes,"" says restaurateur Abhay Mangaldas.Praveen Purohit, city based restaurateur feels that items like mini idli, Mexican tacos , nachos, spring rolls et al are there to fulfill the demand. He says, ""Not only our guests come from different parts of the globe, they also have good knowledge about food and are open to try something different. So we make it a point to include a few items that suit their taste buds as well. Another major reason is that majority of people find the thali too sweet for their taste, be it dal/kadhi or even the sabzi. So, we started infusing elements that balance out their taste.""While the city's population is going multicultural, there are many new thali places that are coming up at newer and posher locations, says Dilip Thakkar, founder of one of the Gujarati thali dining halls in the city. ""Initially, dining halls and restaurants serving authentic Gujarati thali were restricted to areas like Ashram Road, Usmanpura, Navrangpura and certain areas in the walled city. But now these restaurants have expanded to newer areas. And infrastructural cost goes up when you expand your business to a more expensive locality. To break even, or to make profit, you need more attractive dishes, which then amounts to the addition of popular and exotic dishes.""I love to indulge in fusion food. I have also been to restaurants and dining halls, where there are lot of items that are not there in the traditional Gujarati thali. Although, I wouldn't mind indulging in such a fusion thali occasionally, I still prefer the authentic Gujarati thali that has all the elements of Gujarat.Eating out means trying out something different or maybe a different version of your favourite cuisine. I have had Gujarati thali that had starters like samosa and manchurain and I think this inclusion is great as foodies from various parts of the world can relate to such items. They can relish the authentic Gujarati tastes whilst still having something that they love to indulge in.I love gorging on the authentic Gujarati thali, as it has many different textures and tastes. Although I'm not fond of fusion food, I would prefer if varied varieties of the same dish that are made in different parts of Gujarat are included instead of including different dishes that are not even a part of the traditional thali."

This disclosure could become a political hot potato in the upcoming West Bengal polls.Documents belonging to the PMO on the Justice Mukherjee commission of inquiry mention that some files, including a proposal to keep Bose's ashes in a memorial at Delhi's Red Fort, were either not ""readily traceable"" or ""destroyed"". Most of the files are likely to have been destroyed in the 60s and 70s, one file noting points out.The commission had sought photocopies of orders regarding destruction of filesdocuments concerning Netaji as also photocopies of the lists of files documents destroyed.The PMO had informed the commission that ""one file no. 12(226)56-PM has been destroyed on 6.3.1972; certain documents of file no. 23(156)51-PM have been destroyed while recording that file; and one file no. 2(381)60-66PM (proposal to bring Shri Subhas Chandra Bose's ashes from Tokyo to put up a memorial to him in front of the Red Fort in Delhi) is not readily tracea ble in our records"". It is not immediate ly clear why these documents were de stroyed or what their exact contents were, though there have been reports that Bose's death in the 1945 aircrash was a smokescreen allowing him to es cape to the then USSR.Author Anuj Dhar, who has done ex tensive research on Netaji, said, ""I hate to draw this parallel, but just as the gov ernment is making an inquiry into missing correspondence concerning the Ishrat Jahan case, they should find out how documents of historical im portance were destroyed by Congress governments. Under which rule of the official manual was a file concerning Subhas Bose's death destroyed in 1972 when the matter was under investiga tion by a judicial commission?"" The 50 files declassified on Tuesday include 10 from the PMO, 10 from MHA and 30 from MEA, and pertain to the period 1956-2009. The declassification of files on Netaji was started on his 119th birth anniversary, January 23, this year, when PM Modi released the firs lot of 100 files."

Now, the 86-year-old is back in the city she was born taking the community count up by one. And, she has taken upon herself the onerous task of keeping the authentic Jewish flavours alive for her nine-member strong community. Yes, you read it right: nine.Demographers put the strength of the Jewish community in the city at less than 20, but the members are rather strict about who they call ""pure"". Those that have married ""outside"" the community are strictly not ""pure"" Jews.""I have come back to the city because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most...but I am keeping the flame alive,"" she says.Silliman also happens to be among the last keepers of the community's ancient recipes and has decided to chronicle the unique tastes for posterity.""Even the food that Jews here have today is not what we are permitted by our religion. There's so much of mix and match that most of the authentic cuisine that is over 5,000 years old and has its roots in the Middle East, is lost. I am trying to keep the tradition alive by documenting the recipes and rustling up dishes for feasts,"" says Silliman.Jewish food is special because Jews just can't eat cause Jews just can't eat anything and everything, Silliman says. Their food -kosher -has to abide by strict dietary laws which not only lay down what is forbidden but also the process of cooking, the ingredients and the kitchen specifications. Kosher, for example, does not permit meat to be mixed with milk or milk products.So, neither can you mix the two while cooking, nor can you consume milk or milk products after having meat. Flower Silliman says: ""Judaism has a great similari ty with Hinduism so far as its antiquity and dietary specifications go. It's another matter that most followers of both religions have drifted away from these guidelines... perhaps because they have often found it difficult to cope with such restrictions. I am not saying this by way of criticism, but the fact is that cuisines, and even cultures, become extinct because of such interpolation.""A traditional sit-down Jewish feast on Friday night can ideally start with beet khatta with koobah (beet soup with chicken or vegetable balls), followed by Jewish roast chicken, which is different from the European roast in the kind of marinades and spices used. ""The authentic Jewish roast will be far milder, both in flavour and sharpness, compared to the European roast,"" Silliman says.Kosher allows Jews to only have fish that have scales, and not those with shells (prawns, crabs or lobsters). ""So you have items like fish shoofta, which is minced fish skewers. Vegetable lovers have choices like vegetable mahashas, which is stuffed tomatoes and capsicum.But the magic is in the recipe for the stuffing. The authenticity of the dish is heightened when served with aloo makalla (a special potato fry), hulba (a sort of fenugreek, mint and coriander chutney) and cucum ber zalata. Another speciality is mutton or vegetable ingree -a layered meat dish baked with brinjals, tomatoes and potatoes -not unlike the Greek moussaka, but without dairy to keep within kosher limits,"" Silliman explains with the lucidity of an expert.And why not? While abroad, Silliman served as a souschef at the Plaza in Jerusalem and launched the world's only kosher Jewish restaurant, Maharaja. She taught cooking and ran masterchef shows in US and London and authored two books. ""I have come back to Kolkata because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most... but I am keeping the flame alive."""

Nashik caters to the vegetable supplies to Mumbai and the district is known as major onion producer.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman, Lasalgaon APMC said, ""The market remained closed today as traders and mathadi workers went on strike. The average daily turnover of Lasalgaon APMC is nearly Rs 3 crore, while that of all the district APMCs is around Rs 30 crore. We lost this business today.""Holkar added, ""Although the government delisted vegetables from APMCs, farmers will bring their produce to APMCs as there is no parallel system for farmers to sell their produce. In APMCs, there is an open auction and farmers get money immediately after the auction. Even grape-growers are seeking to start auction of grapes in Lasalgaon APMC.

58f5d0fb7be9e01a17ca11ee,Why agri startups are blossoming,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Why-agri-startups-are-blossoming/articleshow/51962194.cms,2016-04-24,"When Ranjith Mukundan quit his job at Wipro in 2011 after 15 years, farming wasn't on his mind. Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."

The agenda was also ignored such other centrally-sponsored schemes like Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan.Even as the state continues to be heavily dependent on central assistance to the tune of about 51%of its budget, there has not been appreciable growth in its own revenue collection, which ironically has come down to around 14 per cent in the last six years from nearly 26 per cent earlier, strengthening critics' view of large-scale corruption in the administration. But the agenda has no plan to discuss the issue, let alone chalking out strategies to increase the revenue base or plugging of the loopholes.Panchayatiraj minister Arun Sahoo on the side lines of the conference told mediapersons that the government has set a target to construct around 15 lakh houses under different rural housing schemes in the next three years.He also said that the government has decided to set up model panchayats with modern facilities like Kalyan Mandaps, internet cafe and market complex in all the blocks.The minister said on the first day only two programmes, rural housing and model gram panchayat, were listed for discussion. Energy minister Pranab Prakash Das said the government is committed to provide power for all by 2019.The BJP and Congress mounted attacks on the government saying that the collectors' conference had been organised to warm up officials to work for BJD's victory in the panchayat elections. ""In an important meeting of collectors schemes that really address the core livelihood problems of the people should be taken up for discussion.

The north corporation, which owns the Civic Centre, had given the space for a monthly charge of Re.1.After councillors raised concerns that this deal may be causing the civic body financial loss, the Remunerative Projects (RP) Cell clarified that market rent of the space would have been Rs.6,32,082 per month. The rent was cut to a nominal amount as the cafe was offering food and beverages at subsidised rates to municipal employees, an official document of the RP Cell stated.Unsatisfied with the reason, former Mayor and BJPs Dev Nagar councillor Yogender Chandolia raised concerns at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Wednesday about the way the project was awarded to the private company running the cafe.We understand that a canteen will not get us Rs.6 lakh in rent. But, when the first tender was floated, there were companies willing to pay us Rs.1 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh in rent. Instead of negotiating with them, our officials picked someone else for Re.1 without following due process, Mr. Chandolia told The Hindu .According to the RP Cell, however, the earlier two bidders were rejected as they did not have the required technical capabilities. As per the RP cell, the present contractor was the only one that responded when the corporation advertised the project on its website on March 23, 2015.BJPs Rajendra Nagar councillor Rajesh Bhatia, who was the first to raise concern, said that other provisions of the agreement were also shocking.Extra goodiesWhat is more astounding is that the corporation has provided the company with inventory worth lakhs of rupees free of cost, said Mr. Bhatia.As per the agreement, the corporation gave refrigerators, boilers, burners, microwave ovens, a double tank fryer, a sandwich griller, a 10-kg capacity potato peeler and a 300-kg weighing scale to the cafe operator."

Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake.

Last month, inflation as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) was at 0.34 per cent, its first gain in 18 months, according to data released by the Centre.The acceleration in WPI, coming as it does after a quickening of retail inflation in the same month, makes it even more unlikely that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates shortly, according to economists.Retail syncThe WPI rose due to food inflation which shot up to 7.9 per cent from 4.2 per cent in April. The same trend could be seen in retail inflation as well where only the food category accelerated inflation.Inflation at the wholesale level rose in sync with trends witnessed in the retail print, Richa Gupta, Senior Economist, Deloitte said.Food continued to push the headline print higher while the effect of rising global commodity prices was also larger in the index due to its close correlation with domestic prices. Vegetable prices rose to take inflation in the category into double digits with potato prices rising by 21.54 per cent, Ms.Gupta said.Within the primary articles basket, while food inflation accelerated, non-food inflation eased considerably in May to 4.5 per cent from 7.1 per cent in April.Supply side responsePolicymakers need to check and address through supply-side responses, the continuous rise in prices of commodities like pulses, food articles, cereals, wheat and other items of national interest , said D.S. Rawat, Secretary General, The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, India.The fuel and power segment in the WPI contracted 6.1 per cent in May compared to a contraction of 4.8 per cent in April. This was led bythe mineral oil segment, which contracted 9.6 per cent in May compared to a contraction of 7.9 per cent in the earlier month.Manufactured goodsInflation in manufactured goods rose marginally to 0.9 per cent in May from 0.7 per cent in April.Manufacturing inflation is unlikely to be a cause of concern as weak demand across the globe is likely to keep prices subdued, Ms Gupta said.Mr.Rawat said the WPI figures may give some relief to manufacturers and producers since earlier it was hampering their pricing power, profitability and limiting their potential to increase capital expenditure.Worrying trendOverall, the view is that rising inflation coupled with poor industrial growth is a worrying trend. The declining trend in index of industrial production (IIP) and rising WPI may have a negative impact on the countrys economy in the long run, Mr. Rawat said.Overall, the view is that rising inflation coupled with poor industrial growth is a worrying trend"
