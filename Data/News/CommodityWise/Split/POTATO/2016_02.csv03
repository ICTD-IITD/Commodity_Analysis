58f603a57be9e031f13ad09d,Costly veggies burn hole in consumerâ€™s pocket,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/Costly-veggies-burn-hole-in-consumers-pocket/articleshow/52644497.cms,2016-06-08,"Madurai: The imbalance created in the demand and supply over the past few days have sent prices of most vegetables soaring in the wholesale markets of Paravai and Mattuthavani. This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain. K Arumugam, agriculture officer, in-charge of Chockikulam farmers' market said the unseasonal rains had resulted in poor production of vegetables grown in hill stations."

Farmers, who started sowing operations by the end of May, had to wait until the end of June first week to begin cultivation. They waited for weeks keeping the land prepared.Around 80,000 quintals of non-certified seeds, supplied by merchants in Punjab, and 2,065 tonnes of certified seeds provided by the National Seed Corporation have been purchased by farmers in the district. While the certified potato seeds were priced at Rs. 27 a kg, the non-certified seeds were sold at up to Rs. 17 a kg. The State government gave Rs. 10 subsidy per kg of certified seeds.Normally, we keep the seeds procured in open air for 15 days before sowing. This time, we waited long because of delayed monsoon. We sowed the seeds soon after the first monsoon showers last week. From then on, there have been no rains. If it does not rain for a few more days, our seeds will start decaying, causing huge loss, said Ninge Gowda, a potato grower of Belavadi in Arkalgud taluk. Hassan district received an average rainfall of 45.36 mm since June 1. In the first week of this month, up to June 7, the district received an average of 25 mm rainfall, which is 6 per cent less than the normal expected for the duration.B. Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, on Wednesday, Seed potatoes are sown between May 15 and June 15, depending on rainfall. Farmers keep the land ready and start cultivation soon after the rains. As there were no pre-monsoon rains this year, farmers had to wait, she said.The officer said that late sowing might end up the crop attracting late blight disease. If it rains heavily in July, plants become vulnerable to late blight, she added. Potato is one among the cash crops cultivated by many farmers in Hassan. In the last five to six years, the yield in potato fields has come down drastically due to late blight, a fungal infection."

There is also an increase in prices of pulses like dal.Vendors assert that sameprices may continue for some more days until the supply is increased."

About 100 hectares of land is under garlic cultivation this season.Farmers in Kanthallur, where cool season vegetables are largely cultivated, has largely shifted to garlic cultivation citing problems in marketing and low prices for traditionally cultivated vegetables such as potato, cabbage, beetroot, and carrot.As per the estimate of the Kanthallur Krishibhavan, about 100 hectares of land is under garlic cultivation. Kanthallur Agriculture Officer Murugan told The Hindu on Monday that there was a major shift to garlic as its price had gone up the last season. Most farmers who cultivated potato had shifted to garlic as there was a slump in the potato price following a bumper production in the last season. Potato used to be the main crop in Kanthallur. Areas under grantis cultivation were brought under potato cultivation through a government project.Farmers mainly cultivate the Mettupalayam variety of garlic, which, though small, is of high quality. Mr. Murugan said the farmers sold it at the Vadukapatti garlic market in Tamil Nadu, for want of a selling space in the State.The present price for garlic is around 200 per kilogram.The growth period for garlic is three months and Kanthallur is all set to start the harvest within two weeks, said P.T. Mohandas, a farmer and president of the Kanthallur Cool-Season Vegetable Marketing Society. He said the sale was brisk in Vadukapatti market and farmers were enthused with the high price in recent times. Garlic from Vadukapatti is mainly used in pickle production centres and Kanthallur garlic has an upper hand in terms of price.Mr. Mohandas said that unlike other vegetables, farmers can keep the garlic dried for three months.Newly harvested garlic can be sold on the spot too, he said.Enquiries from agents of the Vadukapatti market have poured in with the harvesting season nearing, he said."
58f613ac7be9e031f13ae0e2,Where water is hallmarked gold,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Where-water-is-hallmarked-gold/articleshow/52276574.cms,2016-05-15,"What worries 22-year old Jamnaben Dashratbhai, a resident of Kundalia, is not whether Gujarat Lions will win the IPL or whether BJP will win the Kerala assembly polls. It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days. Asked how they were coping with the water crisis Maniben Bhurabhai, 30, says, ""How does anyone care about us? If you go without taking bath for a week and walk down six kms with three pots on your head, you'll now how we are coping up."""

Srinivasa Rao of Visakhapatnam, who came from Tadepalligudem to the city by the AP AC Express on Sunday evening. He has sent a picture of two simians rummaging through the wastes, thrown right on the platform at Tadepalligudem, captured on his mobile phone.Coming to the AP AC Express, the train and the running were good but it stopped at many places en route. It was stopped at Duvvada Railway Station for about 15 minutes to give way to another Super fast Express. Finally, our train reached Visakhapatnam at 7.30 p.m., 45 minutes behind schedule, says Mr. Srinivasa Rao.The normal fare from Tadepalligudem to Vizag on this train was Rs.540. I had booked my ticket, three days prior to my journey and the fare was normal. But, my cousin, Balaji was puzzled to note that the Tatkal fare was Rs.1,200, when he tried to book the ticket on Saturday, he says.Dr. Pradeep, who had travelled by the II AC coach in the Visakhapatnam-Kollam weekly express, a few weeks ago, was perturbed by the collection of variable rates from passengers for food by the supplier.There is no pantry car in the long distance train.A woman, who was travelling with her daughter in the same coach, ordered for vegetarian food when the supplier came to take the order.The supplier charged Rs.70 for the rice, potato curry, sambar and curd. Later, she came to know from the passenger, sitting opposite her after his berth was confirmed, that the supplier had taken Rs.170 for the same menu.Though the coach was clean, the water in the toilet ran out in about an hour after the train started from Visakhapatnam. The water was filled in the overhead tank only at Vijayawada Junction.The woman passenger was shocked when the stall keeper on the platform at Vijayawada, charged Rs.40 for a packet of chips and a 1-litre water bottle, which normally would cost not more than Rs.25. When she pulled him up, he returned Rs.10."

In an administrative meeting of North 24-Parganas at Salt Lake's EZCC on Friday, the CM warned the district administration and the police against unchecked infiltration, deteriorating law and order and uncontrolled cattle smuggling.""What are you doing? Infiltration is increasing, law and order has touched the bottom, anti-socials are moving freely. I won't tolerate this. Don't see colours (read political) of the culprits. Arrest them,"" the CM said.Banerjee cautioned against the rising syndicate business that had turned into a political hot potato during the recently concluded assembly polls. In order to curb the role of supply syndicates that have become a money-spinning machine, Banerjee announced a Rs 45,000crore investment for the district, which has the potential to create 1.40 lakh jobs.Mamata's warning against infiltration comes after Trinamool's impressive victory in North 24-Parganas, particularly in South Basirhat where the party wrested the seat from BJP. Banerjee said, ""There is a new DM and SP in the district. I have told them to increase vigil in the bordering areas. Cattle smuggling should be checked. They should take extra initiative to check the deteriorating law and order condition. The traffic system should also be improved and there should be increased police presence on the streets."" This may raise eyebrows in the opposition, but the CM had said she would support the Centre on a case-to-case basis, even though she is ideologically opposed to BJP.The CM also pulled up municipal affairs secretary Omkar Singh Meena Roy for poor functioning of the municipalities. When Roy complained of paucity of funds, the CM said: ""You will have to do with whatever money we have. See how KMC is working. Learn from them. Utilize the central funds. I have a lot of plans for the district. But I won't accept syndicate raj and promoting racket"".Banerjee later said, ""The municipalities will have to be given funds to regain health."" I have many plans for this distirct. There will be 45000 crore investment in the next few days which will generate 140000 jobs"".The CM didn't spare the MLAs from the district - Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Sujit Bose, Sabyaschi Dutta and Purnendu Bose - either. ""I have warned you before. Stop infighting and work for the people,"" she said.Incidentally, BJP took out a rally in the city during the day, accusing the state of promoting Bangladeshi infiltration. All senior BJP leaders, including Dilip Ghosh, Rahul Sinha, Roopa Ganguly and Locket Chatterjee, were present. This is nothing new for BJP. During election campaign top BJP leaders including Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh had alleged that Trinamool congress and CPM had been promoting infiltration from Bangladesh to get political mileage out it. Shah told in a meeting that BJP would stop infiltration if voted to Nabanna."

The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall. Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon. Logic dictates that they would despatch the produce quickly before the bandh begins and cut their losses.Consumers are furious that middlemen should continue their strike plan despite the dire situation. ""Already , dal is selling for Rs 120-180 per kg, vegetables for Rs 100-200 and dry condiments have come to cost the earth. Now the APMC has decided to go on strike and halt supplies completely . The government or courts should either outlaw this bandh or ensure alternative arrangements for supply ,"" said Andheri resident Neerja Kajale. Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly . Farmers will soon learn how to manage transportation and supply logistics.""Across Mumbai, cauliflow er, green chillies, garlic and capsicum are being sold for up to Rs 200 per kg. Fruits have become dearer too. Apple and pomegranate rose to Rs 180-200 from Rs 150-170.Matunga is among the costliest markets in the city . On Monday , French beans sold for Rs 200, bitter gourd, carrot and tomato Rs 80, onion Rs 30 and potato Rs 40. Prices were two to three times that of last week, said resident K A Viswanathan. Matunga has nearly 100 vegetable shops. Vendor Shiv Pande said fresh produce won't come on Tuesday .Dilip Yadav, a retailer at Navi Mumbai's Mafco retail market said, ""(We were) forced to stock only cheap vegetables to cater to our regular consumers. Even common vegetables are selling above Rs 100.""""Consumers are at the re ceiving end due to the sparring between the government and middlemen,"" said Aarti Jambolkar, a homemaker.The onion and potato market began its strike from Monday. Prices promptly witnessed a jump of Rs 2-5 per kg.Onions with surplus production this season rose to Rs 18-22 from Rs 15-18 earlier.With inputs from Bella Jaisinghani"

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

58f637657be9e031f13b0809,Snack culture spices up packaged foods biz,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Snack-culture-spices-up-packaged-foods-biz/articleshow/52930756.cms,2016-06-27,"Mumbai: Packaged food companies are rejoicing. There has been a rise in food consumption occasions during the day. What used to earlier be four meals daily, including a snack, has doubled to 8-10 meals among urban consumers. While breakfast, lunch and dinner have been the established occasions for consumption with an evening snack thrown in, industry experts say new occasions like a pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, evening, pre-dinner and an after-dinner are gaining in popularity.A pre-lunch snack is said to be the preferred meal among young, on-the-go professionals and the blue-collared workforce. On the other hand, increased health consciousness, especially in the metros and tier I cities, has led to consumers having smaller portions through the day, albeit, more frequently. The culture of putting in longer hours at work and in commute has resulted in late dinners, which makes space for a pre-dinner snack.The shift in consumption patterns has triggered innovation in the packaged foods market. Sanjay Sharma, CEO, MTR Foods , said a professional today spends around 10 hours at work and an average of two hours commuting. This has given a boost to in-between snacking habits. ""This change in behaviour gave us an opportunity to tap this occasion by innovating and launching our traditional snacks portfolio, the on-the-go dessert portion packs and our breakfast-in-a-cup range which gives a quick meal in 3 minutes by just adding hot water.""There is also a significant increase in the women workforce, resulting in a change in food habits. Arabind Das, COO, Godrej Tyson Foods, said the consumer is looking for convenience and she wants to manage her time well, but expects the taste of food to remain intact. ""We are innovating to cater to such needs of the consumer. So while we already offer her a packaged pre-cut chicken, we have also provided her the option of a marinated chicken as well as ready-to-cook chicken nuggets. We see this trend not only in SEC A and B markets, but beyond that as well,"" said Das.Das said the growing number of occasions is driven by the consumer's desire to 'munch on something', with the evening snack emerging as the fastest growing space with a greater variety.Devendra Chawla, group president (food FMCG brands), Future Group , views food as the new entertainment. ""We live in times where instant gratification rules. No other category can provide better instant gratification than food.Whether it's IPL or Bollywood movies, we need food and without food everything seems incomplete. We reward ourselves with food even when alone. When tired, we eat or drink to feel charged up and to meet people, we create food as an occasion. So every occasion now has food intertwined in it,"" said Chawla.Categories like frozen snacks, instant pasta, soups and granola bars are being built as ""in-between meals"". Ready-to-cook packs, including gourmet dishes, too, are making their presence felt. Chawla said while this is largely a big city phenomenon, data reveals that metros such as NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata and even Punjab, to an extent, are over leveraged on these categories.""At home, too, thanks to freezers and microwaves, everyone is a mini chef. It's common to see kids making their own potato fries after school hours. On the other hand, changes in lifestyle and health consciousness, trainers, nutritionists and dietitians are coming up with plans of 6-8 meals a day. This has increased occasions to consume food."""
