Ambient lighting, costumed serving staff and floor-level seating (complete with canopies draped in shimmering curtains) aim to make the visitor forget Tiruchi for a brief while.Moroccan cuisine has been shaped by all its interactions with other countries over the centuries, chef Rajprasad Radhakrishnan said. You will find dishes here with a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine.Theres also an influence of Moroccos colonial heritage, with a small selection of French recipes.The buffet starts off with a salad table that has some staples of Middle Eastern cuisine  steamed couscous (semolina granules made from durum wheat) with finely-chopped fresh vegetables, tabbouleh (cracked wheat mixed with finely chopped ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, and parsley) and Hummous dips made with chickpeas and black beans.Fatayer (mini minced mutton pies) have been given a vegetarian twist with a potato and peas filling, and Manakish, small pita flatbreads topped with zatar spice mix of cumin, oregano and olive oil, and sambouseh add to the variety of the bread counter.Grilled meats feature prominently in the Moroccan palate because of the nomadic lifestyle of its people. We have tried to include the commonly barbecued meats in our festival, with a live station that will serve customers the cuts of their choice. We marinate the lamb for at least one and half days before we grill it, said Mr. Raj. The whole lamb being barbecued at one end of the pool makes a dramatic visual statement at the festival. Small charcoal braziers are placed at customers tables to barbecue chicken, quail and kababs.Tagine, the slow-cooked stew of meat and vegetables that is distinguished by its earthenware dish topped with a conical lid, is available at the festival too.The golden glow of saffron tints everything from rice dishes to gravies and desserts in the festival. At the rice counter, Moroccan versions of biryani and pulao are available. Spaghetti tossed with cheesy white sauce brings a French touch to the table.Date halwa and roz bil haleeb (rice and milk pudding) are among the treats that mingle with some Indian offerings at the dessert table.The buffet dinner is priced at Rs. 600 plus taxes for adults, and Rs. 400 plus taxes for children."

Rama Devi interacting with The Hindu in Vijayawada.PHOTO: V. RAJUWomen aspiring to be entrepreneurs couldnt have asked for more. The Association of Lady Entrepreneurs of Andhra Pradesh (Aleap) plans to set up four green industrial parks across the Sunrise State.With the support of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) and the banking sector, we propose to set up these eco-friendly parks at Vijayawada, Nellore, Visakhapatnam and Anantapur, in collaboration with the German government and German capacity building organisation GIZ, says Rama Devi, Aleaps founder president.Our women members manufacture [many things from] potato chips to electronic chips. We want to bring all of them on a common platform, explains Ms. Rama Devi.Each of the four units will be spread over 50 acres distributed in 200 units. Land allocation for the Nellore plant has been made but the Association is waiting for other units to come on stream as it is keen on starting all four units concurrently.The new industrial estates proposed to be developed exclusively for women entrepreneurs will be natural parks with adequate infrastructure facilities. The idea is to translate the slogan of women empowerment into a reality in Navyandhra Pradesh. Most of them will be micro and small units, says Ms. Rama Devi.World class infrastructureThe new structures will provide world class infrastructure to women entrepreneurs, common facilities like administrative building, conference hall, a library, information centre, guest room and canteen, free power (15 HP) to each unit, establish 200 enterprises, provide employment to scores of people in the vicinity and will convert unorganised sector into organised sector.Founded in 1993, Aleap is recognised as one of the premier institutions of women entrepreneurship.The members provide counselling to aspiring women entrepreneurs through facilitators and Business Development Cell. This enables them to choose business activity of their desire. Need-based skill development training, conduct of entrepreneurship development programmes, helping them to gain access to finance from banks and financial institutions and providing them the much-needed infrastructure to start commercial operations and post-establishment assistance in the fields of marketing and production are its other roles.Aleap is a one-stop destination for aspiring entrepreneurs as we take care of all their needs till we make sure that the entrepreneur is capable of operating a unit independently, says Ms. Rama Devi."

Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has also advised the farmers to use such traps.Yellow traps made by the CPRS cost 4-5 times less than those available in the market. Research station director J S Minhas said the traps available in the market cost Rs 50-60 per piece but those developed by the CPRS innovation cell cost Rs 10-15 a piece.""This is a cheap and effective method to control the white fly menace,"" he said, adding 50 traps of 60cm x 40cm per hectare would be sufficient for controlling the pest.""The farmers can make these traps from white fibre sheet and paint it with golden yellow colour. These sheets are cut into pieces of specified size and are then coated with a thin layer of grease or castor oil. The farmers should then tie these traps on wooden sticks in such a way that they remain just above the canopy of the plant. These are equally effective as the ones available in the commercial market and are reusable,"" Minhas saidFor more information on low-cost yellow sticky traps the farmers could contact him or CPRS assistant chief technical officer Kapil Kumar Sharma, he added."
58f63de97be9e031f13b0fc6,The vegetarian path to golfing greatness (Comment: Special to IANS),http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/shooting/The-vegetarian-path-to-golfing-greatness-Comment-Special-to-IANS/articleshow/53473217.cms,2016-07-31,,The Times Of India,"I thought my son had played reasonably well in a Junior World Golf qualifier in Sacramento , shooting a 77 (+5) on a par-72 course. As I sauntered over to check out the scores, I saw that the winning score was a 64 (-8) by a kid whose parents I knew. ""What did you feed him today?"" I asked in congratulating them.Without skipping a beat, since that is what they were chowing down at that time, they said ""Cheeseburgers"". A food item my son has never experienced in his 13 years of existence.Can a vegetarian ever aspire to the top echelons of golf on a diet devoid of meat? And are we, as parents, failing in our duty by not cooking and plowing burgers and hot dogs into our son?Both my wife and I were brought up as vegetarians for religious reasons.We come from a family lineage in South India whose most cherished dish is 'thair-sadam' (curd and rice). I, however, did stray during my college years to experience being a meat-eater. Not satisfied with just having 'Intel Inside' my computers, I wanted to see what it felt like to have 'Meat Inside' my digestive tract.I still recall the sensation of my first bite into a Whopper and that oh-so-succulent taste of spicy tandoori chicken. Why could my son not feel the same sensations in his palate?When he was three, my wife carefully orchestrated a switcheroo -- replacing potato with chicken nuggets. He chomped at it for a few seconds, gave me a smile that I felt so excited by (I now realise it might have been gas) and then promptly vomited it to let me experience 'Meat Outside'. In all the years since, he has never once expressed a desire to eat anything that has meat in it. And he has a stubborn streak that does not relent easily.So why is this relevant to how he plays the game of golf at the age of 13? Because he is figuratively (and literally) dwarfed in size and strength compared to boys that he plays with of a similar age. It has no bearing on the short game around the greens. But what a difference it makes on those drives from the tee box.Contrast a booming drive of 280 yards on a long par-4 of say 400 yards to enable a short wedge to the green, to eking out 200 yards on the drive and needing an accurate 3-wood to just get close to the green. That shot disparity on one hole accumulates over the long par-4 and par-5 holes to a final differential of at least 7 strokes. Game over, finito, checkmate, acabado in Spanish -- or maybe avocado in my son's mind.Conventional wisdom stresses how essential meat is as a source of protein and bulk to world-class athletes. Can you imagine Usain Bolt Peyton Manning or even Jordan Spieth performing their best on a belly full of salad and lentils? In my quest to better understand the impact of meat on world-class athletes, I Googled vegetarian world-class athletes. And I was quite inspired reading about Carl Lewis Martina Navratilova , Murray Rose, Robert Parrish, Billie Jean King, Venus Williams Tony Gonzalez and a host of other athletes who have and continue to excel with a vegetarian/vegan diet.But the skeptical side of me asks if any of them started their first 13 years on this diet, or was it a lifestyle they adopted later in their success?It is said that vegetarian foods have less caloric density than their meaty alternatives and hence athletes need to be aware of their caloric intake and expenditure to accommodate this. My son sparingly bites into his peanut-butter sandwiches in the middle of his rounds and has absolutely no gauge of his caloric expenditure. Maybe similar bites into a tuna sandwich might give him more calories but I am reasonably sure that will not make any difference to his overall performance during his rounds.This is ultimately a lifestyle choice -- does he need to consume meat-based foods to give him the muscle, strength and endurance to elevate his game? What does he need to do to bring home the bacon (pun oh-so-intended)? Can a combination of a vegetarian diet with an emphasis on physical fitness -- something he is lax about -- give him an equal or potentially greater advantage?It is uneasy being the parent of a vegetarian child aspiring to golf greatness. As parents we want to give our children the best advantage in every aspect of their lives. Maybe we are being unnecessarily paranoid in our thinking. We wait with bated breath for that growth spurt to kick in since height is such a great advantage in golf. And hope he quickly understands the value of physical fitness.Imagine our joy down the road (or maybe that should be down the fairway) in seeing him out-drive his meat-eating competitors. But 'lettuce' see how all this plays out - we really do want to avoid a 'Vegexit' option for our son.(31.07.2016 - Sridhar Narayanan is an engineer and lives in Cupertino, California.

The duo recently got patent for the process of of mixing artificial plastic polymers and natural bio-nano fillers.""In order to achieve enhanced mechanical performance, polymers are reinforced with synthetic fillers such as carbon black, silica and calcium-based powders. Such fillers have adverse effect on environment and is also expensive in nature,"" stated a statement issued by MSU.In the past as well, attempts have been made by researchers from the department to develop polymers such as plastic and rubbers in a biodegradable manner. Natural polymers such as starch and cellulose (polysaccharides) are organic, non-toxic and easily available in plenty at low cost. Researchers have derived starch and cellulose from maze, potato, recycled paper, banana peels, sugarcane and bagasse among others.""Cellulose is hydrophilic in nature while rubber is hydrophobic that leads to poor dispersion. Focus was to overcome the limitation,"" she said.""We have made hydrophobic bio-nanofillers using starch and cellulose and then converted it into nanoparticles by acid treatment. They were then chemically reacted and converted into derivatives which are hydrophobic so as to increase compatibility with polymers,"" said Thakore adding that nano-sized materials have uniform dispersion."

No, we came for another reason: To leave a mark,"" Francis told a crowd that Polish media estimated at over 1 million in a huge field in Brzegi, a village outside the southern city of Krakow.Organizers said 1.6 million people came to hear the pope last night, but police did not give a crowd estimate.Francis decried a modern escapism into consumerism and computers that isolates people. The same message ran through a ballet performance at the site before his speech: a lonely woman seeks human connections but is rebuffed by people on computer tablets and cellphones until one man emerges from behind a see-through barrier to connect.For Francis, Jesus is the ""Lord of risk ... not the Lord of comfort, security and ease.""""Following Jesus demands a good dose of courage, a readiness to trade in the sofa for a pair of walking shoes and to set out on new and uncharted paths,"" Francis said.He challenged his sea of listeners, spread out on blankets, to make their mark on the world by becoming engaged as ""politicians, thinkers, social activists"" and to help build a world economy that is ""inspired by solidarity.""""The times we live in do not call for young 'couch potatoes,'"" he said to applause, ""but for young people with shoes, or better, boots laced.""Like a politician working a crowd, Francis yelled out to his audience: ""You want others to decide your future?"" When he didn't get the rousing ""No!"" he was going for, he tried for a ""Yes.""""You want to fight for your future?"" he asked. ""Yes!"" they roared."

Yet, the monsoon has been beneficial to the farmers, who have taken up vegetable cultivation, as well small tea growers, said horticulture department officials.The southwest monsoon usually sets in the Nilgiris by June 1. But, this year it was delayed by a week. ""The amount of rain received in the past one month is comparatively less. The monsoon this season is uncertain and it rains only on and off,"" said N Mani, joint director of horticulture department. ""However, the rain received till now is very beneficial to farmers taken up vegetable cultivation and tea growers,"" he added.Around 2,176 hectares of farming land in the hills have standing crops like carrot, potato and cabbage. The rain will benefit the crops as they are in the final stages of cultivation. Moreover, it would be easier for the farmers to prepare for the autumn season, begining August,"" Mani said.Pointing out that now the soil was wet, officials said it was the right time to apply manure to the tea gardens. ""When the field is wet, the soil could easily absorb the strength of the manure,"" they added.L Sankar, an Ooty-based farmer agrees. ""It isn't raining continuously this season, but the wet weather condition itself is a boost to the standing crops. We hope more rain in the coming weeks,"" he said.Sankar is waiting to harvest potato and carrot that he cultivated in around three acres of land in the first week of August. The Nilgiris has registered between 6mm and 35mm rain in every 24 hours in different places in the past one week. The trend is expected to continue."

Pressure was also building up within the retailers' community with many members, especially women, complaining about loss of business and livelihood.The retailers have been demanding elimination of agents' commission. Representatives of the retailers' associations and Agriculture Produce Market Committe (APMC) attended the meeting with the minister.The retailers' representatives claimed after the meeting that the government had assured them that it would study the feasibility and take a decision by August 21.Till the retailers made the welcome announcement of calling off their strike, citizens suffered because of vegetable shortage, high prices and poor quality. Most markets in the city were closed for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday. A few retail outlets open sold four-day-old stocks.Several tiffin providers in the city were mulling over suspending their services till Wednesday evening because of vegetables' short supply. ""I was lucky enough to know about the strike a day in advance. So, I stocked up vegetables for a few days. But now my stock is also running out and I might have to stop providing my services for a while till the strike is called off,"" said Asha Patel, a tiffin service provider in the NIBM Road area, an hour before the strike was called off.Consumers were left frustrated for the fourth day running.

According to preliminary estimation prepared by the Department of Agriculture, crop on over 1.13 lakh hectares of the total 2.04 lakh ha will be lost. The final figure, however, is expected to go up once the ground-level assessment is over.Our officials are still collecting data from the fields. Preliminary estimates show that standing crop on 1.13 lakh ha will be lost. The loss in terms of money is yet to be assessed, a senior official in the Department of Agriculture told The Hindu on Monday.The district administration has instructed the officials of the Department of Agriculture to assess the loss and the officials are expected to finalise this report soon.Almost all crops, including paddy, ragi, maize, potato, and ginger have suffered owing to scanty rainfall. According to a report of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, the normal rainfall expected in Hassan district in the monsoon season till Monday is 609.4 mm. However, the actual figure stands at 553.49 mm. In the month of September (till Monday), the rainfall expected is 59.6 mm, but the actual rainfall received is 33.91 mm. The departure from normal in the current month alone is about 43 per cent. The water level in the Hemavati reservoir has fallen drastically with the Supreme Court asking the State Government to release water. As on Monday, the water level in the reservoir stood at 2,874 ft against the full reservoir level of 2,922 ft. The amount of water available is only 07.664 tmcft, of which the live storage is 03.292 tmc ft.Meanwhile, farmers are demanding compensation at the rate of at least Rs. 50,000 per acre in the wake of crop loss. Political parties have also raised a similar demand. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha has planned a protest in front of Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru on Wednesday in this regard. Rame Gowda, a farmer in Salagame Hobli of Hassan taluk, said farmers in the hobli were hoping that the government responds to the demand for compensation positively.Rs. 50,000 per acre will not compensate the loss. Farmers have spent more than that to cultivate each acre, he added."

Every year, from late in July to the first Tuesday of August, Antiguans come together for the carnival which celebrates the emancipation of slavery in the country. Coinciding with the carnival, some villages in the Saint Phillip area of the island organise a reunion every four years. The event brings back expats who mingle with locals. A good number of Antiguans have shifted overseas in search of greener pastures. The largest number of the expats is in United States while many have found their calling in Europe and even South American countries.The reunion is held over a week with activities every day. A popular part of the reunion is the 'food festival' which attracts a goodly crowd. This year, the food fest has been organised at the local football ground of the Seatons village. Food stalls dot one part of the ground while a group of young boys play football under lights.The atmosphere is easy and joyful. There is no hustle and bustle of an Indian carnival because of the small population. On a routine day, you hardly see anyone on the roads after sunset. It's a sparsely populated island and only sounds one hears once the evening sets in is that of birds, pet dogs and the wind coming from the bays. For someone from India, it seems almost eerie.Back at the food fest, Devon seems happy with the sales his wife's stall is racking up. He owns two buses and, interestingly, drives them too. Do you know a bus owner would never drive it in India? Devon, a simple looking man, smiles and says, ""I don't mind driving my bus. People look at me and think I'm just a bus driver but it's fine with me.""For a place like Antigua, a congregation of 300 people is quite a sizeable one -the entire population of the country is barely 85,000. It's thus a festive atmosphere at the Seatons football ground. The blaring music adds to the mood which is typically Afro. On offer at the stalls are king-sized crabs and lobsters, pork ribs and chicken with seasoned rice and veggies. Saltfish, which is a slated, dried cod, is much in demand by the revellers. Then, there are traditional Antiguan staples like fungie which is made of corn paste and water, and ducana which is a sweet, dense dumpling made of grated sweet potato which is mixed with coconut, pumpkin and cinnamon. Then there are simple, homemade cakes almost all of which contain coconut."

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."

File photo: Prakash HassanMany progressive farmers and environmentalists have been calling for a ban on the cultivation of ginger, at least for a few years, given the crops impact on soil fertility and groundwater levels in the district. Office-bearers of farmers groups say farmers are ready to give up ginger cultivation in the interest of the environment and soil.Farmers in Hassan began ginger cultivation in the latter part of the last decade. Following a ban on it in Kerala, many farmers from there came to Hassan, among other districts of Karnataka, and took land on lease to grow ginger. Gradually, native farmers began growing the crop too.A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of the Horticulture Department, says, Ginger is an undersoil crop and extracts nutrients and moisture directly from the soil. Soil fertility is the immediate casualty of ginger cultivation.The farmers who were among the first to grow ginger are already experiencing its ill-effects. Once ginger is grown in a particular land, farmers cannot get good produce from any other crop on that land for a couple of years. It takes years for the soil to regain its fertility, the officer says.BorewellsAs of now, farmers grow ginger on over 10,000 hectares in the district. Each farmer drills one or two borewells; implying hundreds of borewells in a village only for ginger cultivation. This has affected the groundwater table.Farmers were not aware of these ill-effects when they were introduced to this crop. Those fed up with the losses owing to late blight in the case of potato shifted quickly to ginger. They invested money and, initially, earned well. The State government should have spread awareness well in advance and avoided the cultivation of this crop, says H.R. Naveen Kumar, district president of the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha.AllegationsGinger growers have been using chemicals extensively, affecting micro-organisms. There are allegations that banned fertilisers are being used. Farmers greed is one of the reasons for the increase in area under ginger. They want to make a quick buck, and are not bothered about the long-term effects, says Kottur Srinivas, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha. He adds that the forum would help the government in spreading awareness if the latter took a tough stand and banned the production of ginger altogether."

But here in the tropics we have a whole treasury of strikingly beautiful but affordable  in terms of space  flowering trees suitable for small gardens.All the trees described below can also be planted in large tubs in full sun on a terrace or balcony, where they will not grow to their full size but will flower. All of these are also easy-care trees that will thrive in ordinary garden soil and need only minimal watering once they are established.The first three trees described here are deciduous; that is, they completely shed their leaves before flowering. They need a distinct dry period to flower their best.When they start shedding their leaves reduce watering until new buds start appearing, then water normally.INDIAN CORAL TREE (ERYTHRINA INDICA)The Indian coral tree is a dazzler; yet its one of the easiest of trees to grow. It is a plant-and-forget tree until, in February-March, the leafless tree surprises you with its profusion of large, brilliant red flowers. Fast-growing and hardy, it will grow on poor soil and in dry areas with no care. However, it hates to be waterlogged, so take care not to overwater it. The coral tree is very easy to propagate from seed or large cuttings; even a branch cut and used as a stake or fence post will often root and grow.Other Erythrinas worth growing are E. variegata (green and yellow striped leaves, orange flowers); E. crista-galli (orange flowers); and E. blakeii (a large shrub with deep red flowers.YELLOW SILK COTTON (COCHLOSPERMUM GOSSYPIUM; SYN. C. RELIGIOSUM).If I could have just one tree in my garden, Id choose the yellow silk cotton. Even when not in bloom, it is beautiful, with its dark green palmate leaves; in bloom, it is breathtaking. From late September to early March, the leafless tree is covered with clusters of 3-inch golden yellow flowers with long stamens in the centre. At dawn, in my backyard, it is a golden pagoda against a dark background of fishtail palms.MANURE PLANT (GLIRICIDIA SEPIUM)The only trouble with this tree is that though it is a wild forest tree, it is hard to get Gliricidia sepium. This fast-growing tree produces large trusses of pink-and-white flowers in February-March. Called gobrada gida (manure plant) in Kannada, it is valued as an organic fertilizer: its roots fix atmospheric nitrogen, an essential plant nutrient, and the leaves also contribute nitrogen when added to the soil. It grows in poor soil with minimal watering and is very easy to propagate from cuttings; even a branch used as a stake will root and grow. This small tree makes a good temporary filler for spaces where you may want to plant something more permanent later.POTATO TREE (SOLANUM MACRANTHUM; SYN. S. GRANDIFLORUM).In Kannada our local name for this tree is badne marabrinjal tree  and it does look like a large brinjal plant, with deeply lobed, dark green leaves. Its clusters of scented flowers, which appear all year round, open purple, turn lavender the second day, and white the third day. This is a fast-growing but short-lived (8-10 years) tree, so its ideal for spaces that you want filled quickly but where you plan to plant something more permanent later. Plants that like filtered light do well in the dappled shade of the potato tree. Stuck in its fork, my Cymbidium orchid sends out 18 to 20 streamers of flowers every March.GEIGER TREE (CORDIA SEBESTENA)Scarlet Cordia, as it is also called, is commonly seen in parks in Hyderabad, though not so common in Bengaluru. It has large, rough leaves and clusters of orange tubular flowers borne on the tips of the branches throughout the warm season. It grows on a range of soils and is drought-tolerant, though it does better with regular watering. It is reputed to tolerate flooding and salt spray, as well.BOTTLE BRUSH (CALLISTEMON CITRINUS SYN. C. LANCEOLATUS)A native of Australia, it is now commonly grown everywhere in India. A graceful, drooping tree with narrow, lancet-like leaves, it gets its name from its red inflorescences which look just like bottle brushes.The leaves when crushed give a lemon-like aroma; hence its Latin name citrinus."

Currently, gastropubs and watering holes seem to be on a back-to-the-basics-at-home mode, with the most popular Indian pedestrian food, chaat, making its way into their kitchens. Food watchers and chefs believe that this trend is only going to grow bigger and is something that would work well with Indians who are also returning to their roots.Restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani says that going desi was inevitable. ""A bhel puri can work as both an appetizer and a salad. Come to think of it, it is fresh, nothing is cooked, has bold flavours and, without potato, it makes for a healthy snack. Given our palates, it makes for a good accompaniment with alcohol or, as a meal by itself. The industry has fast caught on to serving more chaats on the menu, though we have taken it a bit too far as well, with ingredients such as liquid nitrogen being infused in them, for instance. But given the way the people are headed, why not go desi with our food? It does work, after all,"" points out Riyaaz.F&B consultant Aslam Gafoor says that fusion food, especially chaats, is going to stay. ""While we can trace the first instances of this trend making an appearance to a couple of years ago, it has permeated to our city recently, with many quirky stand-alone restaurants having them on the menu. It is a case of chefs and restaurateurs wanting to give back to consumers what India has to offer. From humble chaats such as jhal muri or bhel puri and puchkas or golgappas, to the Mumbai favourite vada and kheema pav, there is a lot of Indian street food making its way into these kitchens. And they are served in interesting fusion avatars, which make them all the more exciting to the people frequenting these hotspots, as opposed to the same old bruschettas and other European dishes that have been on the menus for a while,"" he adds.Actor-turned-restaurateur Likhit Shetty adds that it was this experimental feeling that got him and his partner to introduce some fusion chaats to their menu. ""I am a Mangalurean and I love chicken sukka. My partner loves chaats, especially pani puri. When planning our menu, we decided to try something new and different, which was when we got to adding Chicken Sukka Golgappa to our menu. Also, we have a Chicken Bhel. We were unsure how people would react to it, but people's response shows that they are game for more such experiments. The cosmopolitan crowd in the city likes the mixed flavours and techniques,"" says Likhit.The fact that chaats are familiar to Indian diners, who do not have the time to go to small chaat restaurants in bylanes, is also why they are a big hit. ""The past couple of years have seen the idea of small plates become popular with people who dine out. Chaats are a perfect sync with the concept of small plates as they offer a reasonable amount and can be shared by 2-3 people. This is another reason the trend has picked up, and has given chefs the chance to plate them innovatively, adding some creativity with the cutlery,"" reasons Aslam And there are some gastropubs that add a bit of drama too, which includes live mixing of chaats at tables. Chef Sombir Chaudary says, ""Instead of serving a soggy version of jhal muri, guests are awestruck when they are served improvized versions live at tables, with spice, onions and tomatoes based on their tastes. Meat versions like chicken and prawn are popular. Mixing cuisines also helps  for example, a papdi-chaat version of nachos, which is a favourite pub snack. I think this trend will stay for a while in Bengaluru, because people seem to like everything to have a twist and are always game for something new."""

Days after CID busted a Ponzi firm MMM Asia with roots in Russia and operating from East Midnapore with the arrest of four persons, a joint team of Kolkata police STF and the CID have nabbed five persons who were offering a 150 percent return within one month. The arrests have been carried out from the Manicktala, Hedua and Rajabazar areas.According to police sources, the gang members are mainly agents and sub agents who had been rendered jobless after the Ponzi firms went bust. ""This time the scheme is deadlier. There are no offices. Money was being collected through family members and a hierarchical chain created. Despite all attempts to sensitize people, it seems that even Kolkata has not taken note of the dangers,"" said a probe officer.TOI spoke to one such investor who herself now under police lens.

I had no clue that they had invested the money in chitfunds,"" she claimed. The investigators though claim that Mitra herself had collected money on behalf of one masterminds who go by the name of Sushil and Mukherjee. ""We are trying to ascertain if those arrested are indeed the masterminds,"" explained an officer.The cops said they deliberately targeted the less informed as everything was arranged through family and friends. All that were used was a written understanding that the victim was lending money to another person. Stamp papers were used for this purpose but it never mentioned the exact terms and conditions when this money had to be returned. Everything operated through word of mouth,"" said an investigating officer. The gang had raised Rs 14 lakh in the past month of June alone, claimed cops.The CID claims chitfunds are trying to claw back in the name of agricultural schemes too. ""For more than a year we have been receiving several complaints, especially from rural Bengal about investors not getting returns or the capital siphoned off in various agricultural schemes,"" Consumer Affairs Minister Sadhan Pande had earlier complained this year.""These operators are taking the advantage of lack of proper banking facilities, poverty and illiteracy of the investors. In most cases the promise of huge return lure the investors into the trap. In most cases the investors and the frauds are known to each other,"" a senior official from CID explained. The official said that in many cases these potato and other agricultural schemes offered investors guaranteed return of 20-100 per cent on their investment within a fixed period of time.A chit fund company, which is being investigated by the CBI, had earlier started a scheme called ""potato flexi scheme"" promising huge returns on investment in potato business."

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N.

This annual event occurs at the Blue Hall of Stockholm City Hall, after the Nobel Prize ceremony on December 10, the death anniversary of Swedish innovator Alfred Nobel. Images of pots clashing, chefs in a rush and total chaos come to our mind. But thats not the case it seems, as chef Mark Phoenix has this to say: On the contrary, it is extremely organised. The British gent who was invited to become a chef for the Nobel dinners in 2006, clarifies, adding that the menu preparation begins in March every year. After a few months of being appointed as a chef for the prestigious banquet, his friend and fellow chef Fredrik Forssell joined the team as well.Phoenix was recently in the country, along with Forsell to cook for the annual Nobel Memorial Dinner which is held in Delhi at the Swedish Ambassadors residence. This year, the chefs also dropped by Mumbai to conduct a master class, and made a stop in Pune to cook an authentic Scandanavian meal for a closed event: both organised by the Swedish Consulate. In a chat before the anticipated masterclass, Phoenix and Forsell talk about their experience at the Nobel dinners and Swedish cuisine.The Nobel Festivities in Stockholm started in 1901, arranged by the Nobel Foundation. They are primarily an academic celebration focusing on science and literature. Guests are always dressed to their finest in tails and long gowns. The story behind this dress code is that Alfred Nobel always wanted the laureates to attend a fancy dinner because they never had the opportunity to dress up in tails (suit), explains Phoenix.Hosted by the King of Sweden, the exclusive dinner has its rules: once the monarch is seated, guests are not permitted to leave the table. There is a set programme and the minutes are planned to the second. Even the temperature of the food has to be exact, and there is no room for a difference. One dinner set at the table (comprising plate/cutlery/glasses, etc.) for one person at the Nobel banquet is worth 4000 SEK (approximately Rs 30,000). We work in different places now but consult for the Nobel Dinners, helping work out the logistics, says Phoenix, who grew up in Westminster and moved to Sweden in 1993. He has lived in Bangladesh, India as well as Istanbul in the last few years.As for the masterclass in the city  when Phoenix was notified about the Mumbai event  he immediately thought of Stockholms ongoing autumn season there. But here, I realised, it is always hot, he says. So, instead, they prepare a traditional summer dish of saffron and white-wine-flavoured aioli, a fennel and baby carrot crudits, and a salmon puck. The camaraderie of the two chefs  who first started working together 14 years ago  is evident as they help each other prep. While Forssell skins a salmon effortlessly, running his knife across its body; Phoenix brushes the croutons with onion oil.When it is time to make the salmon puck, Forssell divides the skinned fish into eight elongated portions. He takes one piece and makes a half-cut, an inch from the centre, and folds it inward to form a cylinder. Neatly, he wraps a leek strip around it and pierces a toothpick to hold it together. He points to the chopping boards and asks us to get to work.It isnt as easy as he made it look. We all fumble, not having paid attention to where the cut is supposed to go. I make my own small, nervous incision, and attempt to fold the raw salmon strip into a cylinder. I quickly tie it up with a leek strip and push in a toothpick pick before my artwork falls apart. I receive a Neat from Phoenix. Obviously, Im thrilled.All the pieces go into the oven, as the chefs set us up for the task of making the crudits salad. While we fumble with the baby carrots and chopper, the professionals make it look effortless. And when the salad is prepared shortly, Forsell gets the salmon pucks out of the oven and shallow fries them. As he grills them golden brown on each side, the chef tells us about traditional Swedish foods which owing to its coastline consists of a lot of seafood, especially salmon. We eat a lot of meat too, pork especially, says Forssell. In Christmas, we make our own ham, pickled herring and meat balls.This year, Forssell and Phoenix cooked for a 1,000 people in Delhi, and the menu comprised a mosaic with scallop and salmon; Swedish caviar as appetizer; a deboned rack of lamb with artichokes, baby carrot and mashed potatoes; and a pineapple parfait with mint to finish off. Some of the recipes are a hundred years old, laughs Phoenix. While we never deviate from the Swedish menu in Nobel dinners, personally, I love Indian food. I make a mean curry.At the end of the masterclass, one thing is evident: the ease with which the chefs encourage us to try our hand at the days menu certainly implies that cooking for 1,350 guests is no big feat for them. Perhaps attending more such classes will help me get better.The author is a freelance writerVisit swedishchamber.in for details."

I believe that at such places, the EVMs can have a software which would directly send the data to control room of election commission as soon as the voter presses the button.""His idea impressed the panelists while another girl Indu Manikpuri suggested an idea for safeguarding septic tanks of toilets made under Swachch Bharat Abhiyan in villages which often overflows due to lack of maintenance. ""To avoid the overflowing of human waste, people drop potatoes in the tank that creates aerobic and in-aerobic bacteria to decompose the waste and reducing its level. But its effect remains only for one or two months and tank overflows again due to excess of waste. Hence, a pressure record scale installed on the top of outer pipe where small capillary tube is inserted, through which the pressure gas would increase and touch the peak of tube. A wire and a red bulb can be connected to capillary tube which would then raise an alarm and bulb would lighten up to alert that the tank is full,"" The girl suggested saying that when the capillary tube reaches the peak level, the circuit gets completed and alarm would signal that it's time to drop potatoes again.Being one of the most common problem in remote areas, this idea suited the panelists and it got selected for IGNITE award.The students would be awarded by President of India and further their ideas would be refined and be used as software on the names of children which would be sold to several companies."

Forty crops, including the upland paddy of Jyothi rice, are cultivated here.The vegetables sown here includes potato, cabbage, tomato, beetroot, carrot, onion, beans and green chilly. Some vegetable will always be ripe for harvesting at the farm round the academic year.When the initiative was launched, the school authorities were not sure whether they would be able to grow all the vegetables available in the market. But now, almost all varieties are grown here, making it a model farm. Both hybrid and traditional crops are grows here, says Siby K. George, convenor of the farm club. The farm is fully organic; pest-control and the application of manure is minimum.A lot of effort, from the children as well as elders, has gone into the farm, which is on a slope. The parents work on the farm along with the teachers on holidays.Though teachers and parents help, the harvest is almost entirely done by the children.They now know which vegetable is ripe for harvest, Mr. George. The children also does the weeding, he says.When a crop is found pest-infested, it is shown to the students and the pests are destroyed, Mr. George adds.The parents also take lessons in vegetable farm management from the school.At this time of the year, tomatoes, chilli and beans are ready for harvest. Though the farm cannot meet the entire vegetable requirements of the noon-meal scheme at the school, on selected days, curries are fully made from the vegetables grown by us, says Mr. George.At homes tooThe farm has also enthused vegetable cultivation at the homes of the children, says Kurien Thomas, the school Headmaster. Most of the students had unused lands which are now being cultivated.The climatic and soil conditions are also suitable, he says, adding at the Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) meetings, the school farm often comes for mention.

You know, civilian casualties are obviously of grave concern to us,"" she said.According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), Riyadh had requested the possible purchase of up to 133 American M1A1/A2 Abrams tanks that would be configured to Saudi needs, plus another 20 to replace damaged tanks in their fleet.Additionally, the deal would include 153 .50-caliber machine guns, 266 7.62mm M240 machine guns, smoke grenade launchers, armored recovery vehicles and a range of other hardware.The US State Department has approved the ""possible"" sale and notified Congress on Monday, the DSCA said.Congress has 30 days to block the sale, though is unlikely to do so. ""This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a strategic regional partner which has been and continues to be a leading contributor of political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,"" the DSCA said in a statement.""The addition of these tanks and recovery vehicles to the (Saudi military's) inventory will enhance Saudi Arabia's ability to support its soldiers in the field and to defend the Kingdom's borders.""The Pentagon announcement made no mention of the conflict in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition intervened in March last year after Shiite Huthi rebels and allied forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh overran Sanaa.Tuesday's raids included a strike on a food factory in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa, medics said.Factory director Abdullah al-Aqel gave a higher toll of 16 killed and 10 wounded, adding that all the victims were workers.The Al-Aqel factory, which makes potato chips and is near a military equipment maintenance center targeted in the raids, was struck during working hours, he added.The UN says more than 6,400 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Yemen since the coalition air campaign began last March.The fighting has also driven 2.8 million people from their homes and left more than 80 percent of the population needing humanitarian aid.Saudi Arabia also forms part of the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State jihadists in Syria and Iraq.Last November, the United States approved a $1.29 billion deal to replenish the Saudi air force's arsenal, depleted by its bombing campaign in Yemen."

The north corporation, which owns the Civic Centre, had given the space for a monthly charge of Re.1.After councillors raised concerns that this deal may be causing the civic body financial loss, the Remunerative Projects (RP) Cell clarified that market rent of the space would have been Rs.6,32,082 per month. The rent was cut to a nominal amount as the cafe was offering food and beverages at subsidised rates to municipal employees, an official document of the RP Cell stated.Unsatisfied with the reason, former Mayor and BJPs Dev Nagar councillor Yogender Chandolia raised concerns at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Wednesday about the way the project was awarded to the private company running the cafe.We understand that a canteen will not get us Rs.6 lakh in rent. But, when the first tender was floated, there were companies willing to pay us Rs.1 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh in rent. Instead of negotiating with them, our officials picked someone else for Re.1 without following due process, Mr. Chandolia told The Hindu .According to the RP Cell, however, the earlier two bidders were rejected as they did not have the required technical capabilities. As per the RP cell, the present contractor was the only one that responded when the corporation advertised the project on its website on March 23, 2015.BJPs Rajendra Nagar councillor Rajesh Bhatia, who was the first to raise concern, said that other provisions of the agreement were also shocking.Extra goodiesWhat is more astounding is that the corporation has provided the company with inventory worth lakhs of rupees free of cost, said Mr. Bhatia.As per the agreement, the corporation gave refrigerators, boilers, burners, microwave ovens, a double tank fryer, a sandwich griller, a 10-kg capacity potato peeler and a 300-kg weighing scale to the cafe operator."

This April, however, the farmer from Majuli and his family of seven polished off almost a quintal of beetles.Pankaj is one of hundreds of farmers on Majuli, recently declared the largest river island by Guinness World Records, who have discovered a taste for the light brown, crunchy beetles locally known as 'hati puk'. In fact, Majuli's new-found craze for beetles serves an ecological purpose - pest control.""It tastes great! It's a bit like eating prawns. All through April and May, when the beetles were in abundance, we binged on them,"" Pankaj smiled.The farmers of Majuli, an island on the Brahmaputra spread over 880 sq km with a population of 160,000, would suffer heavy crop damage due to attack by the insect Lepidiota mansueta. The white grub, which has a biennial life cycle, would destroy vast swathes of crops every year between April and May. The grub would mainly attack potato, colocasia, green gram and sugarcane cultivations in Majuli which has about 30,584 hectare of cultivable land.The farmers hit upon the simple but effective idea of eating their enemies with some help from scientists of Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Jorhat.The scientists, under the All India Network Project, began studying the white grub and pest control on Majuli since 2004. Senior scientist of AAU's entomology department and principal investigator of the project Badal Bhattacharyya and his team carried out extensive campaigns among farmers on the nutritional value of the beetle and on using light traps to catch the insects.""The project (to explore ways of pest control) is part of social engineering. We are controlling pests without using any pesticides. This is being done in keeping in mind that Majuli aspires to be a Unesco World Heritage site,"" Bhattacharyya explains.Analyses of the nutritional value of beetle have confirmed that it is rich in protein (76.83%), followed by carbohydrate (10.93%), fat (4.10%) and fibre (5.16%).Farmers aside, the project has also received a thumbs up from the government. In 2014, it bagged the Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Award for ""Outstanding Research in Tribal Farming Systems"" awarded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.Majuli, home to diverse ethnic communities and the hub of neo-Vaishnavite culture in the state, is no stranger to entomophagy. However, consumption of beetles would earlier be confined to the Mishing community.With AAU's intervention, other communities, too, have realized the many advantages of eating the grub.Cultivator Ganesh Saikia has the last word on the popularity of the project. ""Earlier, we would have some inhibition about eating beetles. Now, it has become our alternative to fish,"" Saikia said."

""Just want to ask Rahul Gandhi, is dalali a word to refer Indian Army and their efforts to save the country,"" he added.Accusing Narendra Modi of gaining political mileage out of, Gandhi had said that the government was doing ""dalali"" (trade) over the bloodshed by Indian soldiers.""Unki dalali kar rahe ho... Yeh bilkul ghalat hai... Hindustan ki sena ne Hindustan ka kaam kiya, aap apna kaam keejiye... (You are trading on them. This is totally wrong... The Indian Army did its job for India, you do your work),"" Rahul had said in a brief but aggressive speech on Thursday.Taking a dig at the Congress party, Shah also said that the comment from party's vice-president clearly reflects the mindset of the Congress party.Those who have questioned the government over the surgical strikes have not only insulted the Army but also the jawans who have lost their lives, Shah added.Taking a potshot at Rahul Gandhi, Shah said that his understanding of farming in the country is limited to 'aalu ki factories' alone.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi, at a political rally had said, ""You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader, I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers.""Shah also attacked. The Delhi chief minister had made headlines in Pakistani media outlets when he raised his doubts over government's 'claim' of surgical strikes along the LoC on September 29. In a video message addressed to the Prime Minister, he had urged him to ""expose"" Pakistan's propaganda on surgical strikes.Responding to a poser on some BJP leaders creating a hype on the strikes, he said some workers were only exhibiting their excitement and questioned why there is was no such excitement in the Congress leadership.The BJP chief urged all parties not to politicise the issue but said the BJP would take the issue to the masses to build up the confidence of the armed forces.""We have not claimed the surgical strikes. The army did it. Army and not the politicians should claim credit,"" he said.He said by questioning the strikes, Congress is associating itself with the dejection in Pakistan. He asked it to stand with the army and the enthused people of India instead."

After the heavy rains last week, water scarcity in Shirdi has come to an end just before the upcoming Guru Pournima Utsav, said CEO Bajirao Shinde.""On the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi, the high-tech kitchen of Shirdi temple made 250 quintal of sabudana khichdi for devotees.

These taluks should be declared drought-hit. Crops like potato, chilly, cotton, jowar and others have been damaged badly. The government should declare support price for potato and open procurement centres, he said.Pralhad Joshi, MP, said the State government had not yet released the crop insurance money for last year and they were citing reasons of duplicate loan accounts of the farmers as major hindrance.However, even after three months no measures have been initiated to set right this problem.The State government should start disbursing the crop insurance by Wednesday or else the BJP would launch an agitation, Mr. Joshi said.Mr. Joshi added that the State government should immediately hold survey to assess the crop loss and sent a proposal to the Centre. He said he would use his office to see that maximum assistance from the Centre is made available.The team led by Mr. Shettar and Mr. Joshi visited Nagashettikoppa, Bengeri, Sulla, Byahatti, Hebasur, Kiresur and Mantur villages."

On World Vegetarian Day , we speak to a few newbie veggies in town to learn more about what it is like to become one.For Kochi-based yoga practitioner Sudakshna Thampi, who joined the vegetarian bandwagon a year ago, vegetarianism has impacted her mind the most. ""The past one year has been a life changing journey for me. Vegetarian food is lighter, more sattvik, karmically better, good for nature and animals as well. Mindful eating is the best way to eat appropriately and I have become more mindful now. I am aware about the food I have on my plate and know how it tastes and smells, its texture and how I feel after consuming it. Turning vegetarian has been the best decision of my life,"" she says.Karthika Nair, a vegetarian by choice for the past two years, doesn't shy away from saying that she owes her recent success to the veggie diet that she follows. Karthika bid good bye to her long-time digestion issues after turning a vegetarian two years back. ""My job demanded a lot of travel and I used to suffer from acidity, stomach upset and digestion problems all through. My career was at stake and that is when I opted to be a vegetarian. The results were magical. I am perfectly healthy now and haven't consulted a doctor for a year. I also used to get issues like joint pains, body aches and also eye sight issues. But after being a vegetarian, my sight is improving and my doctor even said I can go for a laser surgery now. What more do I need to go green?"" she asks. Karthika has now become an advocate of vegetarianism, and many of her friends are also trying out a vegetarian diet to see the transformation for themselves.Kasaba actress Neha Saxena who had an on-and-off relationship with vegetarianism says her diet keeps her fresh and beautiful. ""If you ask me what foods I prefer? I will always say leafy vegetables, cereals, pulses and fruits. It purifies the blood. Carrots are good for the eyes, green veggies keeps my hair healthy and my skin glowing. I also avoid masalas as much as possible,"" she says.According to Neha, a meat-free diet also keeps one physically and mentally more energetic. ""I don't feel exhausted during back-to-back shoots, after I added raw vegetables to my diet,"" she adds.You are what you eat', they say, and that is what Ashwini Prem goes by. Ashwini and family are now vegetarians and she says there has been a drastic change in the family's approach towards other living beings and life in general. ""Five years back when I met my husband he was a pakka non-vegetarian. But now he is a pure vegetarian and there is a huge transformation in his behaviour. He has become more compassionate, spiritual and sensitive. Not only him, our maid and driver too have joined the cause and admit that they have become more empathetic towards both animals and human beings. It also amplifies your patience levels,"" she adds.Ashwini describes their lives as full of happiness and positivity now. ""The word vegetarian comes from the Latin word Vegetus which means full of vitality, vigour and cheer. Plant foods signify peace and harmony; are soothing and cleansing and instill positivity in you. Meat spells death, blood, harm, pain and foul smells, all of which gives you negativity,"" she says.Vegetables are rich in antioxidants. They neutralise free radicals in the body and prevent a lot of lifestyle illness. Different antioxidants bring different benefits to the body; while some boost our immune system, others benefit the skin, eyes, memory problems, moods etc. To be more specific, beta-carotene is good for the eyes, iycopene for prostate health and proanthocyanidin for the urinary tract.However, when a full blown non-vegetarian opts for a vegetarian diet, they should take care to add protein substitutes as well. Only in animal proteins do we get complete proteins which have all the mild amino acids. Soya beans are the best substitute for protein. Combination foods like idly/dosa and sambar provide the benefits for cereals and pulses. And also while making flour batter for chappati, use water with boiled dal. Vegetarians should also take substitutes for Vitamin D and B12 following a rainbow diet - including vegetables of all colours. Have lots of legumes, pulses, cereals, green leaves and fruits!-Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, clinical nutritionistMeanwhile, does the taste of non-veg side dishes stop you from turning a vegetarian? There are many who have been saying that even though they want to follow a vegetarian diet, they find it really tough to replace the taste of fried chicken, fish and beef that dominate their taste buds.

But buying a land is neither cheap nor easy. However, Sundar and many others were flabbergasted when the district horticulture department invited residents to come and lease land on periodic basis, as TOI had reported earlier.""Buying a land is not that easy. But now with the horticulture department giving an option to lease land, I can barely contain my excitement,"" she said.According to officials, within two weeks of the announcement, some 35 residents have already approached the department. ""We have heard from 35 people who are interested and we also carried out a site visit for around 25 people on Saturday,"" said Deen Mohammad Khan , district horticulture officer.The land has been selected in Tikli, a village near Badshahpur, after the land proposed earlier failed some tests. The department will now have the membership forms ready and the work will be started from October.Meanwhile the horticulture department has decided that it will be run the programme on a membership basis and charge Rs 3,879 per month per unit which can be paid monthly or upfront. Every unit will be 600 square yards.The department will keep extra labour to look after the maintenance and security of crops when the residents are away. Besides, there will be a refundable security fee of Rs 5,000 per unit. ""Every unit will be leased for six months because vegetables are grown seasonally and if a resident feels that the plan is not working for them, they can quit after giving a 45-day notice,"" said Khan.Officials informed that they will sit with every family and make a list of vegetables to be grown depending on their preference. ""As per yield, one unit will be able to produce 2,500kg of potato or 1,500kg of potato in one season,"" said Khan. For those interested in organic farming there will be special guidance and assistance.To make things further convenient for the residents, the department has proposed a delivery van which can collect fresh vegetables and milk and deliver it to their residences every morning."

In appointing the Commission the Government has taken into consideration the fundamental basis of the reorganisation of States. Mr. Mahajan will hear the concerned parties and make his recommendations.It is not quite clear whether the recommendations made by the Commission would be binding on both the parties. In fact the Working Committee resolution had mentioned that the Commission shall hear the concerned parties and give its final decision. Mr. Sadiq Ali, General Secretary of the Congress, had explained that when we say the decision of the Commission will be final, it will be binding on both the parties. But to-days decision taken by the Government, however, says that the Commission shall hear the concerned parties and make its recommendations. This departure from the wording of the Working Committees resolution is presumably because the Commissions recommendations could be implemented only by Parliament. No time limit has been fixed for submission of the report by the Commission or for concluding its deliberations. It is believed unlikely that the recommendations would be made before the next general elections in February 1967.Use substitute for rice & wheat: PMThe Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi said here [New Delhi] to-day [Oct. 17] that in view of the difficult situation facing the country due to shortage of wheat and rice, people should take to substitute food. She said that in the Soviet Union, for five years after the revolution, people ate substitute food like potatoes and vegetables for wheat. If rice and wheat were not available, people should be asked to try substitute food, she said.Mrs. Gandhi, who presided over the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Congress Parliamentary Party to-day, is reported to have said that she had learnt about the bad drought situation in eastern U.P. and Bihar. The Central Government was trying its best to help these States by supplying wheat and rice, but how much it would be able to supply would naturally depend on the overall supply position.The Executive which discussed the drought situation in U.P., Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan for over 130 minutes felt that emergency measures should be taken to meet the situation."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all-India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham secretary general D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives."

""Farmers are not getting their produce to the market in large quantities. The onions that arrive are simply being forwarded to the local retail market,"" he added.Predicting that the minimum wholesale price of onions could shoot up to Rs 400-500 per quintal by next week, Saleem pointed out that cloudy weather resulted in the reduction of their cost. ""There has not been any sudden fall in price. As a result, all sectors including traders, buyers and retail sellers are steady,"" he said.He said that he foresaw two possible outcomes for onion traders after the Ganesha festival: ""The prices may go down further because farmers may bring large quantities of the crop to the market. The other possibility is of rain destroying crops, which might see the prices soar.""Nasir Hussain-Attar, another onion trader, believes that prices will only witness a further reduction after the festival. ""Many farmers have cultivated onion and the quality of the yield has been good. However, if there is more demand from Mumbai, the price may go up. As of now, Mumbai buyers have deferred the purchase in view of the festival,"" he said.He went on to add that local retailers are buying onions at sustainable prices.A Gamangatti-based woman farmer, Ningavva decided to sell her onions directly at the retail market, where they would fetch her Rs 10-20 per kg. ""At APMC, the price they were offering for my crop was Rs 5 per kg. I am bringing 50kg every day and selling it directly at the retail market.

Except for the stray wanderer who drives off the bustling National Highway 17 (66), the significance of this village and its history is all but lost.What may appear like just any other Goan roadside village, strewn across the paddy fields barely 10km from Panaji was, until the emergence of Ela or today's Old Goa, India's wealthiest city and busiest port on the southwest coast. Goa Velha literally means Old Goa. This is often the reason for the village being confused for the other historically rich village of Old Goa or Velha Goa which was then still nascent.Gopakapattana is said to be built by Sanapulla, the founder of the south Konkan Silahara dynasty, who reigned from 765 AD. The Silaharas ruled from 765 AD to 1020 AD, when they were overthrown by the Kadambas.According to the famous historian Dr A S Altekar, Gopakapattana finds mention in the epic, Mahabharata. It was also known as Govapuri or Gove in the Ramayana, which adds that whoever casts a glance over the holy city of Govapuri gets his sins cleansed.As the Kadamba dynasty prospered, they built a navy that was formidable. With Chandor being too small to accommodate his fleet of ships, Kadamba ruler Jayakeshi I moved to Goa Velha or Gopakapattana which had natural breakwaters, a safe cove and was open to the seas, historians recount.Today, all that remains of that historic city are the ruins of the laterite brick wall of the ancient port, the site of the Kadamba palace, the 8km-long royal passage known as Raj Bidd from Agasaim to Old Goa, and some centuries-old water tanks.A predominantly Catholic village, Goa Velha is marked by many crosses and chapels besides the striking church of St Andrew The village also holds a special significance for the Hindu brethren. Chamunda Devi is worshipped as the gramdevi or village goddess and this is seen in the number of stores that are named after the deity. While the main temple dedicated to Chamunda Devi is at Bicholim, a small idol of the goddess remains housed in the Zuwarkar family home for daily dharshan.On Akshaya tritiya, the deity kept in the Zuwarkar household is put on an assembled palki (palanquin) and taken in a procession to the building of the Marathi school of the Chemunda Samaj in Goa Velha. It is followed by a three-day cultural programme.Among the prominent families of the village are the Kenis, Zuwarkars and the Menezes'. The few large and old houses scattered about in the village are reportedly owned by these families. The beautiful colonial-style architecture of the houses that belong to the Menezes family, specifically Solar-Menezes or Menezes Mansion, the main ancestral house of the family is very impressive.The 350-year old home of the Zuwarkar's commands a note. It is said that the surname Zuwarkar originates from this village. Walk through the centuries-old wooden door frame on an evening and you maybe lucky to bump into the Zuwarkar cousins. Ask nicely and they will happily show you their family tree drawn on parched paper.Today, the vestiges of Goa Velha are fading away. Once famed for its sweet potatoes and saltpans, traditional trade is dying out. With 65% of its population, especially the younger generation, trading in their Indian passports for the sought-after Portuguese passport, the identity of the village is changing, says Dr Carmo Pegado.The vaccum created by the migration to British shores is slowly being filled up by migrants from neighbouring states.In the past, Goa Velha was famous for Ayurveda. In fact, one of the village wards, Zuari, comprised mostly experts in Ayurvedic medicines and the treatment of broken bones and hence they were known as Zuarioilo dotor. Not much is left of this trade today.Procession of saintsThe church of St Andrew hosts the unique procession of saints, similar to the one in Rome.Shouldered by local devotees, around 28 life-size statues of saints are taken in procession around the church on the fifth Monday of Lent.PilarNo piece on Goa Velha can be complete without a mention of the Pilar Society, or the Mission Society of St. Francis Xavier. Situated atop a hillock in the Pilar ward, this Catholic religious congregation produced the ascetic figure of Venerable Fr Agnelo Gustavo Adolfo de Souza, a missionary, zealous preacher and spiritual director, who died with an aura of sanctity.After the 1835 crackdown on religious orders by the Portuguese colonialists, a Goan priest Fr Jose Mariano Clement Bento Martins founded the Mission Society of St Francis Xavier. The church of Our Lady of Pilar is a fine example of the 17th century architecture and contains relics of Ven.

Everything on the ground pointed to the explosion having been caused by materials used in crackers, a common commodity in and around the blast site.A typical bomb blast leaves behind a crater. We have found no crater at the blast site. It was a low-intensity blast. Our guess is that it was caused by crackers, said S.B.K Singh, Special CP (Law & Order).Investigators said they first looked around for sharpnels at the blast site. There were none. All we could find were materials used for manufacturing crackers, said a senior investigator.Though even toughened glasses of several shops in the street were shattered because of the blast, a lot of other items remained unaffected. Nothing happened to the compressors of the air-conditioners even as glasses all around them broke into pieces. A bomb blast would have certainly damaged the compressors, said an officer.Potato-bomb effectThe police described the impact of the blast as a typical potato-bomb effect (popular as aloo-bomb), but of a much greater magnitude. When the two bags of crackers were put on the ground, it had the same impact that an aloo-bomb has when it is hit hard against the wall, causing it to burst. The high damage was because of the quantity of crackers packed in the bags, said an officer.When crackers are packed tightly in a bag, there is the potential of pressure building inside, he said. Any kind of force on it can cause it to burst. This is what most likely happened with this bag too, the officer said.The impact of the blast was even greater because of the narrow street in which the explosion happened. Had the same incident happened in a wider road or on an open ground, the impact would have been lesser, said police.Some of the crackers found on the spot carried labels of Sony, a fireworks manufacturer based in Tamil Nadu.

Yet, on Friday night, Rohitaswa Das touched down at Kolkata airport all the way from Australia , to get back the piece of land that helped him become what he is today.An IT manager in Belmont Civic Centre, Das has strong roots in Singur. Looking at his plot within the three bighas of ancestral land on Saturday morning, Das reminisced about his early years  when his family used to earn by producing a special variety of brinjals.""This is the land where I spent my childhood. I come from a peasant family that used to earn from potatoes and brinjal farming. It is with this money that I did my M.Stat from Indian Statistical Institute, Baranagar. Later, I took up a job in Baroda before heading for Australia. But that didn't snap my links with Singur. I come here every two years and go to the farm land. Some of my relatives are still in farming,"" Das said.Das came to know of the Supreme Court's land return verdict from Australian newspapers. ""It's a unique thing and got wide coverage in the Australian media. Later, my relatives called and asked me to come down to Singur to take my land back. I couldn't resist the temptation because farming is in my blood,"" the NRI said.Das said he hoped the government would make the entire area suitable for farming and also rebuild the damaged village canal flowing by the project area. Asked about Singur's return from industry to agriculture, Das said: ""I was initially in favour of industry. I felt that a car unit in Singur would create opportunities for the youth. But I became averse to the proposal when police burst tear gas shells in front of my house. I didn't like the coercion. The government should have consulted the owners instead of acquiring the land by force.""Das isn't the only NRI landowner here. Bidyut Ghosh and Durgasankar Bose from the US also own land within the Singur project area."

They have to pay rent for the storage and the quantities stored have to be recorded at the facilities.

It will come to around Rs 60 a plate.Prices of select vegetable items are more than that in Delhi,"" said Anita Mukherjee, who has come from Delhi to visit her parents at Lake Market. At Lake Market on Tuesday, potato (chandramukhi) was selling at Rs 28-30 a kilo, brinjal at Rs 40-50, bitter gourd (uchhe) at Rs 40-55, drum sticks (sajne danta) at Rs 100120 and kanchkala at Rs 10-12 each.

Bags containing 100 kg potato are loaded on trucks at Rs 2140 per bag which comes down to Rs 21.40 a kilo for the chandramukhi variety .What makes potato prices soar by Rs 9 a kilo? The story is all about aggregators, hoarders, Puja organisers and a section of police officers who collect money from trucks as they pass through the 10-odd police station areas before reaching the wholesale market at Posta. From there, light vehicles carry potatoes to the retail markets in the city.Other vegetables are usu ally brought from North 24Parganas, South 24-Parganas and Murshidabad.

Price of each vegetable is less by at least Rs 4-5 compared to the prices at Gariahat, Lake Market and Maniktala markets. For instance, ladies finger in Basirhat is selling at Rs 8-12 a kilo and the green chilli (Beldanga variety) at Rs 30 a kilo at Behrampore. But prices of these vegetables in Kolkata are at least three times high. The upswing has caught the attention of the state government. Prodded by chief minister Mamata Banerjee , the government task force on prices held a meeting at Nabanna on Tuesday to discuss on ways to monitor prices and see that they do not go up further.

We will start visiting the city markets soon and inform the police in case of an abnormality,"" said a task force member."

Kandolkar revealed that he has pursued the matter with the chief minister but to no avail.""Someone wishes to set up a stadium there, but locals opposed it. The locals welcomed this multipurpose project, but I still don't understand why, for eight months, there is a problem with the land allotment for the project,"" Kandolkar said, stating defence minister Manohar Parrikar had given his word for the project during the last ZP polls. He added, ""My words may not have weightage, I don't know whether there is weightage for the defence minister's words.""Sources said, under this project, the government intends to setup a sorting centre, and vegetables which are sorted at Belgaum , will be sorted again and only hygienically packed vegetables will be sold to customers in Goa. The project will also include an open market, where farmers from Bardez taluka, who cultivate vegetables and fruits, will be allotted free spaces to sell their products.Another feature of the project is the ripening chambers which would hopefully deter harmful practice of chemical ripening. Fruit vendors from Goa will be provided with this facility. Kandolkar said presently, chemical ripening exists in the state because there is no ripening chamber. There will also be multiple cold storage spaces for fruits and vegetables. such as potatoes."

On occasions, mid-day meal workers have stopped providing eggs and are serving only bananas as it not viable for them with the given commission.With the prices of red gram and green gram soaring high, workers are forced to serve dal prepared with Bengal gram, which is available at a cheaper price.Similarly, workers are unable to provide different varieties of vegetables due to escalation of prices, and they are forced to serve cheaply available vegetables such as cucumber, potatoes etc.How can we serve eggs twice in a week as per norms when the cost of each egg is Rs.4.50 paise to Rs. 5?, questions Lalitha, a mid-day meal worker in the Government High School, Mankammathota, in the town. The government just provides us rice free of cost. We have to purchase vegetables, oil, ingredients, firewood etc to prepare food at the cost of Rs. 6.64 paise per student, she says.The condition of mid-day meal workers serving food in primary schools is even worse.They are paid only Rs.4.76 paise per student."
58f6a034a3d24b0b70c2d8ce,Popular weekly shandies need to be regulated,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/popular-weekly-shandies-need-to-be-regulated/article8127590.ece,2016-01-20,,The Hindu,"Weekly shandies or vaara sandais are popular among the residents of the city and outskirts. Farmers from Alagarkoil, Alanganallur, Avaniapuram, Kadachanendal and other areas in the district sell their vegetables at locations which give easy access to people.Though regular visitors to these vaara sandais are familiar with the sellers (farmers), they are not sure about the correctness of weights and measures used. However, there is an impression among many buyers that prices are cheap in the weekly shandies than in regular markets and vegetable stalls.According to Corporation authorities, there are close to two dozen shandies functioning in the city and peripheries, but the major shandies popular among the consumers are Sunday market at Uchaparambumedu, Monday market at Koodal Nagar, Tuesday markert at Ellis Nagar, etc.On an average, 200 to 300 persons come to sell their produce, mainly vegetables and fruits. Local merchants also sell hot bajjis, potato chips and sugarcane juice at the shandies. A few artisans sell fancy handicraft items and so on. Close to 2,000 persons visit each shandy.For Roberts (55) of Ellis Nagar, the shandy has its own advantages and disadvantages. When roads were being laid at Ellis Nagar, the shandy was a big barrier for many residents as the farmers put up their shops on both sides of the roads. However, after the roads were laid and widened, vehicle movement had become easy and the number of farmers putting up shops at the shandy had also gone up, and the shandy had extended up to BSNL office from Tamil Nadu Housing Board office, he noted.Radhika, a BSNL employee from DSP Nagar, Bypass Road, said that vegetables like onion and carrot were fresh and reasonably priced at the shandy. It is convenient for me since I buy three or four vegetables once a week and store them in the refrigerator, she added.Another sideHowever, the residents of Rajaji Street in Uchaparambumedu near Iyer Bungalow had a different tale. On Sunday, the market would open at 5 p.m., which meant the farmers would arrive from 2 p.m. The noise and commotion deprived the residents of their post-lunch nap, said Rafiq, who runs a leather business in the city.Till about two years ago, the market functioned on the main road, but due to heavy vehicle movement, the farmers have sneaked into our street. The noise pollution is unbearable on Sundays, he said.Another senior citizen of the same street said that Madurai Corporation should not permit sale of eatables on roads. All vegetables were kept open. It was unhygienic since stray dogs and cattle wandered all around and urinated here and there. Since the market was open beyond 6 p.m., the quality of vegetables could not be checked.On Konnavayanchalai and Bypass Road, the residents alleged that traffic went for a toss when the markets opened. Already, travel on Bypass Road was risky as vehicle flow was high around 6 p.m. Traffic police at the intersection said that since the pathway was occupied by the farmers for their makeshift shandy, pedestrians had to use the roads. Every week, there were cases of freak accidents due to overcrowding and haphazard parking.An official of Corporation Health Department said that the respective sanitary inspectors and teams were entrusted with the task of clearing garbage from the weekly shandies the next day. For instance, a large posse of conservancy workers would be deployed to Uchaparambumedu area on Mondays to clear vegetable wastes which got piled up on both sides of the road, and it applied to other locations as well, she noted.Agriculture Department officials said that farmers from nearby areas such as Poikaikaraipatti, Kadachanendal, Oomachikulam and parts of Alanganallur brought their produce and sold them here. Prices were fixed by them and there was no mechanism with any agency to check their correctness. The prices would not be certainly lesser than uzhavar sandai rates.About a year ago, Labour Department officials, during a raid, found that the weights and measures used in these shandies were not calibrated or those approved by the government. A mere warning was given to the farmers to use electronic scale. The officials did not seize the weights since the farmers pleaded with them to forgive them, an official said.Police officers from the respective stations, who used to warn people through mobile public address system to beware of bag lifters and pickpockets till a few months back were not to be seen now, residents of Uchaparambumedu said.Many residents said that the corporation authorities should study the modalities to regulate the shandies and earmark exclusive space for the farmers. Instead of allowing the farmers to convert roads into makeshift shandies, the officials should provide protected places which would be safe and convenient for the residents, they said."

They have also warned to further intensify their struggle if BSF didn't take action against some of its erring officials.""We have been pleading BSF officials for long to at least stick to the border gate at opening and closing time but they don't. Some of the security personnel often misbehave with farmers and treat them badly,"" said general secretary, Border Area Sangharsh Committee, Rattan Singh Randhawa while talking to TOI on Thursday.He said they had already staged demonstration at Kakkar and Mahawa BOPs. ""Now we will 'gherao' all BOPs of BSF across the Punjab border in a phased manner,"" he said.He alleged that a few BOP in-charges hold meetings with selective farmers who don't raise any objection to them fearing being falsely implicated in smuggling cases by BSF. ""They never invite us or the farmers who oppose BSF's wrongdoing. It has to be stopped. We will not let them issue diktats to us and insult us,"" Randhawa warned.A farmer from the border area Raj Balbir Singh, informed that BSF only allowed them to reap varieties of crops that grow up to four feet, including paddy. ""BSF doesn't allow us to grow crops like sweet potato, cotton and chillies, which are not more than two feet in height. We fail to understand the logic behind this ban,"" he said. Another farmer Arsal Singh said BSF had also made process of issuing identity (ID) cards difficult for farmers, who own land beyond the border fence. ""We have farm help coming from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar but they are not issued ID cards even on guarantee of landowner. And if we argue with them, the officials misbehave with us,"" he alleged.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha president Satnam Singh Ajnala said delegation of farmers had held meeting with senior BSF officials who assured them full support in checking smuggling or infiltration. ""However, BSF needs to win border farmers' and residents' confidence. They want to convey their problems to senior BSF officials through gherao,"" he said.An 'expert committee' of farm scientists and officials, set up to examine the problems of border area farmers, had mentioned in its report to the Punjab government that BSF didn't strictly follow the timing of 8am to 5pm for opening of border gates. ""Farmers gain entry to fields after 10 am and are forced out by 2.30pm,"" said the report. It further stated that every gate was not opened daily, forcing farmers to travel more, and entry to the fields situated beyond border fence was not allowed on Sundays and holidays. The committee had also observed that due to lack of canal water, farmers were forced to use tubewells for irrigation but erratic power supply at critical period resulted in low productivity. Besides, wild animals often destroyed the crop."

It is also the only time when specific regional cuisines are actually available at different venues.During the day it is the bhog which is prepared by special cooks for offering the goddess at the Bengali Durga puja . ""We have items like khichidi, chorchori, (a mix of brinjal, radish and pumpkin) and bati chorchori, a more sophisticated version made with cauliflower, beans and carrots offered as bhog to the deity during day time,"" says Soumandra Sarkar, organizer of Katol Road Durga puja which is famous for its food stalls. In the evening the stalls offering various Bengali delicacies do brisk business at these venues. Beguni, made by frying brinjal dipped in gramflour batter and smeared with poppy seeds, Dimer devil, an egg preparation in which boiled egg is halved and stuffed with potato paste, dipped in besan and deep fried and ghughni, made with chickpeas are all quintessential Bengali food items which sell fast. ""Equally famous are the stalls which prepare fish, mutton and chicken cutlets, fried pomfret, fish curry and rice and biryani. Noodles and egg, chicken and mutton rolls are equally popular,"" says Sarkar.Caterers who specialize in these cuisines are given contracts for these occasions. ""Bengali families do not cook at home during puja days as they are busy attending the rituals at puja pandals during the day and then flitting from one venue to the other in the evening. So we keep these wholesome food combinations which are moderately priced and enjoyed by all,"" Sarkar adds.At the Ram Nagar Durga puja it's an all vegetarian fare. ""Our puja pandal is in between two temples and so we are hesitant of keeping non-vegetarian food stalls here,"" says Datta Satyendu the organizer. ""We will have no control over the plates and the waste is disposed and this may hurt the sentiments of others,"" he says. But Satyendu feels that there is hardly any loss of footfalls. ""There are a lot of non-Bengalis who visit our pandal and once they know that only vegetarian food is sold and served here they enjoy it."" Only Bengalis eat non-vegetarian food during puja days, the rest turn vegetarian during the Puja days. ""Bengalis keep moving from one venue to other so it really doesn't affect us,"" he adds.""Since women are not cooking at all during this time, the husbands know that all the meals will have be at the stalls here and are ready to indulge us,"" says Madhumita Bannerjee, a schoolteacher. ""I would say nothing matches the bhog in terms of taste but I especially look forward to the beguni,"" she adds.If the Bengali puja pandals are all about Bengali delicacies, the garba pandals are more about quick refreshments. An array of food stalls are lined up here as the crowds are much larger. ""Lemon soda and juice stalls along with those selling instant noodles and pasta are a big hit,"" says young businessman Karan Grover. ""The ten minute breaks are too short for people to spend time on eating,"" he adds.""There is so much of frenzied dancing happening here till late night that juice stalls do a thundering business ,"" says photographer Surpeet Kapoor who is a regular at these venues. In terms of food the one at Queta colony is a big favourite and it's a final destination for all dancing enthusiasts. ""The wide range of food stalls serve dosa, ice-cream, sandwiches and pasta,"" says choreographer Sidhartha Joshi. ""The idea is to grab a quick bite and gulp a cool refreshing drink in between dancing. So only 'super' fast food is sold here,"" he adds with a smile."

It served twin purposes -such demarcations will help owners to get the land as estimated by the Hooghly land records office, and the land labourers will get some crumbs of the government bounty . On Friday morning, Srimati Tudu, Bilasi Soren, Phulmani Kisku and Madan Ghosh from Gopalnagar joined work happily because they won't have to go to far off places to eke out a living.The Singur panchayat samity has engaged these day labourers under the NREG scheme on a daily wage of Rs 165 and breakfast. ""We are planning to give some money because the work is not too easy. The samity members at a meeting decided to begin the work with day labourers from Gopalnagar, Dobandhi and Bajemelia,"" said panchayat samity chairperson Pratima Das. The rural body has also devised a way to identify the bona fide day labourers from these areas and keep outsiders at bay. These labourers have got a certificate from the respective gram panchayat member based on which the block land and land reforms office has given them permission to enter the land. ""We are very happy. All of us had come from Bankura 22 years ago to work on the fields here.We have got back the right to work in Singur at last.

58f6b702a3d24b0b70c2e45b,Why pulses rates skyrocketed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Why-pulses-rates-skyrocketed/article14405613.ece,2016-06-28,,The Hindu,"Pulses, the common mans food, have gone beyond the reach of millions with the government failing to rein in the crisis extending across the country since March, 2015. Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

After having helped his friend Raj Seelam since 2004 in his Hyderabad-based organic products venture Sresta, he quit his lucrative job in the FMCG sector and joined Srestas start-up 24 Mantra Organic in 2010 as its CEO.We now have a network of 32,000 farmers producing 90 crops across 1.70 lakh acres in 15 States. We plan to expand to 1 lakh farmers and 5 lakh acres in the next five years.Explaining Srestas business model, he said the firm is not into contract farming. It helps farmers grow organic produce and pays market price for the produce. It currently markets across 145 cities in India, and has tied up with retail majors. It also has access to about 1,000 stores in 45 States in the US and has a presence in Singapore, Dubai and Mauritius.One-stop shopIndore-based Raman Singh Saluja has a slightly different story to narrate. For three years from 1995, he was into wind energy; moved to exporting potato and pulses to West and South Asia before he realised the gaps in supply chain in agriculture. This prompted him to start a web portal and supply-chain initiative called Gram Mandi.com but gave it up in 2000 due to APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) laws and poor web connectivity. He then returned to his family business of metal trading before finally, founding a start-up in 2010.His rural solutions company Gramco Infratech offers farmers end-to-end services under one roof  from sowing to marketing end products, except selling machines. It helps farmers with seeds, fertilisers, bio-fertilisers, chemicals, water solubles, and warehousing. The company also has access to 250 acres of contract farming for soyabean and wheat in Madhya Pradesh. Farmers are free to market their products.We recently tied up with a fertiliser major. In the next three years, we plan to expand to 10,000 to 15,000 acres of contract farming.From growing organic produce to offering farming services, these professionals fill the gap in the sector"

In the last few weeks, tomato prices have shot up multi-fold and purchases have dropped.In Coimbatore, the wholesale price of 1 kg of tomatoes on Tuesday was Rs. 60 and the retail price went up to Rs. 80 a kg. In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

This time, the centre is going to conduct studies on sweet potato too along with the tapioca.With the Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University allocating 6.26 acres of land from its Agriculture Research Station here, Dr. YSR Horticulture University has approved to set up the Horticulture Research Station and allocated a principal scientist and three supporting staff, besides releasing Rs. 25 lakh towards the construction of office building.The All India Coordinated Research Project on Tuber Crops (AICRPTC), on its part, has sanctioned another Rs. 25 lakh for setting up a state-of-the-art laboratory to conduct studies on tapioca and sweet potato. Though the research station has formally commenced its operations from here, it will be equipped with its own office building and laboratory within two years from now.Of the total extent of 80,000 acres in which tapioca is being cultivated in the State, over 65,000 acres is situated in the upland mandals of East Godavari district. The Horticulture Department established a research station on tapioca here way back in 1975, encouraging more and more farmers to switch over to tapioca from other conventional crops. As a result of the continuous research conducted by the station, the yield per acre rose from 4,500 kg to 9,000 kg.Karra Pendalam in the local parlance, tapioca tuber is the main ingredient for making sago. Going by the increased produce of tapioca, over 40 sago mills were established in and around Peddapuram over a period of time. However, the research station was shifted to Venkataramannagudem, the headquarters of Dr. YSR Horticulture University in March, 2012, owing to administrative reasons.As a result of the constant efforts of the tapioca farmers, local elected representatives and the officials of both the Agriculture and Horticulture Universities, the station has come back to the town now. We have already started our fieldwork by interacting with the local farmers. Our focus is ensuring pest-free tapioca tuber and value addition sweet potato to the farmers here. As we are researching into coloured sweet potato with beta-carotene, more and more farmers will be opting for sweet potato in the years to come, B.V.K. Bhagawan, Principal Scientist of the university and in-charge of the station, has told The Hindu .With the tapioca transplantation gaining momentum, the research station staff turned busy advising the farmers on the steps to be taken to get better yield."

A total crop area of around 45 acres was covered in which lights were put up at intervals of 60 metres each on bamboo poles at a height of about 8 feet. The lights were placed at the eye level of elephants so that they can see them from a long distance.Elephants did come to the field where paddy followed by cauliflowers, brinjals, tomatoes, potatoes, pumpkins, and bananas were grown. The big mammals kept waiting at a distance from lights, but did not invade the crop field.Similarly, lights were put up during the mango season from April to June 2016 at an orchard spread over 12 acres at Ganjara village near Hindol Forest Range and 20-acre orchard at Patusahi Kateni village in Dhenkanal district.I used to incur huge loss when a big elephant herd used to enter my orchards and damage mango trees. But this year, the lighting system helped keep elephants at bay, said Jugal Kishore Nayak, orchard owner at Patusahi Kateni.The light system has been designed based on our field experience with elephants and their habits. We knew that the elephants will be scared of flashing lights instead of fixed and powerful lights. We developed this design using low power LED bulbs used as strobes and decorative lights, said Biswajit Mohanty, Project Director, WPSI (Wildlife Protection Society of India), who devised the system.We are delighted with the preliminary results but still believe that repeat trials are necessary before we can advise farmers to adopt them, said Mr. Mohanty.He maintained, we will develop a prototype self-contained unit including an in-built solar charger which should be low cost, maintenance free and easily set up with minimum technical support. This should be popularised among affected farmers so that they can sleep peacefully instead of chasing elephants all night.In one worst kind of man-elephant conflicts, Odisha has lost more than 700 elephants and 700 people since 2004. During the same period, elephants trampled ready-to-harvest crops over 90,000 acres of land. The experiment assumes significance as elephants have now started coming out of forest round the year instead of during harvest season in the past."

Harvesting is in full swing and nearly 65 tonnes of vegetables are daily being sent to Horticorp and the main markets of Mettupalayam and Vadugapatti in Tamil Nadu.The main items cultivated here are potato, carrot, beetroot, cabbage, garlic, and beans. The high prices for garlic at Vadugapatti, the main market for garlic in South India, have kindled hopes among farmers as the price for the item has been fluctuating for the past three years, even reaching below Rs.20 a kg at times. Now the price ranges from Rs.180 to Rs.200 a kg. Garlic harvesting began by June end.Vattavada agriculture officer P.B. Shanavas told The Hindu on Sunday that 2,200 hectares of land was under vegetable cultivation this season, of which garlic was one of the major crops. However, potato continued to be the main crop, he said. Garlic price had touched Rs.400 a kg this season. Farmers cultivated the small-sized Mettupalayam variety, known for its high quality. One of the reasons for farmers shifting to garlic cultivation was the low price for potato last Onam season, due to a bumper production.Unlike other vegetables, farmers can keep garlic for three months after drying in sunlight. However, due to good prices, farmers now tend to sell it soon after harvest, said Thankaraj, a farmer. The garlic market was on Saturdays and Wednesdays, he said, adding that for butter beans and garlic, there was no market in the State. On a single day, about 130 tonnes of garlic is being sent from Vattavada.Better pricesActive market intervention by Horticorp is said to be a reason for farmers getting remunerative prices this season. At the Swayasraya Karshaka Vipani at Koviloor in Vattavada, potatoes were sold for Rs.23 a kg, carrot at Rs.25 and cabbage at Rs.15 .Beans items were also getting good prices with butter beans remaining the most-preferred item. Horticorp procures vegetables directly from farmers through the Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Marketing Society. An official of the Horticorp said that the agency was procuring vegetables without grading them so that the produce would get a better price. Horticorp procured vegetables twice a week. Of the 65 tonnes of vegetables reaching the market, the agency procures only 5 tonnes. Lack of storage facilities is stated to be the reason for low procurement. The vegetables produced here directly go to the markets in Tamil Nadu. Farmers say they get the prices of vegetables procured by Horticorp in a week and hoped the agency would procure more vegetables in the coming days.2,200 ha under vegetable cultivation in VattavadaHorticorp procures only5 tonnes a day"

You dont want to go in for something heavy, but are looking for that perfect snack that keeps your body light enough to keep working without feeling drowsy. So, we zero in on rava idlis.A staple, delicious food, the rava idli has become popular in not just Karnataka but also around the world. This idli is created from roasted semolina, mixed in sour curds and seasoned with mustard and curry leaves.After this the idli is steamed, topped with cashew nuts and served with a tangy coconut chutney, sambar or a vegetable kurma. Some versions also have tiny chopped pieces of beans, grated carrots or coconut and chopped coriander.To find the origin of this popular dish we take off to MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Rooms), on Lalbagh Road, which is associated with the dish for years. We meet Vikram Maiya, the Managing Partner, MTR, who narrates the history of rava idlis.As we wait for our dish to arrive, Vikram starts, The history of rava idly has been retold a number of times. It started off with grain middlings. When the grain is milled, whatever is left out is called semolina. We have wheat, maize and rice semolina. The story starts there. During World War II, there was a shortage of rice. It has not been documented, but my grand uncle  Yagnanarayana Maiya  who was a prolific cook, started experimenting with various ingredients and then zeroed in on the rava idli recipe. He created the recipe. It worked with curds and cashew and seasonings. The original ingredient is still used. Rava idli is now made pretty much the same way everywhere.Then about MTR he says, It started in 1924 as Brahmins Coffee Bar. My grand uncle worked as a cook and later started MTR in 1951. The rest is all history.Our rava idli arrives, piping hot with a sweet and tangy potato curry, coconut chutney and a tiny bowl of melted ghee. We generously layer our cashew-topped idli with the ghee and dip it into the chutney and then the next bite into the potato gravy and theres absolute silence for the next few seconds as we get immersed in our plates.The original recipe is followed everywhere, Vikram says. The consistency has also been followed as the recipe was written down and handed over to the cooks down the years.With our mouths full, we ask why it is not served with a kurma, and Vikram explains, I personally feel the aroma and the strong masalas of the kurma kill the subtle flavours of the rava idli.The rava idli does indeed feel lighter on the tummy and great on your palette. That is because it does not have urad daal or rice, making it a healthy, savoury option, beams Vikram. As he does most of the talking, we do most of the eating. Finally crunch go the roasted cashews in our mouths, adding that grand finale to the taste and the history of the famed rava idli."

Leading this culinary innovation is Bibi Jan, a self-taught cook, from Thalassery, who has been spreading the authentic cuisine across India to great response.She has been adding her novel creations to the traditional menu that are being consumed with as much lip-smack as the rest.Bibi Jan began 20 years ago by plainly watching the goings on in the kitchen of her mother-in-law, when she came as a young bride to Thalassery. She started home cooking for small numbers. Over the years she grew in confidence.The turning point in her culinary route was after she provided snacks at a wedding and began receiving enquiries for more such presentations. She was flooded with requests to cater for small and big functions. Her food grew famous and so did she.

One food festival led to several others and Bibi was showcasing the food of Keralas northern district in Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and even Jaipur.In Jaipur I was invited to cook for a big birthday bash at the palace, says Bibi for whom cooking for 200 to 300 plates is not a big task. She even worked as a chef in Hotel Malabar Plaza in Ernakulam for two years. Now Bibi heads food festivals and caters at big events. She has, unintentionally , played a big role in popularising food from Thalassery.I dont know about that, she says modestly The taste of Thalassery food is very unique. What is being passed off as from that region is not authentic; even those teaching the cuisine are not doing so correctly. The difference comes from the combination of spices.On the new innovations that she has brought in Bibi is clear. She says that preparing this cuisine over so many years has led her to experiment and try different kinds of recipes using the same ingredients.That has resulted in these new foods. Her noodles ball from milk boiled noodles that encase thick prawn or chicken filling is dipped in egg, rolled in bread crumbs and deep fried. The cone pathiri too has meat filling and is shaped in a cone. The kilikoodu or birds nest that has become a popular snack, though not invented by her, has been innovated with different fillings. It has at its centre, quail egg wrapped in potato, patted with vermicelli and deep fried.Other popular new wave foods are the mutta surkka and mudi pathiri. The kakka roti, called kunju roti in Kozhikode, is rice dumplings in thick beef or mutton curry, a wholesome dish.From all these rich and party fare that Bibi prepares, she loves the simple rice and sambar.Bibi Jan is presenting Malabar Spice Route, a culinary experience at East Indies restaurant, Eight Bastion, Fort Kochi for dinner till June 26."
58f726a9a3d24b0b70c3275d,"At its warehouse, Nasscom bets on start-ups",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/at-its-warehouse-nasscom-bets-on-startups/article8544350.ece,2016-05-02,,The Hindu,"more-inavanee Sundaramoorthy cofounded Uncanny Vision, an artificial intelligence start-up, which gives machines an ability to see and analyse like humans, from a garage in a residential area in east Bengaluru. He and other cofounders Ranjith Parakkal and Devadas Parakkal then moved to a proper office on M. G. Road.The founders soon realised that the main hurdle for them is not just workspace, Internet connection or electricity supply, but access to large multinational companies to sell their innovation. Last December, Uncanny Vision moved to Start-up Warehouse formed by IT trade body Nasscom along with Government of Karnataka at Old Airport Road. The co-working space and accelerator for early stage technology product firms is surrounded by tech companies like Intel, Microsoft and Dell. Now every week the Uncanny Vision team meet top executives from big companies like IBM and Bosch, who visit the facility to check out hot technology products.It has been amazing for us. Instead of us going to them, they come to us, said Mr. Sundaramoorthy, 37, who quit his job at chip maker Xilinx to launch the firm. Besides building relationships with these executives, Uncanny Vision has bagged pilot projects from Qualcomm, the worlds largest maker of chips that go inside smartphones and Target Corp, the second-largest discount retailer in the United States.Nasscom, which started as lobbyist for the countrys offshoring industry or big boys club has transformed into a powerhouse for providing infrastructure and mentoring to young firms and helping them to connect with investors. Ashok Madaravally, Deputy Director at Nasscom, said that in the last two decades the organisation helped the IT services industry grow from $1 billion (Rs.6,645 crore) to $140 billion (Rs.9.3 lakh crore). But we realised that the next wave of innovation is going to come from these new age product companies, said Mr. Madaravally, who represents Nasscoms ambitious 10,000 Start-ups programme from Bengaluru. The Start-up Warehouse is part of this programme  that helps young firms with mentoring, funding and industry connects. It expects to have nine such facilities across the country this year.Uncanny Vision, which went through various mentoring programmes has also narrowed down its focus towards the area of surveillance. The firm said that customers would not need to manually monitor the behaviour and activities of people, or other changing information continuously. Its software that sits on surveillance devices such as cameras does it all. The applications range from monitoring elderly patients to the security of buildings.Unlike fancy offices at companies like Google, the Start-up Warehouse is not a Disneyland to have massage chairs or a cafeteria filled with chocolates and potato chips. If you take a stroll around the warehouse, which is equal to a supermarket, one can find a juice shop, traditional coffee containers and food cooked by another small firm that aims to provide nutritionally balanced meal.One of the top guests who visited the warehouse recently was Thuan Pham, Chief Technology Officer at Uber Technologies Inc., the car-sharing service that lets people order transportation via a smartphone. We pitched our product to him (Mr. Pham) and are in talks to take it forward, said Soumik Ukil, 37, Chief Executive at LightMetrics.The firm has developed a technology that helps enterprises to monitor the driving behaviour of their drivers and help prevent accidents and associated losses. Mr. Ukils peer Sarita Mishra, founder of Green Cosmos Energy Solutions has been able to connect with potential clients in markets like Japan, Canada and the Karnataka government. Her firm has developed a cloud-based product RealNatics that analyzes real-time data from smart meters to perform energy consumption forecasts and reduce costs for manufacturing plants and commercial buildings. It would have been difficult to get these contacts on my own, said Ms. Mishra, a former scientist at Indias premier nuclear research facility Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.The warehouse has laboratories for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT)  a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently. Townista, which helps people discover and book interesting things to do in the city such as rock climbing, magic shows and tea tasting, has been using these laboratories to test its app on about 30 different types of devices. This is crucial for Paras Jain, 28, who started the firm along with his IIT-Bombay batch mate Snehal Nimje, from his home in Koramangala. But Mr. Jain said the biggest advantage for his team has been learning from peers working at other firms. You can learn from the peers who are already ahead of you and share back the knowledge with people who are lagging behind, he said.For instance, when Mr. Jains peer Parinitha Manohar, founder of Spalontime, that provides an aggregator app for salons and spas, is stuck on a problem, she posts it on common online group. The group includes all the company employees at the warehouse.Either they reply or come to meet me to discuss it, said Ms. Manohar who quit her engineering job at Internet infrastructure company VeriSign to launch the firm.We follow an open culture, so that we can learn from each other, said Roopa Aravindakshan, Community Manager at the warehouse.Marquee investors such as Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and IDG Ventures also keep flocking the warehouse several times. About 2,000 young firms have been selected for the Nasscoms 10,000 Startups programme in the last three years. Sangeeta Devni, Deputy Manager at 10,000 Startups said that about 200 of these firms raised venture capital or got selected by various accelerators in India and abroad."

Since 2013, scientists have been experimenting with outdoor cultivation at two sites with areas of approximately 550 and 420 square metres in Chongqing, where scientists simulated desert landform conditions.The scientists said the plants survived the heavy rain and high temperatures, the typical climate conditions in Chongqing. The crops, including rice, corn and potatoes, flourished in the converted soil.  PTI"

The German puppeteer, musician, and founder of the band Puppetmastaz Affeld is focussing on a fusion of classical acting, puppetry, and dance. He and his six band members showcase around 500 concerts in and around Europe.Affeld recollects reading about a laughing school in Bengaluru that practiced the art of laughing yoga. Ever since I have been waiting to visit this land that believes in the miracle of being happy, he says. Affelds first puppet stint in India, a fusion show with Anupama Hoskere in Bengaluru, was much appreciated. Indians have a deep understanding of their culture and hence being appreciated here is not quite easy, he said. But, every other art has a religious connotation here. People are ignorant of their capabilities.His second show in the city titled Back from the dark side of the moon revolved around the theme of identity crisis. With my screenplay, my puppets (a dog, a monkey and a bird) added a touch of fantasy to the play. For his performance here and Kochi, Affeld has chosen a slightly different avatar. Acting is emphasised now. Along with his famed puppet character Mr. Potato, a bird and a shadow too accompany him, telling aloud their tale. If you have a cardboard, sheets of paper, scissors and a glue, you can set up a workshop on puppeteering, he says.Taking inspiration from the works of Jim Hansen, Affeld believes that any person who has the potential to make people laugh with his hands in gloves can master the art. For him, satisfaction is the biggest reward. There is no award for excellence in puppeteering, but if you are happy singing and dancing around and making your audience laugh, I believe thats the greatest faculty you are gifted with, he says.German puppeteer and his ally, Mr. Potato, aim at taking the art form to new heights."

And the embracing of the inappropriateness, albeit done in a comical way, is a welcome change. In Kerry on Kutton, there are many such moments, dialogues that border on the profane  a heart-to-heart about mens urinal problems or a tooth found in a gulab jamun, most probably the halwais. But most of them are used for effect. It becomes a problem for the film when the quirks overpower dramatic tension.Kerry on Kutton belongs to the breed of post-Gangs of Wasseypur Hindi films that is so enamoured by the mofussil cool of its subject that it ends up nowhere  much like last years Meerutiya Gangsters.

Kerry and he develop a rivalry over the materialistic Jyoti who uses her sexuality to exploit the two men.Our Hindi heartland films have echoes of Westerns, and the seemingly lawless countryside seem to lend a landscape to it. In Kerry on Kutton, the theme of violence propagated by the gun-culture in the region runs through. All the main three male characters are looking to break out from their fathers shadows and the only answer to their problems seem to be a tamancha (gun).The women of Baliya wear their desire on their sleeves (or salwar kameezes or saris). The film does well to show us how much more bold and frank people from small towns can seem to be compared to the urban blandness we see in films set in cities.The acting isnt bad. Dubey has an easy charm: a little too genial perhaps. But but he makes use of his tall, athletic body to play the strapping man-boy who seems to have a way with the women. I was beginning to get fidgety about Jagota being too glamorous for the role, but as I spent more time with the character  it did make sense.But all these elements never come together in Kerry on Kutton.

Celebrating this staple food item and the people behind the craft of bread-making, it will celebrate the Poderachem Fest (traditional bakers feast) from October 1 to 3.This festival will be attended by bakers from across the State to showcase the variety of breads and will also feature cultural programmes.Into its second year, the three-day event will be held at the Socorro Church Gardens in north Goa, about 10 km from here. There will be stalls dedicated to chouris/pao, roast beef/pie, fish cutlets/mundo, chau/kanknna, chicken/rolls, mincemeat potato/katre, chilly fry /pao , sorpotel/ sanna and chonne ros/poie. Other local delicacies such as omlette-pao and cutlet-pao will also be served and sold at the festival.The popularity of the Goan bread has travelled beyond its borders, so much so that pao is now incorporated in food items across the country: missal pav, pav bhaji, vada pav, maska pav, cutlet pav and so forth.The event is being held to pay tributes to Goan pao and the Goan bakers and convey their noteworthy contribution to the culture of the place, Mario Fernandes, one of the organisers of the event, told The Hindu here on Tuesday.Goan pao  the crisp, aromatic, traditional leavened, oven-baked Goan bread  unites Goa every morning. There are villages where the crows might be waking to the ring of the poder making his door to door delivery visits at the crack of dawn, said Nandkumar M. Kamat, an assistant professor at the Goa University who, in 2010, who headed a State government-appointed Task Force Committee (TFC) to frame an appropriate scheme and package for protection and support for traditional occupations of Goa.Becoming extinctThe tradition, many here lament, is fast becoming extinct with the proliferation of of new modern state-of-the-art bakery in this tourist state, which happens to be an erstwhile Portuguese colony which has preserved some of its traditions, cuisines and cultures. Given a choice, many would prefer the pao, fresh and locally made, instead of the sliced bread, said Dr. Kamat.Bakers plightTalking about the plight of the bakers, he said many of them still continuing to bake in their congested, hazardous, unhealthy and unhygienic old premises, which reminded one of scenes from Charles Dickens novels. Theirs is an institution that has managed to survive against all odds and by weathering unfair competition., he added.The TFC put the number of local bakers at around 1,000.The TFC has recommended that since Goan bread was local heritage and met the nutritional demand of lakhs of people, it was important to support the local bakers through a package which included subsidy on raw material purchases, on electric baking ovens to save firewood, on power and water tariffs, a group insurance cover for families and considering the importance of micro-enterprise involved in door-to-door supply of local bread.The event will showcase a varietyof breads and will also feature cultural programmes"

Kundanapu Bomma lacks a concrete plot and its narrative tone raises a toast to the films made in the 90s. Theres no attempt to make the film contemporary even in the packaging. At best, you could spot a mobile phone or two in the narrative.Set in Vizianagaram, the fairly unidimensional tale of a family headed by Mahadeva Raju (Nagineedu) revolves around the marriage of his confused-pampered daughter Suchi (Chandini Chowdary). Shes apparently the only degree holder in Bobbili who takes her academic authority way too seriously. Theres a bava-maradalu thread too, the decision on Suchis marriage being decided during her birth itself.Gopi (her cousin played by Sudhakar Komakula) isnt keen on the alliance. Theres a new man (Vasu, played by Sudheer Varma) in Suchis life. A middling love triangle feels like a sob-fest stuck in a comic exterior. The film never manages to take off. The narration is tepid and dull.Kundanapu Bomma definitely has plenty of opportunities; theres this tale of an age-old car that the family is deeply attached to, good enough to cause a rift between the brothers, Mahadevaraju and Sahadevaraju (Rajeev Kanakala). Ineffective emotional threads and weak performances make it all seem superficial. Ditto to the romantic track; Vasu helping Suchi copy during her history exam is a frail reason for their love to bloom. Literal English translations of cuss words like chetta naayala (dust fellow) and nee dumpa thega (let your potato get cut), the instance of an automobile engineer mistaken to be the one who repairs autos and mobiles, are what you get in the name of humour. Shakalaka Shankars portions are a pain to scrape through. Jhansis parts fare slightly better. Then there is a Keeravani soundtrack that feels more like a compilation of his rejected tracks over the years. K.V. Mahadevans recreated ghazal Chaitra Maasa, though undone by the CG work, provides some relief. The lead actors, Sudhakar, Sudheer and Chandini, hardly register their presence; their characterisations do the damage. Kundanapu Bomma is a lovely title but the film is anything but that.

But going beyond these popular sweets and the culinary versatility of sesame will thrill the cook in you. Sesame indicum , the cultivated type, which originated in India, continues to be an ingredient of significance today.A wonderful ingredient, sesame is extremely versatile, lending itself to both sweet and savoury dishes. Sprinkle it whole on salads, or knead into chapati dough. Make spice mixes to fortify the flavour and health of your meals. One sprinkle Im hooked to is gomasio, a condiment from Japan, in which toasted sesame is ground coarsely with salt. I just combine coarse sea salt and toasted sesame in a bottle and keep it within reach. Its perfect with anything from a simple bowl of brown rice to salads, noodles, steamed vegetables, even khichdi. Another favourite is the Middle Eastern zaatar (a mix of herbs and spices), a condiment popularly combined with olive oil and smeared on flat bread. Zaatar is also used to flavour meat and vegetables dishes, on labneh (a thick hung yogurt cheese) or fried eggs as a garnish. I toast sesame with dried thyme and salt and grind with amchur instead of the sumac that is traditionally used but not easily found in India. It works perfectly on naans, kulchas, and in raitas. I also like to sprinkle it on chunks of paneer or chicken and grill them.Grinding toasted sesame opens up many more options. Although south India is best known for its use of sesame, I discovered, after I married into a Garhwali family, that the cuisine of Uttarakhand uses a lot of ground sesame in its winter dishes. Crushed sesame adds a nutty accent to lobia khichdi. The piquant khatte aloo is made of potatoes tossed in yogurt, toasted sesame and chillies. And then there is addictive til ki chutney in which toasted sesame is ground with toasted cumin, ginger, green chillies, and the juice of the bada nimbu (large wild lemons that come into season in the winter). Another lovely dish is the earthy pinni ka saag that is made from pinni or compressed seed cakes left over from the oil extraction process of sesame. With the oil removed, these become extremely high in protein and dietary fibre. Grind sesame until it gives forth oil and you get tahini or sesame butter, a staple ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. Stir it into soups, or dips, or add honey to make a quick spread for toast or dip for fruit. I am endlessly confounded that we have been pressing sesame for oil for millennia but never thought of toasting the seed prior to extracting its oil, something that the rest of Asia has savoured for centuries. Toasted sesame oil is the most magical ingredient. The roasting process intensifies the inherent flavour of sesame and is used more as a condiment or flavouring oil. It quickly grows into being indispensible: drizzle over fried eggs, add to vinaigrettes for a delicious variation, swirl a few drops into soups it pairs well with any flavour but is especially good with Asian, tomato and clear soups.And we already know sesames nutty flavours work wonderfully in sweet dishes; our laddoos and chikkis are testimony to this. But sesame is also popular in sweets around the world. In the Middle East you will find sesame halva; which, unlike Indian halvas, come in large dry blocks from which portions are sliced off. They literally melt into a nutty, sweet toffee and glide down your throat. Addictive! In Asian cuisine, a favourite dessert is the sweet black sesame soup of Cantonese cuisine. Asian supermarkets worldwide usually carry instant mix packets but I have made it at home by boiling crushed black sesame or toasted unhusked sesame with water, sweetened with honey or jaggery. It is a great dessert for children.We should be eating a lot more of this super food, not just saving it for festive occasions.If you hate milk like I do, sesame offers a great substitute with three times the calcium content of milk. Plus, one tablespoon of sesame contains 52 calories, 88 mg calcium, 1.3 mg iron and 32 mg magnesium. Why look to the west for health-boosting foods when we are so fortunate in our own home-grown bounty?(The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That )"
58f76b65a3d24b0b70c34a2c,On an organic quest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/on-an-organic-quest/article8635129.ece,2016-05-23,,The Hindu,"Theres an annoying self-satisfied swagger about hipster organic stores; the ones with artfully-lit, Instagram-ready baskets of fastidiously rustic fruit. Exotic vegetables flaunting back-stories more romantic than anything you could ever find on Tinder. Boasting of lovingly hand-pounded, responsibly made, locally-grown, ethically produced, vegan, wild honey-laced breakfast cereals that taste like diligently toasted sand.Lets not even get started on their star customers, swathed in overpriced ethnic handloom, diamonds and self-congratulatory smugness. They dexterously manage to post virtuous Facebook updates about changing the world, one organic carrot at a time, even as they fill their baskets with home-grown quinoa, designer ghee and gently wilting broccoli.Indias burgeoning organic food market, slated to grow by 30 per cent every year, offers wide variety today: ranging from the stolidly indigenous to wildly exotic. With bohemian chic farmers markets springing up in every big city, and swish neighbourhood stores advertising responsibly-grown produce, it has never been easier to eat clean and simultaneously assuage our conscience. After all, if its good for us, it must be good for the planet, right? As for that hefty price tag? Well, clever marketing has us convinced that good food cannot possibly be cheap. Granted, most people who are going organic now are doing it with genuinely good intentions. However, in a trend-obsessed world, it is easy to get overwhelmed.If you truly want to change the way you eat, what should you be looking for? Choitresh Kumar Ganguly of the Timbaktu Collective seems like the ideal person to ask. The collective, which works in over 150 villages in drought-prone Anantapur, has taken unproductive land and, using organic farming, transformed it into fields of flourishing millets over the last 25 years.Ganguly begins by emphasising how important it is to eat food that is indigenous. Millets, for example. Foxtail barnyard millets grow in high-lying marshes as well as low-lying deserts. They are climate-resilient and can survive on very low rainfall. Since these are local species, theyre also rarely attacked by pests.As for that organic quinoa, carefully imported and grown in India? Its all bull, he snorts. Thats the tragedy of us Indians. We dont give importance to what we already have.Remember that any imported seed needs protection, since it is not naturally immune to the local environment and pests. Over a few thousand years, they become resilient, like our chillies, potatoes and tomatoes. But in the meantime, it may destroy a lot of our vegetation by activating pests, or affecting our pollination system.So how do you define organic? The primary meaning, to me, is when all the inputs are produced by the farmer himself or herself. From seed to fertilizer to pesticide everything.After all, natural is an easy term to manipulate: bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides are technically natural too. When the farmer controls the entire process, using dung from village cattle, neem cakes and local earthworms, its a simpler, cleaner, and more straightforward process. It also means that the farmer has full control. Sovereignty is what is important here.Your next step? Cut out the middleman. As a consumer, you should know who is producing your food. Most of the people selling organic food are aggregators; they have little or no contact with the actual farmers. Conventional certification is not always reliable. We have been fighting against third-party certification. All kinds of scams can happen and it is very expensive.Instead, they use a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) where groups of farmers guarantee each others produce. (The Government of India has recently introduced PGS as well.) So look for PGS on produce that you buy.Even better, get to know your farmer. Its increasingly easy these days, as more urban city slickers are swapping their laptops for shovels.Like 51-year-old S. Madhusudhan, who gave up a high-powered corporate career to start a farm six years ago in Bengaluru, after he collapsed in his office. That was my wake-up call, he says, discussing how he taught himself organic farming. My best teachers were Google, Wikipedia and YouTube. Over the past six years, he has tended about 200 acres at Back2Basics, lavishing his land with equal amounts of care and gobar (cow dung) slurry. We use about 24,000 litres of gobar slurry per acre. We use oil seed cakes made with neem, honge and sesame. We used a bore, and struck water at 550 feet. Today, after rainwater harvesting, its risen to 50 feet. I truly believe that the land returns what you give to it. Economically, he says, there is no reason for organic food to be more expensive. I sell a coconut at Rs. 19. The market price is Rs. 30. How do I do it? I just cut out the middleman.His farm has been so successful that he recently launched a service supplying customers with freshly-harvested produce. Morning harvest, evening delivery, he says. I quickly learnt what the problem is in the Indian market. The growers dont know how to market. The marketers dont know how to grow. Im in the sweet spot between the two."

This road has been in a bad state for several years. Last year, temporary repair work was carried out to make it motorable. Now, the government has allocated funds for upgrading it, he said. Residents of Hassan and neighbouring villages had staged many protests in the past to get the road improved.Further, the Minister said that the district administration would procure certified seed potatoes this year and distribute them among the growers.All these years, table potatoes meant for cooking were being provided as seed potatoes. Farmers were suffering a huge loss owing to this practice.

Nestled within each plump, meticulously-braided crescent of pizza dough is a mound of mozzarella and tomatoes; the whole thing is then baked until the crust turns pale gold in colour.

Today, of course, hot dog stands are everywhere  at baseball games, at amusement parks, on busy streets, serving juicy pork sausage spiked with garlic and slick with mustard, ketchup and pickle relish, all resting on a cushion of bread. Thats the classic, but wherever you go in North America, youll find different takes: dogs with coleslaw, dogs with chilli sauce, dogs with avocados and refried beans (surprisingly good), even dogs with fries and cheese i.e. a poutine dog if you will.

After persistent enquiries, a hand-written board was put up at the counter indicating that the flight would arrive at 8.30 a.m. But even that did not happen and the CCTV screen continued to show it as delayed.The waiting relatives wondered about the possible reasons for the delay of the AI flight. Could it be due to rain in Hyderabad? They realised that their fears were unfounded as another relative from Hyderabad came by the SpiceJet flight from Hyderabad at 8.30 a.m.Finally, the AI 952 arrived around 9 a.m. after a one-and-a-half hours delay. The worst part was the lack of information from the AI authorities on the reason for the delay and updating the information about the delay at frequent intervals.The Volvo bus, operated by SpiceJet to ferry air passengers from the tarmac to the terminal building at the airport, gave jitters to the passengers a few weeks ago, according to R.V.K.

He had taken Rs.170 for the same menu from another passenger.Though the coach was clean, the water in the toilet ran out in about an hour after the train started from Visakhapatnam.

Now, I call them grand children, he says.Earning about Rs. 10,000 on regular days and Rs. 15,000 a day during the tourist season, he spends 25 to 30 per cent of his earnings on free snacks. His wife Shabira also supports him. At times, the children, who are now settled, come to his shop to express their gratitude. It is Gods work, he says and wants to continue it till he breathes his last. Mohammed Ali is also secretary of the districts inter-religious peace committee, for which the Collector is the chairman.K. Mohammed Ali has been giving bondas to the children free of cost"
58f7d0a2a3d24b0b70c37f86,Leopard death: forest team arrests two persons,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leopard-death-forest-team-arrests-two-persons/article8344307.ece,2016-03-12,,The Hindu,"The Forest Department has arrested two persons responsible for the death of a female leopard last week in Mavallam beat of Hasanur division in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.A special investigation team led by Hasanur Forest Range Officer Palanichamy narrowed down on two local youths Kumar (30) of Devarnatham and Rangan (32) of Mavallam, who had taken on lease a nearby land for potato cultivation. Both were first-time offenders. They were remanded in judicial custody under Section 9 of Wildlife Protection Act 1972, District Forest Officer of Hasanur Division C.H. Padma said.The team that also constituted Forester Shivakumar, and Forest Guards Alagiri, Govind, Ramasamy and Nausher established that the duo had kept metal wire trap to capture wild boars and hares, without realising the consequences.The investigation team was felicitated by the Field Director of STR I. Anwardeen and Ms. Padma for fast-tracking the probe and arresting the offenders within five days.Within hours of the leopards death after getting snared in the metal wire trap, the forest team rushed to the spot. The post-mortem was carried out by forest veterinarians in the presence of the DFO, the president of Village Forest Committee of Mavallam and a representative of Nature and Geo Society. Thereafter the carcass was burnt completely.The leopard was found to be in an advanced age and the forest team surmised the predator had come closer to human habitation in search of easy prey.The predator could not escape as the noose had tightened around its neck.It was not unusual for locals to set traps for wild boars and hares primarily to prevent them from destroying agricultural crops, but were also in the habit of consuming their meat. However, there was no poaching angle, as such.Though the Forest Department has powers to deal sternly with the animal trappers, eating of the meat of boars and hares by locals seldom comes to light, it is learnt.Nevertheless, the department has been carrying out routine checking of boundary lines in recent years, and there have been instances of very many snares being removed, Ms. Padma said, adding that there has been abundant increase in the population of boars in the forest area."

Yadav described it was a pack of truth aimed at balanced development of rural and urban areas.Stressing that there could be no comparison between the coming up of the Agra-Lucknow Expressway with the Noida Expressway of the then BSP government, mr. Yadav said unlike the previous government, no package or sweeteners were given to any business house nor were farmers forced to give their land for the same.No farmer was killed nor anyone sent to jail by our government for taking land for the expressway, he said.(Rejecting opposition charge that Purvanchal and Bundelkhand areas were neglected in the budget, Mr. Yadav said his government was taking good care of all regions.For Bundelkhand, he said while ponds and rivers like Chandrawal which had become almost extinct were being revived, Hamirpur will be converted into an organic district where use of organic fertiliser will be promoted in a big way.Besides, for these areas which have witnessed drought, mr. Yadav said free foodgrains will be provided to people under the Right to Food Security Act.The government has decided to provide free foodgrains to the people of Bundelkhand region, he said, adding, We have also decided to provide flour, oil, ghee, potato, salts and several other things to poor people of the state.To address the shortage of drinking water, the government would press into service 1,500 water tankers in Bundelkhand so that villagers were provided with quality drinking water, he said.The Chief Minister said his government would develop a greenfield city.He said adequate power and good roads were the main priorities of his government.Brushing aside criticism that sugarcane prices have not been hiked for consecutive years by his government, he said that on coming to power his government had hiked it by Rs 40 in one go in 2012.Besides, we have forced the sugar mills to pay over Rs 77,000 crore to the cane farmers during the four-year rule even though the prices of sugar was at the lowest, he said.On law and order front, the Chief Minister said some small issues also become hot news while the good work remains in the background.He accused the media of tarnishing the image of his government over the law and order issue. PTINo government can compete with us on the issue of development..., says the CM"
