Ambient lighting, costumed serving staff and floor-level seating (complete with canopies draped in shimmering curtains) aim to make the visitor forget Tiruchi for a brief while.Moroccan cuisine has been shaped by all its interactions with other countries over the centuries, chef Rajprasad Radhakrishnan said. You will find dishes here with a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine.Theres also an influence of Moroccos colonial heritage, with a small selection of French recipes.The buffet starts off with a salad table that has some staples of Middle Eastern cuisine  steamed couscous (semolina granules made from durum wheat) with finely-chopped fresh vegetables, tabbouleh (cracked wheat mixed with finely chopped ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, and parsley) and Hummous dips made with chickpeas and black beans.Fatayer (mini minced mutton pies) have been given a vegetarian twist with a potato and peas filling, and Manakish, small pita flatbreads topped with zatar spice mix of cumin, oregano and olive oil, and sambouseh add to the variety of the bread counter.Grilled meats feature prominently in the Moroccan palate because of the nomadic lifestyle of its people. We have tried to include the commonly barbecued meats in our festival, with a live station that will serve customers the cuts of their choice. We marinate the lamb for at least one and half days before we grill it, said Mr. Raj. The whole lamb being barbecued at one end of the pool makes a dramatic visual statement at the festival. Small charcoal braziers are placed at customers tables to barbecue chicken, quail and kababs.Tagine, the slow-cooked stew of meat and vegetables that is distinguished by its earthenware dish topped with a conical lid, is available at the festival too.The golden glow of saffron tints everything from rice dishes to gravies and desserts in the festival. At the rice counter, Moroccan versions of biryani and pulao are available. Spaghetti tossed with cheesy white sauce brings a French touch to the table.Date halwa and roz bil haleeb (rice and milk pudding) are among the treats that mingle with some Indian offerings at the dessert table.The buffet dinner is priced at Rs. 600 plus taxes for adults, and Rs. 400 plus taxes for children."

Rama Devi interacting with The Hindu in Vijayawada.PHOTO: V. RAJUWomen aspiring to be entrepreneurs couldnt have asked for more. The Association of Lady Entrepreneurs of Andhra Pradesh (Aleap) plans to set up four green industrial parks across the Sunrise State.With the support of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) and the banking sector, we propose to set up these eco-friendly parks at Vijayawada, Nellore, Visakhapatnam and Anantapur, in collaboration with the German government and German capacity building organisation GIZ, says Rama Devi, Aleaps founder president.Our women members manufacture [many things from] potato chips to electronic chips. We want to bring all of them on a common platform, explains Ms. Rama Devi.Each of the four units will be spread over 50 acres distributed in 200 units. Land allocation for the Nellore plant has been made but the Association is waiting for other units to come on stream as it is keen on starting all four units concurrently.The new industrial estates proposed to be developed exclusively for women entrepreneurs will be natural parks with adequate infrastructure facilities. The idea is to translate the slogan of women empowerment into a reality in Navyandhra Pradesh. Most of them will be micro and small units, says Ms. Rama Devi.World class infrastructureThe new structures will provide world class infrastructure to women entrepreneurs, common facilities like administrative building, conference hall, a library, information centre, guest room and canteen, free power (15 HP) to each unit, establish 200 enterprises, provide employment to scores of people in the vicinity and will convert unorganised sector into organised sector.Founded in 1993, Aleap is recognised as one of the premier institutions of women entrepreneurship.The members provide counselling to aspiring women entrepreneurs through facilitators and Business Development Cell. This enables them to choose business activity of their desire. Need-based skill development training, conduct of entrepreneurship development programmes, helping them to gain access to finance from banks and financial institutions and providing them the much-needed infrastructure to start commercial operations and post-establishment assistance in the fields of marketing and production are its other roles.Aleap is a one-stop destination for aspiring entrepreneurs as we take care of all their needs till we make sure that the entrepreneur is capable of operating a unit independently, says Ms. Rama Devi."

Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has also advised the farmers to use such traps.Yellow traps made by the CPRS cost 4-5 times less than those available in the market. Research station director J S Minhas said the traps available in the market cost Rs 50-60 per piece but those developed by the CPRS innovation cell cost Rs 10-15 a piece.""This is a cheap and effective method to control the white fly menace,"" he said, adding 50 traps of 60cm x 40cm per hectare would be sufficient for controlling the pest.""The farmers can make these traps from white fibre sheet and paint it with golden yellow colour. These sheets are cut into pieces of specified size and are then coated with a thin layer of grease or castor oil. The farmers should then tie these traps on wooden sticks in such a way that they remain just above the canopy of the plant. These are equally effective as the ones available in the commercial market and are reusable,"" Minhas saidFor more information on low-cost yellow sticky traps the farmers could contact him or CPRS assistant chief technical officer Kapil Kumar Sharma, he added."
58f63de97be9e031f13b0fc6,The vegetarian path to golfing greatness (Comment: Special to IANS),http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/shooting/The-vegetarian-path-to-golfing-greatness-Comment-Special-to-IANS/articleshow/53473217.cms,2016-07-31,"I thought my son had played reasonably well in a Junior World Golf qualifier in Sacramento , shooting a 77 (+5) on a par-72 course. As I sauntered over to check out the scores, I saw that the winning score was a 64 (-8) by a kid whose parents I knew. ""What did you feed him today?"" I asked in congratulating them.Without skipping a beat, since that is what they were chowing down at that time, they said ""Cheeseburgers"". A food item my son has never experienced in his 13 years of existence.Can a vegetarian ever aspire to the top echelons of golf on a diet devoid of meat? And are we, as parents, failing in our duty by not cooking and plowing burgers and hot dogs into our son?Both my wife and I were brought up as vegetarians for religious reasons.We come from a family lineage in South India whose most cherished dish is 'thair-sadam' (curd and rice). I, however, did stray during my college years to experience being a meat-eater. Not satisfied with just having 'Intel Inside' my computers, I wanted to see what it felt like to have 'Meat Inside' my digestive tract.I still recall the sensation of my first bite into a Whopper and that oh-so-succulent taste of spicy tandoori chicken. Why could my son not feel the same sensations in his palate?When he was three, my wife carefully orchestrated a switcheroo -- replacing potato with chicken nuggets. He chomped at it for a few seconds, gave me a smile that I felt so excited by (I now realise it might have been gas) and then promptly vomited it to let me experience 'Meat Outside'. In all the years since, he has never once expressed a desire to eat anything that has meat in it. And he has a stubborn streak that does not relent easily.So why is this relevant to how he plays the game of golf at the age of 13? Because he is figuratively (and literally) dwarfed in size and strength compared to boys that he plays with of a similar age. It has no bearing on the short game around the greens. But what a difference it makes on those drives from the tee box.Contrast a booming drive of 280 yards on a long par-4 of say 400 yards to enable a short wedge to the green, to eking out 200 yards on the drive and needing an accurate 3-wood to just get close to the green. That shot disparity on one hole accumulates over the long par-4 and par-5 holes to a final differential of at least 7 strokes. Game over, finito, checkmate, acabado in Spanish -- or maybe avocado in my son's mind.Conventional wisdom stresses how essential meat is as a source of protein and bulk to world-class athletes. Can you imagine Usain Bolt Peyton Manning or even Jordan Spieth performing their best on a belly full of salad and lentils? In my quest to better understand the impact of meat on world-class athletes, I Googled vegetarian world-class athletes. And I was quite inspired reading about Carl Lewis Martina Navratilova , Murray Rose, Robert Parrish, Billie Jean King, Venus Williams Tony Gonzalez and a host of other athletes who have and continue to excel with a vegetarian/vegan diet.But the skeptical side of me asks if any of them started their first 13 years on this diet, or was it a lifestyle they adopted later in their success?It is said that vegetarian foods have less caloric density than their meaty alternatives and hence athletes need to be aware of their caloric intake and expenditure to accommodate this. My son sparingly bites into his peanut-butter sandwiches in the middle of his rounds and has absolutely no gauge of his caloric expenditure. Maybe similar bites into a tuna sandwich might give him more calories but I am reasonably sure that will not make any difference to his overall performance during his rounds.This is ultimately a lifestyle choice -- does he need to consume meat-based foods to give him the muscle, strength and endurance to elevate his game? What does he need to do to bring home the bacon (pun oh-so-intended)? Can a combination of a vegetarian diet with an emphasis on physical fitness -- something he is lax about -- give him an equal or potentially greater advantage?It is uneasy being the parent of a vegetarian child aspiring to golf greatness. As parents we want to give our children the best advantage in every aspect of their lives. Maybe we are being unnecessarily paranoid in our thinking. We wait with bated breath for that growth spurt to kick in since height is such a great advantage in golf. And hope he quickly understands the value of physical fitness.Imagine our joy down the road (or maybe that should be down the fairway) in seeing him out-drive his meat-eating competitors. But 'lettuce' see how all this plays out - we really do want to avoid a 'Vegexit' option for our son.(31.07.2016 - Sridhar Narayanan is an engineer and lives in Cupertino, California.

After a delayed start, the hills received only intermittent rain, which was also low in intensity. Yet, the monsoon has been beneficial to the farmers, who have taken up vegetable cultivation, as well small tea growers, said horticulture department officials.The southwest monsoon usually sets in the Nilgiris by June 1. But, this year it was delayed by a week. ""The amount of rain received in the past one month is comparatively less. The monsoon this season is uncertain and it rains only on and off,"" said N Mani, joint director of horticulture department. ""However, the rain received till now is very beneficial to farmers taken up vegetable cultivation and tea growers,"" he added.Around 2,176 hectares of farming land in the hills have standing crops like carrot, potato and cabbage. The rain will benefit the crops as they are in the final stages of cultivation. Moreover, it would be easier for the farmers to prepare for the autumn season, begining August,"" Mani said.Pointing out that now the soil was wet, officials said it was the right time to apply manure to the tea gardens. ""When the field is wet, the soil could easily absorb the strength of the manure,"" they added.L Sankar, an Ooty-based farmer agrees. ""It isn't raining continuously this season, but the wet weather condition itself is a boost to the standing crops. We hope more rain in the coming weeks,"" he said.Sankar is waiting to harvest potato and carrot that he cultivated in around three acres of land in the first week of August. The Nilgiris has registered between 6mm and 35mm rain in every 24 hours in different places in the past one week. The trend is expected to continue."

These items were available at a price band of Rs 120 to Rs 150 per kg depending on the quality of the commodity.Likewise, Jagdish Prasad, who has been in the retail vegetable business for over two decades said the trend will continue for the next two months. ""Short supply of vegetables to the market and limited stock with retailers has led to the spurt,"" Prasad said.Another shopkeeper, Kailash, said quite a few varieties of vegetables that are supplied from the surrounding districts and adjoining West Bengal are available at modest prices. ""Commodities such as potato, pumpkin, bottle gourd, that are supplied from surrounding districts, are available at reasonable prices,"" Kailash said.The consumers, however, are complaining. ""We have no option but to buy cheaper vegetables. We are adding more and more potato dishes to our meals,"" 55-year-old NML employee, SK Deo, a Sidhgora resident, said.Mamata Pathak, a Kadma resident, thought vegetable vendors have a role to play in the price rise. ""I suspect the vegetable traders deliberately increae prices, keeping in mind the preference and growing demand for vegetarian food during Shravan,"" she said."

Every year, from late in July to the first Tuesday of August, Antiguans come together for the carnival which celebrates the emancipation of slavery in the country. Coinciding with the carnival, some villages in the Saint Phillip area of the island organise a reunion every four years. The event brings back expats who mingle with locals. A good number of Antiguans have shifted overseas in search of greener pastures. The largest number of the expats is in United States while many have found their calling in Europe and even South American countries.The reunion is held over a week with activities every day. A popular part of the reunion is the 'food festival' which attracts a goodly crowd. This year, the food fest has been organised at the local football ground of the Seatons village. Food stalls dot one part of the ground while a group of young boys play football under lights.The atmosphere is easy and joyful. There is no hustle and bustle of an Indian carnival because of the small population. On a routine day, you hardly see anyone on the roads after sunset. It's a sparsely populated island and only sounds one hears once the evening sets in is that of birds, pet dogs and the wind coming from the bays. For someone from India, it seems almost eerie.Back at the food fest, Devon seems happy with the sales his wife's stall is racking up. He owns two buses and, interestingly, drives them too. Do you know a bus owner would never drive it in India? Devon, a simple looking man, smiles and says, ""I don't mind driving my bus. People look at me and think I'm just a bus driver but it's fine with me.""For a place like Antigua, a congregation of 300 people is quite a sizeable one -the entire population of the country is barely 85,000. It's thus a festive atmosphere at the Seatons football ground. The blaring music adds to the mood which is typically Afro. On offer at the stalls are king-sized crabs and lobsters, pork ribs and chicken with seasoned rice and veggies. Saltfish, which is a slated, dried cod, is much in demand by the revellers. Then, there are traditional Antiguan staples like fungie which is made of corn paste and water, and ducana which is a sweet, dense dumpling made of grated sweet potato which is mixed with coconut, pumpkin and cinnamon. Then there are simple, homemade cakes almost all of which contain coconut."

File photo: Prakash HassanMany progressive farmers and environmentalists have been calling for a ban on the cultivation of ginger, at least for a few years, given the crops impact on soil fertility and groundwater levels in the district. Office-bearers of farmers groups say farmers are ready to give up ginger cultivation in the interest of the environment and soil.Farmers in Hassan began ginger cultivation in the latter part of the last decade. Following a ban on it in Kerala, many farmers from there came to Hassan, among other districts of Karnataka, and took land on lease to grow ginger. Gradually, native farmers began growing the crop too.A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of the Horticulture Department, says, Ginger is an undersoil crop and extracts nutrients and moisture directly from the soil. Soil fertility is the immediate casualty of ginger cultivation.The farmers who were among the first to grow ginger are already experiencing its ill-effects. Once ginger is grown in a particular land, farmers cannot get good produce from any other crop on that land for a couple of years. It takes years for the soil to regain its fertility, the officer says.BorewellsAs of now, farmers grow ginger on over 10,000 hectares in the district. Each farmer drills one or two borewells; implying hundreds of borewells in a village only for ginger cultivation. This has affected the groundwater table.Farmers were not aware of these ill-effects when they were introduced to this crop. Those fed up with the losses owing to late blight in the case of potato shifted quickly to ginger. They invested money and, initially, earned well. The State government should have spread awareness well in advance and avoided the cultivation of this crop, says H.R. Naveen Kumar, district president of the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha.AllegationsGinger growers have been using chemicals extensively, affecting micro-organisms. There are allegations that banned fertilisers are being used. Farmers greed is one of the reasons for the increase in area under ginger. They want to make a quick buck, and are not bothered about the long-term effects, says Kottur Srinivas, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha. He adds that the forum would help the government in spreading awareness if the latter took a tough stand and banned the production of ginger altogether."
58f650daa3d24b0b70c2a2f0,Spectacular trees for small spaces,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/spectacular-trees-for-small-spaces/article8084597.ece,2016-01-09,"Gardeners sometimes hesitate to plant trees lest they swallow up precious garden area. But here in the tropics we have a whole treasury of strikingly beautiful but affordable  in terms of space  flowering trees suitable for small gardens.All the trees described below can also be planted in large tubs in full sun on a terrace or balcony, where they will not grow to their full size but will flower. All of these are also easy-care trees that will thrive in ordinary garden soil and need only minimal watering once they are established.The first three trees described here are deciduous; that is, they completely shed their leaves before flowering. They need a distinct dry period to flower their best.When they start shedding their leaves reduce watering until new buds start appearing, then water normally.INDIAN CORAL TREE (ERYTHRINA INDICA)The Indian coral tree is a dazzler; yet its one of the easiest of trees to grow. It is a plant-and-forget tree until, in February-March, the leafless tree surprises you with its profusion of large, brilliant red flowers. Fast-growing and hardy, it will grow on poor soil and in dry areas with no care. However, it hates to be waterlogged, so take care not to overwater it. The coral tree is very easy to propagate from seed or large cuttings; even a branch cut and used as a stake or fence post will often root and grow.Other Erythrinas worth growing are E. variegata (green and yellow striped leaves, orange flowers); E. crista-galli (orange flowers); and E. blakeii (a large shrub with deep red flowers.YELLOW SILK COTTON (COCHLOSPERMUM GOSSYPIUM; SYN. C. RELIGIOSUM).If I could have just one tree in my garden, Id choose the yellow silk cotton. Even when not in bloom, it is beautiful, with its dark green palmate leaves; in bloom, it is breathtaking. From late September to early March, the leafless tree is covered with clusters of 3-inch golden yellow flowers with long stamens in the centre. At dawn, in my backyard, it is a golden pagoda against a dark background of fishtail palms.MANURE PLANT (GLIRICIDIA SEPIUM)The only trouble with this tree is that though it is a wild forest tree, it is hard to get Gliricidia sepium. This fast-growing tree produces large trusses of pink-and-white flowers in February-March. Called gobrada gida (manure plant) in Kannada, it is valued as an organic fertilizer: its roots fix atmospheric nitrogen, an essential plant nutrient, and the leaves also contribute nitrogen when added to the soil. It grows in poor soil with minimal watering and is very easy to propagate from cuttings; even a branch used as a stake will root and grow. This small tree makes a good temporary filler for spaces where you may want to plant something more permanent later.POTATO TREE (SOLANUM MACRANTHUM; SYN. S. GRANDIFLORUM).In Kannada our local name for this tree is badne marabrinjal tree  and it does look like a large brinjal plant, with deeply lobed, dark green leaves. Its clusters of scented flowers, which appear all year round, open purple, turn lavender the second day, and white the third day. This is a fast-growing but short-lived (8-10 years) tree, so its ideal for spaces that you want filled quickly but where you plan to plant something more permanent later. Plants that like filtered light do well in the dappled shade of the potato tree. Stuck in its fork, my Cymbidium orchid sends out 18 to 20 streamers of flowers every March.GEIGER TREE (CORDIA SEBESTENA)Scarlet Cordia, as it is also called, is commonly seen in parks in Hyderabad, though not so common in Bengaluru. It has large, rough leaves and clusters of orange tubular flowers borne on the tips of the branches throughout the warm season. It grows on a range of soils and is drought-tolerant, though it does better with regular watering. It is reputed to tolerate flooding and salt spray, as well.BOTTLE BRUSH (CALLISTEMON CITRINUS SYN. C. LANCEOLATUS)A native of Australia, it is now commonly grown everywhere in India. A graceful, drooping tree with narrow, lancet-like leaves, it gets its name from its red inflorescences which look just like bottle brushes.The leaves when crushed give a lemon-like aroma; hence its Latin name citrinus."

Days after CID busted a Ponzi firm MMM Asia with roots in Russia and operating from East Midnapore with the arrest of four persons, a joint team of Kolkata police STF and the CID have nabbed five persons who were offering a 150 percent return within one month. The arrests have been carried out from the Manicktala, Hedua and Rajabazar areas.According to police sources, the gang members are mainly agents and sub agents who had been rendered jobless after the Ponzi firms went bust. ""This time the scheme is deadlier. There are no offices. Money was being collected through family members and a hierarchical chain created. Despite all attempts to sensitize people, it seems that even Kolkata has not taken note of the dangers,"" said a probe officer.TOI spoke to one such investor who herself now under police lens. Rinku Mitra (52) claims she was travelled by her close friends and relatives of 20 years. ""I have lost Rs 1.85 lakh after my friends claimed that they were taking the money as loans. I had no clue that they had invested the money in chitfunds,"" she claimed. The investigators though claim that Mitra herself had collected money on behalf of one masterminds who go by the name of Sushil and Mukherjee. ""We are trying to ascertain if those arrested are indeed the masterminds,"" explained an officer.The cops said they deliberately targeted the less informed as everything was arranged through family and friends. All that were used was a written understanding that the victim was lending money to another person. Stamp papers were used for this purpose but it never mentioned the exact terms and conditions when this money had to be returned. Everything operated through word of mouth,"" said an investigating officer. The gang had raised Rs 14 lakh in the past month of June alone, claimed cops.The CID claims chitfunds are trying to claw back in the name of agricultural schemes too. ""For more than a year we have been receiving several complaints, especially from rural Bengal about investors not getting returns or the capital siphoned off in various agricultural schemes,"" Consumer Affairs Minister Sadhan Pande had earlier complained this year.""These operators are taking the advantage of lack of proper banking facilities, poverty and illiteracy of the investors. In most cases the promise of huge return lure the investors into the trap. In most cases the investors and the frauds are known to each other,"" a senior official from CID explained. The official said that in many cases these potato and other agricultural schemes offered investors guaranteed return of 20-100 per cent on their investment within a fixed period of time.A chit fund company, which is being investigated by the CBI, had earlier started a scheme called ""potato flexi scheme"" promising huge returns on investment in potato business."

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato cultivator in Kolar."

The warning has come amid trends of sugar prices crossing Rs 40/kg in recent weeks and there is fear of the prices increasing further during festive season, particularly around the times of Diwali.The state governments have also been asked to enforce the stock limits strictly.

You know, civilian casualties are obviously of grave concern to us,"" she said.According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), Riyadh had requested the possible purchase of up to 133 American M1A1/A2 Abrams tanks that would be configured to Saudi needs, plus another 20 to replace damaged tanks in their fleet.Additionally, the deal would include 153 .50-caliber machine guns, 266 7.62mm M240 machine guns, smoke grenade launchers, armored recovery vehicles and a range of other hardware.The US State Department has approved the ""possible"" sale and notified Congress on Monday, the DSCA said.Congress has 30 days to block the sale, though is unlikely to do so. ""This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a strategic regional partner which has been and continues to be a leading contributor of political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,"" the DSCA said in a statement.""The addition of these tanks and recovery vehicles to the (Saudi military's) inventory will enhance Saudi Arabia's ability to support its soldiers in the field and to defend the Kingdom's borders.""The Pentagon announcement made no mention of the conflict in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition intervened in March last year after Shiite Huthi rebels and allied forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh overran Sanaa.Tuesday's raids included a strike on a food factory in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa, medics said.Factory director Abdullah al-Aqel gave a higher toll of 16 killed and 10 wounded, adding that all the victims were workers.The Al-Aqel factory, which makes potato chips and is near a military equipment maintenance center targeted in the raids, was struck during working hours, he added.The UN says more than 6,400 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Yemen since the coalition air campaign began last March.The fighting has also driven 2.8 million people from their homes and left more than 80 percent of the population needing humanitarian aid.Saudi Arabia also forms part of the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State jihadists in Syria and Iraq.Last November, the United States approved a $1.29 billion deal to replenish the Saudi air force's arsenal, depleted by its bombing campaign in Yemen."

In June, tomatoes were selling at nearly 100 a kg.Koyambedu wholesale traders association advisor V R Soundararajan who has been in the trade for nearly five decades, said, ""I have never seen such a steep fall in prices in all these years. There is a lack of cash flow in small businesses, which has reduced the income. Farmers are devastated at the price fall.""The veteran trader said the sudden rise in tomato price to 100 a kg two months ago was due to lack of supply.""Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and beans that are brought in from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu, were diverted to Maharashtra and Odisha where the summer crop had failed."" Though there is excess supply now, a fall in demand is causing prices to plummet.Traders said the fluctuation in prices will crush the farmers. Soundararajan said, "" The price should be stable at about 20 a kg if the farmer is to make a living.""The price of green peas fell from 140 a kg last month to 40-50 on Sunday.

The north corporation, which owns the Civic Centre, had given the space for a monthly charge of Re.1.After councillors raised concerns that this deal may be causing the civic body financial loss, the Remunerative Projects (RP) Cell clarified that market rent of the space would have been Rs.6,32,082 per month. The rent was cut to a nominal amount as the cafe was offering food and beverages at subsidised rates to municipal employees, an official document of the RP Cell stated.Unsatisfied with the reason, former Mayor and BJPs Dev Nagar councillor Yogender Chandolia raised concerns at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Wednesday about the way the project was awarded to the private company running the cafe.We understand that a canteen will not get us Rs.6 lakh in rent. But, when the first tender was floated, there were companies willing to pay us Rs.1 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh in rent. Instead of negotiating with them, our officials picked someone else for Re.1 without following due process, Mr. Chandolia told The Hindu .According to the RP Cell, however, the earlier two bidders were rejected as they did not have the required technical capabilities. As per the RP cell, the present contractor was the only one that responded when the corporation advertised the project on its website on March 23, 2015.BJPs Rajendra Nagar councillor Rajesh Bhatia, who was the first to raise concern, said that other provisions of the agreement were also shocking.Extra goodiesWhat is more astounding is that the corporation has provided the company with inventory worth lakhs of rupees free of cost, said Mr. Bhatia.As per the agreement, the corporation gave refrigerators, boilers, burners, microwave ovens, a double tank fryer, a sandwich griller, a 10-kg capacity potato peeler and a 300-kg weighing scale to the cafe operator."

A quintal of onions, which fetched farmers between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 last month, was being sold at Rs 500-800 this week.It is not just onion cultivators who are suffering. Potato farmers, too, are finding the going difficult with prices falling.

""Just want to ask Rahul Gandhi, is dalali a word to refer Indian Army and their efforts to save the country,"" he added.Accusing Narendra Modi of gaining political mileage out of, Gandhi had said that the government was doing ""dalali"" (trade) over the bloodshed by Indian soldiers.""Unki dalali kar rahe ho... Yeh bilkul ghalat hai... Hindustan ki sena ne Hindustan ka kaam kiya, aap apna kaam keejiye... (You are trading on them. This is totally wrong... The Indian Army did its job for India, you do your work),"" Rahul had said in a brief but aggressive speech on Thursday.Taking a dig at the Congress party, Shah also said that the comment from party's vice-president clearly reflects the mindset of the Congress party.Those who have questioned the government over the surgical strikes have not only insulted the Army but also the jawans who have lost their lives, Shah added.Taking a potshot at Rahul Gandhi, Shah said that his understanding of farming in the country is limited to 'aalu ki factories' alone.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi, at a political rally had said, ""You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader, I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers.""Shah also attacked. The Delhi chief minister had made headlines in Pakistani media outlets when he raised his doubts over government's 'claim' of surgical strikes along the LoC on September 29. In a video message addressed to the Prime Minister, he had urged him to ""expose"" Pakistan's propaganda on surgical strikes.Responding to a poser on some BJP leaders creating a hype on the strikes, he said some workers were only exhibiting their excitement and questioned why there is was no such excitement in the Congress leadership.The BJP chief urged all parties not to politicise the issue but said the BJP would take the issue to the masses to build up the confidence of the armed forces.""We have not claimed the surgical strikes. The army did it. Army and not the politicians should claim credit,"" he said.He said by questioning the strikes, Congress is associating itself with the dejection in Pakistan. He asked it to stand with the army and the enthused people of India instead."

These taluks should be declared drought-hit. Crops like potato, chilly, cotton, jowar and others have been damaged badly. The government should declare support price for potato and open procurement centres, he said.Pralhad Joshi, MP, said the State government had not yet released the crop insurance money for last year and they were citing reasons of duplicate loan accounts of the farmers as major hindrance.However, even after three months no measures have been initiated to set right this problem.The State government should start disbursing the crop insurance by Wednesday or else the BJP would launch an agitation, Mr. Joshi said.Mr. Joshi added that the State government should immediately hold survey to assess the crop loss and sent a proposal to the Centre. He said he would use his office to see that maximum assistance from the Centre is made available.The team led by Mr. Shettar and Mr. Joshi visited Nagashettikoppa, Bengeri, Sulla, Byahatti, Hebasur, Kiresur and Mantur villages."
