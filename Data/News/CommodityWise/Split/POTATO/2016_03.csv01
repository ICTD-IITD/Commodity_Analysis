On World Vegetarian Day , we speak to a few newbie veggies in town to learn more about what it is like to become one.For Kochi-based yoga practitioner Sudakshna Thampi, who joined the vegetarian bandwagon a year ago, vegetarianism has impacted her mind the most. ""The past one year has been a life changing journey for me. Vegetarian food is lighter, more sattvik, karmically better, good for nature and animals as well. Mindful eating is the best way to eat appropriately and I have become more mindful now. I am aware about the food I have on my plate and know how it tastes and smells, its texture and how I feel after consuming it. Turning vegetarian has been the best decision of my life,"" she says.Karthika Nair, a vegetarian by choice for the past two years, doesn't shy away from saying that she owes her recent success to the veggie diet that she follows. Karthika bid good bye to her long-time digestion issues after turning a vegetarian two years back. ""My job demanded a lot of travel and I used to suffer from acidity, stomach upset and digestion problems all through. My career was at stake and that is when I opted to be a vegetarian. The results were magical. I am perfectly healthy now and haven't consulted a doctor for a year. I also used to get issues like joint pains, body aches and also eye sight issues. But after being a vegetarian, my sight is improving and my doctor even said I can go for a laser surgery now. What more do I need to go green?"" she asks. Karthika has now become an advocate of vegetarianism, and many of her friends are also trying out a vegetarian diet to see the transformation for themselves.Kasaba actress Neha Saxena who had an on-and-off relationship with vegetarianism says her diet keeps her fresh and beautiful. ""If you ask me what foods I prefer? I will always say leafy vegetables, cereals, pulses and fruits. It purifies the blood. Carrots are good for the eyes, green veggies keeps my hair healthy and my skin glowing. I also avoid masalas as much as possible,"" she says.According to Neha, a meat-free diet also keeps one physically and mentally more energetic. ""I don't feel exhausted during back-to-back shoots, after I added raw vegetables to my diet,"" she adds.You are what you eat', they say, and that is what Ashwini Prem goes by. Ashwini and family are now vegetarians and she says there has been a drastic change in the family's approach towards other living beings and life in general. ""Five years back when I met my husband he was a pakka non-vegetarian. But now he is a pure vegetarian and there is a huge transformation in his behaviour. He has become more compassionate, spiritual and sensitive. Not only him, our maid and driver too have joined the cause and admit that they have become more empathetic towards both animals and human beings. It also amplifies your patience levels,"" she adds.Ashwini describes their lives as full of happiness and positivity now. ""The word vegetarian comes from the Latin word Vegetus which means full of vitality, vigour and cheer. Plant foods signify peace and harmony; are soothing and cleansing and instill positivity in you. Meat spells death, blood, harm, pain and foul smells, all of which gives you negativity,"" she says.Vegetables are rich in antioxidants. They neutralise free radicals in the body and prevent a lot of lifestyle illness. Different antioxidants bring different benefits to the body; while some boost our immune system, others benefit the skin, eyes, memory problems, moods etc. To be more specific, beta-carotene is good for the eyes, iycopene for prostate health and proanthocyanidin for the urinary tract.However, when a full blown non-vegetarian opts for a vegetarian diet, they should take care to add protein substitutes as well. Only in animal proteins do we get complete proteins which have all the mild amino acids. Soya beans are the best substitute for protein. Combination foods like idly/dosa and sambar provide the benefits for cereals and pulses. And also while making flour batter for chappati, use water with boiled dal. Vegetarians should also take substitutes for Vitamin D and B12 following a rainbow diet - including vegetables of all colours. Have lots of legumes, pulses, cereals, green leaves and fruits!-Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, clinical nutritionistMeanwhile, does the taste of non-veg side dishes stop you from turning a vegetarian? There are many who have been saying that even though they want to follow a vegetarian diet, they find it really tough to replace the taste of fried chicken, fish and beef that dominate their taste buds.

But buying a land is neither cheap nor easy. However, Sundar and many others were flabbergasted when the district horticulture department invited residents to come and lease land on periodic basis, as TOI had reported earlier.""Buying a land is not that easy. But now with the horticulture department giving an option to lease land, I can barely contain my excitement,"" she said.According to officials, within two weeks of the announcement, some 35 residents have already approached the department. ""We have heard from 35 people who are interested and we also carried out a site visit for around 25 people on Saturday,"" said Deen Mohammad Khan , district horticulture officer.The land has been selected in Tikli, a village near Badshahpur, after the land proposed earlier failed some tests. The department will now have the membership forms ready and the work will be started from October.Meanwhile the horticulture department has decided that it will be run the programme on a membership basis and charge Rs 3,879 per month per unit which can be paid monthly or upfront. Every unit will be 600 square yards.The department will keep extra labour to look after the maintenance and security of crops when the residents are away. Besides, there will be a refundable security fee of Rs 5,000 per unit. ""Every unit will be leased for six months because vegetables are grown seasonally and if a resident feels that the plan is not working for them, they can quit after giving a 45-day notice,"" said Khan.Officials informed that they will sit with every family and make a list of vegetables to be grown depending on their preference. ""As per yield, one unit will be able to produce 2,500kg of potato or 1,500kg of potato in one season,"" said Khan. For those interested in organic farming there will be special guidance and assistance.To make things further convenient for the residents, the department has proposed a delivery van which can collect fresh vegetables and milk and deliver it to their residences every morning."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all-India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham secretary general D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives."

The haul is suspected to have been hoarded by unscrupulous traders in two cold storage facilities.Price of potato in the open market is currently hovering around Rs 25-28 per kg, when the selling price should have been Rs 14-15. Kamrup district deputy commissioner Vinod Seshan said, ""We are releasing the potato to the government's fair price shops (Amaar Dukaan), where it will be sold at Rs 14.50 per kg in Kamrup district and Rs 15 per kg in Kamrup (Metro) district. We have written to the government to allow us to release the potato in all PDS stores.""The cold storage facilities are for farmers to store their products. They have to pay rent for the storage and the quantities stored have to be recorded at the facilities. But, at the two private storage facilities where the potato have been found, there were no records showing where the potato came from and no agreement to establish that farmers have sold off the stuff to the owners of storage facilities."

Homemakers felt the pinch at city markets on Tuesday. ""I am not joking. Go on adding prices of the ingredients for shukto. It will come to around Rs 60 a plate.Prices of select vegetable items are more than that in Delhi,"" said Anita Mukherjee, who has come from Delhi to visit her parents at Lake Market. At Lake Market on Tuesday, potato (chandramukhi) was selling at Rs 28-30 a kilo, brinjal at Rs 40-50, bitter gourd (uchhe) at Rs 40-55, drum sticks (sajne danta) at Rs 100120 and kanchkala at Rs 10-12 each. Add to this the cost of oil and spices.A one-hour drive from Kolkata takes one to Tarakeshwar -the potato producing belt. Bags containing 100 kg potato are loaded on trucks at Rs 2140 per bag which comes down to Rs 21.40 a kilo for the chandramukhi variety .What makes potato prices soar by Rs 9 a kilo? The story is all about aggregators, hoarders, Puja organisers and a section of police officers who collect money from trucks as they pass through the 10-odd police station areas before reaching the wholesale market at Posta. From there, light vehicles carry potatoes to the retail markets in the city.Other vegetables are usu ally brought from North 24Parganas, South 24-Parganas and Murshidabad. Now, check the prices of vegetables like brinjal, ladies finger and bitter gourd at markets along the railway tracks from Sealdah to Santoshpur Sandhyabazar. Price of each vegetable is less by at least Rs 4-5 compared to the prices at Gariahat, Lake Market and Maniktala markets. For instance, ladies finger in Basirhat is selling at Rs 8-12 a kilo and the green chilli (Beldanga variety) at Rs 30 a kilo at Behrampore. But prices of these vegetables in Kolkata are at least three times high. The upswing has caught the attention of the state government. Prodded by chief minister Mamata Banerjee , the government task force on prices held a meeting at Nabanna on Tuesday to discuss on ways to monitor prices and see that they do not go up further. ""The prices at city markets do not seem to be a function of the demandsupply theory . Factors like hoarding, changing of multiple hands and hidden costs during festivals are behind the price rise. We will start visiting the city markets soon and inform the police in case of an abnormality,"" said a task force member."

This will be followed by chicken biryani soon.Though the Railways sells snacks and food items from its stalls as per Railway Board norms, this is for the first time biryani has been included in the menu.The decision follows 'Swachh Aahar Day' (Clean Food Day) celebrated on Sunday amid rigorous monitoring of catering services at railway stations across the division.""On Sunday, we inspected food stalls, pantry cars of passing trains, base kitchen at the station for cleanliness and system of garbage disposal.

It will be sold through railway restaurant Jan Aahar on platform number 1 and railway owned stalls, besides on specified trains. We will also put display boards to market it.""Though biryani may be available in pantry cars and many unauthorized vendors make a killing by selling it, the quality is substandard.

Kadhar, a farmer, said .These farmers cultivate crops on less than four acres of land and depend on good yields to not only cover the expense of the lease amount, but also to pay for the next sowing season.However, this year has been especially hard for them , as the scanty rainfall has meant that they have had little water for their crops.Mr. Kadhar said that he has accrued a loss of more than Rs. 4 lakh cumulatively after his potato crop failed.I have used a tractor to level the land and prepare it for the next season, as we hope the rains will come shortly, he said.The farmer is preparing to grow radish on his 6-acre farm as they are more resistant to winter climates.B Kanagaraj, another farmer who owns a 2-acre farm nearby, said that it had been eight months since it rained in the village.Input costHe is now growing carrots on only a quarter of the entire farm as the input costs are too high. I spend more than Rs. 5,000 for bringing water in trucks to irrigate the fields every month.

However, the steep prices that onions fetched last year seem to have offset a cycle of farmers opting for onions in large numbers, which, coupled with a decent monsoon, ensured good crops across regions, leading to a glut in the market.

The state machinery is working overtime to clear the land so that it can be handed over to its owners by the November 15 deadline set by the CM.On August 31, the Supreme Court had asked the state to wind up the handover within 12 weeks.""We had three bighas of land at the project site. Today, I was handed over 5 cottahs,"" said Malati Ghosh, a landowner. ""It was a three-crop land, which included paddy and potato,"" she said. The CM handed her a bagful of mustard seeds, something Malati has never grown before. Mustard usually doesn't need any fertilizer; it also needs less water (only two inches a week).Mamata said later: ""I know a little about cultivation. My childhood was spent in a village. The crop that farmers can cultivate immediately is mustard. Today, I am distributing mustard seeds. In time, you will sow potato and paddy as well.""""Save greenery, create greenery and bring smiles in Singur again is our theme. For those who wanted to save their agricultural land, it is a dream that has come true. I am sure that as far as the issue of agricultural land is concerned, Singur will be the model for the world,"" she added."
