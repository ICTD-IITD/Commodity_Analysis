58f6a034a3d24b0b70c2d8ce,Popular weekly shandies need to be regulated,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/popular-weekly-shandies-need-to-be-regulated/article8127590.ece,2016-01-20,"Weekly shandies or vaara sandais are popular among the residents of the city and outskirts. Farmers from Alagarkoil, Alanganallur, Avaniapuram, Kadachanendal and other areas in the district sell their vegetables at locations which give easy access to people.Though regular visitors to these vaara sandais are familiar with the sellers (farmers), they are not sure about the correctness of weights and measures used. However, there is an impression among many buyers that prices are cheap in the weekly shandies than in regular markets and vegetable stalls.According to Corporation authorities, there are close to two dozen shandies functioning in the city and peripheries, but the major shandies popular among the consumers are Sunday market at Uchaparambumedu, Monday market at Koodal Nagar, Tuesday markert at Ellis Nagar, etc.On an average, 200 to 300 persons come to sell their produce, mainly vegetables and fruits. Local merchants also sell hot bajjis, potato chips and sugarcane juice at the shandies. A few artisans sell fancy handicraft items and so on. Close to 2,000 persons visit each shandy.For Roberts (55) of Ellis Nagar, the shandy has its own advantages and disadvantages. When roads were being laid at Ellis Nagar, the shandy was a big barrier for many residents as the farmers put up their shops on both sides of the roads. However, after the roads were laid and widened, vehicle movement had become easy and the number of farmers putting up shops at the shandy had also gone up, and the shandy had extended up to BSNL office from Tamil Nadu Housing Board office, he noted.Radhika, a BSNL employee from DSP Nagar, Bypass Road, said that vegetables like onion and carrot were fresh and reasonably priced at the shandy. It is convenient for me since I buy three or four vegetables once a week and store them in the refrigerator, she added.Another sideHowever, the residents of Rajaji Street in Uchaparambumedu near Iyer Bungalow had a different tale. On Sunday, the market would open at 5 p.m., which meant the farmers would arrive from 2 p.m. The noise and commotion deprived the residents of their post-lunch nap, said Rafiq, who runs a leather business in the city.Till about two years ago, the market functioned on the main road, but due to heavy vehicle movement, the farmers have sneaked into our street. The noise pollution is unbearable on Sundays, he said.Another senior citizen of the same street said that Madurai Corporation should not permit sale of eatables on roads. All vegetables were kept open. It was unhygienic since stray dogs and cattle wandered all around and urinated here and there. Since the market was open beyond 6 p.m., the quality of vegetables could not be checked.On Konnavayanchalai and Bypass Road, the residents alleged that traffic went for a toss when the markets opened. Already, travel on Bypass Road was risky as vehicle flow was high around 6 p.m. Traffic police at the intersection said that since the pathway was occupied by the farmers for their makeshift shandy, pedestrians had to use the roads. Every week, there were cases of freak accidents due to overcrowding and haphazard parking.An official of Corporation Health Department said that the respective sanitary inspectors and teams were entrusted with the task of clearing garbage from the weekly shandies the next day. For instance, a large posse of conservancy workers would be deployed to Uchaparambumedu area on Mondays to clear vegetable wastes which got piled up on both sides of the road, and it applied to other locations as well, she noted.Agriculture Department officials said that farmers from nearby areas such as Poikaikaraipatti, Kadachanendal, Oomachikulam and parts of Alanganallur brought their produce and sold them here. Prices were fixed by them and there was no mechanism with any agency to check their correctness. The prices would not be certainly lesser than uzhavar sandai rates.About a year ago, Labour Department officials, during a raid, found that the weights and measures used in these shandies were not calibrated or those approved by the government. A mere warning was given to the farmers to use electronic scale. The officials did not seize the weights since the farmers pleaded with them to forgive them, an official said.Police officers from the respective stations, who used to warn people through mobile public address system to beware of bag lifters and pickpockets till a few months back were not to be seen now, residents of Uchaparambumedu said.Many residents said that the corporation authorities should study the modalities to regulate the shandies and earmark exclusive space for the farmers. Instead of allowing the farmers to convert roads into makeshift shandies, the officials should provide protected places which would be safe and convenient for the residents, they said."

It is also the only time when specific regional cuisines are actually available at different venues.During the day it is the bhog which is prepared by special cooks for offering the goddess at the Bengali Durga puja . ""We have items like khichidi, chorchori, (a mix of brinjal, radish and pumpkin) and bati chorchori, a more sophisticated version made with cauliflower, beans and carrots offered as bhog to the deity during day time,"" says Soumandra Sarkar, organizer of Katol Road Durga puja which is famous for its food stalls. In the evening the stalls offering various Bengali delicacies do brisk business at these venues. Beguni, made by frying brinjal dipped in gramflour batter and smeared with poppy seeds, Dimer devil, an egg preparation in which boiled egg is halved and stuffed with potato paste, dipped in besan and deep fried and ghughni, made with chickpeas are all quintessential Bengali food items which sell fast. ""Equally famous are the stalls which prepare fish, mutton and chicken cutlets, fried pomfret, fish curry and rice and biryani. Noodles and egg, chicken and mutton rolls are equally popular,"" says Sarkar.Caterers who specialize in these cuisines are given contracts for these occasions. ""Bengali families do not cook at home during puja days as they are busy attending the rituals at puja pandals during the day and then flitting from one venue to the other in the evening. So we keep these wholesome food combinations which are moderately priced and enjoyed by all,"" Sarkar adds.At the Ram Nagar Durga puja it's an all vegetarian fare. ""Our puja pandal is in between two temples and so we are hesitant of keeping non-vegetarian food stalls here,"" says Datta Satyendu the organizer. ""We will have no control over the plates and the waste is disposed and this may hurt the sentiments of others,"" he says. But Satyendu feels that there is hardly any loss of footfalls. ""There are a lot of non-Bengalis who visit our pandal and once they know that only vegetarian food is sold and served here they enjoy it."" Only Bengalis eat non-vegetarian food during puja days, the rest turn vegetarian during the Puja days. ""Bengalis keep moving from one venue to other so it really doesn't affect us,"" he adds.""Since women are not cooking at all during this time, the husbands know that all the meals will have be at the stalls here and are ready to indulge us,"" says Madhumita Bannerjee, a schoolteacher. ""I would say nothing matches the bhog in terms of taste but I especially look forward to the beguni,"" she adds.If the Bengali puja pandals are all about Bengali delicacies, the garba pandals are more about quick refreshments. An array of food stalls are lined up here as the crowds are much larger. ""Lemon soda and juice stalls along with those selling instant noodles and pasta are a big hit,"" says young businessman Karan Grover. ""The ten minute breaks are too short for people to spend time on eating,"" he adds.""There is so much of frenzied dancing happening here till late night that juice stalls do a thundering business ,"" says photographer Surpeet Kapoor who is a regular at these venues. In terms of food the one at Queta colony is a big favourite and it's a final destination for all dancing enthusiasts. ""The wide range of food stalls serve dosa, ice-cream, sandwiches and pasta,"" says choreographer Sidhartha Joshi. ""The idea is to grab a quick bite and gulp a cool refreshing drink in between dancing. So only 'super' fast food is sold here,"" he adds with a smile."

It served twin purposes -such demarcations will help owners to get the land as estimated by the Hooghly land records office, and the land labourers will get some crumbs of the government bounty . On Friday morning, Srimati Tudu, Bilasi Soren, Phulmani Kisku and Madan Ghosh from Gopalnagar joined work happily because they won't have to go to far off places to eke out a living.The Singur panchayat samity has engaged these day labourers under the NREG scheme on a daily wage of Rs 165 and breakfast. ""We are planning to give some money because the work is not too easy. The samity members at a meeting decided to begin the work with day labourers from Gopalnagar, Dobandhi and Bajemelia,"" said panchayat samity chairperson Pratima Das. The rural body has also devised a way to identify the bona fide day labourers from these areas and keep outsiders at bay. These labourers have got a certificate from the respective gram panchayat member based on which the block land and land reforms office has given them permission to enter the land. ""We are very happy. All of us had come from Bankura 22 years ago to work on the fields here.We have got back the right to work in Singur at last. We had a tough time looking for odd jobs outside Singur.The government once engaged us in road construction but we are skilled in agricultural work,"" said labourer Phulmani Kisku.The landowners, mean while, queued up in front of the block development office to get the land deeds after hearing. Tarun Bagui, who owns 1.5 bighas, said: ""I have got back my plot and will go back to farming. The land is fit for farming. This year, I will start with potato and cauliflower,"" Bagui said.However, those having land along the Durgapur Expressway are in two minds.Land brokers have already offered them a price of Rs 8 lakh a bigha. Sashibhusan Ghosh, who works in a factory, has four bighas of land.""I will wait for some time for the government to increase the compensation. I am ready to sell the land for some agro-based industry ,"" Ghosh said. Another landowner, Pradyut Das, is waiting and yet to accept the compensation cheque."

We dont buy or sell; no middlemen and no franchisees; we just control production, Madhusudan, Chief Farmer, back2basics, told BusinessLine .Of the 180 acres, back2basics owns nearly 60 and the rest is leased from others. Contrary to belief in some quarters, agriculture is not a dying business. We have home-delivery in Bengaluru as of now and will soon expand to other cities . We also export and have access to 45 organic product outlets abroad.On 3.5 acres, he even offers experimental farming to his consumers so that they know how back2basics grows its vegetables.From fast-moving to farmN Balasubramanian, who graduated from the Institute of Rural Management Anand in 1989 and worked with the National Dairy Development Board, Godrej and some other food-related MNCs, always wanted to help small and marginal farmers. After having helped his friend Raj Seelam since 2004 in his Hyderabad-based organic products venture Sresta, he quit his lucrative job in the FMCG sector and joined Srestas start-up 24 Mantra Organic in 2010 as its CEO.We now have a network of 32,000 farmers producing 90 crops across 1.70 lakh acres in 15 States. We plan to expand to 1 lakh farmers and 5 lakh acres in the next five years.Explaining Srestas business model, he said the firm is not into contract farming. It helps farmers grow organic produce and pays market price for the produce. It currently markets across 145 cities in India, and has tied up with retail majors. It also has access to about 1,000 stores in 45 States in the US and has a presence in Singapore, Dubai and Mauritius.One-stop shopIndore-based Raman Singh Saluja has a slightly different story to narrate. For three years from 1995, he was into wind energy; moved to exporting potato and pulses to West and South Asia before he realised the gaps in supply chain in agriculture. This prompted him to start a web portal and supply-chain initiative called Gram Mandi.com but gave it up in 2000 due to APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) laws and poor web connectivity. He then returned to his family business of metal trading before finally, founding a start-up in 2010.His rural solutions company Gramco Infratech offers farmers end-to-end services under one roof  from sowing to marketing end products, except selling machines. It helps farmers with seeds, fertilisers, bio-fertilisers, chemicals, water solubles, and warehousing. The company also has access to 250 acres of contract farming for soyabean and wheat in Madhya Pradesh. Farmers are free to market their products.We recently tied up with a fertiliser major. In the next three years, we plan to expand to 10,000 to 15,000 acres of contract farming.From growing organic produce to offering farming services, these professionals fill the gap in the sector"

Photo: S. Siva SaravananIts tomatoes, and not onions, that are bringing tears at households now. In the last few weeks, tomato prices have shot up multi-fold and purchases have dropped.In Coimbatore, the wholesale price of 1 kg of tomatoes on Tuesday was Rs. 60 and the retail price went up to Rs. 80 a kg. In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

This time, the centre is going to conduct studies on sweet potato too along with the tapioca.With the Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University allocating 6.26 acres of land from its Agriculture Research Station here, Dr. YSR Horticulture University has approved to set up the Horticulture Research Station and allocated a principal scientist and three supporting staff, besides releasing Rs. 25 lakh towards the construction of office building.The All India Coordinated Research Project on Tuber Crops (AICRPTC), on its part, has sanctioned another Rs. 25 lakh for setting up a state-of-the-art laboratory to conduct studies on tapioca and sweet potato. Though the research station has formally commenced its operations from here, it will be equipped with its own office building and laboratory within two years from now.Of the total extent of 80,000 acres in which tapioca is being cultivated in the State, over 65,000 acres is situated in the upland mandals of East Godavari district. The Horticulture Department established a research station on tapioca here way back in 1975, encouraging more and more farmers to switch over to tapioca from other conventional crops. As a result of the continuous research conducted by the station, the yield per acre rose from 4,500 kg to 9,000 kg.Karra Pendalam in the local parlance, tapioca tuber is the main ingredient for making sago. Going by the increased produce of tapioca, over 40 sago mills were established in and around Peddapuram over a period of time. However, the research station was shifted to Venkataramannagudem, the headquarters of Dr. YSR Horticulture University in March, 2012, owing to administrative reasons.As a result of the constant efforts of the tapioca farmers, local elected representatives and the officials of both the Agriculture and Horticulture Universities, the station has come back to the town now. We have already started our fieldwork by interacting with the local farmers. Our focus is ensuring pest-free tapioca tuber and value addition sweet potato to the farmers here. As we are researching into coloured sweet potato with beta-carotene, more and more farmers will be opting for sweet potato in the years to come, B.V.K. Bhagawan, Principal Scientist of the university and in-charge of the station, has told The Hindu .With the tapioca transplantation gaining momentum, the research station staff turned busy advising the farmers on the steps to be taken to get better yield."

Harvesting is in full swing and nearly 65 tonnes of vegetables are daily being sent to Horticorp and the main markets of Mettupalayam and Vadugapatti in Tamil Nadu.The main items cultivated here are potato, carrot, beetroot, cabbage, garlic, and beans. The high prices for garlic at Vadugapatti, the main market for garlic in South India, have kindled hopes among farmers as the price for the item has been fluctuating for the past three years, even reaching below Rs.20 a kg at times. Now the price ranges from Rs.180 to Rs.200 a kg. Garlic harvesting began by June end.Vattavada agriculture officer P.B. Shanavas told The Hindu on Sunday that 2,200 hectares of land was under vegetable cultivation this season, of which garlic was one of the major crops. However, potato continued to be the main crop, he said. Garlic price had touched Rs.400 a kg this season. Farmers cultivated the small-sized Mettupalayam variety, known for its high quality. One of the reasons for farmers shifting to garlic cultivation was the low price for potato last Onam season, due to a bumper production.Unlike other vegetables, farmers can keep garlic for three months after drying in sunlight. However, due to good prices, farmers now tend to sell it soon after harvest, said Thankaraj, a farmer. The garlic market was on Saturdays and Wednesdays, he said, adding that for butter beans and garlic, there was no market in the State. On a single day, about 130 tonnes of garlic is being sent from Vattavada.Better pricesActive market intervention by Horticorp is said to be a reason for farmers getting remunerative prices this season. At the Swayasraya Karshaka Vipani at Koviloor in Vattavada, potatoes were sold for Rs.23 a kg, carrot at Rs.25 and cabbage at Rs.15 .Beans items were also getting good prices with butter beans remaining the most-preferred item. Horticorp procures vegetables directly from farmers through the Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Marketing Society. An official of the Horticorp said that the agency was procuring vegetables without grading them so that the produce would get a better price. Horticorp procured vegetables twice a week. Of the 65 tonnes of vegetables reaching the market, the agency procures only 5 tonnes. Lack of storage facilities is stated to be the reason for low procurement. The vegetables produced here directly go to the markets in Tamil Nadu. Farmers say they get the prices of vegetables procured by Horticorp in a week and hoped the agency would procure more vegetables in the coming days.2,200 ha under vegetable cultivation in VattavadaHorticorp procures only5 tonnes a day"
