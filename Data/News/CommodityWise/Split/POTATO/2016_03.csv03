58f71b76a3d24b0b70c32113,Snacktrack: A serving of semolina goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/snacktrack-discovering-bengalurus-rava-idli/article8547420.ece,2016-05-02,"There are times when the tummy rumbles and grumbles. You dont want to go in for something heavy, but are looking for that perfect snack that keeps your body light enough to keep working without feeling drowsy. So, we zero in on rava idlis.A staple, delicious food, the rava idli has become popular in not just Karnataka but also around the world. This idli is created from roasted semolina, mixed in sour curds and seasoned with mustard and curry leaves.After this the idli is steamed, topped with cashew nuts and served with a tangy coconut chutney, sambar or a vegetable kurma. Some versions also have tiny chopped pieces of beans, grated carrots or coconut and chopped coriander.To find the origin of this popular dish we take off to MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Rooms), on Lalbagh Road, which is associated with the dish for years. We meet Vikram Maiya, the Managing Partner, MTR, who narrates the history of rava idlis.As we wait for our dish to arrive, Vikram starts, The history of rava idly has been retold a number of times. It started off with grain middlings. When the grain is milled, whatever is left out is called semolina. We have wheat, maize and rice semolina. The story starts there. During World War II, there was a shortage of rice. It has not been documented, but my grand uncle  Yagnanarayana Maiya  who was a prolific cook, started experimenting with various ingredients and then zeroed in on the rava idli recipe. He created the recipe. It worked with curds and cashew and seasonings. The original ingredient is still used. Rava idli is now made pretty much the same way everywhere.Then about MTR he says, It started in 1924 as Brahmins Coffee Bar. My grand uncle worked as a cook and later started MTR in 1951. The rest is all history.Our rava idli arrives, piping hot with a sweet and tangy potato curry, coconut chutney and a tiny bowl of melted ghee. We generously layer our cashew-topped idli with the ghee and dip it into the chutney and then the next bite into the potato gravy and theres absolute silence for the next few seconds as we get immersed in our plates.The original recipe is followed everywhere, Vikram says. The consistency has also been followed as the recipe was written down and handed over to the cooks down the years.With our mouths full, we ask why it is not served with a kurma, and Vikram explains, I personally feel the aroma and the strong masalas of the kurma kill the subtle flavours of the rava idli.The rava idli does indeed feel lighter on the tummy and great on your palette. That is because it does not have urad daal or rice, making it a healthy, savoury option, beams Vikram. As he does most of the talking, we do most of the eating. Finally crunch go the roasted cashews in our mouths, adding that grand finale to the taste and the history of the famed rava idli."

K.M. Shivalinge Gowda, the Arsikere MLA, and H.K. Kumaraswamy, MLA for Alur-Sakleshpur, maintained that the government was not serious in handling the drought situation.Mr. Shivalinge Gowda, raising the issue at the Karnataka Development Programme review meeting, said he had been informed that the Ministers would hold a meeting at the Inspection Bungalow in Arsikere.The Ministers did not come to Arsikere. Instead, they held a meeting in Kanakatte gram panchayat. People would think that the MLA had no time to attend the meeting. Who is responsible for creating this confusion? he asked.District in-charge Minister A. Manju intervened saying he himself was not aware of the Ministers visit to Arsikere. The Ministers visit was not decided in advance. If it was decided in the last minute, the MLA should have been informed, he said.Meanwhile, Mr. Kumaraswamy wondered if the Minister himself was not aware, who else knew about the Ministers visit. This shows how serious the government is about tackling drought, he said.Seed potato procurementRegarding procurement of seed potatoes for farmers in the district, Mr. Manju directed B. Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture, to ensure that the seeds procured from the growers in Punjab were certified."

He and other cofounders Ranjith Parakkal and Devadas Parakkal then moved to a proper office on M. G. Road.The founders soon realised that the main hurdle for them is not just workspace, Internet connection or electricity supply, but access to large multinational companies to sell their innovation. Last December, Uncanny Vision moved to Start-up Warehouse formed by IT trade body Nasscom along with Government of Karnataka at Old Airport Road. The co-working space and accelerator for early stage technology product firms is surrounded by tech companies like Intel, Microsoft and Dell. Now every week the Uncanny Vision team meet top executives from big companies like IBM and Bosch, who visit the facility to check out hot technology products.It has been amazing for us. Instead of us going to them, they come to us, said Mr. Sundaramoorthy, 37, who quit his job at chip maker Xilinx to launch the firm. Besides building relationships with these executives, Uncanny Vision has bagged pilot projects from Qualcomm, the worlds largest maker of chips that go inside smartphones and Target Corp, the second-largest discount retailer in the United States.Nasscom, which started as lobbyist for the countrys offshoring industry or big boys club has transformed into a powerhouse for providing infrastructure and mentoring to young firms and helping them to connect with investors. Ashok Madaravally, Deputy Director at Nasscom, said that in the last two decades the organisation helped the IT services industry grow from $1 billion (Rs.6,645 crore) to $140 billion (Rs.9.3 lakh crore). But we realised that the next wave of innovation is going to come from these new age product companies, said Mr. Madaravally, who represents Nasscoms ambitious 10,000 Start-ups programme from Bengaluru. The Start-up Warehouse is part of this programme  that helps young firms with mentoring, funding and industry connects. It expects to have nine such facilities across the country this year.Uncanny Vision, which went through various mentoring programmes has also narrowed down its focus towards the area of surveillance. The firm said that customers would not need to manually monitor the behaviour and activities of people, or other changing information continuously. Its software that sits on surveillance devices such as cameras does it all. The applications range from monitoring elderly patients to the security of buildings.Unlike fancy offices at companies like Google, the Start-up Warehouse is not a Disneyland to have massage chairs or a cafeteria filled with chocolates and potato chips. If you take a stroll around the warehouse, which is equal to a supermarket, one can find a juice shop, traditional coffee containers and food cooked by another small firm that aims to provide nutritionally balanced meal.One of the top guests who visited the warehouse recently was Thuan Pham, Chief Technology Officer at Uber Technologies Inc., the car-sharing service that lets people order transportation via a smartphone. We pitched our product to him (Mr. Pham) and are in talks to take it forward, said Soumik Ukil, 37, Chief Executive at LightMetrics.The firm has developed a technology that helps enterprises to monitor the driving behaviour of their drivers and help prevent accidents and associated losses. Mr. Ukils peer Sarita Mishra, founder of Green Cosmos Energy Solutions has been able to connect with potential clients in markets like Japan, Canada and the Karnataka government. Her firm has developed a cloud-based product RealNatics that analyzes real-time data from smart meters to perform energy consumption forecasts and reduce costs for manufacturing plants and commercial buildings. It would have been difficult to get these contacts on my own, said Ms. Mishra, a former scientist at Indias premier nuclear research facility Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.The warehouse has laboratories for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT)  a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently. Townista, which helps people discover and book interesting things to do in the city such as rock climbing, magic shows and tea tasting, has been using these laboratories to test its app on about 30 different types of devices. This is crucial for Paras Jain, 28, who started the firm along with his IIT-Bombay batch mate Snehal Nimje, from his home in Koramangala. But Mr. Jain said the biggest advantage for his team has been learning from peers working at other firms. You can learn from the peers who are already ahead of you and share back the knowledge with people who are lagging behind, he said.For instance, when Mr. Jains peer Parinitha Manohar, founder of Spalontime, that provides an aggregator app for salons and spas, is stuck on a problem, she posts it on common online group. The group includes all the company employees at the warehouse.Either they reply or come to meet me to discuss it, said Ms. Manohar who quit her engineering job at Internet infrastructure company VeriSign to launch the firm.We follow an open culture, so that we can learn from each other, said Roopa Aravindakshan, Community Manager at the warehouse.Marquee investors such as Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and IDG Ventures also keep flocking the warehouse several times. About 2,000 young firms have been selected for the Nasscoms 10,000 Startups programme in the last three years. Sangeeta Devni, Deputy Manager at 10,000 Startups said that about 200 of these firms raised venture capital or got selected by various accelerators in India and abroad."

It becomes a problem for the film when the quirks overpower dramatic tension.Kerry on Kutton belongs to the breed of post-Gangs of Wasseypur Hindi films that is so enamoured by the mofussil cool of its subject that it ends up nowhere  much like last years Meerutiya Gangsters. The film isnt even artful in the way it draws inspiration from Anurag Kashyaps two-part gangster saga.

Kerry and he develop a rivalry over the materialistic Jyoti who uses her sexuality to exploit the two men.Our Hindi heartland films have echoes of Westerns, and the seemingly lawless countryside seem to lend a landscape to it. In Kerry on Kutton, the theme of violence propagated by the gun-culture in the region runs through. All the main three male characters are looking to break out from their fathers shadows and the only answer to their problems seem to be a tamancha (gun).The women of Baliya wear their desire on their sleeves (or salwar kameezes or saris). The film does well to show us how much more bold and frank people from small towns can seem to be compared to the urban blandness we see in films set in cities.The acting isnt bad. Dubey has an easy charm: a little too genial perhaps. But but he makes use of his tall, athletic body to play the strapping man-boy who seems to have a way with the women. I was beginning to get fidgety about Jagota being too glamorous for the role, but as I spent more time with the character  it did make sense.But all these elements never come together in Kerry on Kutton.

Kundanapu Bomma lacks a concrete plot and its narrative tone raises a toast to the films made in the 90s. Theres no attempt to make the film contemporary even in the packaging. At best, you could spot a mobile phone or two in the narrative.Set in Vizianagaram, the fairly unidimensional tale of a family headed by Mahadeva Raju (Nagineedu) revolves around the marriage of his confused-pampered daughter Suchi (Chandini Chowdary). Shes apparently the only degree holder in Bobbili who takes her academic authority way too seriously. Theres a bava-maradalu thread too, the decision on Suchis marriage being decided during her birth itself.Gopi (her cousin played by Sudhakar Komakula) isnt keen on the alliance. Theres a new man (Vasu, played by Sudheer Varma) in Suchis life. A middling love triangle feels like a sob-fest stuck in a comic exterior. The film never manages to take off. The narration is tepid and dull.Kundanapu Bomma definitely has plenty of opportunities; theres this tale of an age-old car that the family is deeply attached to, good enough to cause a rift between the brothers, Mahadevaraju and Sahadevaraju (Rajeev Kanakala). Ineffective emotional threads and weak performances make it all seem superficial. Ditto to the romantic track; Vasu helping Suchi copy during her history exam is a frail reason for their love to bloom. Literal English translations of cuss words like chetta naayala (dust fellow) and nee dumpa thega (let your potato get cut), the instance of an automobile engineer mistaken to be the one who repairs autos and mobiles, are what you get in the name of humour. Shakalaka Shankars portions are a pain to scrape through. Jhansis parts fare slightly better. Then there is a Keeravani soundtrack that feels more like a compilation of his rejected tracks over the years. K.V. Mahadevans recreated ghazal Chaitra Maasa, though undone by the CG work, provides some relief. The lead actors, Sudhakar, Sudheer and Chandini, hardly register their presence; their characterisations do the damage. Kundanapu Bomma is a lovely title but the film is anything but that.

The prices of few vegetables have doubled in the retail market.Retail traders at the Gandhi Market say that the severe heat waves have an adverse effect on the growth of horticultural crops.The price of tomato has shot up from Rs.10 to Rs.30. Beans which was sold for Rs.15 during January, now costs Rs. 70 a kg. There has been a sharp demand for beans during domestic functions and other important occasions during summer, says M. Gopinath, one of the dealers. The price of brinjal stands at Rs.40 from Rs.25 last fortnight. However, the prices of potato and cabbage remained steady without any hike.Dheen, a trader in carrots, says that the price per kg stood at Rs.20 now registering an increase by Rs. 5 a kg over last months rate. Apart from increase in the price, the quality of vegetables would be far less during the summer season, as the horticultural plants could not be irrigated adequately."

Owing to excess rainfall, the crop was washed away in three of those farms. In the remaining 60 farms, the yield has been good. For every bag of seed potatoes, the yield was six to seven bags. However, in fields where non-certified seed potatoes were sown, the yield was around three to four bags, he said.A.

Some of them had already left their homes in the city for the airport. They grew restless when the flight did not arrive even at 8.15 a.m. The staff member at the AI ticket counter seemed clueless and directed them to find out from the information being given on the CCTV at the airport entry/exit gates.The CCTV screen at the exit gate was only showing that AI 952 as delayed without mentioning the possible arrival time. After persistent enquiries, a hand-written board was put up at the counter indicating that the flight would arrive at 8.30 a.m. But even that did not happen and the CCTV screen continued to show it as delayed.The waiting relatives wondered about the possible reasons for the delay of the AI flight. Could it be due to rain in Hyderabad? They realised that their fears were unfounded as another relative from Hyderabad came by the SpiceJet flight from Hyderabad at 8.30 a.m.Finally, the AI 952 arrived around 9 a.m. after a one-and-a-half hours delay. The worst part was the lack of information from the AI authorities on the reason for the delay and updating the information about the delay at frequent intervals.The Volvo bus, operated by SpiceJet to ferry air passengers from the tarmac to the terminal building at the airport, gave jitters to the passengers a few weeks ago, according to R.V.K. Koteswara Rao, who came from Hyderabad.The driver applied the brakes all of a sudden and a young woman, with a kid in her arms, lost balance and fell. A senior citizen, who was sitting on the last seat, fell from his seat. Luckily, no one sustained major injuries and ironically, they were not even prepared to complain.I complained to the SpiceJet staff member at the counter but she coolly told me: Sir, please call on the customer care number, says Mr. Koteswara Rao.Dr. Pradeep, who had travelled by the II AC coach in the Visakhapatnam-Kollam weekly express, on May 26, was perturbed by the collection of variable rates from passengers for food by the supplier.The supplier had charged Rs.70 for the rice, potato curry, sambar and curd from a woman passenger. He had taken Rs.170 for the same menu from another passenger.Though the coach was clean, the water in the toilet ran out in about an hour after the train started from Visakhapatnam. The woman passenger was shocked when the stall keeper on the platform at Vijayawada, charged Rs.40 for a packet of chips and a 1-litre water bottle, which normally would cost not more than Rs.25. When she pulled him up, he returned an additional Rs.10."

Mohammed Ali at Udhagamandalam Market every day as he provides them free bondas. One will be surprised to know that this much of crowd has been there for more than 22 years to taste the hot potato bondas worth Rs. 10 and snacks that he offers free of cost.The crowd is at its peak from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. when children return home from schools and special classes. Around 100 children go there even during holidays. This is how he got the name  bonda bhai .Born in Coonoor, Mohammed Ali was the eldest among the siblings. He studied till 5th standard in a government school and on his way back home in the afternoon, a few snack sellers gave him and his friends a small parcel of the remains of varkey and biscuits. He worked in shops in Coonoor and Ooty before starting the snacks and tea bar in Ooty in 1983.Ten years later, he wanted to give something to children who were returning home tired and hungry. I invited a group of five children from a nearby school to the shop and gave them bondas, he says. Word spread about bonda bhais gesture and the number of children coming to his shop multiplied. On weekdays, his snacks bar is frequented by around 250 children and it goes up to 300. They can choose from the bonda and puffs among other snacks, he adds.While he started giving snacks to the children of daily wagers from the government schools, children from private schools also come to his shop for the bondas. Maybe, the taste is good, he says with a smile.Interestingly he does not know the name of any of these children. When I was in my mid 30s, I called them son and daughter. Now, I call them grand children, he says.Earning about Rs. 10,000 on regular days and Rs. 15,000 a day during the tourist season, he spends 25 to 30 per cent of his earnings on free snacks. His wife Shabira also supports him. At times, the children, who are now settled, come to his shop to express their gratitude. It is Gods work, he says and wants to continue it till he breathes his last.

58f7d0a2a3d24b0b70c37f86,Leopard death: forest team arrests two persons,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leopard-death-forest-team-arrests-two-persons/article8344307.ece,2016-03-12,"The Forest Department has arrested two persons responsible for the death of a female leopard last week in Mavallam beat of Hasanur division in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.A special investigation team led by Hasanur Forest Range Officer Palanichamy narrowed down on two local youths Kumar (30) of Devarnatham and Rangan (32) of Mavallam, who had taken on lease a nearby land for potato cultivation. Both were first-time offenders. They were remanded in judicial custody under Section 9 of Wildlife Protection Act 1972, District Forest Officer of Hasanur Division C.H. Padma said.The team that also constituted Forester Shivakumar, and Forest Guards Alagiri, Govind, Ramasamy and Nausher established that the duo had kept metal wire trap to capture wild boars and hares, without realising the consequences.The investigation team was felicitated by the Field Director of STR I. Anwardeen and Ms. Padma for fast-tracking the probe and arresting the offenders within five days.Within hours of the leopards death after getting snared in the metal wire trap, the forest team rushed to the spot. The post-mortem was carried out by forest veterinarians in the presence of the DFO, the president of Village Forest Committee of Mavallam and a representative of Nature and Geo Society. Thereafter the carcass was burnt completely.The leopard was found to be in an advanced age and the forest team surmised the predator had come closer to human habitation in search of easy prey.The predator could not escape as the noose had tightened around its neck.It was not unusual for locals to set traps for wild boars and hares primarily to prevent them from destroying agricultural crops, but were also in the habit of consuming their meat. However, there was no poaching angle, as such.Though the Forest Department has powers to deal sternly with the animal trappers, eating of the meat of boars and hares by locals seldom comes to light, it is learnt.Nevertheless, the department has been carrying out routine checking of boundary lines in recent years, and there have been instances of very many snares being removed, Ms. Padma said, adding that there has been abundant increase in the population of boars in the forest area."
