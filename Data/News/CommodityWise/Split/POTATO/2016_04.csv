For the first time, the food for the officials is being taken care of by the Akshaya Patra Kitchens of the Hare Krishna Foundation. A total of 22,000 kilogramme of rice, 5,000 kg of dal, and 3,500 kg of tomato and potato curries will be prepared and transported to the polling booths across Greater Hyderabad region for the staff involved in the election duty.However, on Monday, officials at City College in the old city protested citing poor facilities at the polling centre. In Rajendranagar too, polling staff raised slogans against the Presiding Officer for lack of drinking water facility and delayed supply of meals. There were many diabetics among the staff who came to perform the election duty. We were told during the training camp that the food will be supplied at 11 a.m. but we did not get it till 2 p.m., said one of the protesting election workers.The GHMC officials said that adequate arrangements have been already made and any complaints in this regard will be take care of.Right from drinking water to two meals, we have taken care of the basic facilities. Even toilets are there in most booths. If there are any polling stations with no toilets, then we have instructed the officials to talk to one of the house owners in the neighbourhood to let the officials use the toilets, said Surender Mohan, Additional Commissioner, GHMC."

C. Deveshwar said.Talking to reporters after unveiling three green field projects, Mr. Deveshwar said the plan could be taken forward if the company had more land at its integrated consumer goods manufacturing facility in Uluberia in Howrah District.While we are exporting shrimps now, we could become a branded player in the frozen shrimp market, taking West Bengal shrimps all over India, he said.We are targeting a Rs.one-lakh crore turnover from new-FMCG business. We need to enter new categories.. it cannot be done only through the existing business, Mr. Deveshwar said.ITC has set this target for 2025-30, planning to emerge as the top FMCG company. ITCs non-cigarette business now stands at over Rs. 20,000 crore.Earlier, he urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for some additional land (around 40 acre) for setting up a cold chain and frozen food facilities at Uluberia where it will commission by May 2016 a four-lakh square feet facility for making atta (wheat flour), biscuits and snacks.He said industrial land was lying unutilised close by.We could scale up tomorrow.. planning a frozen food or a fruit juice line, Mr. Deveshwar said.Ms. Banerjee also laid the foundation stone for a larger unit for making noodles and potato chips.The two initiatives would entail Rs.3,000 crore investment, Mr. Deveshwar said. While pointing out that ITC was experimenting with cultivation of a moisture-resistant wheat strain for West Bengal, its home state, he said the company had taken a leap of faith.He also said the state government could show case these projects for attracting investors.ITCs non-cigarette business now stands at over Rs. 20,000 crore."

The Gandhi Market, established in 1940, has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about six acres of land, attracting thousands of traders and consumers every day. The market caters not only to the city but also to retail traders from several small and big towns in the neighbouring districts.The construction of a central market was announced in July 2014 by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, when she represented the Srirangam constituency. The new market is coming up on 10 acres of land at Kallikudi, off the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, about 15 km from here.Officials say the market would have all modern infrastructure with 1,000 shops, a cold storage of 2,000 tonne capacity, sorting and grading yards and wide internal roads to facilitate easy movement of trucks and loading and unloading facility. Although representatives of traders associations say they did not mind relocating, they wanted the entire market shifted as a whole.A meeting of various traders associations held on Friday, with Ve. Govindarajalu, State treasurer, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu in the chair, decided to go on a 24-hour strike from 10 p.m. on February 11 to 10 p.m. on February 12 essentially to bring to the notice of the government the concerns of the traders.Although we are not opposed to shifting, we want the market to be shifted entirely. Besides, the shops that are being built at Kallikudi are too small and in multiple floors. The government should have consulted the traders, Mr.Govindarajalu said. Echoing his views, A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association, said onion and potato commission mandi traders required shops of 1,000 to 2,000 square feet area on the ground floor. Traders would face difficulty in lifting loads to the upper floors.U.S. Karuppiah of the Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Permanent and Platform Traders Association said there was no information on who would be allotted shops at the new market and whether the market would be shifted entirely.However, one of the platform traders association has decided not to participate in the strike. A few other associations are also yet to decide.Onion and potato traders need shops of 1,000 to 2,000 sq ft. area and will face difficulty in shifting consignments to upper floors.Thangaraj A.,General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association"
58f8de95a3d24b0b70c3b150,Winter harvest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/winter-harvest/article8236293.ece,2016-02-14,,The Hindu,"Grant Roads Bhaji galli will be endlessly fascinating for anyone even slightly interested in food. It is also a reminder that the traditional Indian diet is seasonal, local, minimal in its environmental impact and above all, striking in its immense variety. When I went there on a cool morning, little hillocks of pearly ponkh were being stacked at my feet. Big jute sacks, plump with onions, were being emptied onto raised platforms. Sweet-fleshed yams were being rolled onto colourful plastic crates. Cardboard boxes were being prised open to reveal ruby-hued strawberries and tangy star fruit.Bhaji galli has a fairly old pedigree, originally named for Jagannath Shankarsheth (Jagannath Lane). Its colloquial appellation comes from the vegetable vendors from Vasai who used to unload fresh vegetables that they got from Vasais weekly market, in the compound of the nearby Balchandra building. The number of vendors then slowly swelled, until the entire lane was overwhelmed by a flood of fruit and vegetable sellers.Today, the lane hums with a steady stream of Mumbaikars, some from as far away as Powai and Borivali. Bhaji galli is dotted with vendors on both sides, many specialising in certain kinds of produce: root veggies, kanda batata, fruits, or foreign vegetables. I am drawn to a stall selling a bewildering array of wintry tubers and greens for undhiyu: green Surti papdi, baby eggplants, purple kand, sweet and regular potato, seedless (ariya) kakdi, Rajagiri bananas and fenugreek. The lady next to me is buying up several packets of these. I come from Borivali once a month to Bhaji galli, she explains as I gawk at the quantity of vegetables she is buying. I have to buy enough undhiyu samaan to last my family that long. But why come all the way here, I persist? She gave me a long, cold look and then she smiled gently. She spoke in a soft voice, as if to an insane person. Bhaji galli has the best quality vegetables, she said, enunciating each word.I slink away to the next vendor, who has heaped posies of mogri or rat-tail radish pods, both green and purple. Oddly, for someone who isnt too fond of radish, I cant get enough of mogri, which I mostly eat raw. But this time, I stir fry them lightly at home with some chopped garlic and salt. They are still delicious, but seem to have lost their sharp flavour and their glorious crunch, having turned a bit fibrous.I move down the lane to Chachas stall, one frequented by my mum for years. We have never been able to find out his real name, You call me chacha only. But we do know that he sometimes keeps amba haldi (mango ginger), another winter favourite. Amba haldi looks almost exactly like regular ginger, tastes a little like green mango with an acerbic aftertaste, but is an obscure relative of the turmeric family. The mango ginger is ripe for pickling with just a little salt water and lime juice and is eaten with every meal to ward off winter infections. But you could also lace your curry with a few slivers, to give it a sour-sharp tang. Its widely used to perk up South Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes.A little further into the lane, I spot an enormous heap of fresh, leafy vegetables in every possible shade of green. Behind the pile presides a dignified old lady.There is sarson or mustard greens, the main ingredient in the hearty Punjabi winter staple, sarson da saag. There are bunches of spinach and bathua, both of which make first-rate pakodas; I find bathuas bitterness too acrid to consume except when shrouded by a shell of deep-fried dough. But in Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pants Classic Cooking of Punjab , bathua sits comfortably with sarson, spinach and moolipatta (radish leaf) in the aforementioned sarson da saag. This time, I will try and stuff it into a paratha. I also buy the dill, parsley, tender green garlic, pudina and spring onions, ready to be transformed into osh, the warming, nutritious stew that is much loved by Iranians. The lady also has baby methi and gongura; the latter I am going to try and cook with shrimp, Andhra-style.While the lady is rootling around in her tin box for change, I spot a vendor surrounded by a swathe of carrots, both the orange English carrots and the red-hued Indian carrots. The red carrots are more intensely-flavoured and carrotier than their compatriots. I will add them to green peas for a delicious gajar matar sabzi and if some are left over, I will try to cadge the century-old recipe of vegetable achaar from my Punjabi friend. Into her pickle go gobi, shalgam, gajar tempered with salt, chilli, mustard seeds and oil with a little jaggery. It is a delectable winter tradition.A market is an excellent way to get under the skin of a place, and Bhaji galli is a true reflection of Mumbai. The soft drink crates and plastic trays overflowing with international produce reflect the citys growing omnivorousness. Here, a tray heaving with snowy daikon radish. There, a crowd of avocados balanced precariously on a rickety wooden stand. Naturally, the radish and avocados make their way into my shopping bag.What else do I bring home? A perfectly spherical white gourd, which I will stuff with mincemeat as soon as I finish writing this story. Little fronds of fennel which I happily eat raw in salads, but also braised and served on a bed of white fish. Postbox-red chillies. Tart gooseberries or amla. (Amla juice is the elixir I should absorb but amla murabba is what I will actually eat, with stacks of thepla). And finally, green gram, nestled within their pods (a proper pain to shell). Fried or roasted with a light sprinkle of salt and chilli together with a squeeze of lime, they make for the most satisfying winter evening snack.The author is a freelance writer and editor"

The accused, 45-year-old Dhan Kumar Gurung, was arrested in Gurgaon, where he works with a hospital.A native of Darjeeling, the deceased had reportedly abandoned her husband and children a few years ago to live with the accused, who too had left his family.The womans body was found stuffed inside a plastic sack in Central Delhis Daryaganj area on February 5. She was strangled with a dupatta and her feet were tied with a string.The sack, meanwhile, was filled with potatoes and radish in an attempt to fool people.Parmaditya, DCP (Central), said that the womans facial features suggested she hailed from north-east India. The sack in which her body was found bore the words Kalash Tiptur Copra, which led the police to Mithai Pul area in Lahori Gate  where these sacks are sold. Police then visited all guest houses and hotels in the area to check if the woman had checked in at any of them.We narrowed down to one dharamshala where this woman was believed to have stayed. The vital clues, however, came from the post-mortem room, the DCP said.The doctors who found the SIM card handed it over to the police, who were then able to identify the woman and the killer.The problem allegedly began a few months ago when Gurung doubted her of being involved with other men. He suspected that she had more SIM cards, which she would use to talk to other men, the DCP said.Recently, the woman had expressed her desire to visit her native home in Darjeeling. Police quoted the suspect as saying that he had insisted on accompanying her, which the woman did not agree to.The accused then followed her to the dharamshala at Lahori Gate on February 3. An argument ensued between the couple, which ended with Gurung allegedly strangling her. After this, he reportedly bought a sack and some vegetables, stuffed her body inside and sealed it. Later, he took the sack to Daryanganj with help from an unsuspecting rickshaw puller."

It depends heavily on West Bengal to meet its requirement. When the scarcity was acute a few years ago, the State government had announced a potato mission for increasing production of tuber. However, the mission failed to yield desired results.According to the Ministers, the area of potato cultivation has been increased from 15,805 hectare to 25,270 hectare under the mission. Due to rise in temperature and fewer cold days, the potato cultivation was hit, the Ministers said.The Ministers, however, said potato scarcity was felt all over the country. While per kg price in Kolkata is Rs.14, it is Rs.20 in Chennai, Mumbai (Rs.19), New Delhi (Rs.14), Bhubaneswar (Rs.16) and Sambalpur (Rs.16), they said.In view of rising potato prices, the government on Monday declared to make enforcement activities stricter in order to ensure stability and take stringent action against hoarders. Collectors have been asked to take action against unscrupulous traders."

PHOTOS: A. MURALITHARANmajority of traders of Gandhi Market downed their shutters on Friday to draw the attention of the government to their concerns over a possible move to shift them to the new Central Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers, coming up at Kallikudi on the outskirts of the city.The 24-hour strike commenced at 10 p.m. on Thursday in response to a call given many traders associations. While most shops, including wholesale and retail ones dealing in onion, potato, and vegetables, remained closed, some retailers were seen functioning. A few associations such as the platform traders and fruit sellers had announced that they were not participating in the strike.Although there was no indication from any of the government agencies on the possibility of shifting the traders to the new market, the traders organisations had expressed apprehensions that they may be asked to do so.The traders contended that the new market at Kallikudi did not have adequate number of shops to accommodate all traders operating out of Gandhi Market now. Besides, the shops built at the new market were small in size and would not meet the requirement of wholesale and retail traders, they contended.The strike comes in the context of a long-pending proposal of the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation to shift the market to the outskirts of the city. The Gandhi Market, established in 1940, has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about six acres of land. The new central market is coming up on 10 acres of land at Kallikudi, off the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, about 15 km from here.In a statement here, Ve.

There were over 2,500 shops in the Gandhi Market, he said and affirmed that all could not be accommodated at the new market.Besides, the shops at the new market were located on three floors and unsuitable for traders. The shops, he said, were just 10x10 feet in size. Wholesale traders would require shops of a minimum size of 1,000 square feet and retailers about 500 sq. ft. of space.Many retailers were women and they would face difficulty in operating from the city outskirts. Besides, it would entail higher transportation costs, he contended. Instead of shifting the market, Mr. Govindarajalu said the Gandhi Market could be expanded if the Womens Prison, adjacent to the market, was shifted to some other place.NOT AN EASY TASKTraders associations want all the shops to be shifted to the new placeA majority of retail traders, particularly women, may find it difficult to travel to KallikudiWholesale traders say the shops built in the new complex are too small for them"

They also created in us an interest for farming, which is a refreshing change for us, said Sub Inspector Cleetus K. Joseph. We had earlier successfully cultivated plantain and it gave us the confidence to develop the vegetable farm, said Devasia, civil police officer.

Mr. Kumars two-day meeting with senior police officials ended on Friday with many decisions to nab criminals and control crime in the State.A few gangs busted by the Bihar police in the past few days have interesting names. The Bournvita Gang of young criminals who robbed two-wheelers and snatched gold chains in Patna, for instance, gave them sleepless nights.Most of the gang members, the police said, are school students who took to criminal activities to buy expensive gifts for their girlfriends.In April 2014, members of the Mines Gang were arrested for using advertising campaigns on social network sites to cajole people to join them, and terrorise those who refused.Asked by the Patna police why the gang, led by one Bittu Kumar, called itself the Mines Gang, Kumar said he did not know  he just fancied the name.In 2013, members of the Rockezers Gang, the Blade Gang and the Talwar (sword) Gang too were arrested by the Patna police for their involvement in petty crimes. The members of the Talwar Gang were from the upper caste and had number plates resembling two crossed swords on their two-wheelers.Some of the criminals either arrested by the police or evading arrest too have amusing names. Horlicks Yadav, Dahi (curd) Gope, Lotha Gope, Bindu (dot) Singh, Chawannia (25-paisa coin) and Pakauria (snacks) have been troubling the police for quite some time now. Some criminals like Rinku Halwai, Vicky Paswan and Kallu Dom carry their caste names to identify themselves.The modus operandi adopted by criminals is equally bizarre. On Thursday, a woman was caught while passing marijuana-stuffed litti (a popular snack) to her husband in Patnas Beur central jail. Litti (usually stuffed with gram flour) and Chokha (mashed potato) are among Bihars favourite food. Meena Devi had come to hand over marijuana-stuffed littis to Ramchandra Paswan. She has been arrested and sent to the same jail.On February 5, the Katihar jail authorities recovered two mobile phone SIM cards from the rectum of an inmate, Arnab Das.On an average, eight murders and three rapes take place every day in Bihar. According to police records, 19,6407 criminals and accused persons were arrested and 22,461 theft cases reported in 2015.Horlicks Yadav, Bournvita Gang and Dahi Gope havebeen giving police sleepless nights"

Police then visited all guest houses and hotels in the area to check if the woman had checked in at any of them.We narrowed down to one dharamshala where this woman was believed to have stayed. The vital clues, however, came from the post-mortem room, the DCP said.The doctors who found the SIM card handed it over to the police, who were then able to identify the woman and the killer.The problem allegedly began a few months ago when Gurung doubted her of being involved with other men. He suspected that she had more SIM cards, which she would use to talk to other men, the DCP said.Recently, the woman had expressed her desire to visit her native home in Darjeeling. Police quoted the suspect as saying that he had insisted on accompanying her, which the woman did not agree to.The accused then followed her to the dharamshala at Lahori Gate on February 3. An argument ensued between the couple, which ended with Gurung allegedly strangling her. After this, he reportedly bought a sack and some vegetables, stuffed her body inside and sealed it. Later, he took the sack to Daryanganj with help from an unsuspecting rickshaw puller."

C. Jamir addressing the House. The Opposition Congress and BJP are likely to raise the issues of their choice soon after the Governors address is over, and particularly after the budget for 2016-17 is presented on March 18.The BJD, however, is all set to take recourse to blaming the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre over decrease in Central assistance to several schemes.Blaming the Centre in order to hide its deficiencies and failures has been a practice with the ruling BJD since it assumed power in 2000. It has become further convenient for the regional party since it severed ties with the BJP and ceased to be a member of the NDA in 2009."

The traders fear if the protests continue, it is bound to hit supplies to the Capital. The availability of even milk is likely to be hit with some parts of the city already facing such shortages.Sunday was a calm day at the mandis in the city as they remain shut and supplies were not hit until Saturday as well. But what lies ahead is quite uncertain as traders claim the impact would be visible from Monday onwards. We hope the roads are opened by tomorrow as trucks begin to reach the mandis early morning. Unfortunately, majority of these supplies come from Haryana side, so if the protests do not ease, then problems would begin, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur Agricultural Marketing Produce Committee (APMC).Having hardly any produce of its own, Delhi largely gets fruits and vegetables from other States like Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.The problem being that except from UP, trucks bringing in supplies of essential commodities from other States come to Delhi via Haryana (NH 1, NH 8 and NH 10) which are being blocked by the protestors. Denying reports that wholesale prices of some vegetables have already increased, Mr. Sharma added, So far, there has been no hike in cost of any fruit or vegetable. The rumours are a bid by retailers to cash in on the Jat protests.According to traders at the Azadpur Mandi, the largest fruit and vegetable market in Asia, the items which may take a hit if the roads are not opened include potatoes, cauliflowers, onions, grapes, apples, spinach and so on. The transporters who are aware of the protests are now avoiding going via Haryana and are now taking an alternate route via Baghpat in Western Uttar Pradesh, said the trader.Milk supplies also hitAreas like Rohini and Pitampura faced shortage of milk supplies on Sunday. One of the largest milk suppliers in Delhi, Mother Dairy Fruit and Vegetable Private Limited, also said that it has begun to face problems because of the crisis.Sandeep Ghosh, Business Head  Milk section of Mother Dairy said, We are currently experiencing some consumer supply disruptions in select pockets of Delhi. However, we are taking all corrective measures to ensure that the consumer supplies are normalised by evening today.While in terms of raw milk movement, we are assessing the situation to address any such supply challenges to the incoming milk to our plants, he added. Operations at Amul's milk plant in Rohtak remained suspended. It has a capacity of 5 lakh litres per day.

I asked him why he didnt eat it, my friend Sudeshna Shome Ghosh wrote. His response was, How could I? I didnt know what it was. My friend rolled her eyes (you can now do that thanks to an updated emoticon app), I LOLd and that was the end of it.The conversation brought back dabba memories, of going to school and opening my stainless steel lunch box in the afternoon, hours after it was packed, wondering about its contents. With the mother being a fabulous cook, the dabba was usually crammed with theplas folded in half with a dibbi of mango pickle, jeera rice with caramelized onion and curd, or rotis that miraculously stayed soft so that they could be torn with two fingers and eaten with sabji . There was lunchbox envy, where I coveted my classmates tiffins because they brought food that wasnt familiar to me. I yearned for cucumber sandwiches, after re-reading Enid Blyton books, even though the white bread would be curling up at the edges by afternoon. I even wanted the dabba that held cold, clammy Maggi noodles, something that I now wouldnt touch with a barge pole. But at that time, it was as exciting as moringa leaves are now to chefs.Now there are plenty of cookery books, blogs and Instagram accounts with innovative lunch box ideas, all just a Google search away. Blogger and nutritionist Nandita Iyer, better known as Saffron Trail online, has simple, healthy ideas, which include vegetable peanut noodles, pita pocket pizza sandwiches, and puliyogare or tamarind rice. Lulu Loves Bombay blogs about travel, her children, and food. Her sweet potato discs sound like a lovely addition to the dabba , as do her methi thepla and mango chunda. Sanjeeta KKs blog, Lite Bite, has a Lunchbox Bites section with some handy tips and recipes such as for muthiyas and wholegrain chillas.On Instagram, Lunch Box Dad, Beau Coffrans mealtime hacks include rocket ships from bread and cheese, and Spider-Man lunches with berries; while bleary-eyed parents may not be keen to wake up and make food art, its a fun account to follow. Grace Halls Eats Amazing blog focuses on Bento-style lunches for her son and follows themes such as Halloween, rainbows, and gardens. Her #PackedLunchLove Project has creative boxes that, she promises, take just a few minutes to prepare and are a visual feast. A few years ago, graphic designer and illustrator David Laferrieres innovative sandwich bag art went viral. Hes made over 1,800 sandwich bag drawings with monsters and kites.And when in doubt, return to the library.Apart from the usual cluster of recipe books, check out Karen Le Billons French Kids Eat Everything , a charming account of a family, with two picky-eater children, that moves from the USA to France and discovers how the French government and the school system strengthen food education. Then theres Chris Butterworths Lunchbox: The Story of Your Food , illustrated by Lucia Gaggiotti. A picture book, it takes young readers on a journey from farm to fork, getting them to think: where did the food in my lunchbox come from? Its a lovely way of engaging children with farmers who grow our food and get them curious about what they are eating.Mommy Go Lightly, a.k.a. journalist and author Lalita Iyer, writes lovingly about dabbas on her blog, Food is intuitive, she writes about packing her son Res lunch box. At least thats how it should be. Try different things and figure out what works for your child. My tip is, make it visually exciting. Make it look good. All you need is colours. Pretty much all my mommy and daddy friends gave me tips like that when I talked to them about the art of dabba packing: fruits and dry fruits in small Tupperware boxes to snack on in the bus; use leftovers innovatively.Shinibali Mitra Saigal, who packs food for her nine-year-old daughter said, Mine doesnt like anything soggy, squidgy or leaky. My daughter claims that thanks to me, she had to eat pickled strawberries, which taste vile. When I asked her what she meant, she added, According to her, the pickle in an airtight container leaked and ran into the strawberry in a different compartment. So that makes it pickled strawberry and an excuse not to finish her lunch box.Ghosh wakes up ten minutes earlier in the morning to make extra sandwiches for her sons friends. According to my son, none of them want to share the fruits I pack, she said, with a sigh. But hes telling me that, and well, he hates fruits. SoLooking back, we can appreciate that one person who woke up at the crack of dawn to toil away in the kitchen to prepare fresh lunchboxes for the family. I regret the dabbas that I brought back home uneaten, even the alu methi, which really doesnt do itself any favours when cold. Okay, maybe not the alu methi.The author writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru."

A resident of Jattari in Aligarh, Prasad found that his mustard crop, spread over six bighas, was completely destroyed due to heavy rain and hailstones over the weekend. According to his son Rajveer, Prasad died on Monday evening after complaining of chest pain.He suffered a huge blow after seeing that the mustard crop had been almost completely destroyed, Rajveer told The Hindu. Prasad was not the only casualty of the untimely rain and hailstones. Two more farmers reportedly died in Agra due to the distress caused by destruction of crops. About 30-40 per cent of the crops have been destroyed by the sudden change in weatherOfficials told The Hindu that farmers were badly affected by the large-scale damage to crops. In Aligarh district, wheat, potato and other rabi crops were badly affected. There is no district in western Uttar Pradesh which has not seen crop damage.Though the agriculture department has begun surveying the losses incurred, unofficial estimates put the figure at 25-30 per cent.From the information we collected from the ground, production of wheat in Meerut division may go down by 15 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of crop damage in Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Agra and Aligarh division is about 20-25 per cent. The crop damage may go up further if it rains in the next few days, said Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch.Mr. Jaula said the problem was multi-fold for farmers. First of all, a large number of farmers have not enrolled for the crop insurance scheme. The other problem is that a farmer will get insurance benefit only if the crop damage is at least 33 per cent, which complicates the situation especially for small farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for survival, added Mr. Jaula."

Since, I wont be able to store such quantity or entirely use it, I plan to distribute it among neighbours, said Shanti, a resident of Ameerpet.If inflation or shortage of vegetables and pulses are a matter of concern, then so is the excessive production of the essential consumables which has hit the city markets. At various Rythu Bazars and wholesale markets, some vegetable varieties are abundantly available and sold at dirt-cheap price or worse, being dumped by the farmers themselves. We have fixed a price for onions since we want the farmers to earn some profit, said P. Ramesh, Estate officer of a Rythu Bazar in the city.Less than a year after it had overshot the Rs 100 per kg mark, onions are available for as low as Rs. 4 per kg. The average price of the onion at this time of the year is usually Rs. 20 per kg.The government has taken the initiative and asked the farmers to sell onions for Rs. 12 per kg.

In the absence of purchasers for truckloads of these perishable commodities arriving at the citys mandis, there is now an abundance of stock in the Capital as compared to the usual demand.Traders at Azadpur mandi, Asias largest wholesale fruit and vegetable market, were earlier fearful that the ongoing protests by the Jat community would lead to low supply of items as major highways from Haryana were blocked. But the reverse of what was expected happened on Monday as large quantities of supplies that arrived at the mandi remained unsold.We had buyers only from Delhi and the UP side today. A major chunk of purchasers who come from the Haryana side, from areas like Sonipat, Panipat and Bhiwadi, have given the mandis a miss due to the ongoing protests, said Mahender Sanpal, president of the APMC.Traders from various cities falling within 100-200 kilometers of Delhi come to the Azadpur mandi for large-scale stocks. It is because of this that prices of fruits and vegetables are likely to fall in Delhi, while the rates may go up in Chandigarh, Rohtak, and other parts of Haryana. In Chandigarh, wholesale prices of potatoes have increased from Rs. 5 per kg to about Rs. 20, Mr. Sanpal explained. In Delhi, wholesale prices of garlic have fallen from Rs. 80 to Rs. 60. A truck of green chillies, which is usually sold for Rs. 5 lakh was sold for only Rs. 50,000. Most of the items have rotten, so they are being sold at throw away prices, added Mr Sanpal.Speaking about supplies to the mandis, APMC member Rajender Sharma said that only trucks coming directly from Haryana were hit. Only 5-10 per cent of the supplies have been affected as trucks from Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir were unable to enter Delhi, Mr. Sharma said. Several trucks managed to come to the Capital from that side despite the protests as transporters diverted the route to western UP. Another trader informed that around 500 trucks were stuck at various points including the Kundli border, Panipat and Sonipat.Several trucks managed to come to the Capitalas transporters diverted the route"

Photo: International Potato CentreDo Perus potatoes have the right stuff?Thats the question scientists will be asking in Lima next month, when a selection of tubers will begin undergoing tests to determine whether theyre fit to grow on Mars.NASA, the U.S. space agency, is conducting the pioneering experiment together with Limas International Potato Center (CIP).They will cultivate a hundred selected varieties already subjected to rigorous evaluation in extreme, Mars-like conditions that could eventually pave the way to building a dome on the Red Planet for farming the vegetable.The selection was made from a total of 4,500 varieties registered at CIP, a non-profit research facility that aims to reduce poverty and achieve food security.Of the selected candidates, 40 are native to the Andes Mountains, conditioned to grow in different ecological zones, withstand sudden climate changes and reproduce in rocky, arid terrain.The other 60 are genetically modified varieties able to survive with little water and salt. They are also immune to viruses.Those that pass the tests must meet a final criterion  they must be able not only to grow well on Mars but also reproduce in large quantities. Were almost 100 per cent certain that many of the selected potatoes will past the tests, said Julio Valdivia Silva, a Peruvian NASA astrobiologist who is taking part in the ambitious project.The scientists hope the experiment will also help address the earthly scourges of hunger and malnutrition by identifying varieties suited to growing in harsh conditions.We must be prepared for the future, said virologist Jan Kreuze, a scientist at CIP. To respond to desertification, rising temperature and high salt content in the soil.Vegetable of the futureThe soil in La Joya Pampas  a sector of the Atacama Desert in southern Peru thats considered one of the driest places on earth  is very similar to that found on the Red Planet.The scientists plan to transport 200 pounds (100 kilos) of it to a CIP laboratory in Lima that will simulate the complex Martian atmosphere which contains mostly carbon dioxide  and expose it to extreme ultraviolet radiation.Well have more concrete results in one or two years, Mr. Valdivia said, adding that it will take more than five years to launch an unmanned mission to Mars.The potential future space crop is also one of the oldest.Records of potato cultivation date back to 2500 BC, when the indigenous Aymara Indians farmed it in modern-day Peru and Bolivia.If the varieties selected for next months experiment dont adapt to the desert soil, the researchers will introduce nutrients and subject them to radiation.If that doesnt work, Mr. Valdivia said, well administer a new method the CIP is using called aeroponics. The technique, used for cultivating plants without soil, would expose roots inside a sphere or cube that is sprayed with nutrients and contains a system for removing toxins. In future years, NASA plans to build a Mars research centre in the Peruvian desert.It would create a perfect replica of the Martian landscape and atmosphere for future research into space farming that could serve manned missions to Mars and other planets in the solar system.

Photo: University of BuffaloResearchers have developed a high-tech, food-tracking necklace that will alert you about the unique sounds that foods make as you bite, grind and swallow them.Each food as its chewed has its own unique sound and the device can help people suffering from diabetes, obesity, bowel disorders and other ailments by enabling them to better monitor their food intake and improve how they manage their conditions.There is no shortage of wearable devices that tell us how many calories we burn but creating a device that reliably measures caloric intake isnt so easy, said Wenyao Xu, assistant professor of computer science at University at Buffalo. Mr. Xu is creating a library that catalogues the unique sounds that foods make as we eat.The library is part of a software package that supports AutoDietary, a necklace being developed by Mr. Xu and researchers at Northeastern University in China.AutoDietary is like Fitbit and other wearable devices. Only instead of tracking burned calories, it monitors caloric intake  in other words, what we eat  at the neck. AutoDietary wraps around the back of the neck like a choker necklace.A tiny high-fidelity microphone  about the size of a zipper pull  records the sounds made during mastication and as the food is swallowed. That data is sent to a smartphone via Bluetooth where food types are recognised.The study, published in the IEEE Sensors Journal , describes how 12 participants ages 13 to 49 were given water and six types of food: apples, carrots, potato chips, cookies, peanuts and walnuts.AutoDietary was able to accurately identify the correct food and drink 85 per cent of the time. Mr. Xu plans future studies to build upon his library by testing different foods and recording the sounds they make.He also plans to refine the algorithms used to differentiate the foods to improve AutoDietarys ability to recognise whats being eaten.While promising, a wearable necklace that measures sound has limitations when used alone. For example, it cannot differentiate similar foods such as frosted corn flakes and regular corn flakes. It also cant distinguish the ingredients of complex foods such as soup or chilli.To address these limitations, Mr. Xu is planning a biomonitoring device which would complement AutoDietary. The device is under development but it would be activated once the necklace recognises that the user is eating a general category of food.  IANS"

A Google search revealed a range of podcasts for children: from science shows to plays to dramatised storytelling, theres a whole aural world out there.I couldnt help but wonder if podcasts would appeal to children who are constantly surrounded by screens, enveloped in a dense fog of audio-visual clutter. Getting a child to listen to a podcast would be as impossible a task as winning a round of Candy Crush Saga in the first go. But after tuning into some of the podcasts, I changed my mind. Okay, kind of.When it comes to podcasts for children, science seems to rule the roost. Theres Brain On! , which claims to be serious about being curious. Produced by MPR News and Southern California Public Radio, the science show for kids is hosted by Molly Bloom along with two children co-hosts. Topics bounce from what makes a spider a spider and the science of baking to the language of cats and dogs. There are songs, skits, and interviews with some really cool people. Whats really fun is the Mystery Sound section: try guessing the sound, its really hard.Then theres The Intersection , a show produced by Audiomatic, which is all about science, history, and culture. Journalists Padmaparna Ghosh and Samanth Subramanian set out to explain the complex gravitational waves, inform about ISROs indigenous navigation systems and trace mysteries such as the case of the stolen data and bird samples by the famous ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen. While the show is for adults, the science and history is something that young adults will enjoy listening to. It helps that both Subramanian and Ghosh talk in an easy, casual manner, blending facts with stories and interviews. As it is, science has a bad rep for being dry and boring, said Ghosh. But at the end of the day, everything is a story and the trick is in how you tell it: turning an invention into one persons quest or explaining deep space through sounds.Ghosh points out that children first come across stories when parents read it to them. Voice is a very intimate medium, especially if it is a voice you get to trust and even fall asleep to, she said. It is disembodied, yes, but friendly and warm. It can take us places. Voice leaves space for imagination, which I feel is very important for kids. It lets you travel to places and through time. Ghosh recommends a few podcasts as well: Stuff You Should Know, StarTalk Radio Show by Neil deGrasse Tyson and NPR Science Friday .If your child is obsessed with all things culinary, then Vikram Doctors The Real Food Podcast will whet their appetite about Indian food history, culture, and agriculture. For older children, The Secret Ingredient by Raj Patel, Tom Philpott and Rebecca McInroy chooses one food per episode to talk about its history, production, and impact on our lives. The topics are often serious and dense, and the format of the podcast is usually one-on-one interviews, so its definitely for much older children who are interested in agronomy and food history.While there are plenty of audio books to choose from, Story Pirates stands out for taking childrens stories and turning them into awesome radio plays. Story Pirates celebrate[s] the words, ideas and stories of young people. The group is comprises actors, comedians, improvisers and musicians who first narrate the original story written by the child, and then adapt it with music, dialogue, and lots of jokes. Story Pirates gives free rein to a childs imagination, bringing it to life with their words and music. One such story by a third grader is about two dino bank robbers who decide to well, rob a bank. The Coposauras give chase only to find out that the robbers stole the money for charity. Robin Hood dinos!For fans of TEDTalks, theres TEDTalks Kids + Family podcast, an audio version of the videos. Theres a lovely one by McKenna Pope, who at the age of 13, started an online petition for a gender-neutral toy oven. Why? Because her younger brother loved to cook but all of Hasbros Easy-Bake Ovens were for girls. She ended up meeting the American toy company who started a new, inclusive oven line. Her talk, Want to be an activist? Start with your Toys is powerful and evocative.One of my favourites is BBC 4s Natural Histories , a set of 25 beautifully narrated stories about 25 groups of animals and plants, which has been produced in collaboration with the Natural History Museum, London. Literature, movies, and legends come together with interviews and anecdotes to explore how nature had influenced human culture. Host Brett Westwood is introduced by saying that he has fewer chromosomes than a gorilla or a potato. In one episode, they dramatise an extract from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles The Lost World to introduce dinosaurs. In another, Westwood talks about Billy, a stranded Northern bottlenose whale in central London who was actually a girl! The episode includes the history of whaling, the book Moby Dick and what it reveals about human relationship with these sea creatures, and the need for conserving the species. Theres an entire episode on fleas, about these parasites that can leap stupendously, along with archival interviews with naturalist Miriam Rothschild, and discussions on the fleas reputation of being disease-carriers.Most podcasts have a lot of engagement with their audience, making sure that young minds dont tune out. In India we are used to radio only as a source of entertainment  songs  and not news or information, said Ghosh. Listening for stories is not something we are habituated to. On the other hand, radio is a great medium. It is passive, so you can easily multi-task while someone is reading you a story unlike, say, reading or watching a documentary. It can be creative and challenging too.Bijal Vachharajani writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru"

Ambedkar.The State government has decided to construct Dr. B.R. Ambedkar memorial on a sprawling 15-acre site in the new capital Amaravati. The memorial will consist of a park, convention centre, Buddhist meditation hall and a library besides a gallery encompassing the important events in the life of the architect of the Constitution. In addition, it was proposed to erect a 125-foot statue of Dr. Ambedkar as part of the memorial.Announcing this in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said the government decided to convert all the ST hostels into residential educational institutions during the current year and upgrade all social welfare hostels into residential schools in the next three years to enable the deprived sections get quality education. It was proposed to bring the management of tribal institutions under one umbrella for better quality management.He said the governments focus would be on improving the education and health standards of tribal people and dalits by upgrading the institutions run by the respective departments. In addition, it was proposed to focus on economic development activities of the tribal people with emphasis on products like organic coffee, geographical indication tag for turmeric and promotion of potato cultivation, organic cashew, vegetable cultivation and better marketing with value addition.Better branding and marketing of organic products through engagement of professional business consultants and skill development activities for at least one lakh members a year for ensuring gainful employment were among the measures. The government also relaxed the five-acre norm as eligibility criterion for economic support schemes like horticulture, NTR Jalasri, and other schemes.On the infrastructure development front, it was proposed to cover all the SC/ST habitations with CC internal roads, provision of safe drinking water under NTR sujala pathakam, construction of tribal museum at Visakhapatnam, electrification of all non-electrified habitations, provision of more LED lamps as well as waiver of power supply charges of up to 50 units a month and according priority to infrastructure development in all schools and educational institutions.Jagan picks holesThe main Opposition YSR Congress, however, dismissed the governments claims stating that the huge difference in the allocations made and actual amounts spent for the welfare of the SC/ST communities was an indicator to the hollowness of the assurances. Quoting from the statistics, Opposition leader Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy alleged that the government was unable to spend the funds earmarked for the SC/ST communities while it was diverting the funds granted by the Central government under the NREGA to other works.He alleged that the NREGA, which had 100 per cent wage component was, however, diluted subsequently as a result of which the material component was steadily rising.According to the governments own figures, over 1.7 crore people registered themselves under the NREGA, while the government had provided employment to little over 59 lakh people."

Restaurants are changing rapidly. Judging by current trends, in a decade, the whole posh restaurant experience, complete with the snooty matre d', starched tablecloths and fastidious multi-course menus, may be irrelevant. Expect them to be replaced by a whole range of new dining options, helmed by edgy experimental spaces that put a contemporary, and responsible, spin on tradition.Kickstarter is an interesting space to watch this unfold. Right now, the website, which describes itself as a global community built around creativity, has about 434 live food projects. Looking through them throws up a definite trend: people are increasingly interested in creating and funding food that is good for you and the planet.From Pittsburgh, Harvest Delivery is a sustainably-driven local food distribution company. From Las Vegas, Bootleg Botanicals encourages people to handcraft their own organic, gluten-free, non-GMO, vegan-friendly ginger beer. And then, theres the PieLab, which in true hipster style describes itself as a (and I quote) Neutral Place + A Slice of Pie = Conversation = Ideas + Design = Positive Change.In an attempt to get some clarity on the trend, I chase down Ben Reade, a cheerful young Scottish chef I met a couple of years ago at a Slow Food Asia Pacific conference in South Korea, where he spoke about insects as a food source for a sustainable future. Then, at 27, Ben was the head of culinary research and development at Nomas test kitchen, the Nordic Food Lab. This made him one of the culinary stars of the event, not just because trendy Copenhagen-based Noma had been ranked as the worlds best restaurant for three years running by then, but also because its chef, Rene Redzepi, was changing the way people looked at food world-over with his single-minded focus on local, often foraged, ingredients.I manage to catch Ben on a crackly FaceTime call before dinner service, and post farm visits at his new restaurant in Scotland. Well, I use the word restaurant loosely, because its hard to define Ben and his partner Sashana Souza Zanellas Edinburgh Food Studio in one word. He describes it as a cutting-edge environment where the arts, the sciences, and food collide. A creative space for collaboration, experiments, and learning, he says. It is a restaurant on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, where we host guest chefs and primary producers. We have them collaborate with poets, philosophers, and other creative people. For the rest of the week, they have classes, tastings and lessons in specialist areas.People are bored with just going out for dinner to a restaurant, where they pick what they want off a menu. Theres no personality, no real interaction. Today, people want stories, they want background, they want to support something bigger and wider. His views are supported by the enthusiasm their Kickstarter project, launched in September 2015, generated. We asked for 10,000 (British) pounds and got it in three days. We have become a kind of textbook example of crowd-funding, not because of the amount of money, but the speed with which we raised it. They ended up with 17,000 pounds. The restaurant opened for bookings in November, less than two months later.The studios focus is to discover and record the best of Scottish food. People associate Scotland with black pudding, haggis and deep-fried Mars bars, but we actually have an incredible dairy history, with amazing milk-based desserts. Ben adds with a chuckle, We have found scarlet elf cup mushrooms, which have such psychedelic colours that people often think they are going to start hallucinating when they eat them.He adds, Now that spring is coming, we see wild edibles like yarrow, baby nettles and bitter cresses. Our meat is wild. Last weekend, we served wood pigeon, Scottish rabbits and venison. We also try and use rare breeds of animals, like Shetland mutton, which comes from a great old breed of sheep.Ben started out as a dishwasher, before going to culinary school in Ireland, after which he cooked his way through England, Scotland, Italy and France. Interestingly, his moms cooking was heavily influenced by India. My parents were vegetarian, and they spent a lot of time living in ashrams, so there was quite a profound Indian connection. Some of my earliest memories are of sitting on the floor at home on Indian night, eating rice and dal. When Ben and Sashana decided to begin the Edinburgh Food Studio, they confess they had no definite plan. Sashana says they cherry-picked ideas from all across the world to create a space that was fluid, yet welcoming. The four-course dinners are a real-time creative response to seasonal ingredients, so there is no set menu. Its about opening peoples eyes to how much there is around us. So much more than stereotypical potatoes, haggis and turnips.The response, to their surprise, has been overwhelmingly positive, says Ben. We werent sure if people were ready. We thought it may be a bit too avant-garde. Then said, Lets push it in their faces, and if they dont like it, we will turn it into a cafe  and serve coffee and pastry, he chuckles. Fortunately, customers today are more open-minded than ever before  and they seem to love the drama.

The protagonist of the movie is an Indian chef who takes Paris by storm using Indian spices. It is Paulas culinary dream to master the dance of the spices and put several more Indian dishes and items on the menu of her restaurant.Second tripThis is her second trip to India and its a mix of holidaying and education. In a gastronomic brain-storming session with senior chef Brijesh Thakur of D V Manor in city, Paula learnt how to make puffed puris .Giving out a three-point formula for dishing out puffed puris , Mr. Thakur said the dough should be kneaded until it is very soft and it should be rolled in uniformly thick circles. Oil should be heated to accurate temperature and only then will the puris puff out. No thermometer is needed to check the heat of the oil. Just sprinkle a few drops of water in the oil, if it makes a spluttering noise the oil is ready for making puris , he chuckled.Mr. Thakur also shared with her the secret of dishing out a lip-smacking dum biryani and chilli paneer and besides the use raw papaya juice to tenderise mutton. She carefully watched him making paneer as this form or cheese is not available in Poland.New trendsSpeaking about new trends in the restaurant business across the world, Paula says that vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free dishes are in demand. Restaurants using fresh ingredients are doing well. Besides the taste, plating (arranging different components of the meal artistically on the plate) is very very important.Pierogi , a dumpling stuffed with vegetables and meats, is a popular Polish dish. There is no Polish dish without the use of potato. Pork, chicken, fish (Polish value sea food highly) are other ingredients. Beef is not used much because it is expensive. It is very difficult to get a Michelin star for a restaurant. There are only two restaurants in the entire country which have Michelin stars and both have only one star. Fusion restaurants serving food prepared with new and non-conventional combinations of ingredients are becoming popular, she says.Paula also spent an afternoon learning secrets of making good Punjabi food from Manmohan Singh and Arvinder, who have won several cooking competitions for couples."

The British food blogger turned author was there to promote the publication of her second book, Deliciously Ella Everyday , in the United States, and she had caught a cold on the flight across the Atlantic. Her hotel was close to a juice store, though normally she prefers putting ginger through her own juicer and adding a squeeze of lemon.Its sharp and tart, but effective, she said. Ms. Woodward is a food celebrity in Britain, where her first cookbook, Deliciously Ella , named after her website, has had record sales since early 2015. It helps that even while sick, she has the look of someone who just came in from a brisk walk outdoors, with glowing skin, rosy cheeks and hair that falls in waves.She is one of a group of fashionable young women in Britain who are making a career of promoting healthy eating, including Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, Amelia Freer, Anna Jones and Natasha Corrett. The Guardian has called them the queens of greens; The Telegraph named them the superfoodies. One could also think of them as the Daughters of Nigella, the logical successors to Nigella Lawson, the food personality known for her lush desserts, sensuous presentation and high-profile split from art dealer Charles Saatchi.Ms. Woodward grew up in London, the daughter of supermarket heiress Camilla Sainsbury and politician Shaun Woodward.She used to eat lots of junk food but turned to a plant-based diet after she was found to have postural tachycardia syndrome in 2011. At first I had a lot of brown rice pasta with vegetables mushed with tomato, she said, but then she learned to cook.Her sweet potato brownies made with sweet potatoes, ground almonds, buckwheat, dates, raw cacao, maple syrup and salt are both popular and controversial, with online reviews calling them, alternately, divine, horrible and you will be disappointed.Chef sistersJasmine and Melissa Hemsley, aged 36 and 30 respectively, grew up eating food that was influenced by our mum from the Philippines fused with Grannys cooking. Jasmine Hemsley, a former model, said We ate a lot of old-school soups and stews, in no way fancy and without romanticism.Were big on bone broth soups, cooked vegetables and natural fats that come with meats, Melissa Hemsley said. Their signature dish is cauliflower crust pizza with Parma ham, arugula and Parmesan shavings.Vegetarian cravings36-year-old Anna Jones became a vegetarian at 25. She has written a A Modern Way to Eat: 200+ Satisfying Vegetarian Recipes . Taking something away opened up this whole way of cooking that hadnt existed for me before, she said.I love my salad with kale and coconut and miso and roasted tomatoes, but most popular with my readers are the recipes that are the simplest, the twists on classics, like my veggie burger, she said.Celebrity dieticianAmelia Freer, 40, grew up in England near the Scottish border, and was formerly an assistant to the Prince of Wales. Coming from a small town to London, to have a shop where you could buy lattes, croissants, ready-made sandwiches, I was like Woo hoo and would buy breakfast on the way to work and my evening meal on the way home, she said.A doctor suggested she change her diet, and she eventually went to school for nutritional therapy and has since attracted a clientele of mostly actors and musicians, including Sam Smith, who credits her with his recent weight loss. Working with the prince taught me to be discreet and not be fazed by anyone, she said.Natash Corret, 32, had a father who owned Le Boudin Blanc, a French restaurant in London. His side of the family is a long line of restaurateurs where you try everything and food is delicious and feeds your soul, she said. My mother, on the other hand, has celiac disease and is also very allergic to dairy, so I knew about gluten-free cooking and nut milk long before it was fashionable.I cant just eat what I want, unfortunately; I yo-yo dieted my entire life, she said. It was hard to find a balance. The thing is, it was a blessing in disguise. When I found the alkaline way of eating, it changed my life, and I created a career trying to show how great it is. (Alkaline eating aims for a certain acidity or pH in foods: corn, dairy, meat and wheat are all frowned upon.)Im a sweet-tooth person, she said. My sticky toffee pudding is insane.

They can register their names by paying Rs. 10 per kilo in advance. The State government has announced a subsidy of Rs. 10 per kilo for potato seeds.B. Suma, Deputy Director of the department, asked farmers to register their names at the earliest. Depending upon the number, the department would make arrangements to procure certified seeds, which will be distributed on first-come-first-serve basis.Hassan has been known for potato cultivation for the past several decades. However, in the last few years, potato growers suffered huge losses owing to late blight disease that reduced the yield substantially. Farmers were then dependent on potato growers in Punjab, who send them treated table potatoes for cultivation. In the last few years, farmers have been demanding certified seeds so that they can claim compensation.Last year, on an experimental basis, the department procured certified seeds for 60 farmers. Studies showed that the crop using certified seeds did not attract late blight disease. A subsidy was announced this year as the cost of certified seeds is higher than non-certified ones."

Solemn little school children in prim grey uniforms, socks briskly pulled up to their knees. Village women, pivoting energetically, as they take turns singing verses of a rollicking welcome song. Men in shabby-genteel blazers, standing stiffly in the background, politely waving leafy branches, their faces wreathed in toothy smiles.Pryda village welcomes us with flutes, a gaudy, flower-decked satin banner and unexpectedly warm hugs. Set in the West Khasi hills of Meghalaya, this village is home to about 45 families. Its accessible only via a picturesque, but challenging, one-hour trek from the main road, through steep dirt tracks, snaking streams and rough steps hewn into the rock. We find our way there by following the sound of Prydas drummer womans beats, which echo from a distance through the quiet hills.We also have a guide: village matriarch Spermon Kharnaior. Shes not absolutely sure how old she is; a spirited discussion later at the village school house, over spicy pork curry, fragrant sauted mustard leaves and cups of sweet red tea, reaches a consensus when the group settles on the age of 75. To be honest, she looks older, with her frail frame, deep wrinkles and crimson mouth, stained by years of chewing betel nut. Till she begins to lithely scamper up the hills, telling stories in rapid Khasi as she leads the way. During the last, especially steep stretch, she extends a leathery hand and grabs my wrist, then impatiently hauls me up the path right into the centre of the celebration, which she joins with gusto, raising her hands and snapping her fingers.I was at Pryda because it was one of the host villages of Slow Foods Indigenous Terra Madre, which was held in Shillong last November. An event that was as unique as it was earnest, it brought together influential indigenous people from across the world. For five days, over 600 delegates representing 140 tribes from over 58 countries joined forces to discuss the way ahead.The consensus? The tribes, who have learnt to co-exist comfortably with their land, while holding on to tradition, have answers for us all, especially when it comes to food. In a world that is giddy with conflicting dietary and health advice, tribes from villages like Pryda are an invaluable resource, because they havent changed the way they essentially live  and eat  in generations. And more often than not, theyre getting it all right. We are welcomed into the village with a tray of boiled yam and sweet potato, served with salt and deadly green chillies: a clever, nutritious and unexpectedly delicious snack. After a long lunch, set out on sturdy wooden tables at the village school house, as we get ready to leave, they hand us a final snack: sohplang, a juicy, indigenous tuber, deftly wrapped in banana leaves, to eat on the way back. Its crisp, juicy and refreshing. A world away from the heavily processed granola bars, energy drinks and juice boxes that have become synonymous with an active lifestyle today.According to Slow Food, which works with the villages of the Northeast, this part of India is home to more than 250 indigenous groups, and is considered to be one of the most bio-culturally diverse areas in the world. Meghalaya is home to one of the first species of citric fruits, a type of orange that is found only in the Garo hills.I spend a delightful day at Shillongs Barabazar, known as Lewduh, a heaving, pulsating warren of cobbled paths crammed with bustling stalls. There are trays filled with wriggling eri worms, famous for the silk they produce. A friendly chef from the Khasi tribe, who I bump into at the market, tells me how theyre his favourite snack, simply deep-fried with a dusting of salt. We try a handful, and theyre less intimidating than expected: crunchy outside, spongy inside, with an almost familiar smoky barbeque flavour. If youre squirming right now, steel yourselves: insects are likely to be the food of the future, considering they are economical, easy to raise and packed with protein. Just another little tip from the tribes.In a world that is giddy with conflicting dietary advice, tribes from villages are an invaluable resource"

In fact, they speculate that the prices will continue to be on the rise in the coming weeks.In the last few weeks, the price of vegetables has been within normal ranges in Vellore.Production hitWith the mercury levels starting to soar, the production has been hit, leading to reduced supply to shops, according to vegetable traders.When compared to last week, the rates of many vegetables have increased by Rs. 5 to Rs. 20 now. The heat levels affect production of vegetables, resulting in drop in supply. Hence, the prices have shot up, said A.

Good quality cauliflower that is supplied from Bangalore cost Rs. 30 to Rs. 40. Very few shops sell these cauliflowers, Mr. Balu said.He added that the supply of beans, carrots and cabbage will also start to dwindle in the coming weeks as the production will be hit by the scorching sun.Tamil New YearWith Thursday being Tamil New Years Day, he said people will buy mango, brinjal, plantain and yam.

Pinning his hopes on the British sense of justice and fair play, he arrived in Calcutta to place his case before the then Governor General of India Lord Dalhousie. Stonewalled there, he made plans to appear before the Queen and the British Parliament. But that was not to be.Amid ongoing negotiations between his representatives and the Queen in London, the Sepoy Mutiny broke out in India. It not only dashed his hopes of retrieving Awadh, but also led to his house arrest in Fort William, as the British feared that he could become a rallying point for the rebels.Released from captivity after 26 months and given a purse of Rs. 12 lakh, Wajid Ali Shah set about creating a miniature Lucknow in Metiabruz, a locality in Kolkata.Palaces were built, gardens were laid and a regular court was set up as he brought an entourage.Centre of learningSome of the best poets and musicians of the time were attracted to Metiabruz as it became the centre of learned and talented men. Metiabruz would then often be referred to as Chhota Lucknow.The Nawabi ambience was complete with royal pastimes like wrestling, kite flying, cockfighting and fine dining. Gourmet delights such as potato biryani, sheermal, korma and shahi tukra , were prepared to perfection by the talented bawarchis (chefs) who accompanied the Nawab. The unique dishes of Metiabruz are being recreated at an event in the city this month.In a chat with The Hindu , Shahanshah Mirza, the great-great-grandson of the deposed Nawab said the dishes have now become part of the city.

After that a part of the family decided to go to Pakistan but my grandfather Ghazanfar Mirza decided to stay back."

Something truly magical.Lineker, now a BBC television presenter, also achieved fame or even notoriety for a series of adverts promoting one of the citys most famous products in Walkers Crisps (potato chips).

58fa6415a3d24b44f321ca6c,The storyteller within,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-storyteller-within/article8502076.ece,2016-04-21,,The Hindu,"o where were we? In the middle of a long conversation with actor Pankaj Tripathi, we suddenly lose the thread and have to go back to my notes to figure how we had begun. An exchange with Tripathi is like that, a free flowing, meandering, stream of consciousness. One thought leads to another and then yet another. No doubt Tripathi, soon to be seen as an eccentric school principal in Ashwiny Iyer Tiwaris Nil Battey Sannata , is a talented actor, but he is an even more accomplished raconteur.The actor himself admits to how he creates subplots within a plot so that the listener may not lose interest in his tales. This talent was exploited by the students union while he was studying in Patna in the 90s. As a member, he was assigned the task of bringing the crowd together and holding its interest. I used to tell jokes, keep the kids entertained till the leaders came and talked ideology and politics.Born to a farming family in the village of Belsand, near Gopalganj, Bihar, Tripathi studied there till the tenth standard. He remembers performing small roles in the amateur plays put up during the Chhath festival: This was the kind of theatre in which no one remembered their lines and the only job of the director was to prompt from behind the curtains.His father wanted him to become a doctor, but he never objected to Tripathis taking to acting either. However, the multi-talented son dabbled in a lot of things before settling down with theatre and films.He was a very good sportsman, participating in the 100 metres sprint and kho kho, and he was high jump champion at Magadh University in Patna.A right-wing students union member, Tripathi even spent seven days in jail in 93 for participating in a violent local agitation.Those days proved to be a crucial step in his march towards cinema. He spent a lot of time reading in the jail library, and got exposed to left-wing thinking and the literary works of giants like Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh. Art and culture mein vaampanth ka dabaav aur prabhav raha hai [art and culture have seen the influence and domination of the left wing].A show of Lakshmi Narayan Lals Andha Kuan and Pramita Jaiswals performance in it immensely moved him and got him hooked to theatre for life. Tripathi attended the performances in town with such regularity that the guy at the theatres cycle stand stopped charging him, as he was such a dedicated audience member. One of his own performances in amateur theatre found his name published in the newspaper. The reviewer spoke about apaar sambhavana [endless possibilities] in me as an actor, he recalls. It motivated him. Also, all the other things he was dabbling in couldnt hold his interest for long. He wasnt enjoying sports and the promise of a constables job through the sports quota didnt excite him. He didnt like the idea of embracing politics either: It forces you to bow in front of the leaders, turns you into a sycophant.He was compelled by his uncle to do a course in hotel management in Patna, where he worked night shifts as a trainee cook in a hotel. But I realised I was meant for something more than potatoes and onions. Nonetheless, Tripathi compares acting to cooking, both of which he excels at. With the latter, you have to be careful about the ingredients; how much salt and pepper you put in a dish; acting for him, is also a similar kind of a measure, of emotions: they should neither be too little nor too much. There is texture, colour and taste towards which you work when you are cooking a vegetable. Similarly, I work on a character, with his looks, his personality, his quirks.Tripathi also claims to bring in lifes experiences and draws from the works of his favourite authors, Phanishwar Nath Renu, Uday Prakash, Sanjeev. Every member of the crew on the film set has a button to push. An actor has none. For him, that button is his own experiences.It was in 2001, in his second attempt, that he cleared the entrance test for the National School of Drama in Delhi. But he looks back at those years with regret. Not for what was taught but at his own attitude as a student. It is a fantastic institute, but I was too laidback and not serious enough about it.After the training, he spent some time in Patna doing theatre, but soon realised he wouldnt be able to survive as an artiste. Hindi theatre hasnt developed commercially as well as Gujarati and Marathi theatres.So Tripathi decided to try his luck in films at the behest of a friend. October 16, 2004: he still remembers the day he landed up in Mumbai Central on the Golden Temple Express. Every actor remembers his first day in Mumbai though he may forget many other significant ones.For him, embracing Bollywood hasnt been about glamour but for livelihood and survival. He did a lot of television for the same reason: I never dreamt of becoming the hero, was not choosy about my roles, believed in doing whatever came my way. Even a Dilwale , Singham Returns or Gunday . But he has an explanation: when a big film releases in 5,000 screens simultaneously, you connect with people in a bigger way. I got messages from as far as Romania and Greece for Dilwale . He also strongly feels that it is because of the commercial contribution of a Dilwale or Bajirao Mastani that a small film like Masaan is also able to find its way to a theatre.The role of Sultan in Gangs of Wasseypur has been his passport to recognition and fame. It was unexpected. I used to wonder what unique thing I am doing, he says. But the role of the butcher and henchman of Ramadhir Singh got so popular that more butcher roles started coming his way. No one wants to experiment in the industry. I started getting tired of the gangster roles, he says. This is why he never wanted to play macho characters. There is a word in Bihari, mauga , which means the exact opposite of macho. I wanted to play that. I can even do a womans role with just the right amount of femininity. So Masaan helped in discovering the more sensitive element within. It led him on from the brutality of Sultan to the humane Sadhyaji who forms a unique, indefinable bond with Devi (Richa Chaddha).Tripathi is becoming more conscious of his choices of films now; there are audience expectations to live up to. What dictates the choice is the comfort and tuning with the director and the script. It is very difficult to make a bad film with a good script. You can hold a film for 30 seconds with your visuals but in the 31st, the story has to come into play.Coming up next is a diverse set of characters that an actor of his calibre deserves to play. Anarkali Aarawali has him play a dancer, another art form that he is very good at but hasnt quite put on display on screen. In Shankar Ramans Gurgaon , a story of a father-daughter, he plays the builder father. Then there is Mango Dreams , a tale of an auto driver (played by Tripathi) and a doctor who travel from Ahmedabad to Wagah; one is a Sikh, the other a Muslim; one a victim of the Partition, the other of the riots. The challenge here for him was to speak in English and that too for sync sound. In Amit Masurkars Newton , he plays an arrogant CRPF commandant. We had to match acting skills with 40 tribals who were natural in front of the camera, besides walking for hours in the jungle and staying in three small guest houses in Dalli Rajhara near Raipur.Ask him about his favourite role and he says that he wants to play straight and simple characters. Like Raghuvar Prasad in Srilal Shuklas book Deewar Mein Ek Khidkee Rehti Thi . Or like his 90-year-old father who walks six kilometres every day in the village, sleeps at seven and has no tensions and complexities in life. Things have become too grey and black. There are too many layers. I want to play a pure, simple soul for a change.There has been no return to theatre, though he did work once in a play for the money. He loves the immediacy of the audience response in theatre but cinema gives internal enjoyment to him as an actor. In theatre, you have to project your expression across to the viewer in the last row. In films, you reach your own truth as an actor. You just have to be there in the scene, in the moment, with your co-star, and just feel and react.It has been almost 12 years in Mumbai now, but his heart still belongs to his village. His house in Charkop in Andheri faces a huge pond and a temple, giving a sense of expanse and a rural feel in the middle of the urban jungle that is Mumbai. A place where he can sit for hours together engrossed in another quaint hobby of his: reading maps. Of Andheri, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India and the world.The role of Sultanin Gangs of Wasseypur has beenhis passport to recognition and fame"

Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."

Not a fan on buck fizz. The acidity of the citrus overpowers the sparkling wine flavour.Overall the dinner is a delight for a meat lover, especially if you are a fan of ham and turkey."

People have lost confidence in the central government and in the banking sector. Hence, we give the call of Modi hatao desh bachao to the people of India.She also claimed that several lakhs of skilled and unskilled Bengali labourers have been rendered jobless and forced to return home due to demonetisation.Diamond artisans from Midnapore, zari (embroidery) artisans from Murshidabad and construction labourers from Coochbehar and Hooghly have returned in lakhs from places such as Mumbai, Delhi and the south. Demonetisation was responsible for unemployment of so many people. We will send an unemployment list due to demonetisation to President Pranab Mukherjee soon, she said.Mamata Banerjee also claimed that demonetisation has brought back barter system on a massive scale throughout the state.When I was young and went to my village, I saw people exchanging rice for salt, fish for onions. Modis policies have brought that once again as over 700 gram panchayats in the state are not connected with the banking system, she said, adding that prices of potato, paddy, pulses and basic consumption needs will be skyrocketed as farming has been affected by demonetisation.For the real black money holders, Modi is like a god but for the remaining 94%, he has caused a nightmare, she said."

Skip the turkey,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/nov/26/thanksgiving-in-city-skip-the-turkey-1542623.html,2016-11-26,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: Dale Boone, an American competitive eater holding 52 world records celebrated Thanksgiving last year when he went back home to Atlanta. This year he was down with weather and skipped the party on Thursday and decided to host one on Saturday.A small get together with friends at home is something that he eagerly looks forward to.Residing in Bengaluru for the past ten years, the world food champion believes that Black Fridays have stolen the essence of traditional Thanksgiving in America.I talked to my family yesterday and the Thanksgiving meal was wound up early by about 2pm for the sake of Black Friday sale, Dale says. The Black Friday sale was offering the new iPhone7 for $99, which is about Rs 6000, he adds. His Thanksgiving last year was in a mall as well.One of the things missed in Bengaluru Thanksgiving is the turkey, though Dale did not miss it quite much since he used to pre-order a 3 kilo stuffed Turkey from a store in Indiranagar. The last time he ordered was two years back, this year the service was not available, he says.Camaron Vallepalli, who resides in Old Airport Road, has been celebrating Thanksgiving for the past ten years. Earlier it used to be a challenge to celebrate Thanksgiving in India because we wouldnt get the necessary ingredients and items required. But now the scenario has changed, food wise, we get everything we need and the tradition is kept true to its spirit, said Camaron who is from Connecticut.Though it is quite tricky to celebrate the occasions because Americans in India dont get a holiday, Cameron and her family of four members have been able to pull it off well with small get-togethers.This time she had prepared mashed potatoes, sweet potato casseroles, pumpkin pie and many others.I made the food I have grown up with in Thanksgiving, Camaron said. But instead of big Turkey we had Turkey salamis, she laughed.Brian Stock, who works in a startup and has been in the city for three-and-a-half-years has two Thanksgiving plans. The first one took place on Thursday night when about 35 people, mostly Americans, gathered at his house in Cooke Town for a grand Thanksgiving celebration. Chicken replaced the Turkeys but everything else was traditional. From food such as Corn Casseroles to stuffings to decorations. The other Thanksgiving that he will be attending to is on Saturday.But there is more than the second Thanksgiving the Americans are looking forward to. A day after the Thanksgiving, Christmas plannings set foot. We start listening to Christmas carols and start decorating from Friday, said Camaron.Thanksgiving is an annual holiday observed in the US on fourth Thursday in November and on Second Monday in Canada. Marked by family gatherings and celebrations, a traditional meal to commemorate a harvest festival is served."

This was the fifth straight month of WPI inflation after continued deflation for over a year.In first week of September, retail price inflation remained lower at 5.05 percent that had declined from 6.07 per cent in July, below the tolerance level of the government.Despite food inflation in both the indices showing signs of decline, both indices showed opposite trend. This was because the food index has lower weightage of over 14 percent in WPI against over 45 percent in CPI.This will bring a challenge for the new RBI Governor Urjit Patel for any monetary policy tweaking in October. However, the fact that WPI inflation is still 4 percent would give some comforts to the RBI in case it wants to cut the policy rate to spur economic growth.Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA said that the WPI will have a limited impact on RBIs repo rate cut decision but we expect at least one 25 basis points rate cut this year. A rate cut is more likely to happen in December rather than October, she added.According to global financial services major DBS, the softening trend in inflation leaves the door open for a rate cut in the fourth quarter of this calender year with odds of a move in October on the rise.A benign inflation path going forward and likelihood of a dovish policy committee leaves the door open for further easing but this needs to be balanced off with firmer demand dynamics and risks of US rate normalisation as the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting approaches, DBS said in a research note.Commenting on the inflation number, D S Rawat, secretary general of Assocham said,  prices of products which are of national interest has been continuously rising at industry level are pulses, potato, and fibres but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should check though prices of onions have been managed."

This is the slowest rate at which retail inflation has grown in 14 months, having grown at 4.39 per cent in September helped by small rises in food prices.Making calls for a rate cut shriller, wholesale inflation also slowed down significantly in October, only growing by 3.39 per cent.The easing in CPI data is in line with the RBIs forecast for an average of 5 percent inflation for this financial year.The CPI saw the biggest slowdown in the vegetables category, which continued in the negative zone at (-)5.74 per cent as against (-)7.21 percent in the previous month of September. Sugar and confectionery, however, became dearer by 23.62 per cent.Pulses inflation numbers come as a respite to consumers who have battled high costs, slowing down to 4.11 per cent against 14.33 per cent. However, eggs became more expensive by 9.4 per cent.The index for fuel and light segment stood at 2.81 per cent in October as against 3.07 per cent a month ago.Wholesale price inflation, meanwhile, slowed for the second consecutive month at 3.39 per cent, again pushed by a decline in vegetable prices, which till July had scaled a high of 28.45 per cent.Easing inflation has prompetd industry representatives to demand a further reduction in interest rates to support investor as well as consumer sentiment.An immediate 50 basis points cut in repo rate should be considered by RBI as well as some measures, which may be introduced to provide easy finance for sectors like housing, automobiles and consumer durables, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry President Harshavardhan Neotia said.As per data on the wholesale price index released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry, prices of pulses and potato ruled high this year. The annual inflation rate for potatoes stood at a whopping 60.58 percent, while that for pulses stood at 21.8 per cent. The index for manufactured articles stood at 2.67 per cent in October compared to 2.48 percent in the previous month."

The kitchen also pans a non-vegetarian version of the dish, with a chicken stuffing, which complimented the ensemble well.The kitchen borrows tools from the science laboratory to create an ensemble that exploits every ingredient as a hero on the plate.The fluffy crunch and chowy substance of Spanakopita - a spinach pie wins the appetizer spread. It is a spinach and feta cheese mixture folded in phyllo sheets and baked. The pie is presented well in shot glasses with sauces.Kolokithokeftedes, which are fried zucchini fritters taste of a feta cheese and red onion mix and serves as a good bar food.The chicken souvlaki, which was served with pita bread delivered a smoky flavour with Greek spices on a lemon-based marinate.With the main course, veg moussaka scores high presentation and flavour. The dish has the crunch of fried potato grills, spun in a ball that sits atop an oven baked composition of layers of eggplant, potatoes, zucchini, feta and briami. The baked stuffing is delicious and melts in the mouth exuding flavours of the eggplant and spices.A non-vegetarian version of the dish was served with a well cooked lamb.Chef Shendre also serves this refreshing blend of hibiscus scoured vodka with tea foam as part of his experimental cuisine. Each mouthful of the drink is a fresh mix of the soothing tea and the calming hibiscus abstract - two elements extracted through molecular gastronomy techniques.The Greek desserts at the eatery score a whopper with the chef presenting each element on the dish artistically.While Belgian chocolate and black pepper panna cotta, both deliver visually and please the sweet tooth, baklava with caramel foam and nougat definitely beats them all. This shiny presentation that lays the Greek pastry structurally, one top of another, complimented with honey and caramel froth can definitely be touted to earn fans in the city.The cocktail menu has a spread of mixes that compliments the chefs delights.Of the colourful sips served are Blue Hawaii, Litchi Martin, Blonde, Litchi Passion and Lick my peach.The curry-based vodka punch - Litchi passion, which is the bartenders special and Orange Blossom - orange bitters, peels and gin is a must-try if you visit Kipos.If you are someone who is tired of the usual and are looking for a spread that accentuates each flavour and element on the dish, this place is for you."

In November 2008, on one such road near Bhadutola, then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and Union ministers Jitin Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan narrowly escaped a Maoist ambush. This sparked police excesses, particularly in Chotopeliya village, which triggered the Lalgarh movement in which 700 lives were lost over the next three years.In 2011, top Maoist leader Kishenji was killed near another tarred road not far from Bhadutola. Theres been peace and some development in this forest region since then. But demonetisation has stalled all that for now.For workers building a 10 km road project near Bhadutola, November 9 was to be the weekly pay day. Narendra Modis announcement on Nov 8, demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, put paid to it. The contractors decided to keep their cash.Since then, the project has been running on credit. Labourers, JCB operators and truck drivers have not been paid any money since November 8.We were last paid 15 days ago, says Sudha Singh of Chaita village. Asked how they have been managing, Sudhas wife Ashalata pointed to a kirana shop. Its shutters were down. The kirana shop used to give us credit. However, even he has stopped giving now. Now, we ask the upper caste farmers for food on credit.Munna Mitra, the contractor, pleads helplessness. Im operating even the JCBs on credit. On Thursday morning, the workers rebelled against me seeking credit. If I dont get any money, how can I pay them?The solitary bank in Bhadutola, which serves 28 villages, is giving out only Rs 2,000 notes or tattered Rs 20 and Rs 50 notes. Who will give me vegetables if I hand him a Rs 2,000 note? And wholl take tattered Rs 20 and Rs 50 notes, grumbled Kartik Singh of Chaita village.Agriculture has come to a standstill in this part of Bengal. Not all farmers tilling their fields for potato have Kisan Credit Cards, which have been made mandatory for withdrawing Rs 25,000 per week as per the new rules introduced last Thursday. I am not able to buy fertiliser, said marginal farmer Soumendranath Khamrai, who does not have the card.A group of 30 Banjaras, a nomadic tribe, have camped near the tarred road near Bhadutola, making and selling plaster of Paris dolls. But sales have been poor and they are now contemplating shifting to another village. Our dolls cost Rs 60-Rs 80. We dont accept bigger notes. Our sales have dropped. We should move to a newer place. But its the same everywhere, right? sighs Manju Devi."

So, at the food fest in Crowne Plaza, I am introduced to a history and a cuisine.Master chef Asmic Raj is trying Vietnamese for the first time for their monthly Pan-Asian Festival, at their rooftop restaurant East. This fest will end on September 30.As a starter we are served Rice-paper Roll Chicken. The paper roll, which is exclusive to Vietnam, is imported for the festival and its stuffing  carrots, cucumbers, mint, basil and chicken chunks  taste garden fresh. Mint and basil feature predominantly in this cuisine. It is said that Vietnamese food is one of the healthiest in the world and, after having a sample, you wouldnt question why.The Hanoi corn cake, which is corn paste cooked in banana leaves, is named after the capital city of Vietnam. It is like how pani-puri is to us, says chef Asmic Raj, the most common street-side food.No Vietnamese meal is complete without their signature Pho (pronounced fuh). It, of course, has the country divided as North and South camps over which side makes the best Pho. This aromatic noodle soup was served in a standard white bowl and is full of green vegetables like broccoli and pak choi. The soup is low on salt but the spicy chilli hits you. Seven ingredients are served separately, -- burnt garlic, fried onions, lemon, basil, mint, chillies and coriander -- you can add them to your taste.Vietnam borders Gulf of Thailand, Pacific, South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin, so seafood is a given. We are served basa fish made with tamarind sauce and mango puree. Colourful, the dish tastes tangy and sour.Tofu (bean curd) fried rice, Yellow Chicken Curry and Asparagus with Tender Coconut are the main dishes. Tofu Fried Rice, which was made first to keep for the next day, soon gained wide popularity because of its rich taste. Garlic and onions are plenty, but spring onions are used sparingly. The Yellow Chicken Curry is a fine blend of coconut cream, sugar, curry powder and sweet potatoes.The best is kept for last, when the chef serves us Cassava Coconut Cake. A triangular slice of cake made out of tapioca and glazed with honey was a total winner."

Succha Dyal, a farmer from Gurdaspur said, CII Agro Tech 2016 provides a platform for farmers to pick and choose from a wide array of farm equipment related to the health of the soil, choice of crops to be grown and dairy farm management in the advent of latest technology.He added, I am happy to have invested in the National Pneumatic Planter Machine, which will help in yielding my crop productivity.Gurpreet Singh, representing National Agro Industries, which launched various new machines at the exposition said, Considering the extent of seed wastage in India, we have come up with the National Pneumatic Planter Machine that guarantees optimum seed to soil contact which ensures proper germination thereby, saving scarce and costly labour. This will definitely help in enhancing the profit levels of the rural farmers.Syncing with the thoughts, Tripta Devi, daughter of a small potato farmer from Fazlika district of Punjab said, Till a few years ago, the loss of crop production peaked up to 50 per cent, landing us into the viscous circle of debt trap. But now, the interface of government has helped us rise above the conventional crop cycle and diversify into other profitable crops. We dont have to suffer from crop ripening and wastage, owing to the farm to fork cold chain. This has really helped us save more and enjoy some luxuries of life which we couldnt afford earlier.The fest also hosted several self-help groups (SHGs) that specializes in homemade products. Trained by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, the farmers behind these groups are pioneers in producing the items apart from packaging and labeling them and finally connecting them directly with consumer in the market.More than 60 products made by farmers were on display at the CII Agro Tech 2016 such as the honey and pickle from the Gurdev Kaur Deols stall from the Ayali Khurd village in Ludhiana and turmeric and the Aleo Vera Gel from KKNS products of India of Burj village in Fatehgarh Sahib.I learnt of the help that the PAU offers in direct marking in 2011 and have since learnt the importance of marketing.

58fd42c67be9e06c9371834d,Election-bound Punjab: All trussed up and nowhere to go,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/nov/20/election-bound-punjab-all-trussed-up-and-nowhere-to-go-1540546.html,2016-11-20,,The New Indian Express,"HOW BHARAT COPES: By not sowing until the last minuteCHANDIGARH: Demonetisation has stopped Punjabs agriculture dead in its tracks. The farmers have not been paid for their paddy and cash has been sucked out of circulation. Sowing of wheat is 50 per cent of what it normally is every year, and 40 per cent of the potato crop is lying unsold.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 came bang in the middle of the potato season, mid-October to end-November. Some five lakh quintals of potatoes and potato seeds are supplied from Punjab to other states. But due to the sudden demonetisation of high-value currency, almost 40 per cent of the crop has been frozen in cold storage, explains Jang Bahadur Singh, secretary-general of the Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers of Punjab.And of the 60 per cent thats been dispatched, to states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Assam and Gujarat, a third of it is lying unsold in those states. As for the two-thirds that has reached the local markets, agents are saying they cant pay until they see some cash.Money rotation has stopped and we are unable to pay for labour here, says Jang Bahadur Singh. It has also become difficult for farmers to buy seeds and fertilisers.Omkar Singh, a farmer who has 18 acres in Gurdaspur, is as broke as his farmhands. I have a credit limit of Rs 10 lakh crop with my agriculture society, but I cannot clear my debts as I have no money. I have not been paid by the government agencies that procured my paddy. All money flow has stopped, he says.Omkar Singh went to pay off his debt with the little cash he had. But they refused to take his old notes. Now I am stuck. I cannot buy seed for the wheat crop, fertilisers, pesticides. My sowing has been delayed, adds Omkar Singh.Farmer Avtar Singh of Gurdaspur describes the full circle of his frustration: I have exhausted my crop credit limit and have to pay it back. My bank wont give me my money. The procurement agencies have not paid me for my paddy. And the credit society charges me 11.5 per cent interest on my loan while I stand in queue. I cant buy fertilisers, seeds or pesticides for the wheat crop. What should I do? ''Another Gurdaspur farmer, Manjit Singh, says he has sown just two acres of his ten. It took him four days to purchase wheat seed from the market. Dealers werent accepting old currency. And half of November is gone, he says.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Punjab, says farmers have been the worst hit. In the districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Sangrur, sowing of wheat is less than 50 per cent and a little better in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar.However, Punjabs director of agriculture, J S Bains, says the sowing figures are not as bad as they are being bandied about. Yes sowing has been affected. Normally, 95 per cent sowing is done by November 15. This year, 70 per cent sowing has been done till date. Out of 17 lakh quintals of seeds required for the crop, some 12 lakh quintals have already been purchased by famers, he says.Not just farmers, Punjabs traders have taken a hit too. We used to sell 100 mobile phones per day but we are barely selling one or two now, says Jagmohan Singh, who runs a mobile phone shop in Gurdaspur. No one has any money.Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh says the RBI orders prohibiting cooperative banks from exchanging/accepting old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are to blame for the state of affairs in rural Punjab.The state has 12,673 villages, and farmers deposit their earnings into cooperative banks, which have not been allowed to exchange old notes."
58fd46637be9e06c93718834,"Food prices steady, but is there a secret behind that?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/nov/28/food-prices-steady-but-is-there-a-secret-behind-that-1543360.html,2016-11-28,,The New Indian Express,"More than two weeks after confiscatory demonetisation sucked cash out from the economy, the food market has remained by and large steady, rather deceptively so. This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

Business has slumped by 60% with traders warning of dire consequences to the countrys economy if this continues.This markets impact on business is so striking that the Union Home Ministry even dispatched a representative on Thursday to hold closed-door discussions with traders. Top representatives of the 1,980 wholesale traders at the market have requested the Centre to increase the individual daily withdrawal limit from banks for current account holders from Rs 24,000 to Rs 2 lakh per day.Spread over 93 acres, the APMC is not only the biggest in terms of trade volume but also the largest in south India in terms of area, says Bharat Shah, consultant to food grains and pulses merchants in the city.With 11 entry gates leading to the yard, it is a bustling market with tempos, small and big trucks zooming in and out all day and night. The average daily turnover was a whopping Rs 50 crore till November 8.Onions, potatoes, pulses, grains, sugar, jaggery, dry fruits  almost everything is available in this wholesale market.Loading workers at the yard now earn between D150 and D200 per day as the volume of trucks bringing in produce has come down | s manjunathWe cater to food requirements of 2.5 crore people across the state, including the one crore-plus population of Bengaluru and a large population in Hoskote, Dobbspet, Tumakuru, Magadi, Chintamani, Kolar and Ramanagara, said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains & Pulses Merchants Association.Daily turnover takes a hitAs one enters the gates of the market, bags of onion and potatoes are seen strewn around the yard or being auctioned off. The yard receives an average of 1 lakh bags of onion and 50,000 bags of potato daily. Groups of men are found standing in different spots in the yard, auctioning these items after the trucks arrive with the produce.From a daily turnover of Rs 50 crore, we now have a daily turnover of Rs 18 crore to Rs 20 crore due to the massive cash crunch all around. After the demonetisation move on November 8, our total turnover for the next three days hovered around Rs 5 crore only, said Lahoti. Business has been improving but we are still losing 60 per cent of our business and the Centre has to do something urgently. We requested their representative Anil Kumar, during our meeting on Thursday, to increase the withdrawal limit for current accounts to atleast Rs 2 lakh per day, he added.Traders around his shop concede that the wholesale business sees 90 per cent cash transactions. Representatives of farmers have been camping at the market for a day or two to collect due payment in new currency notes.They will not accept old Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes or cheque payments, a trader said. He adds that almost every trader here lost at least Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh by accepting cheque payments which later bounced. Business is no more done on trust, he added.Speaking of his outlet, Sunil & Co, located in MG Building in the yard, Lahoti said, I have been giving credit only to longstanding customers, whom I trust. I am losing the rest of my business."

What is worse is that a huge chunk of these perishables are in a state of decay.Elaborating on the chores many poor women like her perform here, M Ambika says that when produce from farmers are brought in sacks, buyers would insist on checking a few sample bags before bulk purchase. An entire bag is emptied and the buyer would inspect them and choose only the good ones. He keeps aside the rejected potatoes or onions, she explains.A large section of the women, two in each onion or potato outlet, help the buyers put the selected onions in a sack for transportation. In return for our labour, we are allowed to take these rejected items. We eke out a living by selling them for cheap, Ambika says. Some buyers also give them one or two kg of fresh onions. When asked as to who would actually buy the rotten perishables, pat comes her reply, Hotels and small grocery shops.However, even this paltry income has been hard to come by due to a dip in the number of lorries as well as sacks reaching the yard since November 9. I used to make between Rs 100 and Rs 200 per day. Now it is between Rs 50 and Rs 100 per day, Ambika says.There are roughly 2,000 labourers employed in the yard. The men largely do the loading and unloading of produce.Muruga and his colleagues are quite a disgruntled lot. We used to earn Rs 700 to Rs 800 per day and have work thrice a week. Now we earn Rs 150-Rs 200 a day due to the reduced number of trucks coming to the yard, he says. He is among a group of labourers who come to the city from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh for seven to eight months each year to earn a living.Ganesan, a co-worker says, Just see this truck now. Seven of us were trying to offload the 300 sacks in it which is normally done by two or three people. This will reduce all our wages.Jaishanthappa of Bharat Traders, a potato dealer, says, I used to buy a truck-load of potatoes a day. Now I am buying only one every four days due to cash crunch.The regret over the diminished income and cash crunch echoes across owners and labourers."

Is their any connection? Yes, proves a group of head load workers who have joined hands with a few residents at the Kalikkotta Palace Road near Tripunithura Statue junction. The initiative has not only helped in curbing stray dog menace but has also yielded them good harvest of vegetables.How the dogs grew in numbersThe area near the Statue Junction was once a dumping yard for waste materials where people often dumped food and plastic waste during the night. It was common for stray dogs which hunt for food to camp in the area. Soon, the number of dogs visiting the spot increased, creating a threat to school children in the early hours of the day.Fed up by the foul smell emanating from the waste and the increasing number of dogs, the CITU head load workers whose office is located at Statue Junction decided to take matters in their own hands.We were thinking of a solution. This is when we realised that the area on the road side was lying vacant which is the major reason why people were using it as a dumping yard. If we use the land effectively and make them feel that the spot is not vacant, they will hesitate to dump waste there. After discussions, we came to a conclusion that vegetable cultivation was a good idea, said A M Manoj, a head load worker.Manoj, along with other workers Purushan, Raju, Babu, Pushkaran, Mohanan, Sasi, Johnson and Viswakumar decided to go ahead with the plan. As the cultivation will not affect the pedestrian movement, they were not worried about official sanction.We bought the seeds from the agri-outlet in Tripunithura and planted ladys fingers, tomatoes and cow peas initially. Seeing the success, we have planted more varieties like chinese potato (koorkka), green chilly and ginger, he added."

Thus was born 'Freshveggies Unlimited', an online fruit and vegetable store which provides garden-fresh produce from farmers in Palakkad to customers across Kochi.What makes 'freshveggies' different is that his store plans to cater largely to West Kochi, a neglected sector by other online veg stores, shares Ramesh.""When we studied the market, we learned that none of the other organic vegetable stores cater to the needs of customers in West Kochi, since they find it difficult to access the customers there. This is where we come in. Our priority will also be on the customers in the rural areas,"" he adds. The store will become fully operational by October 1.The plunge from ITBorn in Palakkad, Ramesh left for Mumbai where he was offered a job with Dell. Though he plunged himself wholly into developing database applications, he spent his weekends visiting farmers in Nasik and other places in Maharashtra, talking to them about the market and their produce.When he learned that there was a dearth of fresh onions and potatoes in Kerala (the state was depending on Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for onions which were never fresh), he started sending them down South.Soon after, his father passed away, Ramesh decided to shift base permanently to Kerala, where he began exploring the market possibilities of farmers in Palakkad. ""In reality, many of the farmers did not receive their due, owing to the presence of middle-men and government agents. Through Freshveggies Unlimited, we hope to brighten their chances to get a good price,"" says Ramesh. ""I also wanted to integrate 16 years of my IT experience into agriculture, which is how I developed the online app for the store.""Apart from selling vegetable produce, the online shop sells clay pots, earthernware, and bamboo products, which are not easily available in the market. ""The reason why I decided to introduce these items online was born out of a personal experience. When my wife and I shifted to Kochi, she had a difficult time finding earthernware items for our home. We realised that there was a dearth for such products,"" he shares.The app for 'freshveggies' can be downloaded only in Android phones.

Rai, a former zilla parishad member, wields considerable influence in the area due to his close ties with the RJD chief, said sources.The IMFL cartons were kept hidden under soil and grass loaded in the truck. An employee of the brick kiln has been arrested and two cars and a bike have been seized, said Subodh Kumar Mishra, SHO of Sadar police station in Hajipur, the headquarters town of Vaishali district.While both the ruling JD(U) and RJD declined to comment on this seizure a day after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar addressed a workshop of JD(U) on prohibition, the Opposition BJP targeted the alliance government. The CM said at this workshop that prohibition enforced by his government in the state has been a historic success. Such seizures show the secret of this success. In the name of prohibition, leaders of the ruling parties and police officials are making a fast buck, said senior BJP leader Sanjay Tiger.In the past three days, police and excise department officials seized huge quantities of liquor smuggled into Bihar in potato-laden trucks. In one of these seizures in Chapra, 250 cartons of IMFL were seized from a truck that reached a potato godown in the town. The liquor cartons were kept under sacks of potato. Police sources said the liquor was brought from Punjab.CM Nitish Kumar recently asked police and excise department officials to crack down on liquor smugglers and ensure that liquor does not enter into Bihar from other states."

Chilli and other vegetables grown in the region have a good market in Tamil Nadu.Thousands of farmers who have grown varieties of vegetables using underground water and by judicious water management have also given up harvesting as the prices have crashed.The farmers have grown bullet chilli, beans, cabbage, potato, brinjal and flowers in hundreds of acres expecting good prices in Tamil Nadu market during Navaratri season.Farmers in Bommanahalli, Attigulipura, Siddaiahnapura, Chikkahalli, Chatra, Ankashettypura, Ramasamudra and other villages depend on Tamil Nadu markets particularly Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Mettuplayam and Madurai. They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court.

If fighting black money is the objective, how will Rs 2,000 rupee note help in cleansing the system, he said.The Congress vice-president alleged that the demonetisation move has been prompted by political considerations. But the Congress was not the only Opposition party to think so or raise the political heat on the demonetisation move. Some others, such as the Trinamool and the AAP, asked for a complete rollback of the decision.CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, was a little more nuanced. He asked the Centre to allow the common people to transact business of essential commodities in the old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes till December 31, by which time the new currency will be fully in circulation.Two state governments run by the Left parties, Kerala and Tripura, have already written to the Centre seeking permission for a more gradual phasing out of the demonetised notes. Were not demanding the withdrawal of the move, but crores of people have been inconvenienced. Twenty-five people, were told, have committed suicide. When we raise the issue the house tomorrow, well tell the government to make alternative arrangements, the CPIs D Raja said.The JD(U)s Sharad Yadav maintained that his party would further fine-tune its strategy after another meeting on Wednesday. The Opposition meet which preceded the all party meeting was attended by the Congress, Left parties, DMK, BSP, SP, Trinamool, RSP and the JMM. The only difference was over the protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan, proposed by the Trinamool.With just about every political party speaking up on the cash crisis, the Centre can expect the issue to become a political hot potato. But its certainly not the only issue on which the Prime Minister and the government will get it from the Opposition this session. Surgical strikes, the OROP suicide and inter-state river-water disputes will follow the demonetisation crackers.And in an embarrassment for the ruling BJP, its oldest ally, the Shiv Sena, decided to side with Mamata Banerjees Trinamool in Parliament to oppose the demonetisation process.Meanwhile in the Delhi Assembly, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused Modi of using his mother for political gains and protecting his friends in the corporate world. Huge corporate loans of Rs 1.14 lakh crore werewaived. They take money from the rich and force people to queue up outside banks. In the name of strong tea, you have fed them poison he said."

They now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.But, that is the least of Jayaramans worries. Ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said Jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.Consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said Jayaraman and his friend M Abdul Khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. This month, I had to send four of my 10 labourers to Bihar where they come from, since I couldnt afford them, Jayaraman added.Apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. For instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.Before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.As a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. Likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.In Koyambedu, Asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. Flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.While calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like Jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.If the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.Its not good for business.Produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apples from Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from Ganganagar in Punjab, seedless grapes from Solapur and sapotas from closer home in Tirupattur.The key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. Some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. We cannot do that, said Jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. If we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.So despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.Abdul Khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.In addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of Rs 1 per square feet a month.Hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, Rs 1,200 would have to be paid.However, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. The last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. So, were hopeful, Jayaraman said.On November 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere Rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at Rs 12.Last week, before Ammas death, it was Rs 7 per kg, said Abdul Khader."

What does it mean to be a plus-sized women today? On one hand, it means being asked to change and aspire to fit into an unrealistic beauty standard. On the other, it also means finding fashionable clothing a daunting task. You would probably find Thors hammer faster than a stylish fit thats also affordable for plus-sized women!Illustration Amit BandreIts no secret that there is a careless assumption that body fat is equal to being unfit. Most people perceive plus-sized people to be lazy, slow, and also as a group of people that cant look after themselves. Its like an anti-fat attitude all over, rues Riya, who recently became a mother. What she wasnt expecting was the extent of de-sexualisation shed feel when looking for clothes designed for plus-sized pregnant people. Instead of cute tight dresses to show-off my baby bump, all I could find are potato sacks, and plain A-line tops, she sighs.Shopping, which is supposed to be fun, often turns into a harrowing experience. The stick-thin mannequins definitely dont help either. Im a size 14 and have squeezed into a size 10 because it is so difficult to find clothes that fit! But if the only way to find a pair of jeans (that fits me) is to pay `5,000, then maybe it isnt my body thats the problem; its fast, affordable fashion, avers a frustrated Shraddha.If finding denims wasnt hard enough, Priya adds another dimension to the dilemma and talks about swimsuits. Speedos! Those are my only options. The half-dress swimsuits that cut off mid thigh and are in boring colours. Im not asking for low-cut, slinky suits, that seem to make everyone around me uncomfortable, but Im not expecting this either. Anisha (name changed) is 52 and weighs around 80 kg, and finds it virtually impossible to find something that fits her well. What fits my hips will be too long. What fits the length of my body will not come past my breasts!Which brings us to our next point: is there an ideal plus-size? While women are excited that stores are catering to bigger sizes and advertisements are finally looking at more realistic women, many dont feel like the body positivity movement is inclusive. The majority of plus-sized women have flat stomachs, big breasts and wide hips, Shraddha points out.In this appearance-driven world, body positivity offers an alternative: diversity. Is this the end of the conversation? Absolutely not! This is the beginning of a movement that decentralises the emphasis on a particular ideal body and appreciates all shapes, sizes and colour. Take a step to love your curves and embrace your style, whatever skin you may hold."

They are consultants to those wishing to nurture gardens of different sizes, as well.Minette shares some valuable information and tips with our readers.Watering requires to be done everyday, unless the soil is already wet/damp from the previous day. Among the herbs, rosemary is a delicate darling which requires some extra attention and care.Water your plants enough to keep the soil moist without over-watering (roots will rot in a soggy container). Let the top of the soil, or growing medium, dry out completely between watering and check moisture levels often. Mint, parsley does best in fairly moist soil, whereas rosemary, thyme and sage prefer soil that is only slightly moist.Herbs grow well in equal parts compost, sterile topsoil and builders sand. An all-purpose organic fertilizer can be added to this mix. The soil mix needs to drain well. Since they can thrive on any type of soil, the soil does not have to be completely organic. They are not often bothered by insect or disease pests. Neem oil works best in case of any diseases.Herbs can be grown in pots or on the ground. They require a minimum of 6 hours of bright sunlight and can be grown indoors where they get sufficient light. Indoors the advantage is no weeds, easy to access but the yield is less. A south west facing window will do well. Outdoors, the yield is larger, the herbs are more flavoursome.The beauty of herbs is that they can thrive on your kitchen window sill, balcony, patio etc as long as they get the required amount of sunlight and water. One can buy seeds from most garden stores. Most herbs are available as saplings and can be re potted into bigger pots or into the ground. Basil gives out flowers which dry into seeds. Once it flowers, it needs to be pinched and the seeds can be dried and grown. The same goes with garlic and onion chives.Seeds of annual herbs (basil, coriander, dill and oregano) can be started indoors and grown year round. Place a collection of popular culinary herbs in a sunny kitchen window and theyll be available when needed. Perennial herbs, like chives, parsley, sage, sweet marjoram and thyme, can be started from seed, but it is often easier to purchase young plants from a nursery. Because perennials grow for more than one season, its best to keep them outside in pots during the summer and bring them in if the winter is too cold.The Tale of a TeacherI am the proud owner of a farm in the heart of Bengaluru in Jayanagar. It is just a 3ft by 14 ft patch in my backyard but I call it a farm because in that small space I grow a variety of vegetables and herbs!says former teacher, Mythili Ramaprasad, her eyes sparkling with joy and pride. To make maximum use of the little soil in the patch and also the limited sunlight available, I grow climbers, shrubs, herbs and tubers.So there is a happy mix of pumpkin, turmeric, cherry tomatoes, sweet potato, colocasia( kesuvina soppu) along with curry leaves, chilies, mint, basil and ajwain ( dodpathre soppu) ,all growing in symbiosis. I have also tried growing climbers like passion fruit, chow and hyacinth beans ( avarekai) in the past which have given good yields.She says I took up gardening seriously as a hobby after I retired as a teacher. What began as a hobby has now become a passion. I love to spend time every morning in the garden, examining each plant and discover a fresh green shoot or a healthy new bud. It is very relaxing and has great therapeutic value. Very little investment is needed to plan a small kitchen garden. It is best if it is organically cultivated. Kitchen wastes like vegetable and fruit peels can be collected and buried in a pit in the soil.Sometimes the plants are attacked by caterpillars and insects which need immediate attention as they can seriously damage the plants and affect the produce. Monkeys can also be a menace and cause destruction.....she rues. And those who know Mythili Ramaprasad will tell you just how alert and vigilant she is especially when it comes to her beautiful garden!"

But samples of beans, curry leaves, mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chilli and beetroot, coming from the neighbouring states, contained residues of banned pesticides like Profenophos, Chlorpyrifos, Triazophos, Phenothrin, Lambdacyhalothrin, and Cyfluthrin in alarming levels.According to the report, the various projects executed by the agricultural department have helped in production of pesticides-free vegetables in the state.It is for the first time that such a massive test, taking samples from all districts, was conducted in the state. The samples were collected by the Food Safety Department and the test were conduced at the Pesticide Residual Research and Analytical Laboratory in Vellayani, Tpuram."

Bakeries are stocked with a variety of cakes and super markets have hung out all the new decorative items that have come in. Chennai is now home to Christians from various countries. City Express caught up with a few foreigners and Chennaiites to understand the traditions that are associated with Christmas.Gifts, drinks and food are the most integral part of Christmas for Sofia Juliet, who was raised a Catholic and is all set for Christmas. Now is the time to get together and enjoy a scrumptious meal. Wine and plum cakes are a must! she says. Catholics across the world celebrate in the same way  midnight mass, exchange gifts and sing carols. But the main difference between the celebration in the West and here is that, in the West, Christmas festivities begin in October. There is not much pomp and show here, she adds.Mallika Angela Chaudhuri, a Canadian, misses the white Christmas and it is quite evident when she starts to reminisce about the celebrations there.The weather would be cold, but warm. There will be happiness in the air and its all about giving more than receiving, she says.A socially empowering society, in Canada, people gather outside to celebrate the festival with the less fortunate. You are sure to see many families serving food to the poor. Then there are people dressed as Santa Claus who collect donations to buy gifts for the needy, she smiles.Talking about the wide spread of donating food, she says, Technically the festival season sets in during Thanksgiving, where again there is a wide spread of food. For Christmas, we have egg nog, turkey roast, pumpkin marshmallow pie and of course, wine. As a child, her favourite Christmas memory was going to the yard to pick out the perfect tree. There would be around 2,000 trees and you get to choose yours. Many families used to grow their own trees too.Laura Schorcht and Fabienne Schoch were busy decorating their Christmas tree when we met them. Our family is atheist but we do love Christmas and have our own traditions. Germany is colourful and filled with music this time of the year, says Laura. As a child she would have to recite a poem before receiving her gift from Santa. I was upset when I found out Santa was not real, she laughs and Fabienne pitches in, I knew it the minute I saw one of our family friends struggling hard to be Santa.Since Lauras house near a forest, it is her family tradition to have wild meat on Christmas. We hunt the stag ourselves and that forms a part of the lunch. We have Gluhwein, a spicy red wine along with the meat, she says. At Fabiennes place, they have a special sausage, potato salad and Gluhwein. This year they plan to have a quiet Christmas but exchange gifts.In France, its mandatory that all wishes that kids write down for Santa are fulfilled. Photographer Yannick Cormeir misses the Christmas in his city. There are Christmas markets and we start celebrations from 24th. We give gifts to kids and binge on special dishes, especially seafood, wine and champagne, he says. In Chennai, Christmas to him means catching up with friends and showering his daughter with gifts.Among all these traditions, the Anglo Indians in the city have a unique way of celebrating it. There is food, midnight mass, nativity crib and dance! We celebrate Christmas for a month. Every Sunday we do a part of the decorations  first the star, then the tree and lastly the crib. On the night of Christmas, all the Anglo Indians get together at the association and celebrate the birth of Christ by dancing the night away, shares Geraldine Maria Rozario.Each one of them has made Chennai their second home. If not in a grand manner, they know how to keep the spirit of Christmas alive."

Her garden has lots of greens  mint, coriander, spinach, fenugreek(methi), amaranthus (chaulaee), dill, lettuce, basil - and veggies such as green chilli, tomato, brinjal, ladiesfinger, beetroot, carrot, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, bittergaurd, cucumber and corn.

They don't have much space, so they grow potatoes and chilli in small pots in their balconies. My neighbour has started growing greens recently too."" But the most inspired people stay with her- her children. ""Both my children want to help, gardening is a fun activity for them.Since they're so young, I can't let them do much. But I always let them sprinkle seeds. They've started respecting Nature, they know the role farmers play in our lives and that there is so much work that goes into the food we buy from the supermarkets. Kids have forgotten that today, and so have we.""While many complain of high temperatures and a dry November, Aashita finds Bengaluru's weather ideal.

""Maybe tomorrow onwards, every two, three weeks, I will have to go the ATM or bank to get cash.""India's ""black economy,"" a term widely used to describe transactions that take place outside formal channels, amounted to around 20 percent of gross domestic product, according to investment firm Ambit.New bills of 500 and 2,000 rupees will be introduced from Nov. 10. Jaitley said it would take two to three weeks to replace the old notes, amid concerns over the availability of cash.POLICE ON ALERTDeepak Chhatoi, a salesman at a car varnishing store in Mumbai, said he had to turn away customers wanting to pay with larger bills, and could not buy the popular potato sandwich known as the vada pav.""I couldn't even have breakfast this morning because there seems to be a shortage of change in the market,"" he said.The extent of the impact of the measures became evident as petrol stations and hospitals also refused to accept larger denomination bank notes, even though the government had given them a waiver to continue accepting them.Meanwhile, bank ATMs were closed and banks prepared for a flood of people seeking to exchange larger bank notes for smaller ones.They will have to fill a form and show proof of identity to exchange no more than 4,000 rupees worth of the old notes at any bank, which is likely to cause further chaos.Swapan Mandal, a labourer, wanted to withdraw 3,000 rupees from an ATM and send it to his family in Kolkata, in eastern India, but was unable to do so.""I have only 500 rupees notes at home. I don't know if I will be able to send the money,"" he said.A sub-inspector in New Delhi said the police commissioner had issued orders to watch for disturbances, especially at key retail outlets like petrol pumps.""This is a sensitive time. We have to be alert,"" he said.TEMPORARY GOLD RUSHThe main opposition Congress party said it supported moves to attack the shadow economy, but that withdrawing bigger denomination notes would hit the common man first.""Modi shows how little he cares about ordinary people of this country - farmers, small shopkeepers, housewives, all thrown into utter chaos,"" said party leader Rahul Gandhi.""(All the) while the real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed away abroad or in bullion or real estate.""Indians raced to turn their cash into gold, which jumped nearly 4 percent to its strongest in more than five weeks as investors sought safety following Trump's unlikely win.India is the world's second largest gold consumer and around a third of its demand comes from the unaccounted sector.On Tuesday night, jewellers in Mumbai kept shops open until midnight as panicked people rushed to buy gold with cash, said Kumar Jain, vice president of the Mumbai Jewellers Association.On the stock market, real estate firms that depend on cash transactions were hit particularly hard, with DLF Ltd, India's biggest property developer, closing 17 percent lower.But analysts said the move would prove beneficial to India in the longer term, by ushering in transparency and bringing transactions into the formal economy, and providing additional revenue for a country that has long struggled to contain its fiscal deficits.It could also lead to easing inflation, raising the prospect of additional rate cuts from the central bank, which lowered the key repo rate by 25 basis points last month"

I used to run when I was in school, but things changed after I got married and so on. Fitness wasnt given much importance. But, today I made the decision to keep myself healthy and I am so happy on completing the 5k run! exclaimed Saradha, a 40-year old.UNIS was formed by Viji Swaminathan and Ranish Hariharan, trainers and Nip practioners in 2015 with the primary aim of motivating people to run. Normally people feel that only trained professionals can run but, they forget that they used to run as children. With time, they lose touch with any physical activity and become absorbed in other things, said Viji. All you need is a good pair of shoes, comfortable clothes and a drive to go from being a couch potato to a much healthier phase.Narrating her couch-to-10k story, she recalled, I was almost a 100kg and was a couch potato basically very unhealthy. I started walking for fun. I am not a fast runner, but running itself helps us be fit irrespective of the speed, she explained.From its initial stage of having two to three members in the group, UNIS has grown as big family, opines Viji. Currently, UNIS has 2 chapters UNIS-Bessie and UNIS-Light House. Initially I started a chapter at Bessy with just two people. Later, there was a demand for the training at Marina and we flagged off our second chapter, she smiled.UNIS, apart from training beginners, has two more verticals: campus to corporate training and corporate training. With 250-odd runners, jogging, running and marching towards the end point at the event, it was surprising to see that most participants were first time runners. Viji shared, The goal was to embrace running, not create a racing atmosphere. We had a lot of beginners today and it was a mixed group. Inner strength 2016 is out first event supporting Jeevadhanan an orphanage to educate girl children. The proceeds from the registration will be given to educate them via Sathyamoorthy foundation.For details, visit:https://www.facebook.com/unisindia"

They have a new menu to celebrate their fifth anniversary in India.Walking into the dimly lit restaurant on the fourth floor of a mall, I am surprised by the burst of colours on the table. Two sets of bamboo baskets come to my table for starters and they open to reveal purple-glazed dim sums and bright orange dim sums adorned with caviar. The purple dim sums has chicken, coriander and chestnut fillings. The layer made of potato starch and wheat starch gets that tinge of purple from the red cabbage. The orange dim sum called Spicy Har Gau has prawns and bamboo shoots in it. The meatiness of the prawn with a faint hint of sour bamboo makes for a melt-in-the mouth dish. The purple one is a harmonious blend of Asian spices.The restaurant that believes in modification of authentic cuisines has modified quite a few. The Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun was one such and it is now the restaurants specialty. Cheung Fun or the Cantonese Rice Roll is traditionally served steamed but the twist here is the crispy layer of fried tempura batter that drapes around succulent prawns and black fungus. Warm soya is poured on top of the silky texture that gives the taste buds a sweet, sour delight.For the main course, we are served Pork and Shrimp Fried Rice and Roasted Duck Udon Noodles. The fried rice is the kind that you would have in a good Chinese restaurant, not much of a surprise, but then I am told the basmati rice has been soaked in Jasmine water. After that I get the taste of jasmine, stir-fried with pork, shrimp and prawns. The chewy Udon Noodles is rich in taste of duck and seasonings.It is a delightful and heavy lunch and they serve Jasmine Tea, to help us with digestion. It is a good idea.Then comes the desserts, the restaurants USP. What I always tell the guests, who are not up for a heavy meal, is this have the dim sums, skip the main course and go straight for the dessert, says Ajay, one of the staff. We are served Citrus Tart and Blueberry Pistachio Bar with Lemon Yoghurt Sorbet and Grapefruit Sorbet respectively.The desserts look delightful with an emphasis on the presentation. The yellow, round Citrus Tart and the Brown Pistachio Bar both are signature dishes. The Pistachio Bar has tiny macaroons, the kind of cakes Yauatcha is known to make it in-house. The Pistachio Bar has four layers -- the base is with grinded almond base, topped with a layers of chocolate, pistachio, blueberry mousse and blueberry glaze. The layers are firm and the sweet taste of creamy pistachio balances out the slightly sour blueberry. . The tangy Citrus Tart is a play of bitter, sweet and sour.The sorbet is a bonus show stealer. It is subtle, rich and creamy. The Lemon Sorbet tasted of lemon, minus the excess sourness that causes us to cringe, and replaces it with the taste of rich cream and yogurt. Same with the Grapefruit Sorbet. I must mention the Hot Toddy mocktail. If you have a bad throat, like I do, then this is what you should opt for. A good mixture of orange juice, pineapple juice and masalas. Youll need to hold the wine glass with a napkin but once you sip on it, the flavours seem to dance.(Approximate cost for twopeople `2,100.

I grow areca palm, nithyakalyani, skyblue clustervine, few crotons and, of course the ubiquitous money plant in my pots, says Ophelia.When she is busy, her neighbour, their maid, her cook, and her in-laws take turns to water plants. But she takes out at least 10 minutes every day for her plants. I talk to my plants like nallaa valaruppa seekkiram (grow well soon). I also caress the leaves but I dont sing to them. My neighbours will find it weird, she laughs.She began gardening with a potato seed. Its nice to have some greenery around. Plus they always makes me happy. Its a greater satisfaction when they bloom or bear fruits.We asked her about her first learning experience. It was on how to break soil and mix it with manure.""I learnt it from my mom, and also my periyamma. They are happy gardeners. Whenever they spot any plant on the roadside worth growing at home, they pick it up! Once they picked up blue bells from Yercaud and successfully grew them in our sultry, hot city. My mom grows a whole variety of flowers, greens and vegetables! she says.When she tried growing potatoes in the beginning, only the leaves grew. Start with an easy plant and then move on to plants that require a lot of maintenance. Now, the bitter-gourd plant is close to her heart. She got the seeds from Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department and the manure is bought from nurseries.With the rains around the corner, Ophelia is not worried. All her plants can thrive in the rainy season. The only thing that she has to worry about is the water-logging of pots.

My father had a few acres of agriculture near Sadenahalli, around 16 km from Bengaluru. I grew up on the vegetables and other produce grown from the land, which inspired me to try my hand at terrace gardening.After my marriage in the mid 70s, I planted a small kitchen garden in our Rajajinagar house and grew beans, papaya and greens. When I shifted to Malleswaram, I became a member of the We Care for Malleswaram group. The groups focus was on educating residents on the segregation of wet anddry waste.The compost generated from the wet waste and the availability of abundant sunlight encouraged me to start my own terrace garden. Here I grow beans, greens, tomatoes and German Turnip, to name a few. I have not bought any greens from the market since 2013. When I started my garden, I had decided on two aspects -- no chemicals and judicious use of water.Today, I make manure from the wet waste generated from my own kitchen as well as my neighbours, leftovers from the pooja room, dry leaves and sour buttermilk.I have close to 150 pots on my terrace, in which I use an equal measure of coconut husk and manure. I keep experimenting with the crops and have managed to grow sweet potatoes, three varieties of brinjal, double beans, chickpeas, cucumber and bitter gourd. In addition, I also have basil, parsley, coriander, mint, green chilies and curry leaves. A portion of the beans and brinjal are left to age on the vines. Dried seeds are then collected and preserved for future plants.I also have a good variety of flowers, which are used for prayers. The remnants of the flowers post pooja are added to the compost bin. The garden terrace attracts honey bees and insects that aid in pollination too. I enjoy taking care of the plants and spend close to an hour every day tending them. It is a stress buster."

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

It opens a window to seeing the world differently, with its many magical surprises. Designing a garden that is child-friendly will sustain their interest. Here are some top tips to make it so.Select a small patch of the whole garden space for this garden. Here, they can do activities by themselves like digging, sowing, watering and weeding. Take care of their safety. Avoid using the materials which will hurt them while gardening.The pots and the planters which are used in the garden can be painted with different colours and decorated with their favourite cartoon characters. This will make things more fun. Kids are curious about new things. The kids garden should have plants which grow fast. They will be thrilled to see the sprouting and emerging of a new leaf from a seed which was sown by them. Plucking a carrot from the soil and eating them with the fresh soil flavour will become their green childhood stories. They will enjoy the colours. Bright flowering plants would be a smart addition to their garden.The child-friendly garden should have some interesting structures where the kids can play, learn and grow plants. It could be done in many creative ways. You could design an alphabet garden where the raised beds could be designed like an alphabet. Pizza gardens could be designed in a small circular patch of land where all the vegetables and the herbs which are used in pizzas could be grown. Beans can be grown in a spiral cage attached to the pot, making them more engaged with the plant by trailing it on the cage.In case you have no space on the ground to have a child-friendly garden, don't worry. Make some interesting planters at home which gives them the happiness of growing food. Potato man, aqua onion are easy to make and perfectly fit your window sill garden at home. Here is how to make a potato man and aqua onion:Take a big size potato. Cut the potato one inch from the top and scoop out all the flesh with a spoon or a knife. Leave a thick layer of flesh around the skin. Fill the potato with soil and sow some Ragi seeds on that. Sprinkle some water every day. Ragi will germinate within a week and grow like the hair of the potato. Draw a face on the potato with its green lush hair on the top. Wheat, paddy or any other cereal seeds could be used.Aqua onions: Take a cup and fill with water. Keep an onion in that in such a way that the roots are touching the water.

What does it mean to be a plus-sized woman today? On one hand, it means being asked to change and aspire to fit into an unrealistic beauty standard. On the other, it also means finding fashionable clothing a daunting task. You would probably find Thors hammer faster than a stylish fit thats also affordable for plus-sized women!Its no secret that there is a careless assumption that body fat is equal to being unfit. Most people perceive plus-sized people to be lazy, slow, and also as a group of people that cant look after themselves. Its like an anti-fat attitude all over, rues Riya, who recently became a mother. What she wasnt expecting was the extent of de-sexualisation shed feel when looking for clothes designed for plus-sized pregnant people. Instead of cute tight dresses to show-off my baby bump, all I could find are potato sacks, and plain A-line tops, she sighs.Shopping, which is supposed to be fun, often turns into a harrowing experience. The stick-thin mannequins definitely dont help either. Im a size 14 and have squeezed into a size 10 because it is so difficult to find clothes that fit! But if the only way to find a pair of jeans (that fits me) is to pay `5,000, then maybe it isnt my body thats the problem; its fast, affordable fashion, avers a frustrated Shraddha.If finding denims wasnt hard enough, Priya adds another dimension to the dilemma and talks about swimsuits. Speedos! Those are my only options. The half-dress swimsuits that cut off mid thigh and are in boring colours. Im not asking for low-cut, slinky suits, that seem to make everyone around me uncomfortable, but Im not expecting this either. Anisha (name changed) is 52 and weighs around 80 kg, and finds it virtually impossible to find something that fits her well. What fits my hips will be too long. What fits the length of my body will come past my breasts!Which brings us to our next point: is there an ideal plus-size? While women are excited that stores are catering to bigger sizes and advertisements are finally looking at more realistic women, many dont feel like the body positivity movement is inclusive. The majority of plus-sized women have flat stomachs, big breasts and wide hips, Shraddha points out.In this appearance-driven world, body positivity offers an alternative: diversity. Is this the end of the conversation? Absolutely not! This is the beginning of a movement that decentralises the emphasis on a particular ideal body and appreciates all shapes, sizes and colour. Take a step to love your curves and embrace your style, whatever skin you may hold."

Gayathri, reads the name written on a corner of the photo, with a garland on it and a lit lamp in front. This is where we wanted to put her marriage photo, said her mother M Selvi, struggling to contain memories and tears.The family is yet to come to terms with her tragic death. When this reporter visited her home on Wednesday, her mother and aunt were seated on the floor, folding Gayathris new cloths that were just delivered by their tailor. It is a salwar that she wanted to wear to college, Selvi said. Every day, her father Murugesan, who runs a tea stall, would drop her at the Porur bus stand, from where she would board the bus to college. But it was a bit different on the day of the accident. She unusually requested him to wait until she boarded the bus around 12.30 pm. About an hour later, Selvi received a call from a relative informing her that TV news channels were reporting some trouble near Gayathris college. Selvi rushed to the college with her niece, but couldnt find her daughter. When her niece called on her mobile phone, they were asked to reach Royapettah Government Hospital. As I was waiting in front of the casualty, I saw my daughters dress through the window of a white van. It had blood stains. I peeped into the van only to find her body with her head smashed. Only then I realised there was an accident in which she was killed.Gayathri, Selvi recalled, wanted to become an IPS officer; a dream that was trampled in just a brief but cruel moment on the black, pitiless roads of the city.Asha Shruthis kin, who are yet to come in terms with her death | martin louisChristaraj was in Bengaluru that day, with a customer who had booked his cab.

It was not her but an unknown voice, informing about the death of his daughter.But it was a happy occasion, I could not tell anybody the news. I had to remain quiet and started from Bangalore around 3 pm along with the customers and drove down to Chennai, said the distraught father, hastening to add that he drove very carefully.Christaraj cannot but recall that the last he saw his daughter was when he left early that morning, when Asha was fast asleep. There in their home in Pulianthope, there is a packet of potato chips, a bar of Dairy Milk chocolate, few books on accounting and bright, beautiful salwars. The books and cloths are hers. Even today I bought her favourite potato chips and chocolates, he added, clearly finding it difficult to deal with the sudden absence of his daughter.The family is dependent on his income. Even on that fateful day, her friends had offered her a lift in an auto-rickshaw from Guindy railway station to the college. But Ash had only `10 on her. So she decided to walk.She had big plans for future. Asha wanted to be a chartered accountant. Only a week before the accident, she had told me not to worry about finances.

She was preparing for it, and believed she was just six months away from it.Chitra was an optimistic girl. Even when all the things in the house was washed away during the December floods, it was she who smiled and asked me not to worry, said her father Loganathan, a canteen worker at a private company.For the last one week of her life, Chitra kept asking us not to worry about the debts. I will start working in another six months, and we will repay all our debts she repeated, said Kalavathi, her mother who works in the packing section of a pharmacy company. Their daughter was the first graduate in the family about whom they all were proud of, on whom they had built their dreams.Chitra was a hard worker. She would wake up early, finish her assignments and leave early to reach college. Before and after that, she would attend to the chores at home in her mothers absence. Throughout the week, she would concentrate on the household work and studies. But weekends were for grandparents [who live in the same locality], which she would never skip, Loganathan added.My daughter would never let me be alone, but its been six days now since I am left alone, said Kalavathi struggling to stop herself from bursting into another bout of cries and tears."

The iconic Iyengars bakery is currently being run by its fourth generation entrepreneur, HT Srinivas, who opened another store in Austin Town in 1981 to serve delicious bakes to a larger number of Bengalureans.Decades after, his honey cakes and potato bakes are a sensation in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.However, with branches spread across south India and a few stores in Maharashtra, the new generation businessmen and Sridharas sons  30-year-old Lakshmeesha and 26-year-old Raman  now have a problem at hand with imposters. Numerous bakeries in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai are using Iyengar brand name to serve their bakes.I first spotted a bakery carrying our name near Austin Town about four years ago. Those who wanted cheap bakes and didn't bother with quality would go there, but our loyal customers stuck through. The fake stores may have copied our name but they cannot match us in quality, says Raman HS.Even before the 26-year-old learnt that Mumbai hosts close to 400 fake Iyengar Bakeries, Raman had filed a case against the fake store in Bengaluru, but did not have a legal stand in court as the bakery's trademark has not been registered.Raman learnt about the fake stores in Mumbai after a man came up with a rather weird business proposition, where he said that he would like to lease out an Iyengar Bakery store in Mumbai to Raman. This caught him unawares since he had never known of the existence such a store in his chain. Many have been exploiting the brand that their older generations took decades to build, but the sons are helpless to defend it.Srinivas had registered the bakery's trademark in the 90s with a logo that had a picture of Lord Venkateshwara. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that names of gods or holy books cannot be trademarked to sell goods and services. Following this his son Raman applied for another trademark with a logo adhering to the new policy three months ago.However, without a registered trademark the sons do not have a legal stand in terms of ownership, even if they file a case against the duplicates.You'll find these fakes using our brand name in almost every nook and corner of South India, especially in Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru. I am planning to travel to Hyderabad to find out if there are such stores there, says the MBA graduate.With an alarming number of fakes cropping up in major Indian cities, the sons are determined to do whatever it takes to save their brand from being tarnished by those who sell low quality bakes manipulating the brand to attract customers.I am applying for a patent to safeguard the brand name  Iyengar Bakery  to avoid this rampant misuse. I plan to start a franchise model of business for our bakery in the next three months. An original Iyengar Bakery will only be run by the Iyengars. This is a community-based business, where all of our stores are run by our close or distant relatives, informs Raman."

A KBPS source said the task of printing these 60,000 tomes will affect the printing of over 1.56 crore books that are set to be distributed to the students before Onam vacation. At present we have cleared the partial printing of books for the second volume but now owing to the printing of these 60,000 books we have completely scrapped the second volume. Only after completing this can we restart the printing and that will normally take one more week. It is quite clear that the distribution of the second volume will be delayed, said an official associated with the printing work in KBPS.According to him, the minimum printing requirement for each title has resulted in the completion of the printing of 60,000 books which became a political hot potato with the Opposition trying to pin the government down. There is no point in blaming the KBPS for the delay since the Textbook Officer, who has to submit the intent order, must take the full responsibility. As per the earlier order we have completed the printing of 2.88 crore books and distributed them by June 20 itself but no additional order reached our office and it was only last week that we got the order for printing 60,000 books. Using the three machines we can print a minimum of 2 lakh books a day. We are wasting several lakh owing to the irresponsible behaviour of the Education Department, the official said, adding, no complaints had been lodged with the hubs that had functioned until July 16.Noushad, Production Manager, KBPS, said,  It is a fact that the printing of the second volume has been affected but we are working hard to avoid any kind of delay in distributing the second volume of books. As the new order contains a minimum of five-100 in each volume it needs some time. Most probably we will complete the printing of these 60,000 books by next week and will start the printing of the second volume, said Noushad, Production Manager, KBPS.Meanwhile, it is believed that the government is probing the reasons resulting in the shortfall of 60,000 textbooks last time. Besides, the officials conducting the probe have started raids at all the 14 hubs and 3,100 distribution centres."

You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

Ram, Trustee, MSSRF and Chairman, Kasturi & Sons, said, Despite high growth rates in the country, there is a crisis in agriculture and policy-making in the country. He added, We should be ashamed of the nutritional levels of children in the country.Ram also received the first copy of the 26th annual report of MSSRF, one of the four publications that were released on the occasion.A book on Family Farming, a booklet on MS Swaminathan in Conversation: A farmer-led approach to achieving a malnutrition-free India and a booklet on Pulses in meeting the zero hunger challenge were the others.Delivering the inaugural address, Swaminathan said, Agricultures contribution to the economy has come down to around 13% but that only shows the diversification of the economy; it doesnt mean that agriculture has gone down.He added that it was imperative to provide children an opportunity for a healthy and productive life, for which the first 1000 days of a child were crucial. He went on to explain that the hunger was three dimensional, constituting calorie deprivation, protein deficiency and micronutrient deficiency (hidden hunger).According to the professor, who was also acclaimed by the Time magazine as one of the 20 most influential Asians of the 20th century, incentives for farmers like the minimum support price (MSP) would result in a rise in production and thereby, make doubling of yield possible. He said that bio-fortification, the concept of increasing the nutritional quality of food crops, in the context of the zero hunger challenge could be achieved by naturally biofortified plants such as moringa and sweet potato.Biofortified varieties selected by breeding and selection and genetically biofortified crops could also help in the journey towards zero hunger. While talking on the DNA revolution, he raised the question,With new genetic technology, we can transform life but should we?According to the scientist, the challenges in pulse production in India would be to close the gap between demand and supply, bringing additional land under pulses cultivation and doubling the yield from 700 kg/ha.

Many people are forced to return empty-handed as banks too are running short of money.Meanwhile, some unemployed youths in a bid to earn fast bucks started collecting `1000 and `500 notes near railway station, bus stand and near different banks. They pay 950 against exchange of a `1000 note and `470 for `500 note."

Jalarams Farsanwala, with its first Bengaluru outlet in Basveshwarnagar, just does that.Farsan in Gujarati means snacks and are eaten with almost every meal in a Gujaratis house. Hence the name Farsanwala. This joint promises premium snacks that are not expensive, says Raakesh Rajpopat, co-founder of Jalarams Farsanwala.There are few places in the city that serve a fusion of Gujarati and Marwari food, but none are authentic, says Raakesh who has outlets across different cities such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad.Farsanwala has a variety of sweets. There is mohanthal made from gram flour, ghee, milk and dry fruits; churma ladoo with wheat flour, jaggery, coconut and sesame seeds; kutchi peda that is a hard, roasted peda from khoya and dry fruits; gulab pak that is khoya cooked with rose petals; and sata, a thick maida puri like a donut with a sugar glaze. They also have the regulars  motichoor ladoo, Bengali sweets and, the ever popular, kaju barfi.In savouries they have 20 you can pick from. There is papdi that is deep fried wheat crackers seasoned with cumin seeds; farali chivda, a mixture that is usually had while fasting because it is made with potatoes and gathiya, again fries made from gram flour and condiments.They also stock up about nine varieties of baked khakra. So it is all healthy.Talking about its uniqueness, Rajpopat says At Farsanwala, we serve the most authentic Gujarati food in the whole city. The fafdas (fries from gram flour and seasoning) that we serve are just like what you would get in Gujarat on a Sunday morning. All their chefs are from Gujarat.If you are at the store, you must try the ghugra (deep-fried sweets with a stuffing of coconut, cardomom and nuts), dabeli (toasted pav sandwich with coconut, fruits and potatoes) and fafda jalebi.Other than this, they have twenty different kinds of farsan such as kutchi dabeli, kutchi ghoogra, Mumbai vada pav, undhiyu, khandvi and dhokla.On Sundays, they add specials too. We have Undhiyu (a Gujarati special vegetable made during the Sankranti festival) one day and Dal Pakwaan, the next, and somedays both. Currently, for the Shravan month, we have sabudana vada, sabudana khichdi and farali khakra, which people prefer during the fasting session.They plan to add chaats in time, including pav bhaji, pani puri and dahi puri. But that will come in a little later, says Rajpopat.Rajpopat says, A lot of people said that we were located a little away from the centre of the city... in Basveshwarnagar. But, it is the closest hub for the Gujarati community. About 70-80% of our customers are old time Gujaratis who have been in Bengaluru for 30 years or more."

For as long as I can remember, Ive loved helping my mother in daily chores thus learning different household methods of treating ingredients in many diverse ways. A few simple analogies I made as a kid was how fascinating it was to eat the same food around the globe with simple change in the method of cooking & adding local fusions to authentic dishes. To name some; Baingan Bharta was known as Baba Ganoush to Arabics, Roti/ Paratha was known as Pizza to Italian, Clay Pot Tandoors being used in many North Indian regions had transformed to conventional oven in other parts of world.I have done both - gone to college and travelled the world. It has been always fun and very rewarding experience.My journey as a chef had started long before I was certified as a professional. My expedition in Grand Cayman, Cayman Island, has garnered me to the many varied cuisines. Being a tropical region most of the culinary art evolved around fruits and root vegetables. This local lady, Francis, who worked as maid to one of the North African migrant would cook for the family and had adopted their palette. She also worked as a housekeeper in my resort. It was one of the encounters I had with her where I had come across a very unique way of making hummus out of sweet potato. The twist to the recipe was she would pit roast the sweet potato on a BBQ griddle and once the potatoes are charred she would wrap it in a foil paper and leave it on the slow fired griddle till the potato is cooked through. The potato has a smoky flavour which is mellowed with tahini, garlic, dash of sesame oil and chopped habanero peppers. The sweetness from potato, bitter rich creamy sesame paste and spiciness from the peppers was a firework of flavours.I learnt the recipe from her but even after trying a couple of times I was not so impressed with the final product. This one day I had made Francis taste it. The trick was to puncture holes in the potatoes after they are wrapped in foil, this is where I had gone wrong all this while. While the potatoes rest on the griddle, the holes ooze out sugar and water which is caramelized adding a unique flavour from BBQ smoke, sugar, water and trapped steam.Experimenting over half a dozen of times, I have mastered the recipe, now I can even make it in my sleep!! The guests have loved it, the ones who had tried the same hummus elsewhere would brag about how unique the taste and texture was. I had called it Sweet Francis Potato Hummus, for the name I have nearly explained this journey of recipe to nearly everyone I have served it to.Chef Ajay Thakur, Brand Chef, Mirah Hospitality."

Those trips across the subcontinent formed a sort of pattern popularly known as the Tiger Trail, is the story that inspired the theme of Tiger Trail restaurant, located on Park Road, Near Indian Express Circle.The food served here is said to be a menu that orginated from different tiger reserves in India.The ambience of the place is designed to suit the theme. As you enter the restaurant, the steps have paws printed on them. The dining tables have maps of various states on them with tiger reserves. The walls hold guns to bring the feel of tiger trails and some have placards with one that says, Lets taste the divine food of wild adventure.While on our visit to the restaurant, we were expecting to relish some unique dishes with local flavours they brought from the cities around the tiger reserve, but most of the menu comprised of everyday dishes. The taste of it definitely differs.As we occupied a table with a map of Rajasthan, we were served lassi with sliced badam, served in earthenware. The thick lassi was soothing.The starters followed the welcome drink. Bhurwann Mushroom came first. As we bite into the soft cheesy mushroom, coloured in red and yellow stuffed with paneer, the taste of garam masala and jeera powder covered our taste buds. Next on the platter was Paneer Dahi Tikki that exudes of white pepper powder, green chilli and ginger garlic paste along with paneer. The dahi oozed into our mouth and that was the best feeling one could get while eating this dish.Lahore Subz Sheek Kebab was a mix of vegetables like carrots, beans, cauliflower, potato and roasted channa with bread crumbs. It comes in a crispy layer and the taste of sauf will be the first that you will notice along with the vegetables as you chew it.The breads served at Tiger Trail are something that can only be found here. Out of the four that was served, ajwani naan and chironji naan had ajwani and chironji patted over them respectively. Sheermal had oil made in Kashmiri chilli smothered over it. Though the thought of chilli made us think twice before having it, it did not make the bread spicy.All of this was served with Methi Paneer. The gravy of it reminded one of the gravy in Malai Korma served in restaurants. It was loaded with cashewnut powder to make it taste rich. The paneer was soft and left a slight hint of kasuri methi as we put it on our tongue.Another accompaniment was Mutton Roghan Josh. Unlike the usual spicy rich mutton curries, this red gravy was light and soothing.Khubani ka Meetha with Twist was a perfect end to the meal. Anyone familiar with Khubani ka Meetha will know that it is a rich dessert made with apricots. The twist here was that it was served with a layer of custard over the top. Make sure you scoop it from the bottom to get the rich taste of soaked apricots which is balanced with custard.The apricots picked for the dish originated from Srisailam Tiger Reserve near Hyderabad. It is a common feature at Hyderabadi weddings."

Moreover, since it is located on the canal bund and restrictions have been imposed on vehicle movement in the area, even if the wholesale market is kept open it will not be accessible. The local vendors are sourcing the vegetable from other areas and hence, the increase in prices coupled with the shortage of vegetables, said K Sivashankar, a roadside vegetable vendor in Satyana rayanapuram.Out of fear, people are hoarding veggies in large quantities for the next 12 days. Even if vegetables arrive tomorrow, the cost may touch the sky. So, we are buying and stocking them for the next fortnight, explained P Sirisha of Ayodhya Nagar.However, the marketing officials in Krishna district say there is no need to worry. We decided to open rythu bazaars in the city, round-the-clock during Krishna Pushkarams. We are also operating as many as 20 mobile rythu bazaars in areas that are at considerable distance from the nearest rythu bazaar, said J Ravi Kumar, assistant director of marketing.There are six rythu bazaars in the city including the one at Ibrahimpatnam and running them round-the-clock will certainly help. When pointed out that potatoes, tomatoes and onions are not grown in Vijayawada region and have to be imported from other parts, the official said they have made alternate arrangements even though restrictions on vehicles have been imposed in Vijayawada.The government itself will supply potatoes, onions and tomatoes to rythu bazaars during Pushkarams. Potatoes are being imported from Agra and Indore, onions from Maharashtra and tomatoes from Madanapalle in Chittoor district, said Ramesh Babu, officer in-charge of Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar but public, continues to be apprehensive."

I am accepting things which I can use. Rice and coconut can be resold. Bamboo will be used in fencing and wooden planks for furniture, Palai said.With rural Odisha facing currency crisis and most of the panchayats still remaining unbanked, people have adopted barter system to purchase essential commodities and manage their daily requirements.Barter is an old system of exchange of goods and services without involving money. Treated as cashless economy, it is usually a reciprocal medium of exchange, benefiting both the parties - giver and taker.While people in urban Odisha are using debit or credit cards to make payments, communities in rural areas have turned to the older form of cashless payment. Other things apart, rice, which is abundantly available after the autumn harvest, has become a common medium of exchange.Unlike coastal areas, people in hilly and forest regions have been availing goods, grocery items and vegetables in exchange of forest produces like honey and resin. Even as the Centre chalked out a series of measures for smooth flow of cash into rural areas, this barter system proved beneficial for people like daily wager Dibakar Soren (62) who is yet to have a bank account.I purchased one kg potato, 250 gms dal, 500 gms onion and some spices in exchange of one litre of honey. I have two old Rs 500 notes, but none is willing to accept it. The bank, where I can exchange the notes is seven km away, Soren, a resident of Jashipur in Mayurbhanj district, said.Adding to the woes of senior citizens, the officials have paid them old-age pension in old currency notes.In many parts of the State, two persons have been provided one Rs 500 note and one Rs 100 note asking them to exchange the old one and divide the amount. People above the age of 60 years are entitled to get Rs 300 each as old-age pension.While there are reports of dharna by pensioners in front of panchayat offices in protest against the payment through banned currency notes, people in several districts staged demonstrations before cooperative banks demanding exchange of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."

Another private cold storage is likely to operate in a month is set to bring more cheer for the community.Administrative sources said there were no cold storage facilities in Sundargarh and Bonai sub-divisions and a private cold storage facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela city in Panposh sub-division was the only option.Inaugurating the 5,000 tonne capacity facility in Bargaon block in the last week of October, District Collector Bhupendra Singh Poonia said another cold storage facility of similar capacity will be operational along National Highway 143 in Bonai sub-division. The administration is extending all possible help to private promoters to set up cold storage units and boost the agriculture sector. The farmers are also being asked to cultivate more cash crops like vegetables which would help them earn suitable profits and at the same time reduce the demand supply gap.However, a half-constructed private cold storage unit at Kirei of Sundargarh town has failed to take off allegedly due to the laxity of the promoter. The district administration has sought return of around two acres of land allotted for the purpose.Deputy Director, Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Barik said, private promoters are showing interest in setting up cold storages and a fresh proposal for Tangarpali block is under consideration. More promoters are evincing interest as under the Government prescribed norms a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes costs about `4 crore and the Government is giving a subsidy of about `2.8 crore along with 50 to 20 per cent cut on electricity bills for six years."

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

But farmers are seemingly discouraged to take potato cultivation due to high price of certified seed potato of K-Jyoti variety at `35.5 per kg.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the administration also plans to cover 133 ha in Gurundia, Rajgangpur, Kutra and Lefripara blocks under the convergence initiative of horticulture and watershed schemes. So far, 1,200 quintals of total 2,082 quintals of seed potato have been supplied and farmers in the four blocks would get incentive of `30,000 per ha under convergence initiative, he added.In the rest 13 blocks, potato farmers registered under Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana (RKVY) would be entitled to get incentives of `20,000 per ha. He said a section of the farmers have resorted to germination of seed potatoes and sowing would continue till December in the district.About onion cultivation, he informed that 160 ha are covered under the State Plan Scheme and 16 quintals of seed onion have been supplied at a subsidised cost of `250 per kg. The DDH claimed that in rest of the district, farmers have taken up onion cultivation on 940 ha at their own and onion seeds are being developed at nurseries for transplantation after 45 days.Sources said sandy loam soil is most suitable for potato crop with each ha requiring about 15 quintals of seed potato and after 105 days, the average potato yield is expected to be 10 tonnes per ha in the district. Similarly, each ha requires 10 kg of seed onion and after 150 days, each ha is likely to produce 10 tonnes of onion on an average.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said to boost potato and onion cultivation, adequate cold storage facilities are required. He hoped the recently opened cold storage facility in Bargaon block of 5,000 tonnes capacity and an existing facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela would be helpful to some extent.Potato farmers, however, continue to be worried about market uncertainties as in 2015, potato price had crashed drastically leading to distress sale of locally grown crops."

You will be marvelled at the lush green vegetable farm spreading over nearly 40 cents of land.At a time when pesticide free vegetables are becoming a luxury, this little farm owned by C V Thankappan, a 72-year-old farmer, is providing produce to a section of residents in Irumpanam area. If not for Thankappan, the barren land owned by PWD would have ended up as a waste dumping yard. As a kind gesture, the PWD officials allowed Thankappan to use the land for cultivation some 47 years ago, under one condition that whenever they come up with any project, he has to vacate the plot.Thankappan resides in a small house opposite the PWD plot. When he was allowed to temporarily use the land, he thought of cultivating vegetables. Now even after 47 years, PWD is yet to launch a project there, but Thankappan has conserved the land very well. I will always and forever thank the PWD authorities for allowing me to cultivate their plot for past 47 years. I could look after my familys needs by cultivating the land and selling the produce, said Thankappan He has received the best farmer award of Thiruvankulam Panchayat twice. His farm boasts of vegetables like beans, spinach, sweet potato, tapioca, chilly, elephant yam and brinjal. I sell my produce for half the existing price at the market. The reason behind slashing the price is that I want to make sure the public gets good quality product at a low price, said Thankappan.Before cultivating the PWD land, Thankappan used to lease land from Madhavan Nayar, a resident of Irumpanam. Madhavans land was taken over by the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC) 47 years back to construct its plant at Irumpanam. Following this he requested the then PWD officials to grant him permission to cultivate their barren land. Agriculture has been his passion since childhood and he nurtures his plants with utmost care. The daily buyers vouch for Thankappans vegetables because he uses only organic fertilisers.Being a staff of a private bus, which plies along Kakkanad-Tripunithura route, Iget to see the old man working daily in land from 6 am in the morning. We could see him toiling hard when we make the last trip, said Faizal B.What disturbs Thankappan at present is that some people have started to dump garbage on the land. They usually dump waste during night. Every morning, I collect the waste and dispose it off either by burning or burying, adds Thangappan."

And in the absence of storage facilities, the farmers incurred huge losses. Furthermore, they did not get the promised incentive from the government.""We have no trust in the government. It has betrayed us twice,"" said B Barik, a farmer from the Balasore district.In a bid to encourage farmers to grow potatos, the state government had announced an incentive of Rs 20,000 per hectare. The Directorate of Horticulture has advised farmers interested in the government scheme to register their names in the offices of the local assistant agriculture officers or assistant horticulture officers.The Directorate has made arrangements for the supply of certified potato seeds to registered farmers, who will pay the cost up front. The subsidy amount will be transfered to their accounts.Meanwhile, the Directorate of Horticulture has invited nationalised banks in the state to credit subsidy for the DBT scheme under Rastriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), National Horticulture Mission (NHM) and other schemes of the government.The State Potato Mission launched at the end of 2014-15 had mandated the Directorate of Horticulture to create self-sufficiency in potato production, storage and distribution over the next three years.Since the state is procuring potato seeds from outside agencies, the mission has set a target to produce about 1.20 lakh tonnes of certified seed potatoes. The government has not become self-sufficient in seed production even in the second year of the mission.The Horticulture directorate has requested all the district collectors to hold mission committees and entrust all line departments for increasing potato area coverage in their districts."

Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.  I used to sell a minimum of 10,000 coconuts per day and a maximum of 50,000. In the past one month, my minimum has been 3,000 and the maximum has not crossed 25,000, he said."

But, lack of assured irrigation, agriculture infrastructure and direct market linkage to farmers are holding the districts agro-economy back.Sources said relying on monsoon, the district produces about six lakh tonnes of paddy from 2.13 lakh hectares (ha) in kharif season. Similarly, non-paddy crops are grown on one lakh ha including vegetable crops on 22,460 ha during kharif season as Sundargarh is considered one of the leading districts in vegetable production. It also produces horticulture crops like mango, banana and litchi besides huge amount of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) including mohua and tamarind.Senior scientist and head of Sundargarh Krishi Vigyan Kendra-II Jayant Pati said resource persons from College of Agriculture Engineering and Technology are educating NTFP collectors on value-addition of forest produces. To boost the agriculture economy, the farmers should go for high-value crops like sweet corn, capsicum, baby corn, pulses and oil seeds on upland. The district needs to enhance assured irrigation coverage to ensure double or triple crops in a year and develop infrastructure like food processing industries, cold storage facilities and provide direct market linkage, he suggested.Sources said of its 3.13 lakh ha cultivable land, the district has maximum assured irrigation for about 54,000 ha in kharif season while it is less than 20,000 ha in rabi season.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said Sundargarh has about 1.63 lakh ha upland. The farmers should do away with the risky paddy crops and go for non-paddy crops, he added.Citing his own experience of loss of potato crops in 2015, progressive farmer Bijay Xalxo said the district needs adequate cold storage facilities, direct market linkage, assured irrigation and food processing units.As of now, the infrastructure for farmers remains most neglected. A wholesale market yard in Rourkela proposed at an estimated cost of `98 crore is hanging fire for years while the only private cold storage on about 1,500 ha at Rourkela is not adequate.In May, Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray had written to the State Government for mapping of panchayat level potential to boost pulse production. Incidentally, Sundargarh farmers produce about 1.09 lakh tonnes of pulses in kharif season alone without any support."

With limited production of quality seeds, there is a huge gap between supply and demand.The Government Task Force on Potato Mission has estimated that the State's requirement of tuber seed at 1.2 lakh tonnes by 2017-18.The Government has been procuring large quantities of potato seeds from West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh every year to meet the demand. This not only drains the State exchequer but also results in reduction of quality due to long distance transport.The Task Force had recommended for seed production to be done inside the State with private involvement. The potato seeds to be produced by UTIPL will be marketed inside the State and in Eastern India.The company will get 10 acres of land at Deras farm for establishment of tissue culture laboratory and 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput for seed multiplication with usual Government rent for a period of 15 years.The company will establish the required infrastructure and seed multiplication at their own cost which will be around `20 crore, official sources said.However, the State Government will provide infrastructure support like road connectivity, electricity and water supply to the project sites."

In November 2015, the print was (-)2.04 per cent.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)24.10 per cent in November, saw deflationary pressure for the third consecutive month.

A bowlful of these golden temptations vanishes in minutes, whether placed in front of kids or adults.This universally loved wonderful snack occupies a position that it richly deserves, in the country where it is born, respected and also consumed in large quantities. Belgium honours potato fries with a museum called the Friet Museum where one can learn about the history of potato and how potato fries came about. This museum is in Bruges, Belgium: first and the only of its kind in the world.In the canal-woven city of Bruges (Brugge: Dutch) that reminded me of Venice, I tagged along with my guide Caroline, wonder-eyed.I found the historic centre - a UNESCO World Heritage Site even more enchanting. Through the ancient structures and the romantic horse carriages, we walked back in time to the medieval Europe. Caroline led me to the 14th century Gothic Saaihalle (former wool hall), one of the oldest buildings in the historic centre, where the unique Friet museum is located.On the ground floor, we learnt about the interesting history of the potato, which originated in Peru more than 10,000 years ago, since wild potatoes were found in several tombs in Peru and Chile. Out of the 400 ancient objects that were displayed, the oldest were the Inca vases representing different types of potatoes. The well-preserved vases, though dated from the pre-Columbian period, looked stylish and modern. We moved on to learn how the wild potato became a cultivated plant and how then the plant travelled from Peru to Europe, and to Belgium.There is no scientific or historical proof relating to the origin of the fries. In Belgium, it is attributed to the Mosane region, where the inhabitants along the river Meuse, caught small fish and fried them whole for their meal. In the 1750s, when the rivers froze, making fishing impossible, people cut potatoes into slices resembling small fish and fried them. That is how fries were born.Paul IIegems, an author of several books about fries and fry shops, gives a different story. One of the first places to cultivate potatoes in the 16th century was in the gardens of a monastery in Seville- Spain, built by Teresa of Avila. She used to attribute curative properties to potatoes and feed them to the sick. As the Spanish cook in olive oil, it is possible, that potato was cut into pieces or sliced, to cook faster. Belgians traditionally cook potato fries in two stages, to obtain the best taste: first at 150 degrees and later at 180 degrees centigrade. The first stage lasts four to eight minutes, depending on the thickness of the fries and the type of potato used. This forms a crust, which protects the inside of the fry. Then the fries are shaken to remove excess oil and prevent them from sticking to one another.When you speak of fries, you cant ignore the wonderful dip that goes with it. The word mayonnaise stems from the name Mahon, and appeared in history as Mahonnaise in the mid 18th century, in commemoration of the taking of the fortress of Port-Mahon in Minorca. Faced with a shortage of food supplies, the cooks of the French army had to make do with only oil and eggs for long periods. This is how the first mayonnaise came into being, purely by chance. When the army returned to France, where only thickened and cooked sauces were known, this new sauce whipped in the Richelieu style, offered new possibilities to French cooking.Why are they called French fries?Here too there is a story involved: during the first World War, some French speaking Belgian soldiers offered potato chips to the American soldiers, who thought the Belgian soldiers were French, hence the origin of the name French fries.After touring both the floors, we came down enlightened and eager to taste the fries in the medieval cellars. Hot fries disappeared from the bowl, as they melted in our mouths: with the luscious and buttery mayonnaise, they tasted heavenly. I said to Caroline, Whats in a name? French or Belgianwouldnt fries by any other name taste as delicious? Engrossed in relishing the fries, she agreed with a smile and an approving nod.Fed on fries sumptuously, we walked for two more hours to burn the calories.

When one takes a long hard look at the CPM camp and the developments in the party-controlled channel one cannot help wonder whether the CMs words have turned out to be prophetic.Fissures have started appearing in the cadre party for which the only cause of headache so far was the unpredictable tantrums of Comrade VS. Self-declared coteries have been the downfall of many a strong leader. When a group takes over the patronage and promotion of a leader it slowly alienates the leader from the masses and plain speaking well-wishers. The version of the coterie becomes the last word. Systems and process go for a toss.A senior editor and another employee of the party controlled channel were suspended for having links with a news website. Interestingly, the said site had given a series of news reports tarnishing the party and some of its leaders while trying hard to build a larger than life image of the CM.Most notable were reports about former area secretary Zakir Hussain accused in many criminal cases and councillor Jayanthan allegedly involved in a case of gang rape.The incident of gang rape, the leaders identity and the victims attempt to get in touch with the Chief Minister were first given out by this site, which obviously raised a few eyebrows. The site also worked overtime to create an image that the current CM thinks above party politics and have initiated stringent action against the accused leaders.All these, while party leaders were working overtime to defend the local chieftains. Ernakulam district secretary P Rajeeve said that all cases except one were slapped against Zakir Hussain for being part of political agitations. The party has also launched a parallel investigation by Elamaram Kareem into the allegations.Thrissur district secretary K Radhakrishnan invited the wrath of the party central leadership and womens organisations when he divulged the name of the victim in an attempt to defend the councillor.State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan came up with a lengthy article in the party mouthpiece justifying the partys actions of intervening in disputes. A considerable length of this was spent to defend Zakir Hussain. Kodiyeri repeated Rajeeves version on cases against the ousted area secretary and alleged that he was included in the goonda list by the former government to malign CPM.Ironically the state secretarys justification came a day after Kerala Police filed a report saying Zakir Hussain is a rowdy! This was followed by another case on him. Another example of unbiased rule?There are reports that a section of the party is unhappy with the way the party and some leaders are undermined to polish and project the image of the Chief Minister. The fingers point at some advisors of the CM.The same rumblings were heard when E P Jayarajan was dropped like a hot potato. They want to believe all this is without the knowledge of the CM. The allegation doing the rounds is that the loyal than the king over enthusiasm of certain extra party elements to toe a Pinarayi first line has led to the impasse.They had taken it up with the party leadership and demanded that this unbridled run be curbed in the larger interests of the party which seems to have prompted the action against the channel duo. It remains to be seen whether this is the end of the story or the first of many episodes which could eclipse the clear and massive mandate of the people."

Three elements are cooked separately for this thin soup. The chicken in this lacked meaty flavour though.Then came dimsums. Truffle Scented Edamame Dumplings has a green edamame placed on the top it.

My love for travelling has not only helped me explore new places but also gives me the opportunity to meet people from different cultures, try out food from different cuisines and get acquainted with exotic ingredients. These special ingredients are great to play around  as they test ones creativity, they also lead to some experimentation with unique and innovative recipes. Two ingredients which I really enjoy cooking with are John Dory also known as St Pierre or Peters Fish and the black truffle, popularly known as the black diamond of kitchen.I believe it takes a great understanding of gastronomy and palate along with little creativity to bring forth some delectable recipes. One such recipe, which is really close to my heart is Pan-seared John Dory with Black Truffle and Sweet Potato Mash along with Martini Veloute, Red Wine Sauce and Buttered Vegetables.This dish is very simple, yet an intricate amalgamation of unique flavours bringing together the mild taste and texture of the fish with one of the rare ingredients in the world  black truffle. This unusual fish needs to be cooked in a hot pan, basted with butter and thyme. For the mashed potatoes, you need to boil the sweet potatoes in milk and then mash them into a smooth paste with a few dollops of butter and shaved truffle. Season it with some salt and pepper according to your liking. Stir fry seasonal vegetables with butter and plate them along with Martini Veloute and red wine sauce. For making the Martini Veloute, all you need to do is reduce vermouth with sweet onion and cream. The red wine sauce is no rocket science, just a de-glazed pan with red wine. Surprisingly, it adds an exquisite taste to the dish and goes very well with the texture of the fish.Both these ingredients are unique in their own territory and this dish brings together the mild taste and unique texture of John Dory along with the flavour of the rarest ingredient in the world  black truffle.Ramasamy Selvaraju, Executive Chef, Vivanta by Taj"

This is an attempt to malign my and partys image by the BJP and Akali Dal in Punjab, as they are scared by the growing popularity of AAP. I will file a defamation case against him said Singh.Sherawat, wrote in an open letter to the AAPs National President and Delhi Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal yesterday criticizing the justification put forward by party spokesperson Ashutosh on Sandeep Kumar issue. Further, directly attacking Singh, Sherawat said the he has seen disturbing reports about women being exploited in Punjab in return for ticket to fight elections and that the party high command is unaware about his deeds as party representatives in Punjab.The controversy becomes a political hot potato for the AAP as Punjab is heading to elections next year, with high stakes for the party.Sehrawat had also hit out at AAP's Delhi unit convener Dilip Pandey, questioning his conduct in the national capital and said that the situation is becoming indefensible and disgraceful. Action needs to be taken to remove rotten elements.All the allegations are baseless, I have worked for decades in politics and that has been recognized by the party and hence I am here.

Thats how we have Moplah Food Festival happening at Aish, The Park which will be on till November 20.So what exactly is the new fetish about Moplah food? Its a region of North Kerala dominated by Muslim population who trace their roots to the Arabs as the latter came to the region for the trade of spices and silk. Talk about spices and the same reflects in the cuisine. Chef Abida Rasheed speaks amiably dropping abundant portions on our plates asking the stewards to bring more warm food. There was not command in her tone but affection that reflects in the dishes she so lovingly cooks. We enjoyed eating Mutton Ishtew that had the desired consistency, neither gooey nor sticky  just the right thickness that you can relish with Kerala Parota. The potatoes were succulent and dissolved with the curry, the mutton pieces were juicy and soft. The green coriander leaves just added the ghar ka khana bit. Food needs to be cooked in clay pots as the same give breathing space to your food which keeps your food fresh for a longer time, said the chef.Its not just clay pots that do the wonder, the use of ghee gives the food its own deliciously different taste thats how the mutton biryani she cooked turned out to be really different from what we eat in Hyderabad, Calcutta or Lucknow. The rice used wasnt the long-grained biryani rice, instead the grains were smaller and better known as Khaima rice. She describes, Earlier this rice used to grow in valleys and as the wind blew the crop became more fragrant. It cooks really well giving the biryani its unique texture.We relished Kozhi Nirachathu, pot roasted chicken with deep-fried onion gravy that had that subtle sweet flavour. Begum Abida added, We use spring chickens that dont weigh more than 400 gms. The bones of these chickens give that special flavour and taste to the curry.And not just these dishes there are a variety to be relished such as: Meen Porichattu, Vada with thenga manga chutney, Kadala Kari, Parupu Kari and more. It was the dessert which amazed us. The egg yolk and white had been separated and cooked differently. The egg white was steamed with sugar, while the yolk was whisked and dropped in loops in hot boiling sugar syrup which gave it noodle like shape and consistency. It was topped on the sweet steamed white. Any guesses for the name? Its that famous Mutta Mala people associated Moplah cuisine with.Price: `999 all inclusive for lunch and `1,495 all inclusive for dinner."

(Photo | AP)OHIO: She is a mother of three, grandmother of 16, great-grandmother of 12 and great-great-grandmother of three. She recently had surgery to remove a malignant tumor, but doctors say she's doing well.She's Colo, the nation's oldest living gorilla, and she turned 60 on Thursday at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.Colo was the first gorilla in the world born in a zoo and has surpassed the usual life expectancy of captive gorillas by two decades. Her longevity is putting a spotlight on the medical care, nutrition and up-to-date therapeutic techniques that are helping lengthen zoo animals' lives.""Colo just epitomizes the advances that zoos have made, going all the way back to her birth at Columbus,"" said Dr. Tom Meehan, vice president for veterinary services at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo and veterinary adviser to a national gorilla species survival plan.The changes also mean more animals living with the normal aches and pains of growing older. Today, zoo veterinarians regularly treat animals for heart and kidney disease, arthritis, dental problems and cancer.Hundreds of people gathered at the zoo Thursday to see Colo, singing ""Happy Birthday"" moments before the gorilla ambled into an enclosure decorated with multicolored construction paper chains and filled with cakes such as squash and beet and cornbread with mashed potato parsley frosting.Among the first in line was Pam Schlereth of Columbus, who at 63 was just a little girl when her father brought her to see the newborn Colo in a gorilla incubator in 1956.""It's a tribute to the zoo that she's alive at 60 years old,"" Schlereth said.Colo represents so much to the zoo, Tom Stalf, president of the zoo, told the crowd. ""It's all about connecting people and wildlife,"" he said.Colo is one of several elderly gorillas around the country. The oldest known living male gorilla, Ozzie, is 55 years old and lives at the Atlanta Zoo, which has a geriatric gorilla specialty.At Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo, staff members use acupuncture, massage, laser therapy, and heat and joint supplements to help Emma, a 13-year-old rabbit.At the National Zoo in Washington, Shanthi, a 42-year-old Asian elephant with arthritis, receives osteoarthritis therapy and was recently fitted with specially crafted front foot boots to help her feet heal as medications are applied.In Oakland, California, Tiki, a 27-year-old giraffe and one of the oldest in the nation, gets foot care, massage therapy, acupuncture and chiropractic care, along with traditional veterinary medicine. Gao Gao, a 26-year-old male panda at the San Diego Zoo with a heart condition, periodically undergoes cardiac ultrasounds.""Geriatrics is probably one of our most common medical challenges that we face in a zoo situation,"" said Dr. Keith Hinshaw, director of animal health at the Philadelphia Zoo. ""So pretty much anything that you could imagine would happen with an older person is going to happen eventually with any animal.""That's up to and including medication: JJ, a 45-year-old orangutan at the Toledo Zoo, is on the human heart medicines carvedilol and Lisinopril, along with pain and orthopedic medications. He also takes Metamucil.Colo, a western lowland gorilla, holds several other records. On her 56th birthday in 2012, she exceeded the record for longest-lived gorilla. On Thursday, she surpasses the median life expectancy for female gorillas in human care (37.5 years) by more than two decades."

""This year, they had a scheduling conflict. Actually, they just couldn't take my jokes anymore,"" the president said.His nephews, Austin and Aaron Robinson, filled in admirably. Obama joked they had not yet been turned cynical by Washington. ""They still believe in bad puns. They still believe in the grandeur of this occasion,"" Obama said. ""They still have hope.""The White House asked people on Twitter to vote for which turkey will receive the pardon, though both will get a reprieve. The White House even provided a biography for each bird to help voters with their decision. For example, Tater's favorite snack is worms. Tot prefers tomato slices. Each 18-week-old bird weighed in at about 40 pounds.While only one could be named the ""National Thanksgiving Turkey,"" the White House said that both birds will be sent to their new home at Virginia Tech's ""Gobblers Rest"" where they will be cared for by veterinarians and students.The ceremony also gave Obama a chance to reflect on the spirit of Thanksgiving. Obama said it's a time to remember that ""we have a lot more in common than divides us."" He also challenged Americans to show the world that the United States is a generous and giving country, and to make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving.After the ceremony, the president and first family served Thanksgiving meals to residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington. The campus is home to 405 previously enlisted service members, who represent every campaign since World War I. Obama served the turkey and gravy and briefly chatted with veterans and workers as they went through the line.First lady Michelle Obama served beans and spinach, while Sasha provided the mashed potatoes, dressing and cranberry sauce.The pardoning ceremony brings levity to the endless list of serious issues the president faces daily.

""I think they should disarm. Immediately. What do you think. Yes? Take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Take them. Let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away, OK. It will be very dangerous.""It was the most recent onslaught in a presidential election in which sober policy discussion has been drowned out by personal insults, character assassinations, and base offensives.It is also rife with conspiracy theory - this week, Mr Trump revived the debate around where President Barack Obama was born. He finally admitted that Mr Obama was born in the United States, but then tried to blame Mrs Clinton, accusing his Democratic rival of initiating the doubts.Meanwhile, a release of hacked emails written by Colin Powell, the Secretary of State under George W Bush and a friend of Hillary Clinton's, revealed that while he would support Mrs Clinton, he would ""rather not have to vote for her"".He described the Democratic presidential nominee as having ""a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational."" The election has become a fight between two pensioners almost equally disliked by the nation. Polls show the pair are now two of the most hated candidates in the country's recent political history. More than half of the nation - 54.9 per cent - have an ""unfavourable"" view of Mrs Clinton according to an average of polls on the issue. It is statistic beaten only by Mr Trump, who is intensely disliked by almost 60 per cent of the country.Many American are left asking a phrase now frequently repeated on the 24-hour news channels: ""We're a country of 300 million - and this is the best we can do?""Welcome to America's unpopularity contest.This time, it's personalAll elections have their bitter moments, but this year's bid to the most powerful office in the world has sunk to unprecedented lows.As Mrs Clinton has been keen to point out, Mr Trump has often treated his election campaign as if it were another of his reality television shows.His own friends admit that he revels in the drama of personal attacks, and likes to make news by sending out insulting tweets ""before he gets out of bed"". Mr Trump has declared that Mrs Clinton is ""totally unhinged"" and ""unbalanced"".Mrs Clinton is anticipating being mocked or attacked at this month's presidential debate over her husband Bill Clinton's notorious affair with Monica Lewinsky.Earlier this year a tweet was sent from Mr Trump's account which read: ""If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?"" Mrs Clinton has responded by releasing stand up comedy routines mocking her rival.She recently used a tag-line from Mr Trump's show The Apprentice to attack him on the economy: ""We shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are, 'You're fired'."" Meanwhile, her campaign has released an application called ""Trump yourself"", which adorns the Facebook profile picture of anyone who signs up with insulting quotes by the Republican candidate. ""Fat pig"" reads one. ""You sweat like a dog,"" reads another.Big business tiesLast week, Bill Clinton belatedly celebrated his 70th birthday. The event, a fundraiser for The Clinton Foundation in New York, saw the great and the good mingling: among them Jon Bon Jovi and Barbra Streisand. And yet, despite being billed as a party, the event was heavy with politics.The Clinton Foundation has come under intense scrutiny from allies of Donald Trump, with the charitable organisation portrayed as a way for Mrs Clinton to grant favours to international donors. The Clintons have said there has never been any evidence of wrongdoing. Yet for many, the lingering suspicion remains.A Newsweek article last week made even more damning allegations about Mr Trump and his sprawling global business empire. The report described him as ""the most conflicted president in American history,"" and said that his business interests in India, South Korea, Turkey, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey were of deep concern.Mr Trump's links to Russia have also become a political hot potato - with the billionaire businessman praising Vladimir Putin.Health stumblesIf Mr Trump wins the election, it will make him the oldest newly elected president in US history - Ronald Reagan was just shy of 70 when he was inaugurated in 1981. If Mrs Clinton wins, it will make her, at 69, the second oldest behind Reagan.With 51 days to go, Mrs Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis and Mr Trump's high testosterone levels have drowned out almost everything else.""The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health,"" joked Mrs Clinton after returning to the fray from three days of rest.But the fact that she covered up her illness for three days cut deep: by the end of the episode, her poll ratings had sunk from 51 per cent of Americans supporting her in August, down to 42 per cent.The staunchly pro-Trump New York Post took to calling her ""Illary,"" and absurd conspiracy theories circulated - including that she has Parkinson's or even uses a body double because she cannot cope with the pace of campaigning.Mr Trump's week was scarcely less ridiculous. He seized the opportunity to glorify his own vital statistics - appearing, with typical Trump showmanship, on a television chat show hosted by Dr Mehmet Oz to boast about his health. He admitted he was overweight - borderline obese, according to his BMI - and that he did not eat healthily or exercise. But, he said, he had a wonderful golf swing.Values abandonedRonald Reagan called America the ""shining city on the hill"", a beacon of hope for the free world. But in this election, this view of the United States has become lost in the fog.Mr Trump has rejected the notion that America should play any role as the world's moral arbitrator. And he has rebuffed free-market inspired trade deals, in favour of a nativist, insular and protectionist view.Values issues have affected Democrats too. Mrs Clinton is increasingly perceived as adapting her values and policy beliefs according to what is politically expedient.For example, as secretary of state she pushed for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal with a dozen Pacific rim countries.But as a presidential candidate she has abandoned it, because many voters fear it will result in more manual labour jobs going overseas."

The guest list makes this 13th and final state dinner among the largest of Obama's presidency.""We saved the best for last,"" Obama said somewhat wistfully as he welcomed the Italians during a pageantry-filled South Lawn arrival ceremony on an unseasonably warm, mid-October day.On the way to dinner, guests were being invited to tour Mrs. Obama's world-famous ""kitchen"" garden. She and Landini sipped tea there together earlier Tuesday.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the highest-ranking Italian American in U.S. politics, and her husband, Paul Pelosi, are among the guests. Other Italian Americans on the list are former race car driver Mario Andretti, fashion designer Giorgio Armani, actor John Turturro and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Celebrity chef Mario Batali was helping the White House kitchen crew prepare the meal, and Grammy Award-winning singer Gwen Stefani was on tap to perform after the tables have been cleared. Not only did Batali collaborate on dinner, he was also invited to attend as a guest.The list of expected guests also included hairstylist Yene Damtew, whose website describes her as one of two personal hair stylists to the Obama family, and Carl Ray, Michelle Obama's make-up artist.The menu was designed to showcase traditional Italian dishes that Americans are familiar with and feature ingredients pulled from Mrs. Obama's garden during this month's final harvest.Batali, executive chef Cristeta Comerford and pastry chef Susie Morrison settled on a menu of sweet potato ravioli with browned butter and sage, warm butternut squash salad and beef pinwheels, an Italian classic, served with broccoli rabe. Dessert is a green apple crostata, or Italian tart, served with buttermilk gelato, or Italian ice cream.""It's such an incredibly, well-orchestrated thing, but you have to get the food out superfast,"" Rick Bayless, one of the country's most respected voices when it comes to Mexican food, said in an interview from one of his Chicago restaurants. Bayless is friends with the Obamas and, in 2009, they enlisted him as ""guest chef"" for a 200-person White House state dinner for Mexico.Batali, a restaurant owner, cookbook author and authority on Italian cuisine, seemed to have things under control by midday Tuesday.His very active Twitter page featured near hourly postings, including photos of him with the four chefs who accompanied him from New York, of him on the presidential basketball court sporting his signature pair of orange Crocs, of him with Obama dogs Bo and Sunny, and of dinner ingredients in various stages of preparation, including a close-up of the almost-ready beef pinwheels.Obama has held 13 state dinners during nearly eight years in office, two more than President George W.

Rescuers in Coast Guard helicopters plucked some of them from rooftops and used military vehicles to reach others, including a woman who held on to a tree for three hours after her car was overrun by flood waters.In another dramatic rescue, a woman with her small child perched on the roof of her car had to be helped to safety as the waters rose around them, underscoring how quickly Matthew wreaked havoc 100 miles or more inland after sparing much of the Southeastern coast the catastrophic damage once feared.The storm killed more than 500 people in Haiti and at least 17 in the U.S.  nearly half of them in North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory said authorities were searching for five people and feared they may find more victims. The problems were far from over as all that rain  more than a foot in places  flows into rivers and downstream, likely causing days of major flooding in many of the same places devastated by a similar deluge from Hurricane Floyd in 1999.""Hurricane Matthew is off the map. But it is still with us. And it is still deadly,"" McCrory said.More than a million people in South Carolina and North Carolina were without power, and at least four separate sections of Interstate 95  the main artery linking the East Coast from Florida to Maine  were closed in North Carolina.The ferocity of the rain caught people by surprise.""The forecast said it wasn't supposed to be anything major. Just rain and wind. Well, considering what happened weeks prior with the rain and combined with this, Mother Nature's at its best,"" said Lamont England, who was trying Sunday to get to his parents' home in Fayetteville.In Wilson County, rescuers were called when a 63-year-old woman didn't make it home from work. They heard her cries for help while riding on top of a Humvee, and when they couldn't get her with a rope, a National Guard soldier swam to her, staying until a rescue boat arrived, Emergency Management Director Gordon Deno said.Even animals had to be saved. WRAL-TV showed a dog swimming around floodwaters Saturday. McCrory said he and his wife were riveted by the coverage and relieved to find out from the Coast Guard that the dog managed to get into a tree and rescue it.Most of the dead were swept away by flood waters. The governor said there were rural areas that search and rescue teams hadn't been able to make it to and places that flooded overnight.""There could be some backroads where we had people swept away. I'm praying that is not going to be,"" McCrory said.The rainfall totals were staggering: Nearly 15 inches in Fayetteville and 8 inches in Raleigh. McCrory warned that cities along rivers in eastern North Carolina needed to be prepared for days of flooding. The Lumber River in Lumberton was 4 feet above its record level Sunday afternoon and was forecast to remain there for at least five days.Shortly before daybreak, the hurricane was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. As of 2 p.m. EDT, the storm was centered about 150 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving out to sea. It still had hurricane-force winds of 75 mph.Elsewhere along the Atlantic coast, things were slowly returning to normal. Much of Savannah, which had 17 inches of rain, was still without electricity. About 150 people stood in line for a grocery store to open like it was a Black Friday sale.Debbie Berta said she waited more than an hour to get propane gas for her grill. She also wanted ""bread, potatoes, eggs  and a piece of sanity.""Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti last week, plowing into the desperately poor country at 145 mph. The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places along the coast was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation nearer the ocean.An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in.In addition to the eight deaths in North Carolina, there were four in Florida, three in Georgia and two in South Carolina. Some were killed by falling trees, others by carbon monoxide fumes from a generator . One 66-year-old man near Columbia, South Carolina, died at a nursing facility when he got pinned under his electric wheelchair in water after the heavy rains.Property data firm CoreLogic projected that insured losses on home and commercial properties would amount to $4 billion to $6 billion, well below Hurricane Katrina's $40 billion and Superstorm Sandy's $20 billion."

Given the European Union's protracted severance procedure under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be a long time before those jaunty words can come true. Meanwhile, India has good reason to take some interest in the turmoil that is rocking Britain. First, David Cameron's prediction that the reshaping of Europe may allow Britain to seek the ""strongest possible economic link"" with ""important partners like India and China"" was a reminder that the word crisis in Chinese combines two ideograms that stand for ""danger"" and ""opportunity"". Second, many Indians must be concerned at the potentially ugly race implications of the immigration fears that underlie the EU debate. So many other skeletons (like the false statistics the Leave side is accused of using to whip up anti-EU prejudice) are tumbling out of the cupboard that Afro-Asian immigration hasn't received much attention. But some of those who voted Leave to stem the influx of continental Europeans and some who believe Britain can negotiate terms to enjoy the benefits of the 500-million-strong European free market while closing its borders to Europeans may find they have jumped from the frying pan into the fire. Britain needs skilled and unskilled labour. The health service (which uses 80 different languages) relies so heavily on foreigners that English language rules have been relaxed, creating another of the contradictions with which today's Britain bristles. Now that Britain is leaving the EU, a German-born university teacher at Oxford who has lived in the country for years has discovered he must take an English language test to qualify for naturalization. He would have been exempt if he had been taught in English at university for three years. But although he teaches at Oxford, his own first degree was in Germany; his English must, therefore, be put to the test. Once such anomalies become widely known, the British may begin to draw a line between Polish and Pakistani. One can understand why working-class South Asian immigrants in old Lancashire mill towns like Oldham voted Leave. They complain of freeloading Poles but the deeper fear is of newer immigrants who have a head start on them to begin with because of race. When Sadiq Khan, London's ethnic Pakistani mayor, bravely defends Polish newcomers (""They work, pay taxes, support the NHS, social care, the construction sector"") he is addressing white - not brown or black - resistance. A Polish immigrant's son becomes another Brit, albeit with a slightly exotic name (though that, too, can be managed), while a Pakistani-Briton remains an outsider unto the third or fourth generation. Poland's ambassador has appealed on TV against anti-Polish propaganda; Pakistan's high commissioner has not, although instances of ""Paki"" abuse have also been reported in the last few days. The media also focuses much more on anti-Polish feeling. This is not because it condones anti-Pakistani (or anti-Indian) sentiment. But it probably fears that public discussion of inter-racial strife would open a can of worms. The turmoil is evident elsewhere too. At least 3.5 million people (at last count) are demanding a second referendum. Michael Heseltine, the former Tory grandee, blames the burly, boisterous, blond Boris Johnson, a former journalist and twice mayor of London with a half-Indian wife, for plunging the country into its worst political crisis. Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian premier, blames ""the selfishness of one man who is ready to do anything to become prime minister... "". There was no concealing the pleasure on Thursday morning when that man suddenly snatched his hat back from the ring. The day before a Conservative Party member in Cheshire had suggested that having ""stabbed David Cameron in the back"" Johnson change his first name to Brutus. The morning after his key aide, Michael Gove, justice minister under Cameron, stabbed him front, back and sides, it was Johnson's turn to quote Shakespeare and suggest Gove was the real Brutus. Gove enabled Johnson to destroy Cameron. Then he turned round and destroyed Johnson. No doubt he is convinced the field is now clear for his own unhindered march into Number 10 although for years he vehemently denied any interest in the top job. But with five candidates jostling for the Tory party leadership, the chances are he has made things easier for Theresa May, the calm and composed home minister of proven competence, to become Britain's second woman prime minister. If there is any logic or reason beyond self-aggrandizement behind this murky drama, it isn't obvious to anyone. ""I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead,"" Gove explains. Apparently, he discovered in just the last four days the fatal flaws that make Johnson unsuitable for prime ministership. They had escaped his notice during a year of working closely together on the Leave campaign and undermining Cameron's leadership. As three other politicians quickly abandoned the Johnson ship - more desertions are expected over the weekend - the gossip among journalists was that The Times (London) had fired Johnson in 1988 for fabricating a quotation. His anti-Europe bias was blamed for making up the story that the EU wouldn't allow Britain to import prawn cocktail-flavoured potato crisps. He was guilty of misrepresentation even in his first comment after the results were announced by dismissing the EU as a federal system ""that is imitated nowhere else on earth"". That is incorrect. True, none of the imitators have achieved as much as the EU in terms of common economic and political institutions but it isn't for want of trying. The optimism that inspired Europeans also produced such regional partnerships as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. For reasons of history, economics and politics, Europe made much greater progress than any of the other attempts at following its lead. But the source of inspiration remains unmistakable. Theresa May thinks it will take ""several years"" for the Britain-EU divorce to be finalized. They provide opportunities for India to consolidate its position in London which, like Scotland and Wales, voted ""Remain"". London's vibrant economy as a global financial centre is expected to survive the strong challenge from Frankfurt. The city uses 200 languages. It wants to be independent of the rest of the country. Indian companies have been raising money there. The nearly 800 Indian firms (including Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra and Vedanta Resources) with a presence in London generate 19 billion annually from their UK-based operations. Some may now open offices on the continent but not at London's expense. As Britain negotiates separate free trade agreements with the remaining 27 EU countries, India must do the same with Britain. India is among the United Kingdom's top three investors and the $14 billion bilateral trade leaves considerable scope for expansion. This is also the time for India to renegotiate existing free trade agreements to enhance market access and conclude the pact with the EU that has been hanging fire for nearly a decade. India's tardiness at a time when both Britain and Europe are reconsidering alliances can only be China's gain. So much for the ""opportunity"" part of crisis. The ""danger"" is one of regret that a dream of unity foundered on the rock of nationalism. The EU itself was born of the prosaic European Coal and Steel Community but it enshrines faith in a supranational foundation that would ""make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible"" and reinforce democracy amongst its members. The hope now is that Britain's folly will not find echoes in other parts of Europe."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Its not just dal anymore; the entire vegetable basket is burning holes in pockets, prompting homemakers to squeeze their kitchen budget in the month of Shravan when many people avoid non-vegetarian food. The price-rise issue rocked the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday as well, with Trinamul Congress leader Derek OBrien saying it is worse to be vegetarian in India than a non-vegetarian because even though prices of meat and fish seems to be under control, the prices of vegetables and dal have sky-rocketed. Over the past few weeks, prices of vegetables such as including bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ladies finger, capsicum and aubergine have increased by anything between 10 and 50 per cent. Vendors in the retail markets in the city attributed the price-rise to short supply. Vegetable experts from Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa, said insect infestation in agricultural fields in the monsoon is the primary reason behind short supply of vegetables this time of the year. Besides, the floods are also affecting the vegetable supply. Vegetable farming is comparatively a more sophisticated form of farming than regular crops. While other crops like paddy and maize can be cultivated amid heavy rainfall conditions, green vegetables, especially the creeper varieties, get easily damaged under such conditions, said Udit Kumar, a vegetable expert at Rajendra Agriculture University. Fertilisers, fungicides and pesticides in the vegetable fields are normally sprayed either in the morning or evening, he added. At times, farmers are unable to spray the fertilisers and pesticides owing to heavy rainfall or flooding. The situation is aggravated in riverine areas, which are instantly flooded when the water level in rivers rises, said Udit. Vegetable vendors corroborated the experts view. Majority of the vegetables in this market come from Muzaffarpur, Motihari and Saran, said Mahavir Rai, a vendor at Punaichak vegetable market. However, a large chunk of green vegetables grown in the low-lying areas at those places either get damaged or are washed away at this time of the year owing to heavy rain. The short supply raises the prices. Majority of the vegetables in this market come from Muzaffarpur, Motihari and Saran, said Mahavir Rai, a vendor at Punaichak vegetable market. However, a large chunk of green vegetables grown in the low-lying areas at those places either get damaged or are washed away at this time of the year owing to heavy rain. The short supply raises the prices. It has been raining vigorously in north Bihar districts and neighbouring Nepal over the past fortnight. The state government has declared nine districts as flood-affected as of Wednesday and the rising water level in a number of rivers has affected agriculture activities across much larger areas. As per the daily flood bulletin issued by the disaster management department, around 60,000 hectares of croplands had been flood-affected in the state as of Tuesday. High demand While the supply of vegetables has been hit due to the rains, their demand has increased with the advent of Shravan, when a large section of Hindus abstain from eating non-vegetarian food. Health experts also suggest light diet during the rainy season. As the general hygiene is comparatively bad at this time, it is normally suggested to avoid oily and spicy food. During rainy season, chances of water-borne diseases such as jaundice, typhoid and cholera become higher, said Patna-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. Kitchen strategy Homemakers have had to adapt to the soaring vegetable prices. Although green vegetables are rich in various nutrients, I have reduced their usage lately owing to the soaring prices. I am using more of non-green vegetables like soy bean, paneer and chhola among others, said Anita Jain, a homemaker who lives on Bhattacharya Road. Restaurants are also facing the brunt of the vegetable price-rise. Though we are not altering the quality of vegetables we are serving, our profit margin has definitely dropped owing to soaring vegetable prices. We keep looking for different vendors to find the most suitable prices, said Abhishek Parmar, owner of Swadesh restaurant on Boring Road. REASONS FOR PRICES HEADING NORTH Insect-menace: Farmers are unable to spray fungicide and pesticide in the fields and creeper plants are damaged by insects very soon Flooding of riverine area: Farmland in low-lying riverine areas in places like Muzaffarpur, West Champaran and Vaishali among others inundatedHow menu is being tweaked to tackle the vegetable price-rise Usage of more potatoes and less green vegetables as the prices of potatoes have come down lately Usage of non-green vegetables like soyabean and paneer among others"

Dal sheddho (boiled pulses), alu sheddho (boiled potato) and bhat (steamed rice), with a generous helping of makhon (butter). His favourite restaurant food? Bengali fried rice. His favourite shopping destination? New Market. A Calcuttan enamoured of all things Calcutta? No, it's Welshman Neil John Taylor, the 27-year-old Swansea left-back who scored the second goal - his first for his country - in Wales's 3-0 Euro 2016 victory over Russia on Monday. Neil, whose mother Shibani Taylor nee Chakraborty, 65, is a Calcuttan from Dum Dum's Kajipara, has been coming to the city for vacations since he was a toddler and considers Calcutta his second home. The last time he was in town was in 2013 for a charity event. Since then, he has been planning a family vacation with wife Genna-Lea, daughter Madison, 5, and son Marley, 2. ""Neil is a very, very good boy. He was a tad mischievous as a kid, but he grew up to be the most polite, soft-spoken and cultured man you would ever see. He is deeply attached to this city and the family here and he is a joy to be around,"" said 53-year-old Kalindi resident Sulata Mukherjee, the Welsh star's first cousin. Sulata remembers how, as a school kid, Neil would participate in the Lakshmi Puja every Thursday at his family residence in Ruthin, Wales. ""His Bengali isn't very good, but he would flawlessly pronounce the Lakshmi stotra,"" she recalled. Only once, during his 2013 trip to the city, did he stay anywhere other than his aunt Bina Chakraborty's Gurusaday Road house. He stayed at the Taj Bengal on that occasion and loved the food at Sonargaon. ""We would play together when we were kids. He preferred cricket and badminton to football when he was here.... In 2000, when he came here, he used to sing and dance to Phir bhi dil hai Hindustani a lot,"" recounted 24-year-old Soham Mukherjee, a nephew working as an auditor in a city-based private firm. Soham and Neil's playground used to be balcony of the Gurusaday Road house. It was there that Soham first heard of Neil's days in the Manchester City Academy, where he had trained since he was 8 and till he turned 15. ""Even at that age, we knew he was meant for greatness. In para football or while playing on the balcony, you simply could not get past his left side,"" Soham smiled. Cousins and nephews also remember Neil as an aggressive right-hand batsman and a fairly fast right-arm bowler. His proficiency in badminton was no less. ""Once, in a knockout badminton series in the neighbourhood, he defeated everyone in sight,"" Soham said. Neil's maternal grandfather Satish Chandra Chakraborty was a collector in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Mother Shibani, a former airline employee, was taken to England in 1972 by her elder sister Bina, who graduated from the London School of Economics in the Sixties but returned to India to work for BHEL. In the Seventies, Shibani met Neil's father John Taylor in London. The couple settled in Ruthin and had three children: Dean, 32, Donna, 30, and the youngest, Neil. Dean, a gold medallist from the London School of Economics, is a financial analyst. Donna is a schoolteacher. Neil, of course, followed his heart and ball skills to become a professional footballer who would go on to represent Great Britain in the 2012 London Olympics alongside the likes of fellow Welshman Ryan Giggs. When staying in Bina's Gurusaday Road house during his Calcutta vacations, Neil often eats out at Kwality on Park Street or Mainland China, which is almost next door. Although Neil plays for Swansea, he is a die-hard fan of Liverpool and grew up idolising up Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard. The captain of the Wales and Swansea sides, Ashley Williams, is one of his closest friends. ""He has seen it all as an international player. He has played against the likes of Neymar. But as he puts it, his dream-come-true moment came in 2011 when he played against Liverpool and Gerrard,"" Soham said. ""That and seeing a tiger in real life in the Sunderbans, in 2000!""

File picture Agartala, July 19: The CPM in Tripura has lashed out at the Assam government and the Centre for the pitiable condition of the 20km stretch of National Highway 44, between Churaibari on the border of Tripura with Assam and Loarpura in Karimganj district. Thousands of trucks and other vehicles carrying essential commodities, including petrol, rice, potato, fish, vegetables and fruits, have been stranded on NH-44 for days, creating serious problems for Tripura, including spiralling prices and blackmarketeering of fuel. ""Neither the Assam government nor the Centre has taken any major initiative to upgrade the slushy surface of the highway between Churaibari and Loarpura despite our repeated appeals. Our PWD staff actually entered the Kathalcherri area in Karimganj district and partially repaired the alternative highway, but this is not enough. We are now urging the Centre to rush essential goods through Bangladesh,"" said CPM state secretary and central committee member Bihan Dhar here last night. Altogether, 102 vehicles, including goods-carrying trucks, entered Tripura yesterday till 7 pm but that did not ease the crisis situation, Saha said. Apart from this, chief secretary Yashpal Singh yesterday visited badly-damaged Lowerpoa at Karmganj area and assured all help to the construction firm working for repair of the highway. ""Tripura government was prepared to supply bricks and stone chips needed for construction in case they faced problems of materials. The work for repair of the damaged highway was progressing at a snail's pace,"" Singh told reporters. Saha said petroleum products could be brought through Meghalaya's Dawki to Dharmanagar via Sylhet in Bangladesh. He said the state had only 42 days' food stocks and in such situation urgent steps were needed to be taken by the central government for dispatching foodgrains. ""Despite state's repeated request to the Centre for urgent interference in the situation, it was just playing the role of onlooker. It is nothing but a conspiracy,"" Saha added. In another development, chief minister Manik Sarkar has called on officers and employees of his government to take the administration to the doorstep of the people. Inaugurating the newly launched Kalacherra block in the Dharmanagar subdivision of North Tripura, Sarkar said, ""Let this new building, comprising 16 gram panchayats, provide all necessary services to the people without any delay and constraints of red tapism. We are trying to decentralise the administration so that people in rural and hilly areas get necessary service without having to move out of their places of stay."" Floods batter Assam The flood situation in Assam continued to be serious with over 1.75 lakh people affected in six districts. According to the flood bulletin issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority this evening, 6,017 people have taken shelter in 29 relief camps in Golaghat, Jorhat, Dhemaji and Sivasagar districts. Lakhmpur and Morigaon are the two other affected districts. The Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level at Neematighat in Jorhat, and Dhubri. The Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat district and the Jia Bharali in Sonitpur, Golokganj and Dhubri districts are flowing above the danger level. Golaghat district is the worst-hit with 64,469 people affected while 46,504 people have been hit in Jorhat, 23,079 in Dhemaji, 16,580 in Lakhmipur, 1,125 in Morigaon and 580 in Sivasagar. Crop area of 13,634 hectares has been damaged in the current wave of floods.

58fed5d57be9e0420db27e79,A window on history,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160604/jsp/opinion/story_89176.jsp,2016-06-04,,Telegraph,"Memory can be extraordinarily flexible. As the Portuguese coast recedes and our ship edges into Spanish waters, vora's reticence about the communist upsurge in the surrounding region called Alentejo reminds me of the stonewall I encountered in Hyderabad trying to talk of the Telangana revolt. Most people assumed I meant the agitation for a separate state. Few even remembered the earlier armed rising linked to the 1948 Calcutta Conference which also resulted in Malaya's prolonged and bloody Emergency. ""In the Alentejo, you travel naturally with and to History,"" writes a local chronicler. It didn't know a revolution that never was like West Bengal where revolution means speeches, and revolutionaries fatten in office for decade after decade. Alentejo's was a revolution that failed like Telangana's. But without the violence. It also suffered from a confusion of aims. Both mixed the local with the global. The immediate impetus in Telangana was opposition to the Nizam of Hyderabad's regime. However, the Calcutta Conference spoke of a wider ideological purpose. In fact, many believe the insurrection petered out because Moscow's rapprochement with New Delhi prompted the Comintern to abandon the conference's ostensible hosts, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. The peasantry around vora where we spent several delightful days also felt betrayed. vora is a charming medieval walled town whose university students in black medallion-studded cloaks over their frock coats sing and dance in the cobbled central square, the Praa do Giraldo, chasing away horrible memories of the burnings that took place there during the Inquisition. Founded in 1559, the university closed down in 1759, when the authoritarian prime minister of the day turned out the Jesuits. It didn't reopen until 1973. vora was under Muslim rule for 400 years. They came to help a local contender for power and stayed to consolidate their own rule. The real contradiction was between radical young officers of the Movimento das Foras Armadas and peasant and student protesters clamouring for reform in 1974. The officers overthrew Portugal's long dictatorship in a last-ditch attempt to pre-empt more drastic change. The protesters in the streets who gave them carnations which they put into the barrels of their guns - hence the name Carnation Revolution - hoped for a drastic social and political transformation. The organizations of workers and young people that sprouted all over the Alentejo resembled the proletarian councils (soviets) associated with Russia's October Revolution. Ordinary soldiers weary of war also set up their own committees to demand democratic rights and an end to Lisbon's imperialist wars. If national liberation movements could rock the foundations of colonial rule in the so-called ""overseas provinces"" of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and So Tom, they asked, why should the metropole remain under the corporatist yoke? Landless labourers who toiled on the great estates called latifundio seized the fields they farmed. According to government estimates, about 2,200,000 acres were occupied. Some 1,000 estates were collectivized. Something like the Spanish Civil War seems to have been fought out in miniature but with roles reversed. Claiming that fascism had to be defeated, Portugal's reformist Socialist Party and Stalinist Communist Party sprang to support the MFA and the junta it had installed. Social historians believe they destroyed the chance of a socialist revolution. Lisbon promulgated the Land Reform Review Law in 1977. The collectives were dissolved. The original owners repossessed the latifundio. Portugal's aristocracy has retained its wealth through centuries of upheavals. Some of the mansions and manor houses have been in the same family for generations. Hoardings in the vineyards along the road from vora to Lisbon proudly proclaim the ownership of families like the Fonsecas. No lingering memory of the 1974 uprising disturbs vora's tranquillity. The official justification is that the Alentejo collective farms could not be modernized. In the mid-1980s, agricultural productivity was half that of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the European average. Land holdings were polarized between small and fragmented family farms in the north and inefficiently large collectives in the south. Even Bangladeshi immigrants who had managed to acquire Portuguese work permits fled to more prosperous economies. Decollectivization was said to be the only hope. I learnt more about vora and its unexpected links with Bengal from Trilokesh Mukherjee, my graphic artist friend who lived in the Dordogne in France for many years. Now he seems to spend more time in Oxford and South Wales but remains a storehouse of the minutiae of Indo-European culture. Trilokesh told me vora was the birthplace of Manuel da Assumpo, an Augustinian monk who spent many years near Dhaka and is credited with writing and printing the first dictionary and grammar of the Bengali language, Vocabulario em idioma bengalla e portugueza. ""The Portuguese even cast some Tamil and Malayalam types. But they never could cast Bengali types."" It's a matter of everlasting regret to Trilokesh that this final triumph eluded the Portuguese. ""The first book to be printed in Bengali was printed in Lisbon though the writer, translator and the compiler came from vora,"" he wrote. Alas, it was set in Latin type. vora's state library treasures another historic document, the manuscript of Brahman-Roman-Kyathalik-Samvada: an argument on Law between a Roman Catholic and a Brahmin by the Bengali Dom Antonio de Rozario. Dom Antonio's life is shrouded in mystery. No one knows his Bengali name. He was apparently a princeling of Bhusana, which some place near Dhaka and others near Jessore. According to one version, Mug pirates took him to Arakan as their prisoner. Another has it he was sold into slavery in Goa. Both agree that another Portuguese Augustinian priest was his saviour and that he converted to Christianity. The reinvented Dom Antonio is believed to have converted 30,000 Hindus in and around his estate, thereby arousing the wrath of the Jesuits in Goa who sent a senior priest to investigate. He confirmed Dom Antonio's proselytizing success but added the converts had little knowledge of Christianity and had been paid to be baptized. It must be added before ghar wapsi fanatics reach for their purifying water that this was the competing camp's verdict. No rivalry is more relentlessly bitter than that between the pious who are convinced of their monopoly of the truth. Religion and language are the two main links. Vasco da Gama wasn't quite the pirate in priest's clothing that Bharatiya Janata Party loyalists made out on the 400th anniversary of his landing at Calicut, but he did have a strong religious motivation. Another Portuguese sailor, Lus de Cames, called Portugal's Shakespeare, immortalized his achievement in the epic poem, The Lusiads. If Calcutta had Anthony Feringhee (Hensman Anthony), Dhaka's Christians revere Sadhu Antoni (St Anthony of Padua). Some credit the Portuguese with creating Bengal's first modern city in Hooghly. Others hold their imports of tobacco, potato and guava changed Bengali taste for all time. With so many connections, it was exciting to stumble upon a Bengali gift to Portuguese (or so I imagined) when my wife was allotted the janela seat on the train to Sintra. I emailed a friend in Calcutta who passed it on to Aditi Roy Ghatak who messaged me from Macau, where she was holidaying, to say the former Portuguese colony had given her a janela on Portugal. I now learn that far from being Bengali, janla is an import like potato, guavas or tobacco. Derived from the vulgar Latin januella, the Portuguese janela travelled east with those first Europeans to inspire the Sinhalese janelaya and Tamil cannal. Our own janla is like almirah or kameez. Borrowing within reason is all right providing it doesn't prompt Mamata Banerjee to follow the late P.N. Oak and claim that Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower are really Bengali creations."

(Reuters) Recife (Brazil), Jan. 30: So many distraught mothers stream into the infant ward clutching babies with abnormally small heads that the receptionist sends them outside, to see if they can find a chair to wait under the mango tree. ""There's shade there, at least,"" said Maria Helena Lopes, 66, as she greeted one young mother after another. ""We'll call you when we're ready."" Roziline Ferreira took three buses to get here, grasping her 3-month-old son, Arthur, all the way. Tears swelled as she looked at him, recalling how the symptoms of the Zika virus had struck her during the second month of her pregnancy. How would she ever be able to care for him, she wondered? What kind of life would he have? ""It gets me angry when someone on the bus looks at Arthur and asks, 'What's wrong with his head?'"" Ferreira said. ""I tell them, 'Nothing's wrong, he's just different.' But then I think to myself, 'Yes, something's wrong. My son will never be like the other boys.'"" This poverty-stricken city near the Equator is at the centre of a nightmarish health crisis that has set off alarms across the Western Hemisphere. Mothers began showing up at the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital with their affected babies as early as September, stunning doctors and leaving even the most experienced among them scrambling to figure out what was going on. ""I would like to dream it isn't happening,"" said the head of the infant care unit, Dr Angela Rocha, who began working at the hospital in 1973. ""We've had our share of epidemics, but this is unprecedented."" Before last autumn, medical reports of babies born with brain damage and unusually small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - were so uncommon in Brazil that only about 150 cases were registered each year in the entire country. Now Brazilian officials are investigating thousands of them, and they contend that the mosquito-borne Zika virus is the cause. Virus specialists are racing to understand the connection, if any, between Zika and the rash of microcephaly cases in Brazil. But whatever the cause, ""There is no doubt that Brazil is experiencing a significant increase in microcephaly,"" said an official for Brazil's health ministry who was not authorised to speak publicly. ""We wouldn't have declared this situation a health emergency if this increase had not been detected."" The Zika epidemic has spread much faster than science's understanding of it. Researchers here believe that the virus made the leap from Polynesia to Brazil during the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament. Since then, as many as 1.5 million people in Brazil are believed to have been infected, and the virus has spread to more than 20 countries and territories in the Americas. The most common symptoms are relatively mild, like fever and joint pain, and most people with the virus feel no ill effects at all. But as Zika continued to spread across Brazil, particularly here in the northeast, doctors began to encounter a steady stream of women cradling babies with unusually small heads. ""I saw this dramatic increase in cases with my own eyes,"" said Dr Vanessa Van Der Linden, a neurologist in Recife who was among the first doctors to detect an increase in microcephaly cases last year. She said she was shocked when the babies began appearing at the public hospital where she works, the Hospital Baro de Lucena, and at her private practice. Altogether, she has examined about 60 cases in the last six months, she said - 10 times the rate of cases she came across in previous years. ""I never witnessed anything like it,"" Dr Van Der Linden said. She began suspecting a new cause for the microcephaly after testing the mothers for other possible factors, like toxoplasmosis, HIV and rubella. None of the tests showed that these ailments could have been responsible, prompting researchers to examine the link to Zika. ""This is an emergency because the situation is unprecedented,"" Dr Van Der Linden said. Dr Rocha, at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, said that she and her team had also examined about 10 times as many babies with signs of microcephaly as they normally would, turning Recife into a harbinger of what officials fear could unfold on a much broader scale. Many of the mothers were already overwhelmed by poverty. Now they are grappling with an incurable condition that can involve seizures, impaired cognitive development, delayed motor functions, problems with speech and dwarfism. Two months ago, Selma Alves de Oliveira, 38, gave birth to a daughter, Maria das Graas. It was her eighth child, inevitably increasing the strain on her and her husband, who farm beans and potatoes on a small plot of land near Recife. But unlike her others, this child was born with microcephaly, requiring multiple bus rides or paying someone to drive them to Recife for medical care. New York Times News Service"

Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

Initiated by the Society of North East Handmade Paper Development (SNEHPD), an NGO working for rural development, the farmers' clubs will have about 200 members each, covering 2,000 farmers spread over the subdivision. Prakash Thakur, who heads the organisation, said the richer farmers will teach others how to go about farming so that they can get the most out of the land they own. ""From our side we will be pushing for multiple cropping and will supply the mustard seeds to be sown after this paddy season (June-September). Assam Agricultural University has agreed to supply the amount of mustard seeds required. After that we will tell the farmers to grow potatoes. These are the three crops which we have selected for a year of cropping,"" he said. Thakur said gain was not the only objective of opening the clubs. ""Over the years our youths, instead of tilling the soil as their fathers had, prefer to go to towns and cities in search of jobs like waiters, watchmen, painters and the like. They even move out of the state in search of jobs as they feel agriculture does not pay. We would like these youths to remain rooted to the soil,"" Thakur said. He said the aim is also to keep the family engaged and, therefore, women will be taught to weave. For that, weaving clusters will be developed so that they can make a small profit. He said their children can also be engaged in looking after goats or pigs, growing vegetables in kitchen gardens, animal husbandry, fishery and horticulture. SNEHPD has collaborated with Nabard for promotional sponsorship, Titabar agriculture sub divisional officer for guidance and a couple of banks for loans. Thakur said banks were wary of lending to farmers as they already have huge outstanding amounts. He said six months ago, SNEHPD held loan recovery camps and were working towards total recovery so that banks start lending to farmers again. The clubs will be located at Xilikhabari, Mahimabari, Daani Gaon, Kamalpur, Gopalpur, Kosukhat and Xilikha Sanatan in Titabar subdivision. Mili Juli, Green Land, Garali Adorxo are some of the names given to the clubs, which will be formally launched at Xilikhabari tomorrow."

With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, July 1: Godda police registered an FIR last night against state BJP chief Tala Marandi's newly-wed son Munna Marandi under Section 376 of IPC (rape) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act based on a sexual exploitation complaint made by the ""other woman"" while the district administration is likely to submit a report on his alleged child bride in court tomorrow. Apparently, Munna (22) had been sleeping with a village girl at Simra village, Boarijore area, for the past 18 months, with the promise of marrying her. This girl's June 23 complaint at a Godda court - where she claimed she was underage, introducing the POCSO angle - was registered by Boarijore thana last night. But, policemen from the Dumka range DIG to Mahagama SDPO are squeamish about the FIR order against the BJP state chief's son. ""I have learnt about it (the FIR) through different sources, but officially I have not yet been communicated anything,"" Dumka range DIG Deo Bihari Sharma said when asked about steps taken for Munna's arrest. ""The court order had not reached us,"" said Mahagama SDPO Samir Sevaia, when asked the explain the gap between June 23 and June 30. ""We sent an officer to court yesterday and secured a copy of the order. Munna has been booked under sections of IPC and POCSO Act that the court directed us to do. We haven't added anything on our own,"" the SDPO said. The matter of Munna marrying a minor on Wednesday is another hot potato for Godda district. Though Tala Marandi, also Borio MLA, denies it, Munna allegedly married a minor when his intended bride - the one whose name was printed on wedding cards - refused to on the grounds that he was involved with the Simra girl. Today, Dumka DC Rahul Kumar Sinha, who holds the additional charge of Godda, said they would submit an earlier SDO report that cited the bride's birthday as July 25, 2005. ""We will submit the report tomorrow and seek guidance from the judiciary. The court may ask us to conduct the girl's medical test to ascertain her real age. Judicial orders will be strictly executed,"" Sinha said today. However, Sinha, who had on Wednesday promised a medical test to determine the age of Munna's bride, did an about turn yesterday, lending credence to Opposition claims that the case was being hushed up to protect the state BJP chief. As Tala Marandi floated conspiracy theories targeting him through his son, and Mahila Congress wing burnt his effigies, the case is becoming a free-for-all. Seeking to restore order, Jharkhand State Commission of Child Rights member Manoj Kumar today wrote a letter to Sinha demanding inquiry and action taken reports within three days. ""We have taken suo motu cognisance of the reported child marriage and want the culprits to be taken to task,"" he said. Incidentally, under Section 13 (3) of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act of 2006, the court of a first-class judicial magistrate or metropolitan magistrate may take suo motu cognisance on the basis of a reliable report or information. ""The judiciary's silence on the issue is rather intriguing,"" said Jharkhand High Court advocate Raj Nandan Sahay. But, Jharkhand High Court advocate-general Vinod Poddar refused to comment. ""I cannot comment on the basis of media reports,"" he said. Though Munna's bride has not spoken yet, the Simra girl had had to go to great lengths to make her voice heard. Initially, Godda SP had refused to entertain her sexual exploitation complaint. After state women's commission stepped in, the police filed the FIR."

Telegraph pictureImphal, June 17: People in the Manipur valley have stopped supply of essential commodities to the five hill districts to counter a 10-day economic blockade imposed by tribal organisations in the hills. Vehicles leaving Imphal are being regularly checked by valley people since Tuesday to stop transportation of essential commodities to the hills. If rice, potato or any other edible item is found in the vehicles, it is being unloaded. However, those accompanying the goods are allowed to proceed. People turned up along Imphal-Churachandpur, Imphal- Ukhrul, Imphal-Tamenglong, Imphal-Senapati and Imphal-Chandel routes to enforce the counter-blockade. Several hill-based indigenous groups had imposed a 10-day economic blockade on the state's lifelines - National Highway 2 (Imphal-Dimapur highway) and National Highway 37 (Imphal-Silchar highway) - on June 9 midnight, disrupting supply of commodities to Manipur. The blockade was called jointly by the Joint Action Committee against Anti-Tribal Bills, Hmar Inpui, Mizo Peoples Convention, Thadou Inpi, United Naga Council, Zoumi Council and the Outer Manipur Tribal Forum against the Protection of Manipur People Bill 2015, Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms (Seventh Amendment) Bill 2015 and the Manipur Shops and Establishments (Second Amendment) Bill 2015, which were passed by the Manipur Assembly in August last year. The bills are awaiting the President's assent. The Okram Ibobi Singh government has so far brought loaded trucks, stranded at various points in Senapati district, to Imphal with police escorts twice since the blockade began. To counter the blockade, people in the valley stopped commodities moving towards the five hill districts at various places in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts - all in the valley. ""We are checking vehicles going towards Ukhrul. We unload if commercial items are found in the vehicles and allow the people to proceed. We told the owner of the goods that they can come back and collect the unloaded goods after the 10-day blockade imposed by tribal organisations is over,"" a counter-blockade supporter said. Sources said the counter-blockade was launched after prices of essential commodities, including vegetables, soared after the economic blockade was imposed. An independent researcher said the price of potato had increased from Rs 25 to Rs 35 in Imphal city. The prices of other edible items have also increased, ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 40. Unlike in the past, consumers are not facing any scarcity of fuel as all the pumps are open this time. In the earlier blockades, some of the pumps were closed while others witnessed long queues. ""The IOC is releasing adequate petrol and fuel this time. Therefore, there is no problem of fuel this time,"" a petrol pump owner said."
58fed9677be9e0420db28477,Pokemon hunters on the prowl,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160711/jsp/calcutta/story_96012.jsp,2016-07-11,,Telegraph,"Schoolmates Subhranjoy Datta and Sayak Guha, both 23, hadnt seen each other in two years until Pokemons brought them together on Sunday morning. The two old boys of South Point met at Madhusudan Mancha in Dhakuria and criss-crossed south Calcutta  from Jadavpur University to South Park Street Cemetery  by car and on foot looking for cute animated virtual creatures called Pokemons and places called Pokestops. Subhranjoy and Sayak are part of the growing tribe of participants in the augmented reality mobile game called Pokemon Go that has become a craze worldwide since its launch last week. The game has not been launched officially in India yet but can be downloaded from apkpure.com. Played on iOS and Android devices, it allows players to track virtual Pokemons around a city, capture and even battle others using them.With GPS on the phone turned on, the game not only tracks the players movement on a map but also indicates when a Pokemon or Pokestop, where freebies can be collected, or Gyms, where they can engage in battle, are nearby. The mobile game is geared to bring to life the world of fantasy inhabited by anyone who grew up on a staple of the hugely successful anime series Pokemon. Pokestops in Calcutta are spread across the city, including in and around Madhusudan Mancha, Rabindra Sarobar, Babubagan, Jodhpur Park and Golpark. Pokemon hunters say there are quite a few at Jadavpur University, Nandan and Minto Park. In the north, the Diamond Plaza shopping mall and Sodepur station are two of the many Pokestops.Scores of young Calcuttans swept by the craze have hit the road, eyes glued to their mobile phone screens, looking at the map for the location of the nearest Pokemon. For the gamers, playing the game is a way of reliving a childhood passion common to many kids who grew up with a childhood dream of owning Pokemons, training them and winning battles using them. What is more, there are fringe benefits to hunting for Pokemons. Many have discovered parts of the city they had never visited before, couch potatoes have walked kilometres, and friends and siblings have learnt to share high-speed mobile data! On Sunday, Subhranjoys malfunctioning phone was missing a high-speed network; so he took along sibling Siddhanta, eight-and-a-half years his junior, on the Pokemon mission to share his speedier mobile data using Wi-fi hotspot technology. Since Siddhanta is a big Pokemon fan himself, he found no reason to complain. We had never spent so much time together before! The experience was fun. We discussed strategies as we went along collecting Pidgey and Doduos that came our way, he said. For Subhranjoy, playing Pokemon Go with school friend Sayak was like revisiting their childhood. Sayak and I decided to play the game together because both of us used to like Pokemon a lot in school and would discuss the episodes we watched on TV, recalled the young man, a resident of Selimpur who has just graduated from St. Xaviers College.Sayak, who is set to join TCS next month, and Subhranjoy were scouring the area around Madhusudan Mancha for Pokemons when Siddhanta suddenly screamed: I have got a Rattata! I have got a Rattata! The two older boys scurried to capture the Pokemon, just as Siddhanta had done. The scene repeated itself time and again throughout the trios travels within the city  one of the boys locating the prized catch and the others playing catch-up. For Sayak, the biggest takeaway from their Sunday toil for Pokemons was the time spent at the South Park Street Cemetery, a place he had always wanted to visit, especially after reading Satyajit Rays Feluda story Gorosthane Sabdhan. To spread the word about Pokemon Go and discuss the game, some enthusiasts have even formed WhatsApp groups. Sayak is the admin for one comprising his college and school acquaintances, already boasting 38 members. Nostalgia apart, augmented reality is what makes Pokemon Go click. Once you track a Pokemon  footprints indicating its presence lessen in number as you approach it  and turn on the phone camera, you actually see the Pokemon on screen, as if it were alive and sitting or flying around. Gariahat resident Adipto Mitra, who has recently joined his familys restaurant business, found a Doduo on his Pokemon mission and was mightily excited. The two-headed avian Pokemon was sitting on a grave in the Lower Circular Road graveyard. Adipto, a common friend of Subhranjoy and Sayak, was also at Jadavpur University hunting for Pokemons. When he heard that the duos next two stops would be the two graveyards diagonally opposite each other at Mullickbazar, he decided to tag along in the hope of finding some ghost Pokemons. While common Pokemons like Pidgey and Rattata are being found at many places around the city, a rarer one like the Horsea has been spotted at Dhakshinapan and Magikarp near a water body at Jadavpur. Ghost Pokemon Ghastly was picked up near Michael Madhusudans statue at the Lower Circular Road cemetery recently.Players can evolve Pokemons during the course of the game and also hatch eggs that they collect from Pokestops to get new Pokemons. After reaching Level Five of the game, they can join a team (red, blue or yellow) and look for Gyms where they can fight other Pokemon trainers. One Pokemon at a time reigns at a particular Gym. The Gym assumes the colour of that particular gamers team. The colour changes if someone else visits the site and hurls his or her Pokemon at the reigning Pokemon as a challenge. If the challenger wins, the Gym assumes the colour of that team. In south Calcutta, someone called Abhik88 playing for the red team is doing splendidly. He has placed his Pokemons at many of the Gyms, Sayak said. The aim of the players is to capture as many Gyms for their teams as possible and graduate to the higher levels of the game. Pokemon Go also promotes walking, something that many hope will help them lose some weight  after all, to hatch just one egg a player has to walk 5km! The app recognises a walk by setting a speed limit of 20kmph on your movement. I was reading somewhere that people were driving slowly in Australia to cheat the app! Subhranjoy said. Businessman and Pokemon Go addict Kunal Vasa, 25, said he had started walking to his gym instead of driving. I even walked to Nandan to be able to collect more Pokemons. Have you played Pokemon Go?

Picture by Prashant Mitra Don't want to go veggie shopping amid dust, heat and crowds? Just tap on an app. Two young Ranchi guys with BCA and MBA degrees under their belt from Manipal and Pune are back home to open a start-up selling vegetables and fruits at prices lower than retail markets. Friends from their days at DAV Public School, Hehal, Bariatu boys Ankit Kumar (25), a BCA from Manipal, and Aman Lal (24), an MBA from Pune, have teamed up to open Meri Sabzi, a vegetable shop with a difference, from June 20. The boys have provided three options for customers to order fruits and vegetables, through the portal www.merisabzi.com, an app called Merisabzi and a WhatsApp number 8351155455. Ankit, who worked as an event manager, and Aman, who was with a telecom company, came back home when the business bug bit them. ""We wanted to open something people needed everyday,"" said Ankit. ""Vegetables and fruits are a must, but busy young professionals, couples who have a packed day juggling many things or elderly people who don't want to depend on domestic help do face problems going to the market to buy the essentials."" ""Plus, the skyrocketing prices,"" chipped in Aman. ""From farm to wholesale to retail, prices keep inflating at every rung and the customer bears the full brunt of it. So, we wanted to put in place a seamless logistics, from farm to Meri Sabzi, to give our customers the best deal possible, eliminating middlemen."" The duo made their home delivery plunge after six months of planning. They took care of the software, built contacts with farmers on the outskirts of Ranchi in places like Bundu, Chanho Pithoria, Ormanjhi, Bedo, Nagri, hired delivery boys and opened up their Bariatu office. The efforts seem to have paid off. Thanks to their farm links, they have managed to deliver potatoes at Rs 15 per kg, onions at Rs 14, tomatoes at Rs 25, brinjal at Rs 22 and lady's finger at Rs 23 when the market rates are Rs 20, Rs 18, Rs 40, Rs 30 and Rs 30. In mornings, they delivery only vegetables from 6am to 9am. In the evening, they also deliver fruits and fresh veggies between 5pm and 8pm. Orders must be worth Rs 100 and above. If someone places an order worth Rs 250, he or she will get 5kg onions for Rs 50, the duo promise. The best part? Delivery is free of cost. So far the maximum orders are through WhatsApp, though the duo hope their own app also catches on. ""But our five delivery boys are busy all the time, which is important as we have just started out. We got 60 orders on Day One. We've come close to 100 orders in one day,"" said Ankit. ""We've got customers from Namkum, Hatia, Piska More, Booty More, Kanke Road, Bariatu, Morabadi, Ratu Road and many other places."" Their first customer, Bariatu homemaker Rachna Sahay, said she was thrilled when the fruits she had ordered, worth Rs 167, came smartly wrapped in plastic in a basket.

M. Venkaiah Naidu, who took over information and broadcasting from Arun Jaitley, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's underlying message in the changes in the council of ministers was ""perform, reform, transform and inform"". The shuffle, he also explained, was aimed at ""effective utilisation of the available talent"". On Smriti Irani's shift from the human resources development ministry to textiles, Naidu said ""too much is being read into it"". ""Both Prakash Javadekar (the new HRD minister) and Smriti Irani are dynamic persons. I think too much is being read into the change of portfolios,"" Naidu said while addressing the media after taking charge of his new ministry. ""Distribution of portfolios is a prerogative of the PM."" The I&B ministry will be an addition to the urban development ministry that Naidu holds. He was relieved of parliamentary affairs, which has been handed to Ananth Kumar. Welcoming the changes in the cabinet, Naidu thanked Jaitley for the time and attention he had devoted to the ministry despite his other heavyweight responsibilities - finance and corporate affairs - and said he would carry forward Jaitley's approach. ""Effective communication is the key to realise change. I would like to focus on the task of information empowerment,"" Naidu, who represents Rajasthan in the Rajya Sabha, said. ""The government is a reservoir of information relating to socio-economic, cultural and political aspects of a common man's life. We need to ensure a proper flow of information - undiluted and unadulterated,"" Naidu added. Known for his one-liners, Naidu tried his hand at rhyming at yesterday's media briefing too. ""I am very frank and outspoken and I have Frank beside me now,"" he said, referring to the government's chief spokesperson, Frank Noronha. Another wordplay was aimed at his deputy, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. ""I have got an energetic MOS (minister of state) and whenever there is an SOS (save our soul) situation, I will turn to him. We will perform and inform together."" Sources close to Jaitley said it had been ""almost expected"" that he would be divested of I&B. ""He was never very keen on the ministry, but was brought in because of his media management skills and good connections in the (media) industry,"" said an official close to Jaitley. ""However, the ministry had become too much for him. There is little work here compared to the other ministries but too much headache, particularly as it involves dealing with the film industry,"" the official added. The I&B ministry and the ""autonomous"" bodies under it - the Central Board of Film certification and the Film and Television Institute of India - have been dogged by controversies. While Pahlaj Nihalani, ever since his appointment as chief censor in January 2015, has been facing the wrath of the film industry for his controversial decisions, the government had to deal with a student agitation when it appointed small-time actor Gajendra Chauhan as FTII chairman. ""The censorship issues, in particular, have been a hot potato for the ministry and, despite Jaitley's tactical and strategic handling of matters, the ministry often cut a sorry face,"" another official in Jaitley's team, who will now move to the corporate affairs ministry, said."

Picture by Jai PrakashCity schools have failed to adhere to the Central Board of Secondary Education's directive against serve junk food on campus. Between 2006 and 2008, the board issued six circulars to ensure healthy eating habits. In January this year, it issued a detailed circular instructing schools to ensure non-availability of junk food at canteens and within 200m of the campus. It also directed schools to constitute a canteen management committee comprising up to 10 members, including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators, and to check children's lunch boxes. Only St Michael's High School Patna has constituted a teachers' committee to check primary students' lunch boxes. Most schools, however, have thrown up their hands. For example, the canteen at Notre Dame Academy sells high-fat food items such as samosa and chaat. Principal Mary Jessy claimed the foods were hygienic and will not harm students. ""If we stop selling samosa, chaat and kachori in the school canteen, they would start eating outside the school which will definitely affect them,"" she added. K.K. Kunjachan, principal of St Karen's Secondary School, said there are limits to what a school can do. ""We have a law banning sale of cigarettes and tobacco in the vicinity schools and colleges. This is hardly followed. There are few shack-shops that openly sell tobacco products. We can only ban junk foods on the school campus, not around the premises,"" he said. Brother Satheesh K Don, principal of Loyola High School, said the school does not sell any unhygienic food. ""In physical education class students are taught about the effects of bad eating habits,"" he added. ""Because of shopping centres near the school, it is hard to keep fast food stalls at bay."" The board circular did not suggest any penalty if schools fail to promote healthy practices. ""The CBSE office has scarcity of employees. There are only 30 employees out of 74,"" said R.R. Meena, CBSE regional officer for Bihar and Jharkhand. ""We are supposed to keep tab on the smooth conduct of board exams. We are not able to check the canteens and what they are selling. The schools should take appropriate measures in this regard."" Arun Kumar Thakur, a city-based general physician, said obesity and hypertension are alarmingly high among school students as they find it tempting to eat junk food at canteens instead of eating healthy, home-cooked food. ""When you have a junk meal rich in oil you feel drowsy and fail to concentrate,"" he added. ""Over sustained periods of junk food eating, blood circulation drops due to fat accumulation. Lack of vital oxygen, nutrients and proteins particularly can stale brain cells temporarily."" Most schoolchildren failed to see what the brouhaha was about. ""I really like tikki chaat and bhelpuri. How can potatoes affect health? They contain carbohydrate which is actually good for health,"" said Pranshu Deep, a Class VII student of Radiant International School. He said he has ""never"" faced any health ailment despite eating outside the school campus. ""It is up to us what we like to eat,"" declared Satyam Kumar, a Class VI student of Loyola High School. "" Panipuri and chhola bhatura are my favourites and I eat them after my classes."" Karuna Devi, mother of two school-going kids, felt schools and parents must work together. ""Schools should ban selling junk food and as parents we need to discourage kids to eat such foods which may harm their health. The responsibility lies on both sides,"" she said. Another concerned mother, Jyoti Sinha whose son studies in class III at St Michael's High School, said she makes stuff like samosa and chaat at home but her son still likes to eat outside the school campus. ""He often complains about stomach ache and other health issues,"" she added."
58feeb697be9e0420db296e3,The world and the Left,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160615/jsp/opinion/story_91156.jsp,2016-06-15,,Telegraph,"We are living in a world full of uncertainties; anything might happen, or not happen. Even so, my instant reaction to those who confidently assert the imminent total eclipse of Marxism and the Left in the global context are, to use the vernacular, talking through their hat. Just take a look at the intense economic crisis the Western capitalist countries are currently facing. The crisis is one of over-capitalization. Technological progress has an impulse and momentum of its own. The demand for investing more and more, thus, further broadens and deepens the capital structure as well. The phenomenon is continuously accompanied by a shrinkage in wage labour. Once the wage bill begins to contract, the dilemma of capitalism is glaringly revealed. Progressively superior technology implies increasingly higher and higher labour productivity. The consequence is an extremely fast rate of expansion in productive capacity. Capitalism suddenly realizes the mess it has created, and is creating, for itself. There is mammoth productive capacity, but where is the demand for the output that might be produced. Demand deficiency generates a situation from which capitalism is seemingly unable to extricate itself. In Marx's schemata, a steadily falling rate of profit is inevitable. In the capitalist system, until the culminating point is reached where profit shrinks to zero. Marx conceived a parallel development too. As capitalism expands, every day new factories get set up and workers fill the factories. A large cluster of such factories covers the capitalist economies. But, with capital intensification, the size of the wage bill comes under attack and discontent among the workers keeps mounting. Soon they learn the craft of organizing themselves into coherent entities, which rise in protest against the trend towards continuous shrinkage of the wage bill and increasing exploitation of the workers. Marx had envisaged a coincidence: at about the moment the rate of profit threatens to fall to zero, workers all over the economy gather together and strike the blow that vanquishes the capitalist class; a new social system emerges. Way back in the early 1930s, stagnation of demand had already caught up with capitalism in both Europe and the United States. Massive unemployment in country after country generated intense social discontent; industrial unrest was a daily feature. Capitalism, however, would withstand that major crisis, thanks to the fortuitous availability of an economist of the wisdom and calibre of John Maynard Keynes and a politician of the stature of Franklin Roosevelt possessing large practical sense. Keynes recommended creating money via large budgetary deficits and using these extra funds to launch public works that could create employment. The money that went into the pockets of the newly engaged was immediately spent in the market to increase the purchase of goods and services. Demand picked up and capitalism got saved. For nearly a decade now, the US and most of Western Europe are once more being visited by a similar crisis. It is an era of super-computers and super-super-computers. Breathlessly rapid technological advance has soared productivity per worker to fantastic heights. That apart, major sections of the population in both continents have already attained a level of comfortable living, so much so that their urge for new goods and services is steadily declining. Most of West Europe and large segments of the US have already practised the Keynesian methodology and have arranged a safety net in the form of a public sector of sizeable magnitude. Nothing, however, is of any avail. There is little enthusiasm for new investment because both income and employment growth is only marginal year after year. Writing his works more than 150 years ago, Marx could hardly foresee the specific twists and turns capitalist growth would take. But it would be plain silly to underestimate the majesty of this overall prognosis. Nonetheless, we cannot but face the awkwardly knotty issue: none of the social revolutions that have taken place since Marx's time has been in accordance with his formulation. Even the very first revolution that took place in October/November 1917, the transformation of the czar's empire into the Soviet Union had zero link with Marxian formulation. The territory constituting the Russian empire was mostly agricultural and pastoral along with some stretches of desert, and hardly any industry worth the name. The First World War was about to end; although the czar was on the victorious side, the Russian economy was in a shambles, the soldiers could not be paid their wages, and their families were starving in the countryside. The army revolted in Moscow, chaos ensued, providing Lenin and the Communist Party to seize power. The next most significant social transformation was the popular democratic revolution in China. But it was planned and organized by a social force that Marx had once considered, with a measure of contempt, as ""a sack of potatoes"" - the peasantry. The revolution in Vietnam was more in the nature of a national liberation movement against foreign aggressors, which was led and inspired by the Communist Party. Once more, though, it did not follow the Marxian agenda. When Fidel Castro and his comrades took to the hills and valleys to conduct guerrilla warfare against the military regime in Cuba, the country's Communist Party severely castigated them in the strongest terms; they were supposedly not following the revolutionary grammar. Once the revolution was successful, the same party surrendered itself lock, stock and barrel to Fidel. Both Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg suggested a temporary respite for the capitalist system from the doom awaiting it. Imperialism could offer capitalism the opportunity to extract raw materials at cheap rates; at the same time, the subjugated countries might provide a dumping ground for goods and services that would not be absorbed within the capitalist economies. Low raw material cost could reduce, up to a point, variable costs in the process of production, thereby allowing scope for liberalizing a bit the size of the wage bill, which, in time, would contribute to enlarge market demand. In addition, the occupied lands would be forced to accept exported goods from the imperial countries. The most classic example of the kind of imperialism Lenin and Luxemburg had etched is the Indian empire set up by the British. There were in Asia parallel empires set up by other European nations such as the French and the Dutch. Africa offered an equally lush opportunity for European imperialism. Alongside Britain, France, Germany and Italy lorded over the hapless Africans. Latin America as a whole illustrates a different version of imperialism Lenin and Luxemburg had foreseen. Although not formally occupied by American troops, nearly all the countries in Central and South America were ruled ruthlessly by army generals loyal to the US. The entire continent was at the disposal of the Americans to extract oil and raw materials. The American corporate sector had complete grip over the economy of each of these countries. This was the situation even half a century ago. The inspiration set afire by Castro and Guevara has since then totally transformed the situation in Latin America. Venezuela followed the lead of Cuba, Bolivia was not far behind, and, sooner or later, the rest of the countries rose against American overbearingness as well; the US was as good as totally ejected from Latin America. A couple of years ago, Washington D.C. planned a counter-attack, achieving limited success here and there. It is at the moment a see-saw, but there is absolutely no prospect of a return to the overwhelming imperial dominance the US had exercised south of the Panama Canal. Oil imperialism was another kind of manoeuvre the Anglo- Americans had enforced on West Asia. The Bush-Blaire blunder in Iraq has ensured the death-knell of that too. The conflagration these two foolish Western leaders set off has now eventuated into the major crisis West Europe is facing in coping with the migrant victims of the Islamic State aggression. Western capitalism is in very grave crisis. But, admittedly, what is occurring has little semblance with Marx's scheme of things. Even within the US, despite the rate of profit threatening to drop down to zero, there is not the least danger with its coinciding with a revolt on the part of the working class. True, there is unemployment and resulting discontent here and there. But, social security payments of a very generous order keep a very large majority of the unemployed quietly content. Stray discontentment such as ""Occupy Wall Street"" soon turned into a fading fad. Are we not in a position to reach a tentative conclusion? Marx, the great savant, was able to foresee with his profound wisdom the difficulties mature capitalism was likely to experience. There is no deficiency in the faculty of his thinking. It was naturally impossible for him to foresee the exact shape in which economic events would evolve over the decades and centuries that were to follow. That hardly matters: the text he scripted concerning class consciousness and the inevitability of confrontation between social classes such as those who exploit and those who are exploited remains sacred. It is a question of time before social and economic inequalities are extradited from human society and a classless State as dreamt by Marx emerges as a reality. The problem arises with those who refused to deviate from a mechanical interpretation of everything Marx said. The trouble the Left is facing in many countries is because of such a mechanistic frame of mind."

We drive past Muzaffarpur town onto a narrow road, pass groves of bananas, mangoes and lychees, vegetable patches of potatoes, cauliflowers, onions, fields of rice, sugarcane and grass. We cross a canal and suddenly came upon a lake. Its water is red from the setting sun. Birds are flying home. It is idyllic. I was driving to Manika Gaon in Mushari, the home of Sachchidanand Sinha, who is among the most important living socialist writers and thinkers in India. The road was good, the villages clean and orderly. If only every village in India could be like this, neat and fertile, its prosperity reflected not in ugly electricity-guzzling big malls and shopping complexes but on the branches of its trees and the crop in its fields! Sachchidanandji was waiting for me with Biju mangoes from his tree, soaking in a small bowl of water. We sat on a raised mud-platform outside his small home, surrounded by mango and guava trees and a flowering madhumalti bush. A tiny patch of wild grass divided us from the main village road, with small houses on both sides. ""Your father had come here during George's (Fernandes) election,"" he recalls. George's constituency was Muzaffarpur in Bihar though Bombay was his stomping ground as a trade union leader and Mangalore his place of birth. My father and George were close friends. George had hidden at our place during the Emergency dressed as a priest. At the time of his arrest, my father had gone to fetch Chinese food. Later both my parents had campaigned for George's election in Muzaffarpur, while George was in jail for the Baroda Dynamite Case. When George came to Calcutta after his release, he took us to eat ice-cream on Park Street. However, in good socialist tradition, I never called him Uncle. He was simply George. My father still goes to see a paralysed George in Delhi, even though they did not meet during the BJP-alliance years. Sachchidanandji too opposed the Emergency (Emergency in Perspective: Reprieve and Challenge, 1977), but the performance of the Janata regime disappointed him. He reflected on the subject in The Permanent Crisis: After Janata What? (1978), and left Delhi for Bihar in 1979, to live and explore socialist ideology. The 87-year-old lives on the bank of a huge lake in the middle of exotic flora and fauna, grows his own grain, greens, and fruits. He offers the Biju mango grown without any chemical fertiliser or pesticide with delight. He paints and photographs his surroundings, and has published a book on birds. As I suck the mango, I talk to him of Gandhian socialism. He explains: the ends don't justify the means; the means are the ends; the means we choose dictate the ends we get. As this has come down to us, it is popularly understood as non-violence. But it goes far deeper than that. We discuss how violence done to the earth normalises violence for us. In turn we are violent with each other without realising it. Violence to women is part of the culture of violence. Non-violence has to start from non-violence to earth. How can one be non-violent to the earth? We are not miners, we don't throw bombs, we don't throw chemical into rivers. His answer was, we have to be mindful consumers and mindful producers. Large-scale industrialisation has led to large-scale waste and the very rape of earth. We have to consume as little as necessary. At the same time, we have to choose our means of production carefully. The race for more has devastating environmental consequences. In fact, Sachchidanandji felt that the biggest issue for the socialist movement was environment and nature. Socialists needed to offer a different paradigm for development. Born in 1929, Sachchidanand Sinha joined the Quit India movement in 1942 as a Class 9 student and ended up with the socialist group of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and Kishan Patnaik. He was in the labour movement working as a khalasi (coolie) in Bombay, when Lohia read an article by him. He began working in Mankind; later participated in the JP Movement and has, ever since, contributed to the socialist movement as a writer and ideologue. In 1973, he wrote The Internal Colony: A Study in Regional Exploitation on Centre-state relations focussing on Bihar, the definitive Socialism and Power, The Bitter Harvest: Agriculture and Economic Crisis called for long-term planning and management of agriculture and environment and Chaos and Creation, a profound probing of the biological roots of art and creativity. He is able to transcend boundaries of disciplines and ideologies, but returns to socialism, again and again, because he finds in it the only hope for mankind. I wonder why. So many friends in my generation feel that Bihar is poor because socialism has called anarchy here. He smiles and says they don't see the changes in the everyday lives of ordinary people. They don't see the teenage girl cycling to school in a remote Bihar village who could not have stepped out from home a decade earlier or the change in the caste composition of the Bihar Assembly from the 1950s which was then dominated by Brahmins and Kayasthas. Today the majority is of Yadavs, Kurmis, Majhis, Paswans... ""The change may not be enough but a radical change is happening. Its biggest threat is the so-called development that is being imposed top-down. We are brainwashed into believing that destruction is 'development' by both the communist and capitalist thinkers. Look at the big industries and shopping complexes - do they give back to people as much as they consume or do they end up consuming people instead? ""Vera Zasulich wrote to Marx questioning his unilinear model of development focusing on industry. Capitalist countries in the west did the same thing. Waste, over-production and the use of technology to control the marginalised are the result of this model. The Gandhian model is more appropriate, not just for agrarian, non-industrialised societies like ours, but for the earth itself. We are hurtling towards disaster. Enough will never be enough, we will always want more."" But what about fascism? Is that not the biggest challenge for India? Sachchidanandji differs. ""Fascism cannot take root in India for two reasons: the diversity of our country and Gandhian thought. The BJP had to drop their call to remove Article 370 on Kashmir from the Indian Constitution. And Gandhian thought is in our blood now. It will be hard for any party to uproot our political and socially democratic values."" A man in a khadi dhoti waves from the village path across the grass patch. A woman appears on a scootie. The man jumps in on the back seat behind the woman as they drive away. ""That is the change,"" Sachchidanandji says as he waves back. ""She is driving. He took a lift. They are both farmers, going to sell their produce in the local village market.""

Telegraph picture Ranchi, May 26: We all know how important water is for our survival. And when the message on the need for its conservation is spread through film, everyone sits up and notices. That's what Netarhat Film Institute is aiming to do. The brainchild of national film award winner Sriram Dalton, who is from Palamau district but works in Mumbai, the institute is holding a 12-day film workshop with pani as its central theme in the jungles of Netarhat in Laterhar district. ""Over 50 participants were present yesterday, which was the first day of the workshop. More people are expected to join within a day or two,"" Sriram told The Telegraph over telephone phone from the campsite at Netarhat today, noting that many local residents, otherwise unconnected to films, were also taking part. The workshop would be covering all important aspects of filmmaking, like screenplay writing, shooting, direction and editing, he said when asked about the nature of activities being held there. ""Those conducting various sessions at the workshop have been asked to narrate their ideas about water crisis and possible solutions,"" Sriram said. Later, 10 of the best ides would be chosen as themes for short films. A graduate in fine arts from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), 36-year-old Sriram took to filmmaking and ended up wining the national award for a 10-minute short film, The Lost Bahrupiya, at the 61st National Film Awards of 2013. He won a Rajat Kamal for the film that was described as the ""best art/cultural film"" with a ""near surreal depiction of the dying art form of bahrupiya (nomadic performing artistes who masquerade as mythological characters, tigers and the like) in a globalised society"". Sriram said the enthusiasm at the workshop was palpable. ""Participants are sleeping in tents and eating Spartan food,"" he said, adding that various people and organisations helped out with the workshop. Apart from the state information and public relations department, the local administration, police and forest authorities supported the event. Cultural organisations like the Daltonganj branch of IPTA and film organisations like Movizz.com and Salpani and film star Manoj Bajpayee also helped. ""Even local people did so... there was one person who donated a bag of potatoes,"" Sriram added."
58fef3817be9e0420db29e95,The jail that sparked many a story,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/bihar/story_92019.jsp,2016-06-19,,Telegraph,"I stop at Purnea to meet Girindranath Jha, a journalist, who has returned to his ailing father and begun farming. I read his blogs and Facebook posts on harvesting potatoes, the impact of the westerly wind - pachiya - on fruits, the joy of seeing rice saplings sprout, the significance of green fields and running rivers, all intermingled with his own fiction and research on the writings of Phaniswarnath Renu, one of the greatest modern socialist writers from Bihar. We decide to start by visiting the Purnea Jail. My father had been a political prisoner there as a 25-year-old in 1957 with the Maharaja of Vizianagram Vijay Gajapati Raju, Loknath Joshi, Kalikaprasad Singh, Sarju Mishra and about 95 other socialist leaders. They were all part of a pan-Indian movement to remove English from official use. My father used to describe the room where 65 prisoners were jailed with one open toilet between them, the mess, the courtyard where they did yoga, the tree that had thousands of bats hanging from it... As we drove to the jail we stopped at the Indubhushan library, started by the father of Satinath Bhaduri, a socialist writer who wrote the great novels Jagori and Dhorai Charit Manas about India's freedom struggle against the British. Professor Partha Chatterjee, whose writing and teaching have helped to decolonise the humanities, was informed by the subaltern characters in Dhorai Charit Manas in writing The Politics of the Governed. The writer (top) in front of the Purnea central jail where her father was a political prisoner in 1957. Pictures by Sudhanshu Bhaduri was born in Purnea and went to jail in Bhagalpur, Giri reminiscences, and Renu was born in a village in Araria and went to jail in Purnea. Bhaduri was Renu's guru. Both were influenced by the Indian National Congress and later the Congress Socialist Party. The characters in Jagori and Dhorai Charit Manas describe the jail in Purnea as does Renu. We reach the jail and meet the kind-hearted jailor, who does not let us inside the actual prison, but we are allowed to peep in from the outside and visit the room with an open toilet that my father occupied. It is disused. The jail is clean, there is a garden and the prisoners are allowed to pursue cultural activities. Indians have done better than the British in the treatment of prisoners. Bihar has gone one step ahead. National Crime Records Bureau data reveal that Chhattisgarh and the Union territories are arresting increasing number of people, whereas the numbers of those arrested in Bihar are going down. I had read recently that Sweden has closed down its prisons because they do not have anyone to arrest. They have chosen to use the funds to invest in people instead. Perhaps, the socialist government in Bihar is going to follow its socialist partner's path. Purnea was the first district to be created by the British in 1771, one of the worst exploited and thus the worst hit by the Bengal Famine. Timber contracts to those in service of the British Raj ended up turning this area, once called Puran Aranya (Total Forest), into a swamp, that generated one of the cruellest cholera outbreaks in human history. As a result, Purnea became the centre of resistance and intellectual ferment. Its young men and women were delegates to the Indian National Congress, attended rallies, spun the charka, went to jail, wrote pamphlets and books. Purnea became a literary centre. Today it is one of the big education centres of north Bihar. The disused rooms in the jail could easily be turned into a museum on the role that Purnea played in India's independence struggle. It would be a striking way to remind the next generation of their hard won independence. Over lunch at Sanjha Chullah it is evident that Giri will carry on the legacy of Purnea's literati. Like Renu his writings are both reportage and fiction. His newest book, Ishq me Maatisona, has been published by Rajkamal. I then go to Gulabh Bagh, one of the most notorious red-light areas in north Bihar, situated near the largest grain depot in eastern India and on a highway. Truckers used to routinely buy little girls here and the traffickers would provide a constant supply of poor, low caste children from nearby villages. To my pleasant surprise, I heard from a young girl, Roshanara, on her way back from school, that a female police officer, Kim Sharma, has arrested many of the kingpins and things were much better here. Roshanara adds, ""One more push and investment in the girls and women here could make this a non-red light area."" I leave, thinking that perhaps, we are too hasty in saying nothing has been achieved in 60 years. We have forgotten what once was. The legacy of zamindari and the Raj are vanishing. Two days ago, women won more than half the seats in the Purnea municipality.

58fef5217be9e0420db2a12a,Caterpillar cloud on tomatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/nation/story_91510.jsp,2016-06-16,,Telegraph,"UNDER SCANNER New Delhi, June 15: Government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to South America that has slipped into at least four Indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year. ""The United States is taking it so seriously we haven't even given permits to do research (in laboratories) in order to prevent any possibility of the insect's escape (from the labs into farms)."""

Pictures by Ruchira Gupta Jugeshwar is a Mahadalit sharecropper living off the edge of a pond in a remote village in Araria. Satyajit Kumar Singh is the CEO of Shakti Sudha Industries in Patna. Both are 46-year- old Biharis. Their lives are interconnected by the euryale ferox. This water lily with bright purple flowers is a common sight in wetlands and ponds in north Bihar. It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.
