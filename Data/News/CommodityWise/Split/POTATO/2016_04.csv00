For the first time, the food for the officials is being taken care of by the Akshaya Patra Kitchens of the Hare Krishna Foundation. A total of 22,000 kilogramme of rice, 5,000 kg of dal, and 3,500 kg of tomato and potato curries will be prepared and transported to the polling booths across Greater Hyderabad region for the staff involved in the election duty.However, on Monday, officials at City College in the old city protested citing poor facilities at the polling centre. In Rajendranagar too, polling staff raised slogans against the Presiding Officer for lack of drinking water facility and delayed supply of meals. There were many diabetics among the staff who came to perform the election duty. We were told during the training camp that the food will be supplied at 11 a.m. but we did not get it till 2 p.m., said one of the protesting election workers.The GHMC officials said that adequate arrangements have been already made and any complaints in this regard will be take care of.Right from drinking water to two meals, we have taken care of the basic facilities. Even toilets are there in most booths. If there are any polling stations with no toilets, then we have instructed the officials to talk to one of the house owners in the neighbourhood to let the officials use the toilets, said Surender Mohan, Additional Commissioner, GHMC."

C. Deveshwar said.Talking to reporters after unveiling three green field projects, Mr. Deveshwar said the plan could be taken forward if the company had more land at its integrated consumer goods manufacturing facility in Uluberia in Howrah District.While we are exporting shrimps now, we could become a branded player in the frozen shrimp market, taking West Bengal shrimps all over India, he said.We are targeting a Rs.one-lakh crore turnover from new-FMCG business. We need to enter new categories.. it cannot be done only through the existing business, Mr. Deveshwar said.ITC has set this target for 2025-30, planning to emerge as the top FMCG company. ITCs non-cigarette business now stands at over Rs. 20,000 crore.Earlier, he urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for some additional land (around 40 acre) for setting up a cold chain and frozen food facilities at Uluberia where it will commission by May 2016 a four-lakh square feet facility for making atta (wheat flour), biscuits and snacks.He said industrial land was lying unutilised close by.We could scale up tomorrow.. planning a frozen food or a fruit juice line, Mr. Deveshwar said.Ms. Banerjee also laid the foundation stone for a larger unit for making noodles and potato chips.The two initiatives would entail Rs.3,000 crore investment, Mr. Deveshwar said. While pointing out that ITC was experimenting with cultivation of a moisture-resistant wheat strain for West Bengal, its home state, he said the company had taken a leap of faith.He also said the state government could show case these projects for attracting investors.ITCs non-cigarette business now stands at over Rs. 20,000 crore."

The Gandhi Market, established in 1940, has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about six acres of land, attracting thousands of traders and consumers every day. The market caters not only to the city but also to retail traders from several small and big towns in the neighbouring districts.The construction of a central market was announced in July 2014 by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, when she represented the Srirangam constituency. The new market is coming up on 10 acres of land at Kallikudi, off the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, about 15 km from here.Officials say the market would have all modern infrastructure with 1,000 shops, a cold storage of 2,000 tonne capacity, sorting and grading yards and wide internal roads to facilitate easy movement of trucks and loading and unloading facility. Although representatives of traders associations say they did not mind relocating, they wanted the entire market shifted as a whole.A meeting of various traders associations held on Friday, with Ve. Govindarajalu, State treasurer, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu in the chair, decided to go on a 24-hour strike from 10 p.m. on February 11 to 10 p.m. on February 12 essentially to bring to the notice of the government the concerns of the traders.Although we are not opposed to shifting, we want the market to be shifted entirely. Besides, the shops that are being built at Kallikudi are too small and in multiple floors. The government should have consulted the traders, Mr.Govindarajalu said. Echoing his views, A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association, said onion and potato commission mandi traders required shops of 1,000 to 2,000 square feet area on the ground floor. Traders would face difficulty in lifting loads to the upper floors.U.S. Karuppiah of the Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Permanent and Platform Traders Association said there was no information on who would be allotted shops at the new market and whether the market would be shifted entirely.However, one of the platform traders association has decided not to participate in the strike. A few other associations are also yet to decide.Onion and potato traders need shops of 1,000 to 2,000 sq ft. area and will face difficulty in shifting consignments to upper floors.Thangaraj A.,General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association"

It depends heavily on West Bengal to meet its requirement. When the scarcity was acute a few years ago, the State government had announced a potato mission for increasing production of tuber. However, the mission failed to yield desired results.According to the Ministers, the area of potato cultivation has been increased from 15,805 hectare to 25,270 hectare under the mission. Due to rise in temperature and fewer cold days, the potato cultivation was hit, the Ministers said.The Ministers, however, said potato scarcity was felt all over the country. While per kg price in Kolkata is Rs.14, it is Rs.20 in Chennai, Mumbai (Rs.19), New Delhi (Rs.14), Bhubaneswar (Rs.16) and Sambalpur (Rs.16), they said.In view of rising potato prices, the government on Monday declared to make enforcement activities stricter in order to ensure stability and take stringent action against hoarders. Collectors have been asked to take action against unscrupulous traders."

The produce is used in the police canteen.Though civil police officer Shajahan is in charge of the farm, all the officials at the station do the farming work in their free time.No easy taskAs soil was not fertile, developing the farm was not an easy task. First we tested the soil and added nutrients to make the soil fertile, Shajahan said.It was with the continuous support and timely advice of Krishi Bhavan officials that we developed the farm. They also created in us an interest for farming, which is a refreshing change for us, said Sub Inspector Cleetus K. Joseph. We had earlier successfully cultivated plantain and it gave us the confidence to develop the vegetable farm, said Devasia, civil police officer.

C. Jamir addressing the House. The Opposition Congress and BJP are likely to raise the issues of their choice soon after the Governors address is over, and particularly after the budget for 2016-17 is presented on March 18.The BJD, however, is all set to take recourse to blaming the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre over decrease in Central assistance to several schemes.Blaming the Centre in order to hide its deficiencies and failures has been a practice with the ruling BJD since it assumed power in 2000. It has become further convenient for the regional party since it severed ties with the BJP and ceased to be a member of the NDA in 2009."

I asked him why he didnt eat it, my friend Sudeshna Shome Ghosh wrote. His response was, How could I? I didnt know what it was. My friend rolled her eyes (you can now do that thanks to an updated emoticon app), I LOLd and that was the end of it.The conversation brought back dabba memories, of going to school and opening my stainless steel lunch box in the afternoon, hours after it was packed, wondering about its contents. With the mother being a fabulous cook, the dabba was usually crammed with theplas folded in half with a dibbi of mango pickle, jeera rice with caramelized onion and curd, or rotis that miraculously stayed soft so that they could be torn with two fingers and eaten with sabji . There was lunchbox envy, where I coveted my classmates tiffins because they brought food that wasnt familiar to me. I yearned for cucumber sandwiches, after re-reading Enid Blyton books, even though the white bread would be curling up at the edges by afternoon. I even wanted the dabba that held cold, clammy Maggi noodles, something that I now wouldnt touch with a barge pole. But at that time, it was as exciting as moringa leaves are now to chefs.Now there are plenty of cookery books, blogs and Instagram accounts with innovative lunch box ideas, all just a Google search away. Blogger and nutritionist Nandita Iyer, better known as Saffron Trail online, has simple, healthy ideas, which include vegetable peanut noodles, pita pocket pizza sandwiches, and puliyogare or tamarind rice. Lulu Loves Bombay blogs about travel, her children, and food. Her sweet potato discs sound like a lovely addition to the dabba , as do her methi thepla and mango chunda. Sanjeeta KKs blog, Lite Bite, has a Lunchbox Bites section with some handy tips and recipes such as for muthiyas and wholegrain chillas.On Instagram, Lunch Box Dad, Beau Coffrans mealtime hacks include rocket ships from bread and cheese, and Spider-Man lunches with berries; while bleary-eyed parents may not be keen to wake up and make food art, its a fun account to follow. Grace Halls Eats Amazing blog focuses on Bento-style lunches for her son and follows themes such as Halloween, rainbows, and gardens. Her #PackedLunchLove Project has creative boxes that, she promises, take just a few minutes to prepare and are a visual feast. A few years ago, graphic designer and illustrator David Laferrieres innovative sandwich bag art went viral. Hes made over 1,800 sandwich bag drawings with monsters and kites.And when in doubt, return to the library.Apart from the usual cluster of recipe books, check out Karen Le Billons French Kids Eat Everything , a charming account of a family, with two picky-eater children, that moves from the USA to France and discovers how the French government and the school system strengthen food education. Then theres Chris Butterworths Lunchbox: The Story of Your Food , illustrated by Lucia Gaggiotti. A picture book, it takes young readers on a journey from farm to fork, getting them to think: where did the food in my lunchbox come from? Its a lovely way of engaging children with farmers who grow our food and get them curious about what they are eating.Mommy Go Lightly, a.k.a. journalist and author Lalita Iyer, writes lovingly about dabbas on her blog, Food is intuitive, she writes about packing her son Res lunch box. At least thats how it should be. Try different things and figure out what works for your child. My tip is, make it visually exciting. Make it look good. All you need is colours. Pretty much all my mommy and daddy friends gave me tips like that when I talked to them about the art of dabba packing: fruits and dry fruits in small Tupperware boxes to snack on in the bus; use leftovers innovatively.Shinibali Mitra Saigal, who packs food for her nine-year-old daughter said, Mine doesnt like anything soggy, squidgy or leaky. My daughter claims that thanks to me, she had to eat pickled strawberries, which taste vile. When I asked her what she meant, she added, According to her, the pickle in an airtight container leaked and ran into the strawberry in a different compartment. So that makes it pickled strawberry and an excuse not to finish her lunch box.Ghosh wakes up ten minutes earlier in the morning to make extra sandwiches for her sons friends. According to my son, none of them want to share the fruits I pack, she said, with a sigh. But hes telling me that, and well, he hates fruits. SoLooking back, we can appreciate that one person who woke up at the crack of dawn to toil away in the kitchen to prepare fresh lunchboxes for the family. I regret the dabbas that I brought back home uneaten, even the alu methi, which really doesnt do itself any favours when cold. Okay, maybe not the alu methi.The author writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru."

A resident of Jattari in Aligarh, Prasad found that his mustard crop, spread over six bighas, was completely destroyed due to heavy rain and hailstones over the weekend. According to his son Rajveer, Prasad died on Monday evening after complaining of chest pain.He suffered a huge blow after seeing that the mustard crop had been almost completely destroyed, Rajveer told The Hindu. Prasad was not the only casualty of the untimely rain and hailstones. Two more farmers reportedly died in Agra due to the distress caused by destruction of crops. About 30-40 per cent of the crops have been destroyed by the sudden change in weatherOfficials told The Hindu that farmers were badly affected by the large-scale damage to crops. In Aligarh district, wheat, potato and other rabi crops were badly affected. There is no district in western Uttar Pradesh which has not seen crop damage.Though the agriculture department has begun surveying the losses incurred, unofficial estimates put the figure at 25-30 per cent.From the information we collected from the ground, production of wheat in Meerut division may go down by 15 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of crop damage in Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Agra and Aligarh division is about 20-25 per cent. The crop damage may go up further if it rains in the next few days, said Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch.Mr. Jaula said the problem was multi-fold for farmers. First of all, a large number of farmers have not enrolled for the crop insurance scheme. The other problem is that a farmer will get insurance benefit only if the crop damage is at least 33 per cent, which complicates the situation especially for small farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for survival, added Mr. Jaula."

Photo: International Potato CentreDo Perus potatoes have the right stuff?Thats the question scientists will be asking in Lima next month, when a selection of tubers will begin undergoing tests to determine whether theyre fit to grow on Mars.NASA, the U.S. space agency, is conducting the pioneering experiment together with Limas International Potato Center (CIP).They will cultivate a hundred selected varieties already subjected to rigorous evaluation in extreme, Mars-like conditions that could eventually pave the way to building a dome on the Red Planet for farming the vegetable.The selection was made from a total of 4,500 varieties registered at CIP, a non-profit research facility that aims to reduce poverty and achieve food security.Of the selected candidates, 40 are native to the Andes Mountains, conditioned to grow in different ecological zones, withstand sudden climate changes and reproduce in rocky, arid terrain.The other 60 are genetically modified varieties able to survive with little water and salt. They are also immune to viruses.Those that pass the tests must meet a final criterion  they must be able not only to grow well on Mars but also reproduce in large quantities. Were almost 100 per cent certain that many of the selected potatoes will past the tests, said Julio Valdivia Silva, a Peruvian NASA astrobiologist who is taking part in the ambitious project.The scientists hope the experiment will also help address the earthly scourges of hunger and malnutrition by identifying varieties suited to growing in harsh conditions.We must be prepared for the future, said virologist Jan Kreuze, a scientist at CIP. To respond to desertification, rising temperature and high salt content in the soil.Vegetable of the futureThe soil in La Joya Pampas  a sector of the Atacama Desert in southern Peru thats considered one of the driest places on earth  is very similar to that found on the Red Planet.The scientists plan to transport 200 pounds (100 kilos) of it to a CIP laboratory in Lima that will simulate the complex Martian atmosphere which contains mostly carbon dioxide  and expose it to extreme ultraviolet radiation.Well have more concrete results in one or two years, Mr. Valdivia said, adding that it will take more than five years to launch an unmanned mission to Mars.The potential future space crop is also one of the oldest.Records of potato cultivation date back to 2500 BC, when the indigenous Aymara Indians farmed it in modern-day Peru and Bolivia.If the varieties selected for next months experiment dont adapt to the desert soil, the researchers will introduce nutrients and subject them to radiation.If that doesnt work, Mr. Valdivia said, well administer a new method the CIP is using called aeroponics. The technique, used for cultivating plants without soil, would expose roots inside a sphere or cube that is sprayed with nutrients and contains a system for removing toxins. In future years, NASA plans to build a Mars research centre in the Peruvian desert.It would create a perfect replica of the Martian landscape and atmosphere for future research into space farming that could serve manned missions to Mars and other planets in the solar system.

Photo: University of BuffaloResearchers have developed a high-tech, food-tracking necklace that will alert you about the unique sounds that foods make as you bite, grind and swallow them.Each food as its chewed has its own unique sound and the device can help people suffering from diabetes, obesity, bowel disorders and other ailments by enabling them to better monitor their food intake and improve how they manage their conditions.There is no shortage of wearable devices that tell us how many calories we burn but creating a device that reliably measures caloric intake isnt so easy, said Wenyao Xu, assistant professor of computer science at University at Buffalo. Mr. Xu is creating a library that catalogues the unique sounds that foods make as we eat.The library is part of a software package that supports AutoDietary, a necklace being developed by Mr. Xu and researchers at Northeastern University in China.AutoDietary is like Fitbit and other wearable devices. Only instead of tracking burned calories, it monitors caloric intake  in other words, what we eat  at the neck. AutoDietary wraps around the back of the neck like a choker necklace.A tiny high-fidelity microphone  about the size of a zipper pull  records the sounds made during mastication and as the food is swallowed. That data is sent to a smartphone via Bluetooth where food types are recognised.The study, published in the IEEE Sensors Journal , describes how 12 participants ages 13 to 49 were given water and six types of food: apples, carrots, potato chips, cookies, peanuts and walnuts.AutoDietary was able to accurately identify the correct food and drink 85 per cent of the time. Mr. Xu plans future studies to build upon his library by testing different foods and recording the sounds they make.He also plans to refine the algorithms used to differentiate the foods to improve AutoDietarys ability to recognise whats being eaten.While promising, a wearable necklace that measures sound has limitations when used alone. For example, it cannot differentiate similar foods such as frosted corn flakes and regular corn flakes. It also cant distinguish the ingredients of complex foods such as soup or chilli.To address these limitations, Mr. Xu is planning a biomonitoring device which would complement AutoDietary. The device is under development but it would be activated once the necklace recognises that the user is eating a general category of food.  IANS"
