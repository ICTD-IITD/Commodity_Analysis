Ambedkar.The State government has decided to construct Dr. B.R. Ambedkar memorial on a sprawling 15-acre site in the new capital Amaravati. The memorial will consist of a park, convention centre, Buddhist meditation hall and a library besides a gallery encompassing the important events in the life of the architect of the Constitution. In addition, it was proposed to erect a 125-foot statue of Dr. Ambedkar as part of the memorial.Announcing this in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said the government decided to convert all the ST hostels into residential educational institutions during the current year and upgrade all social welfare hostels into residential schools in the next three years to enable the deprived sections get quality education. It was proposed to bring the management of tribal institutions under one umbrella for better quality management.He said the governments focus would be on improving the education and health standards of tribal people and dalits by upgrading the institutions run by the respective departments. In addition, it was proposed to focus on economic development activities of the tribal people with emphasis on products like organic coffee, geographical indication tag for turmeric and promotion of potato cultivation, organic cashew, vegetable cultivation and better marketing with value addition.Better branding and marketing of organic products through engagement of professional business consultants and skill development activities for at least one lakh members a year for ensuring gainful employment were among the measures. The government also relaxed the five-acre norm as eligibility criterion for economic support schemes like horticulture, NTR Jalasri, and other schemes.On the infrastructure development front, it was proposed to cover all the SC/ST habitations with CC internal roads, provision of safe drinking water under NTR sujala pathakam, construction of tribal museum at Visakhapatnam, electrification of all non-electrified habitations, provision of more LED lamps as well as waiver of power supply charges of up to 50 units a month and according priority to infrastructure development in all schools and educational institutions.Jagan picks holesThe main Opposition YSR Congress, however, dismissed the governments claims stating that the huge difference in the allocations made and actual amounts spent for the welfare of the SC/ST communities was an indicator to the hollowness of the assurances. Quoting from the statistics, Opposition leader Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy alleged that the government was unable to spend the funds earmarked for the SC/ST communities while it was diverting the funds granted by the Central government under the NREGA to other works.He alleged that the NREGA, which had 100 per cent wage component was, however, diluted subsequently as a result of which the material component was steadily rising.According to the governments own figures, over 1.7 crore people registered themselves under the NREGA, while the government had provided employment to little over 59 lakh people."
58f9ca59a3d24b0b70c4249d,Daughters of Nigella: Young British women promote healthy eating,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/daughters-of-nigella-young-british-women-promote-healthy-eating/article8457230.ece,2016-04-10,"Ella Woodward was buying ginger shots in New York. The British food blogger turned author was there to promote the publication of her second book, Deliciously Ella Everyday , in the United States, and she had caught a cold on the flight across the Atlantic. Her hotel was close to a juice store, though normally she prefers putting ginger through her own juicer and adding a squeeze of lemon.Its sharp and tart, but effective, she said. Ms. Woodward is a food celebrity in Britain, where her first cookbook, Deliciously Ella , named after her website, has had record sales since early 2015. It helps that even while sick, she has the look of someone who just came in from a brisk walk outdoors, with glowing skin, rosy cheeks and hair that falls in waves.She is one of a group of fashionable young women in Britain who are making a career of promoting healthy eating, including Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, Amelia Freer, Anna Jones and Natasha Corrett. The Guardian has called them the queens of greens; The Telegraph named them the superfoodies. One could also think of them as the Daughters of Nigella, the logical successors to Nigella Lawson, the food personality known for her lush desserts, sensuous presentation and high-profile split from art dealer Charles Saatchi.Ms. Woodward grew up in London, the daughter of supermarket heiress Camilla Sainsbury and politician Shaun Woodward.She used to eat lots of junk food but turned to a plant-based diet after she was found to have postural tachycardia syndrome in 2011. At first I had a lot of brown rice pasta with vegetables mushed with tomato, she said, but then she learned to cook.Her sweet potato brownies made with sweet potatoes, ground almonds, buckwheat, dates, raw cacao, maple syrup and salt are both popular and controversial, with online reviews calling them, alternately, divine, horrible and you will be disappointed.Chef sistersJasmine and Melissa Hemsley, aged 36 and 30 respectively, grew up eating food that was influenced by our mum from the Philippines fused with Grannys cooking. Jasmine Hemsley, a former model, said We ate a lot of old-school soups and stews, in no way fancy and without romanticism.Were big on bone broth soups, cooked vegetables and natural fats that come with meats, Melissa Hemsley said. Their signature dish is cauliflower crust pizza with Parma ham, arugula and Parmesan shavings.Vegetarian cravings36-year-old Anna Jones became a vegetarian at 25. She has written a A Modern Way to Eat: 200+ Satisfying Vegetarian Recipes . Taking something away opened up this whole way of cooking that hadnt existed for me before, she said.I love my salad with kale and coconut and miso and roasted tomatoes, but most popular with my readers are the recipes that are the simplest, the twists on classics, like my veggie burger, she said.Celebrity dieticianAmelia Freer, 40, grew up in England near the Scottish border, and was formerly an assistant to the Prince of Wales. Coming from a small town to London, to have a shop where you could buy lattes, croissants, ready-made sandwiches, I was like Woo hoo and would buy breakfast on the way to work and my evening meal on the way home, she said.A doctor suggested she change her diet, and she eventually went to school for nutritional therapy and has since attracted a clientele of mostly actors and musicians, including Sam Smith, who credits her with his recent weight loss. Working with the prince taught me to be discreet and not be fazed by anyone, she said.Natash Corret, 32, had a father who owned Le Boudin Blanc, a French restaurant in London. His side of the family is a long line of restaurateurs where you try everything and food is delicious and feeds your soul, she said. My mother, on the other hand, has celiac disease and is also very allergic to dairy, so I knew about gluten-free cooking and nut milk long before it was fashionable.I cant just eat what I want, unfortunately; I yo-yo dieted my entire life, she said. It was hard to find a balance. The thing is, it was a blessing in disguise. When I found the alkaline way of eating, it changed my life, and I created a career trying to show how great it is. (Alkaline eating aims for a certain acidity or pH in foods: corn, dairy, meat and wheat are all frowned upon.)Im a sweet-tooth person, she said. My sticky toffee pudding is insane.

58f9d3caa3d24b0b70c427d8,Potato seeds: farmers told to book in advance,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/potato-seeds-farmers-told-to-book-in-advance/article8440067.ece,2016-04-06,"The Horticulture Department has appealed to farmers, who need certified seeds of potato, to register with the department. They can register their names by paying Rs. 10 per kilo in advance. The State government has announced a subsidy of Rs. 10 per kilo for potato seeds.B. Suma, Deputy Director of the department, asked farmers to register their names at the earliest. Depending upon the number, the department would make arrangements to procure certified seeds, which will be distributed on first-come-first-serve basis.Hassan has been known for potato cultivation for the past several decades. However, in the last few years, potato growers suffered huge losses owing to late blight disease that reduced the yield substantially. Farmers were then dependent on potato growers in Punjab, who send them treated table potatoes for cultivation. In the last few years, farmers have been demanding certified seeds so that they can claim compensation.Last year, on an experimental basis, the department procured certified seeds for 60 farmers. Studies showed that the crop using certified seeds did not attract late blight disease. A subsidy was announced this year as the cost of certified seeds is higher than non-certified ones."

Pinning his hopes on the British sense of justice and fair play, he arrived in Calcutta to place his case before the then Governor General of India Lord Dalhousie. Stonewalled there, he made plans to appear before the Queen and the British Parliament. But that was not to be.Amid ongoing negotiations between his representatives and the Queen in London, the Sepoy Mutiny broke out in India. It not only dashed his hopes of retrieving Awadh, but also led to his house arrest in Fort William, as the British feared that he could become a rallying point for the rebels.Released from captivity after 26 months and given a purse of Rs. 12 lakh, Wajid Ali Shah set about creating a miniature Lucknow in Metiabruz, a locality in Kolkata.Palaces were built, gardens were laid and a regular court was set up as he brought an entourage.Centre of learningSome of the best poets and musicians of the time were attracted to Metiabruz as it became the centre of learned and talented men. Metiabruz would then often be referred to as Chhota Lucknow.The Nawabi ambience was complete with royal pastimes like wrestling, kite flying, cockfighting and fine dining. Gourmet delights such as potato biryani, sheermal, korma and shahi tukra , were prepared to perfection by the talented bawarchis (chefs) who accompanied the Nawab. The unique dishes of Metiabruz are being recreated at an event in the city this month.In a chat with The Hindu , Shahanshah Mirza, the great-great-grandson of the deposed Nawab said the dishes have now become part of the city. He said his family chose to make the city their home even after the birth of Pakistan.We had expected the Indian government to give us liberal grants after Independence but that never happend, he said. After that a part of the family decided to go to Pakistan but my grandfather Ghazanfar Mirza decided to stay back."
