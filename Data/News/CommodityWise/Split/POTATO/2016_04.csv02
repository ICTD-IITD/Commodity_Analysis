The cold buffet included Parma ham with melon, sesame crusted tuna nicoise, smoked duck with pear compote, shrimps ceviche, barley wuith prune and kalamata, artichoke and tomator terrine.The simmering hot roasted pumpkin soup was soft, sweet, rich in texture and creamy.The roasted turkey was carved and served to us. The turkey was well cooked, with subtle flavours of the giblet gravy, cranberry and potato that added to the glazed tasting.Honey glazed ham had a hint of sweetness, almost nil with the size of the slices served, the meat was succulent.The steak served was juicy and flavoured with barbecue sauce.The Coq au vin rouge won the buffet at the table - the meat was moist and cooked thorough.The classic pumpkin pie was dry, crumbled easily.The pie could have been better at least with a whipped cream on top.Maple pumpkin twists with cream cheese frosting was an interesting concept, but failed as the pumpkin stuffing was way too sweet.I had a diabetes threat in my mouth with the dessert.The Pavlov was the saving grace among the dessert with creamy and crumbly textures breaking into a moist combination of subtly sweet and fruity flavours.M Cafe at the Marriott also served red wine, which goes well with the meaty delight.They also served cinnamon maple whisky sour, ginger cranberry cooler and buck fizz at the dinner. Not a fan on buck fizz. The acidity of the citrus overpowers the sparkling wine flavour.Overall the dinner is a delight for a meat lover, especially if you are a fan of ham and turkey."

Skip the turkey,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/nov/26/thanksgiving-in-city-skip-the-turkey-1542623.html,2016-11-26,"BENGALURU: Dale Boone, an American competitive eater holding 52 world records celebrated Thanksgiving last year when he went back home to Atlanta. This year he was down with weather and skipped the party on Thursday and decided to host one on Saturday.A small get together with friends at home is something that he eagerly looks forward to.Residing in Bengaluru for the past ten years, the world food champion believes that Black Fridays have stolen the essence of traditional Thanksgiving in America.I talked to my family yesterday and the Thanksgiving meal was wound up early by about 2pm for the sake of Black Friday sale, Dale says. The Black Friday sale was offering the new iPhone7 for $99, which is about Rs 6000, he adds. His Thanksgiving last year was in a mall as well.One of the things missed in Bengaluru Thanksgiving is the turkey, though Dale did not miss it quite much since he used to pre-order a 3 kilo stuffed Turkey from a store in Indiranagar. The last time he ordered was two years back, this year the service was not available, he says.Camaron Vallepalli, who resides in Old Airport Road, has been celebrating Thanksgiving for the past ten years. Earlier it used to be a challenge to celebrate Thanksgiving in India because we wouldnt get the necessary ingredients and items required. But now the scenario has changed, food wise, we get everything we need and the tradition is kept true to its spirit, said Camaron who is from Connecticut.Though it is quite tricky to celebrate the occasions because Americans in India dont get a holiday, Cameron and her family of four members have been able to pull it off well with small get-togethers.This time she had prepared mashed potatoes, sweet potato casseroles, pumpkin pie and many others.I made the food I have grown up with in Thanksgiving, Camaron said. But instead of big Turkey we had Turkey salamis, she laughed.Brian Stock, who works in a startup and has been in the city for three-and-a-half-years has two Thanksgiving plans. The first one took place on Thursday night when about 35 people, mostly Americans, gathered at his house in Cooke Town for a grand Thanksgiving celebration. Chicken replaced the Turkeys but everything else was traditional. From food such as Corn Casseroles to stuffings to decorations. The other Thanksgiving that he will be attending to is on Saturday.But there is more than the second Thanksgiving the Americans are looking forward to. A day after the Thanksgiving, Christmas plannings set foot. We start listening to Christmas carols and start decorating from Friday, said Camaron.Thanksgiving is an annual holiday observed in the US on fourth Thursday in November and on Second Monday in Canada. Marked by family gatherings and celebrations, a traditional meal to commemorate a harvest festival is served."

This is the slowest rate at which retail inflation has grown in 14 months, having grown at 4.39 per cent in September helped by small rises in food prices.Making calls for a rate cut shriller, wholesale inflation also slowed down significantly in October, only growing by 3.39 per cent.The easing in CPI data is in line with the RBIs forecast for an average of 5 percent inflation for this financial year.The CPI saw the biggest slowdown in the vegetables category, which continued in the negative zone at (-)5.74 per cent as against (-)7.21 percent in the previous month of September. Sugar and confectionery, however, became dearer by 23.62 per cent.Pulses inflation numbers come as a respite to consumers who have battled high costs, slowing down to 4.11 per cent against 14.33 per cent. However, eggs became more expensive by 9.4 per cent.The index for fuel and light segment stood at 2.81 per cent in October as against 3.07 per cent a month ago.Wholesale price inflation, meanwhile, slowed for the second consecutive month at 3.39 per cent, again pushed by a decline in vegetable prices, which till July had scaled a high of 28.45 per cent.Easing inflation has prompetd industry representatives to demand a further reduction in interest rates to support investor as well as consumer sentiment.An immediate 50 basis points cut in repo rate should be considered by RBI as well as some measures, which may be introduced to provide easy finance for sectors like housing, automobiles and consumer durables, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry President Harshavardhan Neotia said.As per data on the wholesale price index released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry, prices of pulses and potato ruled high this year. The annual inflation rate for potatoes stood at a whopping 60.58 percent, while that for pulses stood at 21.8 per cent. The index for manufactured articles stood at 2.67 per cent in October compared to 2.48 percent in the previous month."

The kitchen also pans a non-vegetarian version of the dish, with a chicken stuffing, which complimented the ensemble well.The kitchen borrows tools from the science laboratory to create an ensemble that exploits every ingredient as a hero on the plate.The fluffy crunch and chowy substance of Spanakopita - a spinach pie wins the appetizer spread. It is a spinach and feta cheese mixture folded in phyllo sheets and baked. The pie is presented well in shot glasses with sauces.Kolokithokeftedes, which are fried zucchini fritters taste of a feta cheese and red onion mix and serves as a good bar food.The chicken souvlaki, which was served with pita bread delivered a smoky flavour with Greek spices on a lemon-based marinate.With the main course, veg moussaka scores high presentation and flavour. The dish has the crunch of fried potato grills, spun in a ball that sits atop an oven baked composition of layers of eggplant, potatoes, zucchini, feta and briami. The baked stuffing is delicious and melts in the mouth exuding flavours of the eggplant and spices.A non-vegetarian version of the dish was served with a well cooked lamb.Chef Shendre also serves this refreshing blend of hibiscus scoured vodka with tea foam as part of his experimental cuisine. Each mouthful of the drink is a fresh mix of the soothing tea and the calming hibiscus abstract - two elements extracted through molecular gastronomy techniques.The Greek desserts at the eatery score a whopper with the chef presenting each element on the dish artistically.While Belgian chocolate and black pepper panna cotta, both deliver visually and please the sweet tooth, baklava with caramel foam and nougat definitely beats them all. This shiny presentation that lays the Greek pastry structurally, one top of another, complimented with honey and caramel froth can definitely be touted to earn fans in the city.The cocktail menu has a spread of mixes that compliments the chefs delights.Of the colourful sips served are Blue Hawaii, Litchi Martin, Blonde, Litchi Passion and Lick my peach.The curry-based vodka punch - Litchi passion, which is the bartenders special and Orange Blossom - orange bitters, peels and gin is a must-try if you visit Kipos.If you are someone who is tired of the usual and are looking for a spread that accentuates each flavour and element on the dish, this place is for you."

In November 2008, on one such road near Bhadutola, then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and Union ministers Jitin Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan narrowly escaped a Maoist ambush. This sparked police excesses, particularly in Chotopeliya village, which triggered the Lalgarh movement in which 700 lives were lost over the next three years.In 2011, top Maoist leader Kishenji was killed near another tarred road not far from Bhadutola. Theres been peace and some development in this forest region since then. But demonetisation has stalled all that for now.For workers building a 10 km road project near Bhadutola, November 9 was to be the weekly pay day. Narendra Modis announcement on Nov 8, demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, put paid to it. The contractors decided to keep their cash.Since then, the project has been running on credit. Labourers, JCB operators and truck drivers have not been paid any money since November 8.We were last paid 15 days ago, says Sudha Singh of Chaita village. Asked how they have been managing, Sudhas wife Ashalata pointed to a kirana shop. Its shutters were down. The kirana shop used to give us credit. However, even he has stopped giving now. Now, we ask the upper caste farmers for food on credit.Munna Mitra, the contractor, pleads helplessness. Im operating even the JCBs on credit. On Thursday morning, the workers rebelled against me seeking credit. If I dont get any money, how can I pay them?The solitary bank in Bhadutola, which serves 28 villages, is giving out only Rs 2,000 notes or tattered Rs 20 and Rs 50 notes. Who will give me vegetables if I hand him a Rs 2,000 note? And wholl take tattered Rs 20 and Rs 50 notes, grumbled Kartik Singh of Chaita village.Agriculture has come to a standstill in this part of Bengal. Not all farmers tilling their fields for potato have Kisan Credit Cards, which have been made mandatory for withdrawing Rs 25,000 per week as per the new rules introduced last Thursday. I am not able to buy fertiliser, said marginal farmer Soumendranath Khamrai, who does not have the card.A group of 30 Banjaras, a nomadic tribe, have camped near the tarred road near Bhadutola, making and selling plaster of Paris dolls. But sales have been poor and they are now contemplating shifting to another village. Our dolls cost Rs 60-Rs 80. We dont accept bigger notes. Our sales have dropped. We should move to a newer place. But its the same everywhere, right? sighs Manju Devi."

The same resonated at this years CII Agro Tech 2016 where latest technologies were displayed and launched in a bid to boost the agriculture sector in the country.The young farmers invested in technological innovations, seeking solace from the mundane agricultural processes at the fest. Succha Dyal, a farmer from Gurdaspur said, CII Agro Tech 2016 provides a platform for farmers to pick and choose from a wide array of farm equipment related to the health of the soil, choice of crops to be grown and dairy farm management in the advent of latest technology.He added, I am happy to have invested in the National Pneumatic Planter Machine, which will help in yielding my crop productivity.Gurpreet Singh, representing National Agro Industries, which launched various new machines at the exposition said, Considering the extent of seed wastage in India, we have come up with the National Pneumatic Planter Machine that guarantees optimum seed to soil contact which ensures proper germination thereby, saving scarce and costly labour. This will definitely help in enhancing the profit levels of the rural farmers.Syncing with the thoughts, Tripta Devi, daughter of a small potato farmer from Fazlika district of Punjab said, Till a few years ago, the loss of crop production peaked up to 50 per cent, landing us into the viscous circle of debt trap. But now, the interface of government has helped us rise above the conventional crop cycle and diversify into other profitable crops. We dont have to suffer from crop ripening and wastage, owing to the farm to fork cold chain. This has really helped us save more and enjoy some luxuries of life which we couldnt afford earlier.The fest also hosted several self-help groups (SHGs) that specializes in homemade products. Trained by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, the farmers behind these groups are pioneers in producing the items apart from packaging and labeling them and finally connecting them directly with consumer in the market.More than 60 products made by farmers were on display at the CII Agro Tech 2016 such as the honey and pickle from the Gurdev Kaur Deols stall from the Ayali Khurd village in Ludhiana and turmeric and the Aleo Vera Gel from KKNS products of India of Burj village in Fatehgarh Sahib.I learnt of the help that the PAU offers in direct marking in 2011 and have since learnt the importance of marketing. It is really a great concept and I want to learn even more as there is no limit to what one can apply and earn, says Nirmal Singh (35) of the KKNS Group, who has a stall at the States Pavilion. The group has a turnover of around Rs 1 crore and sells 11 kinds of pickles, herbal tea and turmeric.56-year old Gurdev Kaur Deol from Ludhiana said, People are now aware of our products and we now have orders from Delhi and even the Southern India."

The farmers have not been paid for their paddy and cash has been sucked out of circulation. Sowing of wheat is 50 per cent of what it normally is every year, and 40 per cent of the potato crop is lying unsold.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 came bang in the middle of the potato season, mid-October to end-November. Some five lakh quintals of potatoes and potato seeds are supplied from Punjab to other states. But due to the sudden demonetisation of high-value currency, almost 40 per cent of the crop has been frozen in cold storage, explains Jang Bahadur Singh, secretary-general of the Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers of Punjab.And of the 60 per cent thats been dispatched, to states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Assam and Gujarat, a third of it is lying unsold in those states. As for the two-thirds that has reached the local markets, agents are saying they cant pay until they see some cash.Money rotation has stopped and we are unable to pay for labour here, says Jang Bahadur Singh. It has also become difficult for farmers to buy seeds and fertilisers.Omkar Singh, a farmer who has 18 acres in Gurdaspur, is as broke as his farmhands. I have a credit limit of Rs 10 lakh crop with my agriculture society, but I cannot clear my debts as I have no money. I have not been paid by the government agencies that procured my paddy. All money flow has stopped, he says.Omkar Singh went to pay off his debt with the little cash he had. But they refused to take his old notes. Now I am stuck. I cannot buy seed for the wheat crop, fertilisers, pesticides. My sowing has been delayed, adds Omkar Singh.Farmer Avtar Singh of Gurdaspur describes the full circle of his frustration: I have exhausted my crop credit limit and have to pay it back. My bank wont give me my money. The procurement agencies have not paid me for my paddy. And the credit society charges me 11.5 per cent interest on my loan while I stand in queue. I cant buy fertilisers, seeds or pesticides for the wheat crop. What should I do? ''Another Gurdaspur farmer, Manjit Singh, says he has sown just two acres of his ten. It took him four days to purchase wheat seed from the market. Dealers werent accepting old currency. And half of November is gone, he says.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Punjab, says farmers have been the worst hit. In the districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Sangrur, sowing of wheat is less than 50 per cent and a little better in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar.However, Punjabs director of agriculture, J S Bains, says the sowing figures are not as bad as they are being bandied about. Yes sowing has been affected. Normally, 95 per cent sowing is done by November 15. This year, 70 per cent sowing has been done till date. Out of 17 lakh quintals of seeds required for the crop, some 12 lakh quintals have already been purchased by famers, he says.Not just farmers, Punjabs traders have taken a hit too. We used to sell 100 mobile phones per day but we are barely selling one or two now, says Jagmohan Singh, who runs a mobile phone shop in Gurdaspur. No one has any money.Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh says the RBI orders prohibiting cooperative banks from exchanging/accepting old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are to blame for the state of affairs in rural Punjab.The state has 12,673 villages, and farmers deposit their earnings into cooperative banks, which have not been allowed to exchange old notes."

Business has slumped by 60% with traders warning of dire consequences to the countrys economy if this continues.This markets impact on business is so striking that the Union Home Ministry even dispatched a representative on Thursday to hold closed-door discussions with traders. Top representatives of the 1,980 wholesale traders at the market have requested the Centre to increase the individual daily withdrawal limit from banks for current account holders from Rs 24,000 to Rs 2 lakh per day.Spread over 93 acres, the APMC is not only the biggest in terms of trade volume but also the largest in south India in terms of area, says Bharat Shah, consultant to food grains and pulses merchants in the city.With 11 entry gates leading to the yard, it is a bustling market with tempos, small and big trucks zooming in and out all day and night. The average daily turnover was a whopping Rs 50 crore till November 8.Onions, potatoes, pulses, grains, sugar, jaggery, dry fruits  almost everything is available in this wholesale market.Loading workers at the yard now earn between D150 and D200 per day as the volume of trucks bringing in produce has come down | s manjunathWe cater to food requirements of 2.5 crore people across the state, including the one crore-plus population of Bengaluru and a large population in Hoskote, Dobbspet, Tumakuru, Magadi, Chintamani, Kolar and Ramanagara, said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains & Pulses Merchants Association.Daily turnover takes a hitAs one enters the gates of the market, bags of onion and potatoes are seen strewn around the yard or being auctioned off. The yard receives an average of 1 lakh bags of onion and 50,000 bags of potato daily. Groups of men are found standing in different spots in the yard, auctioning these items after the trucks arrive with the produce.From a daily turnover of Rs 50 crore, we now have a daily turnover of Rs 18 crore to Rs 20 crore due to the massive cash crunch all around. After the demonetisation move on November 8, our total turnover for the next three days hovered around Rs 5 crore only, said Lahoti. Business has been improving but we are still losing 60 per cent of our business and the Centre has to do something urgently. We requested their representative Anil Kumar, during our meeting on Thursday, to increase the withdrawal limit for current accounts to atleast Rs 2 lakh per day, he added.Traders around his shop concede that the wholesale business sees 90 per cent cash transactions. Representatives of farmers have been camping at the market for a day or two to collect due payment in new currency notes.They will not accept old Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes or cheque payments, a trader said. He adds that almost every trader here lost at least Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh by accepting cheque payments which later bounced. Business is no more done on trust, he added.Speaking of his outlet, Sunil & Co, located in MG Building in the yard, Lahoti said, I have been giving credit only to longstanding customers, whom I trust. I am losing the rest of my business."

In return for their labour, they are not paid in cash, but in the form of onions or potatoes. What is worse is that a huge chunk of these perishables are in a state of decay.Elaborating on the chores many poor women like her perform here, M Ambika says that when produce from farmers are brought in sacks, buyers would insist on checking a few sample bags before bulk purchase. An entire bag is emptied and the buyer would inspect them and choose only the good ones. He keeps aside the rejected potatoes or onions, she explains.A large section of the women, two in each onion or potato outlet, help the buyers put the selected onions in a sack for transportation. In return for our labour, we are allowed to take these rejected items. We eke out a living by selling them for cheap, Ambika says. Some buyers also give them one or two kg of fresh onions. When asked as to who would actually buy the rotten perishables, pat comes her reply, Hotels and small grocery shops.However, even this paltry income has been hard to come by due to a dip in the number of lorries as well as sacks reaching the yard since November 9. I used to make between Rs 100 and Rs 200 per day. Now it is between Rs 50 and Rs 100 per day, Ambika says.There are roughly 2,000 labourers employed in the yard. The men largely do the loading and unloading of produce.Muruga and his colleagues are quite a disgruntled lot. We used to earn Rs 700 to Rs 800 per day and have work thrice a week. Now we earn Rs 150-Rs 200 a day due to the reduced number of trucks coming to the yard, he says. He is among a group of labourers who come to the city from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh for seven to eight months each year to earn a living.Ganesan, a co-worker says, Just see this truck now. Seven of us were trying to offload the 300 sacks in it which is normally done by two or three people. This will reduce all our wages.Jaishanthappa of Bharat Traders, a potato dealer, says, I used to buy a truck-load of potatoes a day. Now I am buying only one every four days due to cash crunch.The regret over the diminished income and cash crunch echoes across owners and labourers."

Is their any connection? Yes, proves a group of head load workers who have joined hands with a few residents at the Kalikkotta Palace Road near Tripunithura Statue junction. The initiative has not only helped in curbing stray dog menace but has also yielded them good harvest of vegetables.How the dogs grew in numbersThe area near the Statue Junction was once a dumping yard for waste materials where people often dumped food and plastic waste during the night. It was common for stray dogs which hunt for food to camp in the area. Soon, the number of dogs visiting the spot increased, creating a threat to school children in the early hours of the day.Fed up by the foul smell emanating from the waste and the increasing number of dogs, the CITU head load workers whose office is located at Statue Junction decided to take matters in their own hands.We were thinking of a solution. This is when we realised that the area on the road side was lying vacant which is the major reason why people were using it as a dumping yard. If we use the land effectively and make them feel that the spot is not vacant, they will hesitate to dump waste there. After discussions, we came to a conclusion that vegetable cultivation was a good idea, said A M Manoj, a head load worker.Manoj, along with other workers Purushan, Raju, Babu, Pushkaran, Mohanan, Sasi, Johnson and Viswakumar decided to go ahead with the plan. As the cultivation will not affect the pedestrian movement, they were not worried about official sanction.We bought the seeds from the agri-outlet in Tripunithura and planted ladys fingers, tomatoes and cow peas initially. Seeing the success, we have planted more varieties like chinese potato (koorkka), green chilly and ginger, he added."

Rai, a former zilla parishad member, wields considerable influence in the area due to his close ties with the RJD chief, said sources.The IMFL cartons were kept hidden under soil and grass loaded in the truck. An employee of the brick kiln has been arrested and two cars and a bike have been seized, said Subodh Kumar Mishra, SHO of Sadar police station in Hajipur, the headquarters town of Vaishali district.While both the ruling JD(U) and RJD declined to comment on this seizure a day after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar addressed a workshop of JD(U) on prohibition, the Opposition BJP targeted the alliance government. The CM said at this workshop that prohibition enforced by his government in the state has been a historic success. Such seizures show the secret of this success. In the name of prohibition, leaders of the ruling parties and police officials are making a fast buck, said senior BJP leader Sanjay Tiger.In the past three days, police and excise department officials seized huge quantities of liquor smuggled into Bihar in potato-laden trucks. In one of these seizures in Chapra, 250 cartons of IMFL were seized from a truck that reached a potato godown in the town. The liquor cartons were kept under sacks of potato. Police sources said the liquor was brought from Punjab.CM Nitish Kumar recently asked police and excise department officials to crack down on liquor smugglers and ensure that liquor does not enter into Bihar from other states."

They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court. He said about 55 farmers in his village are served notices and are told to appear before the court on August 29. How can I attend court spending `500-1,000 when I have no money to buy fodder for my cows? he said.He said banks have claimed `500 more for serving notice and alleged that these pressure tactics would only force farmers to take extreme steps.The stir has hit transportation of textile products to Mysuru during the Dasara festivities and it has delayed moving of black granite to ports in Tamil Nadu for the last two weeks."

What does it mean to be a plus-sized women today? On one hand, it means being asked to change and aspire to fit into an unrealistic beauty standard. On the other, it also means finding fashionable clothing a daunting task. You would probably find Thors hammer faster than a stylish fit thats also affordable for plus-sized women!Illustration Amit BandreIts no secret that there is a careless assumption that body fat is equal to being unfit. Most people perceive plus-sized people to be lazy, slow, and also as a group of people that cant look after themselves. Its like an anti-fat attitude all over, rues Riya, who recently became a mother. What she wasnt expecting was the extent of de-sexualisation shed feel when looking for clothes designed for plus-sized pregnant people. Instead of cute tight dresses to show-off my baby bump, all I could find are potato sacks, and plain A-line tops, she sighs.Shopping, which is supposed to be fun, often turns into a harrowing experience. The stick-thin mannequins definitely dont help either. Im a size 14 and have squeezed into a size 10 because it is so difficult to find clothes that fit! But if the only way to find a pair of jeans (that fits me) is to pay `5,000, then maybe it isnt my body thats the problem; its fast, affordable fashion, avers a frustrated Shraddha.If finding denims wasnt hard enough, Priya adds another dimension to the dilemma and talks about swimsuits. Speedos! Those are my only options. The half-dress swimsuits that cut off mid thigh and are in boring colours. Im not asking for low-cut, slinky suits, that seem to make everyone around me uncomfortable, but Im not expecting this either. Anisha (name changed) is 52 and weighs around 80 kg, and finds it virtually impossible to find something that fits her well. What fits my hips will be too long. What fits the length of my body will not come past my breasts!Which brings us to our next point: is there an ideal plus-size? While women are excited that stores are catering to bigger sizes and advertisements are finally looking at more realistic women, many dont feel like the body positivity movement is inclusive. The majority of plus-sized women have flat stomachs, big breasts and wide hips, Shraddha points out.In this appearance-driven world, body positivity offers an alternative: diversity. Is this the end of the conversation? Absolutely not! This is the beginning of a movement that decentralises the emphasis on a particular ideal body and appreciates all shapes, sizes and colour. Take a step to love your curves and embrace your style, whatever skin you may hold."

But what we saw in those 75 days was her soft, caring side, says CV Sheela, one of the 16 nurses who cared for the late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa at Apollo Hospitals.She loved upma; upma, pongal, curd rice and potato curry were her favourite dishes. With each spoon of food, she would say I will eat this morsel for Sheela, this one for Saamu, and each subsequent spoonful for yet another nurse in the room. She motivated herself and us with simple words like these.Among the nurses, Jayalalithaa lovingly referred to her favourite three  CV Sheela, MV Renuka and Samundeeshwari  as the King Kongs.After being shifted to the general ward, she would watch TV for an hour every day and listen to old Tamil songs with us. She was moved when she saw on TV that thousands of people were praying for her, says Renuka.Whenever someone entered her room, she would smile and ask, What can I do for you? chief nursing superintendent Suneetha R recalls, adding that the nurses were moved by Jayalalithaas trust in them. She would throw balls and play with us, in accordance with the physiotherapists instructions.She never refused our suggestions.

Bakeries are stocked with a variety of cakes and super markets have hung out all the new decorative items that have come in. Chennai is now home to Christians from various countries. City Express caught up with a few foreigners and Chennaiites to understand the traditions that are associated with Christmas.Gifts, drinks and food are the most integral part of Christmas for Sofia Juliet, who was raised a Catholic and is all set for Christmas. Now is the time to get together and enjoy a scrumptious meal. Wine and plum cakes are a must! she says. Catholics across the world celebrate in the same way  midnight mass, exchange gifts and sing carols. But the main difference between the celebration in the West and here is that, in the West, Christmas festivities begin in October. There is not much pomp and show here, she adds.Mallika Angela Chaudhuri, a Canadian, misses the white Christmas and it is quite evident when she starts to reminisce about the celebrations there.The weather would be cold, but warm. There will be happiness in the air and its all about giving more than receiving, she says.A socially empowering society, in Canada, people gather outside to celebrate the festival with the less fortunate. You are sure to see many families serving food to the poor. Then there are people dressed as Santa Claus who collect donations to buy gifts for the needy, she smiles.Talking about the wide spread of donating food, she says, Technically the festival season sets in during Thanksgiving, where again there is a wide spread of food. For Christmas, we have egg nog, turkey roast, pumpkin marshmallow pie and of course, wine. As a child, her favourite Christmas memory was going to the yard to pick out the perfect tree. There would be around 2,000 trees and you get to choose yours. Many families used to grow their own trees too.Laura Schorcht and Fabienne Schoch were busy decorating their Christmas tree when we met them. Our family is atheist but we do love Christmas and have our own traditions. Germany is colourful and filled with music this time of the year, says Laura. As a child she would have to recite a poem before receiving her gift from Santa. I was upset when I found out Santa was not real, she laughs and Fabienne pitches in, I knew it the minute I saw one of our family friends struggling hard to be Santa.Since Lauras house near a forest, it is her family tradition to have wild meat on Christmas. We hunt the stag ourselves and that forms a part of the lunch. We have Gluhwein, a spicy red wine along with the meat, she says. At Fabiennes place, they have a special sausage, potato salad and Gluhwein. This year they plan to have a quiet Christmas but exchange gifts.In France, its mandatory that all wishes that kids write down for Santa are fulfilled. Photographer Yannick Cormeir misses the Christmas in his city. There are Christmas markets and we start celebrations from 24th. We give gifts to kids and binge on special dishes, especially seafood, wine and champagne, he says. In Chennai, Christmas to him means catching up with friends and showering his daughter with gifts.Among all these traditions, the Anglo Indians in the city have a unique way of celebrating it. There is food, midnight mass, nativity crib and dance! We celebrate Christmas for a month. Every Sunday we do a part of the decorations  first the star, then the tree and lastly the crib. On the night of Christmas, all the Anglo Indians get together at the association and celebrate the birth of Christ by dancing the night away, shares Geraldine Maria Rozario.Each one of them has made Chennai their second home. If not in a grand manner, they know how to keep the spirit of Christmas alive."

""Maybe tomorrow onwards, every two, three weeks, I will have to go the ATM or bank to get cash.""India's ""black economy,"" a term widely used to describe transactions that take place outside formal channels, amounted to around 20 percent of gross domestic product, according to investment firm Ambit.New bills of 500 and 2,000 rupees will be introduced from Nov. 10. Jaitley said it would take two to three weeks to replace the old notes, amid concerns over the availability of cash.POLICE ON ALERTDeepak Chhatoi, a salesman at a car varnishing store in Mumbai, said he had to turn away customers wanting to pay with larger bills, and could not buy the popular potato sandwich known as the vada pav.""I couldn't even have breakfast this morning because there seems to be a shortage of change in the market,"" he said.The extent of the impact of the measures became evident as petrol stations and hospitals also refused to accept larger denomination bank notes, even though the government had given them a waiver to continue accepting them.Meanwhile, bank ATMs were closed and banks prepared for a flood of people seeking to exchange larger bank notes for smaller ones.They will have to fill a form and show proof of identity to exchange no more than 4,000 rupees worth of the old notes at any bank, which is likely to cause further chaos.Swapan Mandal, a labourer, wanted to withdraw 3,000 rupees from an ATM and send it to his family in Kolkata, in eastern India, but was unable to do so.""I have only 500 rupees notes at home. I don't know if I will be able to send the money,"" he said.A sub-inspector in New Delhi said the police commissioner had issued orders to watch for disturbances, especially at key retail outlets like petrol pumps.""This is a sensitive time. We have to be alert,"" he said.TEMPORARY GOLD RUSHThe main opposition Congress party said it supported moves to attack the shadow economy, but that withdrawing bigger denomination notes would hit the common man first.""Modi shows how little he cares about ordinary people of this country - farmers, small shopkeepers, housewives, all thrown into utter chaos,"" said party leader Rahul Gandhi.""(All the) while the real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed away abroad or in bullion or real estate.""Indians raced to turn their cash into gold, which jumped nearly 4 percent to its strongest in more than five weeks as investors sought safety following Trump's unlikely win.India is the world's second largest gold consumer and around a third of its demand comes from the unaccounted sector.On Tuesday night, jewellers in Mumbai kept shops open until midnight as panicked people rushed to buy gold with cash, said Kumar Jain, vice president of the Mumbai Jewellers Association.On the stock market, real estate firms that depend on cash transactions were hit particularly hard, with DLF Ltd, India's biggest property developer, closing 17 percent lower.But analysts said the move would prove beneficial to India in the longer term, by ushering in transparency and bringing transactions into the formal economy, and providing additional revenue for a country that has long struggled to contain its fiscal deficits.It could also lead to easing inflation, raising the prospect of additional rate cuts from the central bank, which lowered the key repo rate by 25 basis points last month"

A plethora of children in bright neon running shoes, adults and senior citizens were scattered around the perimeter of Besant Nagar to complete a 5k and 10k run at the INNER STRENGTH 2016 event organised by UNIS in association with Sathyamoorthy Foundation as part of their first anniversary celebrations.This is the first time I am part of a running event. I used to run when I was in school, but things changed after I got married and so on. Fitness wasnt given much importance. But, today I made the decision to keep myself healthy and I am so happy on completing the 5k run! exclaimed Saradha, a 40-year old.UNIS was formed by Viji Swaminathan and Ranish Hariharan, trainers and Nip practioners in 2015 with the primary aim of motivating people to run. Normally people feel that only trained professionals can run but, they forget that they used to run as children. With time, they lose touch with any physical activity and become absorbed in other things, said Viji. All you need is a good pair of shoes, comfortable clothes and a drive to go from being a couch potato to a much healthier phase.Narrating her couch-to-10k story, she recalled, I was almost a 100kg and was a couch potato basically very unhealthy. I started walking for fun. I am not a fast runner, but running itself helps us be fit irrespective of the speed, she explained.From its initial stage of having two to three members in the group, UNIS has grown as big family, opines Viji. Currently, UNIS has 2 chapters UNIS-Bessie and UNIS-Light House. Initially I started a chapter at Bessy with just two people. Later, there was a demand for the training at Marina and we flagged off our second chapter, she smiled.UNIS, apart from training beginners, has two more verticals: campus to corporate training and corporate training. With 250-odd runners, jogging, running and marching towards the end point at the event, it was surprising to see that most participants were first time runners. Viji shared, The goal was to embrace running, not create a racing atmosphere. We had a lot of beginners today and it was a mixed group. Inner strength 2016 is out first event supporting Jeevadhanan an orphanage to educate girl children. The proceeds from the registration will be given to educate them via Sathyamoorthy foundation.For details, visit:https://www.facebook.com/unisindia"

They have a new menu to celebrate their fifth anniversary in India.Walking into the dimly lit restaurant on the fourth floor of a mall, I am surprised by the burst of colours on the table. Two sets of bamboo baskets come to my table for starters and they open to reveal purple-glazed dim sums and bright orange dim sums adorned with caviar. The purple dim sums has chicken, coriander and chestnut fillings. The layer made of potato starch and wheat starch gets that tinge of purple from the red cabbage. The orange dim sum called Spicy Har Gau has prawns and bamboo shoots in it. The meatiness of the prawn with a faint hint of sour bamboo makes for a melt-in-the mouth dish. The purple one is a harmonious blend of Asian spices.The restaurant that believes in modification of authentic cuisines has modified quite a few. The Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun was one such and it is now the restaurants specialty. Cheung Fun or the Cantonese Rice Roll is traditionally served steamed but the twist here is the crispy layer of fried tempura batter that drapes around succulent prawns and black fungus. Warm soya is poured on top of the silky texture that gives the taste buds a sweet, sour delight.For the main course, we are served Pork and Shrimp Fried Rice and Roasted Duck Udon Noodles. The fried rice is the kind that you would have in a good Chinese restaurant, not much of a surprise, but then I am told the basmati rice has been soaked in Jasmine water. After that I get the taste of jasmine, stir-fried with pork, shrimp and prawns. The chewy Udon Noodles is rich in taste of duck and seasonings.It is a delightful and heavy lunch and they serve Jasmine Tea, to help us with digestion. It is a good idea.Then comes the desserts, the restaurants USP. What I always tell the guests, who are not up for a heavy meal, is this have the dim sums, skip the main course and go straight for the dessert, says Ajay, one of the staff. We are served Citrus Tart and Blueberry Pistachio Bar with Lemon Yoghurt Sorbet and Grapefruit Sorbet respectively.The desserts look delightful with an emphasis on the presentation. The yellow, round Citrus Tart and the Brown Pistachio Bar both are signature dishes. The Pistachio Bar has tiny macaroons, the kind of cakes Yauatcha is known to make it in-house. The Pistachio Bar has four layers -- the base is with grinded almond base, topped with a layers of chocolate, pistachio, blueberry mousse and blueberry glaze. The layers are firm and the sweet taste of creamy pistachio balances out the slightly sour blueberry. . The tangy Citrus Tart is a play of bitter, sweet and sour.The sorbet is a bonus show stealer. It is subtle, rich and creamy. The Lemon Sorbet tasted of lemon, minus the excess sourness that causes us to cringe, and replaces it with the taste of rich cream and yogurt. Same with the Grapefruit Sorbet. I must mention the Hot Toddy mocktail. If you have a bad throat, like I do, then this is what you should opt for. A good mixture of orange juice, pineapple juice and masalas. Youll need to hold the wine glass with a napkin but once you sip on it, the flavours seem to dance.(Approximate cost for twopeople `2,100.

Despite such little disappointments, RJ Ophelias gardening experience in the last two years has lifted her spirits.Through her busy schedule, which includes anchoring festival-special celebrity shows and interviews for Lycas new YouTube channel, she finds time for the plants.I live in an apartment; so I dont have much space for gardening. I grow areca palm, nithyakalyani, skyblue clustervine, few crotons and, of course the ubiquitous money plant in my pots, says Ophelia.When she is busy, her neighbour, their maid, her cook, and her in-laws take turns to water plants. But she takes out at least 10 minutes every day for her plants. I talk to my plants like nallaa valaruppa seekkiram (grow well soon). I also caress the leaves but I dont sing to them. My neighbours will find it weird, she laughs.She began gardening with a potato seed. Its nice to have some greenery around. Plus they always makes me happy. Its a greater satisfaction when they bloom or bear fruits.We asked her about her first learning experience. It was on how to break soil and mix it with manure.""I learnt it from my mom, and also my periyamma. They are happy gardeners. Whenever they spot any plant on the roadside worth growing at home, they pick it up! Once they picked up blue bells from Yercaud and successfully grew them in our sultry, hot city. My mom grows a whole variety of flowers, greens and vegetables! she says.When she tried growing potatoes in the beginning, only the leaves grew. Start with an easy plant and then move on to plants that require a lot of maintenance. Now, the bitter-gourd plant is close to her heart. She got the seeds from Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department and the manure is bought from nurseries.With the rains around the corner, Ophelia is not worried. All her plants can thrive in the rainy season. The only thing that she has to worry about is the water-logging of pots. Her one last piece of advice: Like my mom often says loosen the soil once a week to get more oxygen to the root system and add manure once in a while."

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

It opens a window to seeing the world differently, with its many magical surprises. Designing a garden that is child-friendly will sustain their interest. Here are some top tips to make it so.Select a small patch of the whole garden space for this garden. Here, they can do activities by themselves like digging, sowing, watering and weeding. Take care of their safety. Avoid using the materials which will hurt them while gardening.The pots and the planters which are used in the garden can be painted with different colours and decorated with their favourite cartoon characters. This will make things more fun. Kids are curious about new things. The kids garden should have plants which grow fast. They will be thrilled to see the sprouting and emerging of a new leaf from a seed which was sown by them. Plucking a carrot from the soil and eating them with the fresh soil flavour will become their green childhood stories. They will enjoy the colours. Bright flowering plants would be a smart addition to their garden.The child-friendly garden should have some interesting structures where the kids can play, learn and grow plants. It could be done in many creative ways. You could design an alphabet garden where the raised beds could be designed like an alphabet. Pizza gardens could be designed in a small circular patch of land where all the vegetables and the herbs which are used in pizzas could be grown. Beans can be grown in a spiral cage attached to the pot, making them more engaged with the plant by trailing it on the cage.In case you have no space on the ground to have a child-friendly garden, don't worry. Make some interesting planters at home which gives them the happiness of growing food. Potato man, aqua onion are easy to make and perfectly fit your window sill garden at home. Here is how to make a potato man and aqua onion:Take a big size potato. Cut the potato one inch from the top and scoop out all the flesh with a spoon or a knife. Leave a thick layer of flesh around the skin. Fill the potato with soil and sow some Ragi seeds on that. Sprinkle some water every day. Ragi will germinate within a week and grow like the hair of the potato. Draw a face on the potato with its green lush hair on the top. Wheat, paddy or any other cereal seeds could be used.Aqua onions: Take a cup and fill with water. Keep an onion in that in such a way that the roots are touching the water. After a week new shoots will come from the onion. Engage your kids in watering and trimming the shoots.The options are endless! So start to grow plants and nurture your kids in a greener world.

Most people perceive plus-sized people to be lazy, slow, and also as a group of people that cant look after themselves. Its like an anti-fat attitude all over, rues Riya, who recently became a mother. What she wasnt expecting was the extent of de-sexualisation shed feel when looking for clothes designed for plus-sized pregnant people. Instead of cute tight dresses to show-off my baby bump, all I could find are potato sacks, and plain A-line tops, she sighs.Shopping, which is supposed to be fun, often turns into a harrowing experience. The stick-thin mannequins definitely dont help either. Im a size 14 and have squeezed into a size 10 because it is so difficult to find clothes that fit! But if the only way to find a pair of jeans (that fits me) is to pay `5,000, then maybe it isnt my body thats the problem; its fast, affordable fashion, avers a frustrated Shraddha.If finding denims wasnt hard enough, Priya adds another dimension to the dilemma and talks about swimsuits. Speedos! Those are my only options. The half-dress swimsuits that cut off mid thigh and are in boring colours. Im not asking for low-cut, slinky suits, that seem to make everyone around me uncomfortable, but Im not expecting this either. Anisha (name changed) is 52 and weighs around 80 kg, and finds it virtually impossible to find something that fits her well. What fits my hips will be too long. What fits the length of my body will come past my breasts!Which brings us to our next point: is there an ideal plus-size? While women are excited that stores are catering to bigger sizes and advertisements are finally looking at more realistic women, many dont feel like the body positivity movement is inclusive. The majority of plus-sized women have flat stomachs, big breasts and wide hips, Shraddha points out.In this appearance-driven world, body positivity offers an alternative: diversity. Is this the end of the conversation? Absolutely not! This is the beginning of a movement that decentralises the emphasis on a particular ideal body and appreciates all shapes, sizes and colour. Take a step to love your curves and embrace your style, whatever skin you may hold."

But ask anybody in the locality for the address, and they would not only give the directions, but accompany you till the doorstep, as a token of respect for the deceased. Jayanthi Pawar visits the homes of the three Chellammal Womens College students, mowed down by a water tanker a week ago, and finds their families havent yet been able to move onGrief-struck relatives of Gayathri at their home in Alapakkam | martin louisIn the front room of the small, one-bedroom grey house inside a narrow lane in Alapakkam hangs the photo of a young girl. Gayathri, reads the name written on a corner of the photo, with a garland on it and a lit lamp in front. This is where we wanted to put her marriage photo, said her mother M Selvi, struggling to contain memories and tears.The family is yet to come to terms with her tragic death. When this reporter visited her home on Wednesday, her mother and aunt were seated on the floor, folding Gayathris new cloths that were just delivered by their tailor. It is a salwar that she wanted to wear to college, Selvi said. Every day, her father Murugesan, who runs a tea stall, would drop her at the Porur bus stand, from where she would board the bus to college. But it was a bit different on the day of the accident. She unusually requested him to wait until she boarded the bus around 12.30 pm. About an hour later, Selvi received a call from a relative informing her that TV news channels were reporting some trouble near Gayathris college. Selvi rushed to the college with her niece, but couldnt find her daughter. When her niece called on her mobile phone, they were asked to reach Royapettah Government Hospital. As I was waiting in front of the casualty, I saw my daughters dress through the window of a white van. It had blood stains. I peeped into the van only to find her body with her head smashed. Only then I realised there was an accident in which she was killed.Gayathri, Selvi recalled, wanted to become an IPS officer; a dream that was trampled in just a brief but cruel moment on the black, pitiless roads of the city.Asha Shruthis kin, who are yet to come in terms with her death | martin louisChristaraj was in Bengaluru that day, with a customer who had booked his cab. He had left home early, around 4.30 am, to ferry the passenger for a christening ceremony and back. Around 1.45 pm, he received a call from his daughter Asha Shruthis phone. It was not her but an unknown voice, informing about the death of his daughter.But it was a happy occasion, I could not tell anybody the news. I had to remain quiet and started from Bangalore around 3 pm along with the customers and drove down to Chennai, said the distraught father, hastening to add that he drove very carefully.Christaraj cannot but recall that the last he saw his daughter was when he left early that morning, when Asha was fast asleep. There in their home in Pulianthope, there is a packet of potato chips, a bar of Dairy Milk chocolate, few books on accounting and bright, beautiful salwars. The books and cloths are hers. Even today I bought her favourite potato chips and chocolates, he added, clearly finding it difficult to deal with the sudden absence of his daughter.The family is dependent on his income. Even on that fateful day, her friends had offered her a lift in an auto-rickshaw from Guindy railway station to the college. But Ash had only `10 on her. So she decided to walk.She had big plans for future. Asha wanted to be a chartered accountant. Only a week before the accident, she had told me not to worry about finances. She said she would start working and pursue her CA part time, as we could not afford to pay the fees, her mother Dhilpheia said between tears.Chitras family members recalling the optimistic girl they knew | p jawaharEvery day, Chitra would travel about 30 km to attend her college, including 5 km on foot. But there was not a never a day that she complained. This was important in her scheme of things for the future, where she saw herself clearing the State public service exam to become a government employee and support her family. She was preparing for it, and believed she was just six months away from it.Chitra was an optimistic girl. Even when all the things in the house was washed away during the December floods, it was she who smiled and asked me not to worry, said her father Loganathan, a canteen worker at a private company.For the last one week of her life, Chitra kept asking us not to worry about the debts. I will start working in another six months, and we will repay all our debts she repeated, said Kalavathi, her mother who works in the packing section of a pharmacy company. Their daughter was the first graduate in the family about whom they all were proud of, on whom they had built their dreams.Chitra was a hard worker. She would wake up early, finish her assignments and leave early to reach college. Before and after that, she would attend to the chores at home in her mothers absence. Throughout the week, she would concentrate on the household work and studies. But weekends were for grandparents [who live in the same locality], which she would never skip, Loganathan added.My daughter would never let me be alone, but its been six days now since I am left alone, said Kalavathi struggling to stop herself from bursting into another bout of cries and tears."

The iconic Iyengars bakery is currently being run by its fourth generation entrepreneur, HT Srinivas, who opened another store in Austin Town in 1981 to serve delicious bakes to a larger number of Bengalureans.Decades after, his honey cakes and potato bakes are a sensation in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.However, with branches spread across south India and a few stores in Maharashtra, the new generation businessmen and Sridharas sons  30-year-old Lakshmeesha and 26-year-old Raman  now have a problem at hand with imposters. Numerous bakeries in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai are using Iyengar brand name to serve their bakes.I first spotted a bakery carrying our name near Austin Town about four years ago. Those who wanted cheap bakes and didn't bother with quality would go there, but our loyal customers stuck through. The fake stores may have copied our name but they cannot match us in quality, says Raman HS.Even before the 26-year-old learnt that Mumbai hosts close to 400 fake Iyengar Bakeries, Raman had filed a case against the fake store in Bengaluru, but did not have a legal stand in court as the bakery's trademark has not been registered.Raman learnt about the fake stores in Mumbai after a man came up with a rather weird business proposition, where he said that he would like to lease out an Iyengar Bakery store in Mumbai to Raman. This caught him unawares since he had never known of the existence such a store in his chain. Many have been exploiting the brand that their older generations took decades to build, but the sons are helpless to defend it.Srinivas had registered the bakery's trademark in the 90s with a logo that had a picture of Lord Venkateshwara. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that names of gods or holy books cannot be trademarked to sell goods and services. Following this his son Raman applied for another trademark with a logo adhering to the new policy three months ago.However, without a registered trademark the sons do not have a legal stand in terms of ownership, even if they file a case against the duplicates.You'll find these fakes using our brand name in almost every nook and corner of South India, especially in Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru. I am planning to travel to Hyderabad to find out if there are such stores there, says the MBA graduate.With an alarming number of fakes cropping up in major Indian cities, the sons are determined to do whatever it takes to save their brand from being tarnished by those who sell low quality bakes manipulating the brand to attract customers.I am applying for a patent to safeguard the brand name  Iyengar Bakery  to avoid this rampant misuse. I plan to start a franchise model of business for our bakery in the next three months. An original Iyengar Bakery will only be run by the Iyengars. This is a community-based business, where all of our stores are run by our close or distant relatives, informs Raman."

A KBPS source said the task of printing these 60,000 tomes will affect the printing of over 1.56 crore books that are set to be distributed to the students before Onam vacation. At present we have cleared the partial printing of books for the second volume but now owing to the printing of these 60,000 books we have completely scrapped the second volume. Only after completing this can we restart the printing and that will normally take one more week. It is quite clear that the distribution of the second volume will be delayed, said an official associated with the printing work in KBPS.According to him, the minimum printing requirement for each title has resulted in the completion of the printing of 60,000 books which became a political hot potato with the Opposition trying to pin the government down. There is no point in blaming the KBPS for the delay since the Textbook Officer, who has to submit the intent order, must take the full responsibility. As per the earlier order we have completed the printing of 2.88 crore books and distributed them by June 20 itself but no additional order reached our office and it was only last week that we got the order for printing 60,000 books. Using the three machines we can print a minimum of 2 lakh books a day. We are wasting several lakh owing to the irresponsible behaviour of the Education Department, the official said, adding, no complaints had been lodged with the hubs that had functioned until July 16.Noushad, Production Manager, KBPS, said,  It is a fact that the printing of the second volume has been affected but we are working hard to avoid any kind of delay in distributing the second volume of books. As the new order contains a minimum of five-100 in each volume it needs some time. Most probably we will complete the printing of these 60,000 books by next week and will start the printing of the second volume, said Noushad, Production Manager, KBPS.Meanwhile, it is believed that the government is probing the reasons resulting in the shortfall of 60,000 textbooks last time. Besides, the officials conducting the probe have started raids at all the 14 hubs and 3,100 distribution centres."
58fd5dde7be9e06c9371a7fa,Pellets or grains for furry friends?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2016/sep/21/Pellets-or-grains-for-furry-friends-1521949.html,2016-09-21,"CHENNAI: A nutritious and balanced diet is essential for your furry friends, but how can you pick the right one? You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

While the subsidy for new cold storages in plain area is 55 percent of the project cost subject to a maximum limit of Rs 2.20 lakh, the subsidy amount is Rs 2.80 lakh for scheduled areas.The state government has announced to provide subsidy of 50 per cent on electricity tariff for six years for the existing cold storages and the ones to come up by March 31, 2018 for storing potatoes and seed potatoes. Each cold store would have the capacity of 5,000 tonne.Of the 113 cold storages with a combined capacity of over 3 lakh tonnes in the state, about 80 stores are defunct.

For as long as I can remember, Ive loved helping my mother in daily chores thus learning different household methods of treating ingredients in many diverse ways. A few simple analogies I made as a kid was how fascinating it was to eat the same food around the globe with simple change in the method of cooking & adding local fusions to authentic dishes. To name some; Baingan Bharta was known as Baba Ganoush to Arabics, Roti/ Paratha was known as Pizza to Italian, Clay Pot Tandoors being used in many North Indian regions had transformed to conventional oven in other parts of world.I have done both - gone to college and travelled the world. It has been always fun and very rewarding experience.My journey as a chef had started long before I was certified as a professional. My expedition in Grand Cayman, Cayman Island, has garnered me to the many varied cuisines. Being a tropical region most of the culinary art evolved around fruits and root vegetables. This local lady, Francis, who worked as maid to one of the North African migrant would cook for the family and had adopted their palette. She also worked as a housekeeper in my resort. It was one of the encounters I had with her where I had come across a very unique way of making hummus out of sweet potato. The twist to the recipe was she would pit roast the sweet potato on a BBQ griddle and once the potatoes are charred she would wrap it in a foil paper and leave it on the slow fired griddle till the potato is cooked through. The potato has a smoky flavour which is mellowed with tahini, garlic, dash of sesame oil and chopped habanero peppers. The sweetness from potato, bitter rich creamy sesame paste and spiciness from the peppers was a firework of flavours.I learnt the recipe from her but even after trying a couple of times I was not so impressed with the final product. This one day I had made Francis taste it. The trick was to puncture holes in the potatoes after they are wrapped in foil, this is where I had gone wrong all this while. While the potatoes rest on the griddle, the holes ooze out sugar and water which is caramelized adding a unique flavour from BBQ smoke, sugar, water and trapped steam.Experimenting over half a dozen of times, I have mastered the recipe, now I can even make it in my sleep!! The guests have loved it, the ones who had tried the same hummus elsewhere would brag about how unique the taste and texture was. I had called it Sweet Francis Potato Hummus, for the name I have nearly explained this journey of recipe to nearly everyone I have served it to.Chef Ajay Thakur, Brand Chef, Mirah Hospitality."

The walls hold guns to bring the feel of tiger trails and some have placards with one that says, Lets taste the divine food of wild adventure.While on our visit to the restaurant, we were expecting to relish some unique dishes with local flavours they brought from the cities around the tiger reserve, but most of the menu comprised of everyday dishes. The taste of it definitely differs.As we occupied a table with a map of Rajasthan, we were served lassi with sliced badam, served in earthenware. The thick lassi was soothing.The starters followed the welcome drink. Bhurwann Mushroom came first. As we bite into the soft cheesy mushroom, coloured in red and yellow stuffed with paneer, the taste of garam masala and jeera powder covered our taste buds. Next on the platter was Paneer Dahi Tikki that exudes of white pepper powder, green chilli and ginger garlic paste along with paneer. The dahi oozed into our mouth and that was the best feeling one could get while eating this dish.Lahore Subz Sheek Kebab was a mix of vegetables like carrots, beans, cauliflower, potato and roasted channa with bread crumbs. It comes in a crispy layer and the taste of sauf will be the first that you will notice along with the vegetables as you chew it.The breads served at Tiger Trail are something that can only be found here. Out of the four that was served, ajwani naan and chironji naan had ajwani and chironji patted over them respectively. Sheermal had oil made in Kashmiri chilli smothered over it. Though the thought of chilli made us think twice before having it, it did not make the bread spicy.All of this was served with Methi Paneer. The gravy of it reminded one of the gravy in Malai Korma served in restaurants. It was loaded with cashewnut powder to make it taste rich. The paneer was soft and left a slight hint of kasuri methi as we put it on our tongue.Another accompaniment was Mutton Roghan Josh. Unlike the usual spicy rich mutton curries, this red gravy was light and soothing.Khubani ka Meetha with Twist was a perfect end to the meal. Anyone familiar with Khubani ka Meetha will know that it is a rich dessert made with apricots. The twist here was that it was served with a layer of custard over the top. Make sure you scoop it from the bottom to get the rich taste of soaked apricots which is balanced with custard.The apricots picked for the dish originated from Srisailam Tiger Reserve near Hyderabad. It is a common feature at Hyderabadi weddings."

Another private cold storage is likely to operate in a month is set to bring more cheer for the community.Administrative sources said there were no cold storage facilities in Sundargarh and Bonai sub-divisions and a private cold storage facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela city in Panposh sub-division was the only option.Inaugurating the 5,000 tonne capacity facility in Bargaon block in the last week of October, District Collector Bhupendra Singh Poonia said another cold storage facility of similar capacity will be operational along National Highway 143 in Bonai sub-division. The administration is extending all possible help to private promoters to set up cold storage units and boost the agriculture sector. The farmers are also being asked to cultivate more cash crops like vegetables which would help them earn suitable profits and at the same time reduce the demand supply gap.However, a half-constructed private cold storage unit at Kirei of Sundargarh town has failed to take off allegedly due to the laxity of the promoter. The district administration has sought return of around two acres of land allotted for the purpose.Deputy Director, Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Barik said, private promoters are showing interest in setting up cold storages and a fresh proposal for Tangarpali block is under consideration. More promoters are evincing interest as under the Government prescribed norms a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes costs about `4 crore and the Government is giving a subsidy of about `2.8 crore along with 50 to 20 per cent cut on electricity bills for six years."

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

Director, Horticulture will head the panel which will submit its report by December-end. Basing on the report, the State Government will go in for potato procurement.Two agencies, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MARKFED) which have been identified for procuring the tuber for 2017, have also been asked to submit details of a cost estimate of the crop. Payments to the procuring agencies will be made only after delivery of potato."

But farmers are seemingly discouraged to take potato cultivation due to high price of certified seed potato of K-Jyoti variety at `35.5 per kg.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the administration also plans to cover 133 ha in Gurundia, Rajgangpur, Kutra and Lefripara blocks under the convergence initiative of horticulture and watershed schemes. So far, 1,200 quintals of total 2,082 quintals of seed potato have been supplied and farmers in the four blocks would get incentive of `30,000 per ha under convergence initiative, he added.In the rest 13 blocks, potato farmers registered under Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana (RKVY) would be entitled to get incentives of `20,000 per ha. He said a section of the farmers have resorted to germination of seed potatoes and sowing would continue till December in the district.About onion cultivation, he informed that 160 ha are covered under the State Plan Scheme and 16 quintals of seed onion have been supplied at a subsidised cost of `250 per kg. The DDH claimed that in rest of the district, farmers have taken up onion cultivation on 940 ha at their own and onion seeds are being developed at nurseries for transplantation after 45 days.Sources said sandy loam soil is most suitable for potato crop with each ha requiring about 15 quintals of seed potato and after 105 days, the average potato yield is expected to be 10 tonnes per ha in the district. Similarly, each ha requires 10 kg of seed onion and after 150 days, each ha is likely to produce 10 tonnes of onion on an average.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said to boost potato and onion cultivation, adequate cold storage facilities are required. He hoped the recently opened cold storage facility in Bargaon block of 5,000 tonnes capacity and an existing facility of 1,500 tonnes at Rourkela would be helpful to some extent.Potato farmers, however, continue to be worried about market uncertainties as in 2015, potato price had crashed drastically leading to distress sale of locally grown crops."

And in the absence of storage facilities, the farmers incurred huge losses. Furthermore, they did not get the promised incentive from the government.""We have no trust in the government. It has betrayed us twice,"" said B Barik, a farmer from the Balasore district.In a bid to encourage farmers to grow potatos, the state government had announced an incentive of Rs 20,000 per hectare. The Directorate of Horticulture has advised farmers interested in the government scheme to register their names in the offices of the local assistant agriculture officers or assistant horticulture officers.The Directorate has made arrangements for the supply of certified potato seeds to registered farmers, who will pay the cost up front. The subsidy amount will be transfered to their accounts.Meanwhile, the Directorate of Horticulture has invited nationalised banks in the state to credit subsidy for the DBT scheme under Rastriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), National Horticulture Mission (NHM) and other schemes of the government.The State Potato Mission launched at the end of 2014-15 had mandated the Directorate of Horticulture to create self-sufficiency in potato production, storage and distribution over the next three years.Since the state is procuring potato seeds from outside agencies, the mission has set a target to produce about 1.20 lakh tonnes of certified seed potatoes. The government has not become self-sufficient in seed production even in the second year of the mission.The Horticulture directorate has requested all the district collectors to hold mission committees and entrust all line departments for increasing potato area coverage in their districts."

But, lack of assured irrigation, agriculture infrastructure and direct market linkage to farmers are holding the districts agro-economy back.Sources said relying on monsoon, the district produces about six lakh tonnes of paddy from 2.13 lakh hectares (ha) in kharif season. Similarly, non-paddy crops are grown on one lakh ha including vegetable crops on 22,460 ha during kharif season as Sundargarh is considered one of the leading districts in vegetable production. It also produces horticulture crops like mango, banana and litchi besides huge amount of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) including mohua and tamarind.Senior scientist and head of Sundargarh Krishi Vigyan Kendra-II Jayant Pati said resource persons from College of Agriculture Engineering and Technology are educating NTFP collectors on value-addition of forest produces. To boost the agriculture economy, the farmers should go for high-value crops like sweet corn, capsicum, baby corn, pulses and oil seeds on upland. The district needs to enhance assured irrigation coverage to ensure double or triple crops in a year and develop infrastructure like food processing industries, cold storage facilities and provide direct market linkage, he suggested.Sources said of its 3.13 lakh ha cultivable land, the district has maximum assured irrigation for about 54,000 ha in kharif season while it is less than 20,000 ha in rabi season.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said Sundargarh has about 1.63 lakh ha upland. The farmers should do away with the risky paddy crops and go for non-paddy crops, he added.Citing his own experience of loss of potato crops in 2015, progressive farmer Bijay Xalxo said the district needs adequate cold storage facilities, direct market linkage, assured irrigation and food processing units.As of now, the infrastructure for farmers remains most neglected. A wholesale market yard in Rourkela proposed at an estimated cost of `98 crore is hanging fire for years while the only private cold storage on about 1,500 ha at Rourkela is not adequate.In May, Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray had written to the State Government for mapping of panchayat level potential to boost pulse production. Incidentally, Sundargarh farmers produce about 1.09 lakh tonnes of pulses in kharif season alone without any support."

With limited production of quality seeds, there is a huge gap between supply and demand.The Government Task Force on Potato Mission has estimated that the State's requirement of tuber seed at 1.2 lakh tonnes by 2017-18.The Government has been procuring large quantities of potato seeds from West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh every year to meet the demand. This not only drains the State exchequer but also results in reduction of quality due to long distance transport.The Task Force had recommended for seed production to be done inside the State with private involvement. The potato seeds to be produced by UTIPL will be marketed inside the State and in Eastern India.The company will get 10 acres of land at Deras farm for establishment of tissue culture laboratory and 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput for seed multiplication with usual Government rent for a period of 15 years.The company will establish the required infrastructure and seed multiplication at their own cost which will be around `20 crore, official sources said.However, the State Government will provide infrastructure support like road connectivity, electricity and water supply to the project sites."
