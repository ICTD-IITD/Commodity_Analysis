In the last five days price of potato has gone up by Rs two to touch Rs 22. While cucumber costs Rs 40 a kg, onion is up by Rs four to cost Rs 22, tomato is priced at Rs 35 from the earlier Rs 30 and ladyfinger is selling for Rs 40 and cauliflower is priced between Rs 20 and Rs 25.Banking in on the religious sentiments of the people are dalals who have started hoarding. A farmer of Sankarpur Basanta Sahoo alleged that they earn little as dalals detain them on way to Dhenkanal markets and buy the produce from them at cheaper prices. Farmers from Sankarpur, Tarava, Gondia and Dinabandhupur and other pockets of Sadar block bring their produce to the towns market while potato is imported from West Bengal and Onions from Nasik.Civil Supply Officer Hadibandhu Sethy said, We have conducted a meeting with traders and asked them to keep price of onion and potato stable in daily sample study. We have started conducting survey from Tuesday. The department, however, has no hold or authority in enforcing price of vegetables except potato, onion and dal, he added.During Laxmi Puja, the demand for potato and onion increases manifold as more fast food stalls come up at this time. As many as 200 gupchup vendors from Bihar have opened their stalls and each vendor purchases a minimum of 50 kg potato a day, informed one of the kiosk owners in Ganesh Bazaar. Locals have demanded the intervention of the Government or district administration to check the prices from going beyond the reach of common man."

While members of both the communities were conspiring against each other, Sauqat was busy discharging his duty for the mankind.The youths were crying in pain when they arrived at the hospital. I cleaned their wounds and covered those with bandage after nurse applied medicines, he said.On the strife, Sauqat said people from both the communities live peacefully in the town. Some mischief mongers flared up the small incident, he added. Normally, Soro is a peaceful town and people here extend cooperation to each other, Sauqat added.Doctors of the CHC also donned role of Samaritans for the patients and their attendants who were stuck up without food due to promulgation of prohibitory orders and curfew. A team of four doctors led by Dr Dhiresh Kumar Sarangi spent from their own pocket and provided cooked food to at least 200 persons daily for the last four days.The patients and their attendants were helpless since all hotels were closed as Section 144 of CrPc was clamped in the town. Even vegetables were also not available, we managed to collect dal, some vegetables and rice to provide them cooked food, said Dr Sarangi.Other doctors who extended a helping hand are Dr Satyanarayan Nayak, Dr Hemanta Roul and Dr Gauranga Singh. With the situation in Soro improving and no untoward incident reported since last 24 hours, the contribution of the hospital doctors and Sauqat is hailed by all and sundry.Meanwhile, the locals residents, who were forced to remain indoors due to prohibitory orders, came out and purchased essential commodities and vegetable which were made available after four days. People alleged that the traders were raking in the moolah as very few shops were opened and commodities were insufficient. Some were seen selling potato and onion at ` 40-a-kilo while the price of other vegetables were very high compared to other markets in the district. Fishes and chickens were sold like hot cakes.A district official said only a few truck loads of potato, vegetables and fishes reached Soro on Wednesday. The price was high since the supply was less but it will come down in a day or two, he added."

A bowlful of these golden temptations vanishes in minutes, whether placed in front of kids or adults.This universally loved wonderful snack occupies a position that it richly deserves, in the country where it is born, respected and also consumed in large quantities. Belgium honours potato fries with a museum called the Friet Museum where one can learn about the history of potato and how potato fries came about. This museum is in Bruges, Belgium: first and the only of its kind in the world.In the canal-woven city of Bruges (Brugge: Dutch) that reminded me of Venice, I tagged along with my guide Caroline, wonder-eyed.I found the historic centre - a UNESCO World Heritage Site even more enchanting. Through the ancient structures and the romantic horse carriages, we walked back in time to the medieval Europe. Caroline led me to the 14th century Gothic Saaihalle (former wool hall), one of the oldest buildings in the historic centre, where the unique Friet museum is located.On the ground floor, we learnt about the interesting history of the potato, which originated in Peru more than 10,000 years ago, since wild potatoes were found in several tombs in Peru and Chile. Out of the 400 ancient objects that were displayed, the oldest were the Inca vases representing different types of potatoes. The well-preserved vases, though dated from the pre-Columbian period, looked stylish and modern. We moved on to learn how the wild potato became a cultivated plant and how then the plant travelled from Peru to Europe, and to Belgium.There is no scientific or historical proof relating to the origin of the fries. In Belgium, it is attributed to the Mosane region, where the inhabitants along the river Meuse, caught small fish and fried them whole for their meal. In the 1750s, when the rivers froze, making fishing impossible, people cut potatoes into slices resembling small fish and fried them. That is how fries were born.Paul IIegems, an author of several books about fries and fry shops, gives a different story. One of the first places to cultivate potatoes in the 16th century was in the gardens of a monastery in Seville- Spain, built by Teresa of Avila. She used to attribute curative properties to potatoes and feed them to the sick. As the Spanish cook in olive oil, it is possible, that potato was cut into pieces or sliced, to cook faster. Belgians traditionally cook potato fries in two stages, to obtain the best taste: first at 150 degrees and later at 180 degrees centigrade. The first stage lasts four to eight minutes, depending on the thickness of the fries and the type of potato used. This forms a crust, which protects the inside of the fry. Then the fries are shaken to remove excess oil and prevent them from sticking to one another.When you speak of fries, you cant ignore the wonderful dip that goes with it. The word mayonnaise stems from the name Mahon, and appeared in history as Mahonnaise in the mid 18th century, in commemoration of the taking of the fortress of Port-Mahon in Minorca. Faced with a shortage of food supplies, the cooks of the French army had to make do with only oil and eggs for long periods. This is how the first mayonnaise came into being, purely by chance. When the army returned to France, where only thickened and cooked sauces were known, this new sauce whipped in the Richelieu style, offered new possibilities to French cooking.Why are they called French fries?Here too there is a story involved: during the first World War, some French speaking Belgian soldiers offered potato chips to the American soldiers, who thought the Belgian soldiers were French, hence the origin of the name French fries.After touring both the floors, we came down enlightened and eager to taste the fries in the medieval cellars. Hot fries disappeared from the bowl, as they melted in our mouths: with the luscious and buttery mayonnaise, they tasted heavenly. I said to Caroline, Whats in a name? French or Belgianwouldnt fries by any other name taste as delicious? Engrossed in relishing the fries, she agreed with a smile and an approving nod.Fed on fries sumptuously, we walked for two more hours to burn the calories. To savour potato fries, I didnt mind walking any distance in the beautiful Bruges!! Its worth every fry!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer;blogs at www.vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

These special ingredients are great to play around  as they test ones creativity, they also lead to some experimentation with unique and innovative recipes. Two ingredients which I really enjoy cooking with are John Dory also known as St Pierre or Peters Fish and the black truffle, popularly known as the black diamond of kitchen.I believe it takes a great understanding of gastronomy and palate along with little creativity to bring forth some delectable recipes. One such recipe, which is really close to my heart is Pan-seared John Dory with Black Truffle and Sweet Potato Mash along with Martini Veloute, Red Wine Sauce and Buttered Vegetables.This dish is very simple, yet an intricate amalgamation of unique flavours bringing together the mild taste and texture of the fish with one of the rare ingredients in the world  black truffle. This unusual fish needs to be cooked in a hot pan, basted with butter and thyme. For the mashed potatoes, you need to boil the sweet potatoes in milk and then mash them into a smooth paste with a few dollops of butter and shaved truffle. Season it with some salt and pepper according to your liking. Stir fry seasonal vegetables with butter and plate them along with Martini Veloute and red wine sauce. For making the Martini Veloute, all you need to do is reduce vermouth with sweet onion and cream. The red wine sauce is no rocket science, just a de-glazed pan with red wine. Surprisingly, it adds an exquisite taste to the dish and goes very well with the texture of the fish.Both these ingredients are unique in their own territory and this dish brings together the mild taste and unique texture of John Dory along with the flavour of the rarest ingredient in the world  black truffle.Ramasamy Selvaraju, Executive Chef, Vivanta by Taj"

Further, directly attacking Singh, Sherawat said the he has seen disturbing reports about women being exploited in Punjab in return for ticket to fight elections and that the party high command is unaware about his deeds as party representatives in Punjab.The controversy becomes a political hot potato for the AAP as Punjab is heading to elections next year, with high stakes for the party.Sehrawat had also hit out at AAP's Delhi unit convener Dilip Pandey, questioning his conduct in the national capital and said that the situation is becoming indefensible and disgraceful. Action needs to be taken to remove rotten elements.All the allegations are baseless, I have worked for decades in politics and that has been recognized by the party and hence I am here.

(Photo | AP)OHIO: She is a mother of three, grandmother of 16, great-grandmother of 12 and great-great-grandmother of three. She recently had surgery to remove a malignant tumor, but doctors say she's doing well.She's Colo, the nation's oldest living gorilla, and she turned 60 on Thursday at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.Colo was the first gorilla in the world born in a zoo and has surpassed the usual life expectancy of captive gorillas by two decades. Her longevity is putting a spotlight on the medical care, nutrition and up-to-date therapeutic techniques that are helping lengthen zoo animals' lives.""Colo just epitomizes the advances that zoos have made, going all the way back to her birth at Columbus,"" said Dr. Tom Meehan, vice president for veterinary services at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo and veterinary adviser to a national gorilla species survival plan.The changes also mean more animals living with the normal aches and pains of growing older. Today, zoo veterinarians regularly treat animals for heart and kidney disease, arthritis, dental problems and cancer.Hundreds of people gathered at the zoo Thursday to see Colo, singing ""Happy Birthday"" moments before the gorilla ambled into an enclosure decorated with multicolored construction paper chains and filled with cakes such as squash and beet and cornbread with mashed potato parsley frosting.Among the first in line was Pam Schlereth of Columbus, who at 63 was just a little girl when her father brought her to see the newborn Colo in a gorilla incubator in 1956.""It's a tribute to the zoo that she's alive at 60 years old,"" Schlereth said.Colo represents so much to the zoo, Tom Stalf, president of the zoo, told the crowd. ""It's all about connecting people and wildlife,"" he said.Colo is one of several elderly gorillas around the country. The oldest known living male gorilla, Ozzie, is 55 years old and lives at the Atlanta Zoo, which has a geriatric gorilla specialty.At Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo, staff members use acupuncture, massage, laser therapy, and heat and joint supplements to help Emma, a 13-year-old rabbit.At the National Zoo in Washington, Shanthi, a 42-year-old Asian elephant with arthritis, receives osteoarthritis therapy and was recently fitted with specially crafted front foot boots to help her feet heal as medications are applied.In Oakland, California, Tiki, a 27-year-old giraffe and one of the oldest in the nation, gets foot care, massage therapy, acupuncture and chiropractic care, along with traditional veterinary medicine. Gao Gao, a 26-year-old male panda at the San Diego Zoo with a heart condition, periodically undergoes cardiac ultrasounds.""Geriatrics is probably one of our most common medical challenges that we face in a zoo situation,"" said Dr. Keith Hinshaw, director of animal health at the Philadelphia Zoo. ""So pretty much anything that you could imagine would happen with an older person is going to happen eventually with any animal.""That's up to and including medication: JJ, a 45-year-old orangutan at the Toledo Zoo, is on the human heart medicines carvedilol and Lisinopril, along with pain and orthopedic medications. He also takes Metamucil.Colo, a western lowland gorilla, holds several other records. On her 56th birthday in 2012, she exceeded the record for longest-lived gorilla. On Thursday, she surpasses the median life expectancy for female gorillas in human care (37.5 years) by more than two decades."

""I think they should disarm. Immediately. What do you think. Yes? Take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Take them. Let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away, OK. It will be very dangerous.""It was the most recent onslaught in a presidential election in which sober policy discussion has been drowned out by personal insults, character assassinations, and base offensives.It is also rife with conspiracy theory - this week, Mr Trump revived the debate around where President Barack Obama was born. He finally admitted that Mr Obama was born in the United States, but then tried to blame Mrs Clinton, accusing his Democratic rival of initiating the doubts.Meanwhile, a release of hacked emails written by Colin Powell, the Secretary of State under George W Bush and a friend of Hillary Clinton's, revealed that while he would support Mrs Clinton, he would ""rather not have to vote for her"".He described the Democratic presidential nominee as having ""a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational."" The election has become a fight between two pensioners almost equally disliked by the nation. Polls show the pair are now two of the most hated candidates in the country's recent political history. More than half of the nation - 54.9 per cent - have an ""unfavourable"" view of Mrs Clinton according to an average of polls on the issue. It is statistic beaten only by Mr Trump, who is intensely disliked by almost 60 per cent of the country.Many American are left asking a phrase now frequently repeated on the 24-hour news channels: ""We're a country of 300 million - and this is the best we can do?""Welcome to America's unpopularity contest.This time, it's personalAll elections have their bitter moments, but this year's bid to the most powerful office in the world has sunk to unprecedented lows.As Mrs Clinton has been keen to point out, Mr Trump has often treated his election campaign as if it were another of his reality television shows.His own friends admit that he revels in the drama of personal attacks, and likes to make news by sending out insulting tweets ""before he gets out of bed"". Mr Trump has declared that Mrs Clinton is ""totally unhinged"" and ""unbalanced"".Mrs Clinton is anticipating being mocked or attacked at this month's presidential debate over her husband Bill Clinton's notorious affair with Monica Lewinsky.Earlier this year a tweet was sent from Mr Trump's account which read: ""If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?"" Mrs Clinton has responded by releasing stand up comedy routines mocking her rival.She recently used a tag-line from Mr Trump's show The Apprentice to attack him on the economy: ""We shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are, 'You're fired'."" Meanwhile, her campaign has released an application called ""Trump yourself"", which adorns the Facebook profile picture of anyone who signs up with insulting quotes by the Republican candidate. ""Fat pig"" reads one. ""You sweat like a dog,"" reads another.Big business tiesLast week, Bill Clinton belatedly celebrated his 70th birthday. The event, a fundraiser for The Clinton Foundation in New York, saw the great and the good mingling: among them Jon Bon Jovi and Barbra Streisand. And yet, despite being billed as a party, the event was heavy with politics.The Clinton Foundation has come under intense scrutiny from allies of Donald Trump, with the charitable organisation portrayed as a way for Mrs Clinton to grant favours to international donors. The Clintons have said there has never been any evidence of wrongdoing. Yet for many, the lingering suspicion remains.A Newsweek article last week made even more damning allegations about Mr Trump and his sprawling global business empire. The report described him as ""the most conflicted president in American history,"" and said that his business interests in India, South Korea, Turkey, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey were of deep concern.Mr Trump's links to Russia have also become a political hot potato - with the billionaire businessman praising Vladimir Putin.Health stumblesIf Mr Trump wins the election, it will make him the oldest newly elected president in US history - Ronald Reagan was just shy of 70 when he was inaugurated in 1981. If Mrs Clinton wins, it will make her, at 69, the second oldest behind Reagan.With 51 days to go, Mrs Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis and Mr Trump's high testosterone levels have drowned out almost everything else.""The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health,"" joked Mrs Clinton after returning to the fray from three days of rest.But the fact that she covered up her illness for three days cut deep: by the end of the episode, her poll ratings had sunk from 51 per cent of Americans supporting her in August, down to 42 per cent.The staunchly pro-Trump New York Post took to calling her ""Illary,"" and absurd conspiracy theories circulated - including that she has Parkinson's or even uses a body double because she cannot cope with the pace of campaigning.Mr Trump's week was scarcely less ridiculous. He seized the opportunity to glorify his own vital statistics - appearing, with typical Trump showmanship, on a television chat show hosted by Dr Mehmet Oz to boast about his health. He admitted he was overweight - borderline obese, according to his BMI - and that he did not eat healthily or exercise. But, he said, he had a wonderful golf swing.Values abandonedRonald Reagan called America the ""shining city on the hill"", a beacon of hope for the free world. But in this election, this view of the United States has become lost in the fog.Mr Trump has rejected the notion that America should play any role as the world's moral arbitrator. And he has rebuffed free-market inspired trade deals, in favour of a nativist, insular and protectionist view.Values issues have affected Democrats too. Mrs Clinton is increasingly perceived as adapting her values and policy beliefs according to what is politically expedient.For example, as secretary of state she pushed for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal with a dozen Pacific rim countries.But as a presidential candidate she has abandoned it, because many voters fear it will result in more manual labour jobs going overseas."

The guest list makes this 13th and final state dinner among the largest of Obama's presidency.""We saved the best for last,"" Obama said somewhat wistfully as he welcomed the Italians during a pageantry-filled South Lawn arrival ceremony on an unseasonably warm, mid-October day.On the way to dinner, guests were being invited to tour Mrs. Obama's world-famous ""kitchen"" garden. She and Landini sipped tea there together earlier Tuesday.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the highest-ranking Italian American in U.S. politics, and her husband, Paul Pelosi, are among the guests. Other Italian Americans on the list are former race car driver Mario Andretti, fashion designer Giorgio Armani, actor John Turturro and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Celebrity chef Mario Batali was helping the White House kitchen crew prepare the meal, and Grammy Award-winning singer Gwen Stefani was on tap to perform after the tables have been cleared. Not only did Batali collaborate on dinner, he was also invited to attend as a guest.The list of expected guests also included hairstylist Yene Damtew, whose website describes her as one of two personal hair stylists to the Obama family, and Carl Ray, Michelle Obama's make-up artist.The menu was designed to showcase traditional Italian dishes that Americans are familiar with and feature ingredients pulled from Mrs. Obama's garden during this month's final harvest.Batali, executive chef Cristeta Comerford and pastry chef Susie Morrison settled on a menu of sweet potato ravioli with browned butter and sage, warm butternut squash salad and beef pinwheels, an Italian classic, served with broccoli rabe. Dessert is a green apple crostata, or Italian tart, served with buttermilk gelato, or Italian ice cream.""It's such an incredibly, well-orchestrated thing, but you have to get the food out superfast,"" Rick Bayless, one of the country's most respected voices when it comes to Mexican food, said in an interview from one of his Chicago restaurants. Bayless is friends with the Obamas and, in 2009, they enlisted him as ""guest chef"" for a 200-person White House state dinner for Mexico.Batali, a restaurant owner, cookbook author and authority on Italian cuisine, seemed to have things under control by midday Tuesday.His very active Twitter page featured near hourly postings, including photos of him with the four chefs who accompanied him from New York, of him on the presidential basketball court sporting his signature pair of orange Crocs, of him with Obama dogs Bo and Sunny, and of dinner ingredients in various stages of preparation, including a close-up of the almost-ready beef pinwheels.Obama has held 13 state dinners during nearly eight years in office, two more than President George W. Bush, who held 11, but fewer than other recent predecessors, according to the White House Historical Association. President Bill Clinton far exceeded both of his successors with 28 dinners during his two terms in office."
58fed4a27be9e04171b85415,Danger and opportunity,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160702/jsp/opinion/story_94314.jsp,2016-07-02,"A giant ""Leave"" hoarding on the road from London to Oxford now wears a diagonal sash reading ""Bye-bye EU!"" Given the European Union's protracted severance procedure under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be a long time before those jaunty words can come true. Meanwhile, India has good reason to take some interest in the turmoil that is rocking Britain. First, David Cameron's prediction that the reshaping of Europe may allow Britain to seek the ""strongest possible economic link"" with ""important partners like India and China"" was a reminder that the word crisis in Chinese combines two ideograms that stand for ""danger"" and ""opportunity"". Second, many Indians must be concerned at the potentially ugly race implications of the immigration fears that underlie the EU debate. So many other skeletons (like the false statistics the Leave side is accused of using to whip up anti-EU prejudice) are tumbling out of the cupboard that Afro-Asian immigration hasn't received much attention. But some of those who voted Leave to stem the influx of continental Europeans and some who believe Britain can negotiate terms to enjoy the benefits of the 500-million-strong European free market while closing its borders to Europeans may find they have jumped from the frying pan into the fire. Britain needs skilled and unskilled labour. The health service (which uses 80 different languages) relies so heavily on foreigners that English language rules have been relaxed, creating another of the contradictions with which today's Britain bristles. Now that Britain is leaving the EU, a German-born university teacher at Oxford who has lived in the country for years has discovered he must take an English language test to qualify for naturalization. He would have been exempt if he had been taught in English at university for three years. But although he teaches at Oxford, his own first degree was in Germany; his English must, therefore, be put to the test. Once such anomalies become widely known, the British may begin to draw a line between Polish and Pakistani. One can understand why working-class South Asian immigrants in old Lancashire mill towns like Oldham voted Leave. They complain of freeloading Poles but the deeper fear is of newer immigrants who have a head start on them to begin with because of race. When Sadiq Khan, London's ethnic Pakistani mayor, bravely defends Polish newcomers (""They work, pay taxes, support the NHS, social care, the construction sector"") he is addressing white - not brown or black - resistance. A Polish immigrant's son becomes another Brit, albeit with a slightly exotic name (though that, too, can be managed), while a Pakistani-Briton remains an outsider unto the third or fourth generation. Poland's ambassador has appealed on TV against anti-Polish propaganda; Pakistan's high commissioner has not, although instances of ""Paki"" abuse have also been reported in the last few days. The media also focuses much more on anti-Polish feeling. This is not because it condones anti-Pakistani (or anti-Indian) sentiment. But it probably fears that public discussion of inter-racial strife would open a can of worms. The turmoil is evident elsewhere too. At least 3.5 million people (at last count) are demanding a second referendum. Michael Heseltine, the former Tory grandee, blames the burly, boisterous, blond Boris Johnson, a former journalist and twice mayor of London with a half-Indian wife, for plunging the country into its worst political crisis. Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian premier, blames ""the selfishness of one man who is ready to do anything to become prime minister... "". There was no concealing the pleasure on Thursday morning when that man suddenly snatched his hat back from the ring. The day before a Conservative Party member in Cheshire had suggested that having ""stabbed David Cameron in the back"" Johnson change his first name to Brutus. The morning after his key aide, Michael Gove, justice minister under Cameron, stabbed him front, back and sides, it was Johnson's turn to quote Shakespeare and suggest Gove was the real Brutus. Gove enabled Johnson to destroy Cameron. Then he turned round and destroyed Johnson. No doubt he is convinced the field is now clear for his own unhindered march into Number 10 although for years he vehemently denied any interest in the top job. But with five candidates jostling for the Tory party leadership, the chances are he has made things easier for Theresa May, the calm and composed home minister of proven competence, to become Britain's second woman prime minister. If there is any logic or reason beyond self-aggrandizement behind this murky drama, it isn't obvious to anyone. ""I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead,"" Gove explains. Apparently, he discovered in just the last four days the fatal flaws that make Johnson unsuitable for prime ministership. They had escaped his notice during a year of working closely together on the Leave campaign and undermining Cameron's leadership. As three other politicians quickly abandoned the Johnson ship - more desertions are expected over the weekend - the gossip among journalists was that The Times (London) had fired Johnson in 1988 for fabricating a quotation. His anti-Europe bias was blamed for making up the story that the EU wouldn't allow Britain to import prawn cocktail-flavoured potato crisps. He was guilty of misrepresentation even in his first comment after the results were announced by dismissing the EU as a federal system ""that is imitated nowhere else on earth"". That is incorrect. True, none of the imitators have achieved as much as the EU in terms of common economic and political institutions but it isn't for want of trying. The optimism that inspired Europeans also produced such regional partnerships as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. For reasons of history, economics and politics, Europe made much greater progress than any of the other attempts at following its lead. But the source of inspiration remains unmistakable. Theresa May thinks it will take ""several years"" for the Britain-EU divorce to be finalized. They provide opportunities for India to consolidate its position in London which, like Scotland and Wales, voted ""Remain"". London's vibrant economy as a global financial centre is expected to survive the strong challenge from Frankfurt. The city uses 200 languages. It wants to be independent of the rest of the country. Indian companies have been raising money there. The nearly 800 Indian firms (including Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra and Vedanta Resources) with a presence in London generate 19 billion annually from their UK-based operations. Some may now open offices on the continent but not at London's expense. As Britain negotiates separate free trade agreements with the remaining 27 EU countries, India must do the same with Britain. India is among the United Kingdom's top three investors and the $14 billion bilateral trade leaves considerable scope for expansion. This is also the time for India to renegotiate existing free trade agreements to enhance market access and conclude the pact with the EU that has been hanging fire for nearly a decade. India's tardiness at a time when both Britain and Europe are reconsidering alliances can only be China's gain. So much for the ""opportunity"" part of crisis. The ""danger"" is one of regret that a dream of unity foundered on the rock of nationalism. The EU itself was born of the prosaic European Coal and Steel Community but it enshrines faith in a supranational foundation that would ""make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible"" and reinforce democracy amongst its members. The hope now is that Britain's folly will not find echoes in other parts of Europe."
58fed5d57be9e0420db27e79,A window on history,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160604/jsp/opinion/story_89176.jsp,2016-06-04,"Memory can be extraordinarily flexible. As the Portuguese coast recedes and our ship edges into Spanish waters, vora's reticence about the communist upsurge in the surrounding region called Alentejo reminds me of the stonewall I encountered in Hyderabad trying to talk of the Telangana revolt. Most people assumed I meant the agitation for a separate state. Few even remembered the earlier armed rising linked to the 1948 Calcutta Conference which also resulted in Malaya's prolonged and bloody Emergency. ""In the Alentejo, you travel naturally with and to History,"" writes a local chronicler. It didn't know a revolution that never was like West Bengal where revolution means speeches, and revolutionaries fatten in office for decade after decade. Alentejo's was a revolution that failed like Telangana's. But without the violence. It also suffered from a confusion of aims. Both mixed the local with the global. The immediate impetus in Telangana was opposition to the Nizam of Hyderabad's regime. However, the Calcutta Conference spoke of a wider ideological purpose. In fact, many believe the insurrection petered out because Moscow's rapprochement with New Delhi prompted the Comintern to abandon the conference's ostensible hosts, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. The peasantry around vora where we spent several delightful days also felt betrayed. vora is a charming medieval walled town whose university students in black medallion-studded cloaks over their frock coats sing and dance in the cobbled central square, the Praa do Giraldo, chasing away horrible memories of the burnings that took place there during the Inquisition. Founded in 1559, the university closed down in 1759, when the authoritarian prime minister of the day turned out the Jesuits. It didn't reopen until 1973. vora was under Muslim rule for 400 years. They came to help a local contender for power and stayed to consolidate their own rule. The real contradiction was between radical young officers of the Movimento das Foras Armadas and peasant and student protesters clamouring for reform in 1974. The officers overthrew Portugal's long dictatorship in a last-ditch attempt to pre-empt more drastic change. The protesters in the streets who gave them carnations which they put into the barrels of their guns - hence the name Carnation Revolution - hoped for a drastic social and political transformation. The organizations of workers and young people that sprouted all over the Alentejo resembled the proletarian councils (soviets) associated with Russia's October Revolution. Ordinary soldiers weary of war also set up their own committees to demand democratic rights and an end to Lisbon's imperialist wars. If national liberation movements could rock the foundations of colonial rule in the so-called ""overseas provinces"" of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and So Tom, they asked, why should the metropole remain under the corporatist yoke? Landless labourers who toiled on the great estates called latifundio seized the fields they farmed. According to government estimates, about 2,200,000 acres were occupied. Some 1,000 estates were collectivized. Something like the Spanish Civil War seems to have been fought out in miniature but with roles reversed. Claiming that fascism had to be defeated, Portugal's reformist Socialist Party and Stalinist Communist Party sprang to support the MFA and the junta it had installed. Social historians believe they destroyed the chance of a socialist revolution. Lisbon promulgated the Land Reform Review Law in 1977. The collectives were dissolved. The original owners repossessed the latifundio. Portugal's aristocracy has retained its wealth through centuries of upheavals. Some of the mansions and manor houses have been in the same family for generations. Hoardings in the vineyards along the road from vora to Lisbon proudly proclaim the ownership of families like the Fonsecas. No lingering memory of the 1974 uprising disturbs vora's tranquillity. The official justification is that the Alentejo collective farms could not be modernized. In the mid-1980s, agricultural productivity was half that of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the European average. Land holdings were polarized between small and fragmented family farms in the north and inefficiently large collectives in the south. Even Bangladeshi immigrants who had managed to acquire Portuguese work permits fled to more prosperous economies. Decollectivization was said to be the only hope. I learnt more about vora and its unexpected links with Bengal from Trilokesh Mukherjee, my graphic artist friend who lived in the Dordogne in France for many years. Now he seems to spend more time in Oxford and South Wales but remains a storehouse of the minutiae of Indo-European culture. Trilokesh told me vora was the birthplace of Manuel da Assumpo, an Augustinian monk who spent many years near Dhaka and is credited with writing and printing the first dictionary and grammar of the Bengali language, Vocabulario em idioma bengalla e portugueza. ""The Portuguese even cast some Tamil and Malayalam types. But they never could cast Bengali types."" It's a matter of everlasting regret to Trilokesh that this final triumph eluded the Portuguese. ""The first book to be printed in Bengali was printed in Lisbon though the writer, translator and the compiler came from vora,"" he wrote. Alas, it was set in Latin type. vora's state library treasures another historic document, the manuscript of Brahman-Roman-Kyathalik-Samvada: an argument on Law between a Roman Catholic and a Brahmin by the Bengali Dom Antonio de Rozario. Dom Antonio's life is shrouded in mystery. No one knows his Bengali name. He was apparently a princeling of Bhusana, which some place near Dhaka and others near Jessore. According to one version, Mug pirates took him to Arakan as their prisoner. Another has it he was sold into slavery in Goa. Both agree that another Portuguese Augustinian priest was his saviour and that he converted to Christianity. The reinvented Dom Antonio is believed to have converted 30,000 Hindus in and around his estate, thereby arousing the wrath of the Jesuits in Goa who sent a senior priest to investigate. He confirmed Dom Antonio's proselytizing success but added the converts had little knowledge of Christianity and had been paid to be baptized. It must be added before ghar wapsi fanatics reach for their purifying water that this was the competing camp's verdict. No rivalry is more relentlessly bitter than that between the pious who are convinced of their monopoly of the truth. Religion and language are the two main links. Vasco da Gama wasn't quite the pirate in priest's clothing that Bharatiya Janata Party loyalists made out on the 400th anniversary of his landing at Calicut, but he did have a strong religious motivation. Another Portuguese sailor, Lus de Cames, called Portugal's Shakespeare, immortalized his achievement in the epic poem, The Lusiads. If Calcutta had Anthony Feringhee (Hensman Anthony), Dhaka's Christians revere Sadhu Antoni (St Anthony of Padua). Some credit the Portuguese with creating Bengal's first modern city in Hooghly. Others hold their imports of tobacco, potato and guava changed Bengali taste for all time. With so many connections, it was exciting to stumble upon a Bengali gift to Portuguese (or so I imagined) when my wife was allotted the janela seat on the train to Sintra. I emailed a friend in Calcutta who passed it on to Aditi Roy Ghatak who messaged me from Macau, where she was holidaying, to say the former Portuguese colony had given her a janela on Portugal. I now learn that far from being Bengali, janla is an import like potato, guavas or tobacco. Derived from the vulgar Latin januella, the Portuguese janela travelled east with those first Europeans to inspire the Sinhalese janelaya and Tamil cannal. Our own janla is like almirah or kameez. Borrowing within reason is all right providing it doesn't prompt Mamata Banerjee to follow the late P.N. Oak and claim that Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower are really Bengali creations."

Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, July 1: Godda police registered an FIR last night against state BJP chief Tala Marandi's newly-wed son Munna Marandi under Section 376 of IPC (rape) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act based on a sexual exploitation complaint made by the ""other woman"" while the district administration is likely to submit a report on his alleged child bride in court tomorrow. Apparently, Munna (22) had been sleeping with a village girl at Simra village, Boarijore area, for the past 18 months, with the promise of marrying her. This girl's June 23 complaint at a Godda court - where she claimed she was underage, introducing the POCSO angle - was registered by Boarijore thana last night. But, policemen from the Dumka range DIG to Mahagama SDPO are squeamish about the FIR order against the BJP state chief's son. ""I have learnt about it (the FIR) through different sources, but officially I have not yet been communicated anything,"" Dumka range DIG Deo Bihari Sharma said when asked about steps taken for Munna's arrest. ""The court order had not reached us,"" said Mahagama SDPO Samir Sevaia, when asked the explain the gap between June 23 and June 30. ""We sent an officer to court yesterday and secured a copy of the order. Munna has been booked under sections of IPC and POCSO Act that the court directed us to do. We haven't added anything on our own,"" the SDPO said. The matter of Munna marrying a minor on Wednesday is another hot potato for Godda district. Though Tala Marandi, also Borio MLA, denies it, Munna allegedly married a minor when his intended bride - the one whose name was printed on wedding cards - refused to on the grounds that he was involved with the Simra girl. Today, Dumka DC Rahul Kumar Sinha, who holds the additional charge of Godda, said they would submit an earlier SDO report that cited the bride's birthday as July 25, 2005. ""We will submit the report tomorrow and seek guidance from the judiciary. The court may ask us to conduct the girl's medical test to ascertain her real age. Judicial orders will be strictly executed,"" Sinha said today. However, Sinha, who had on Wednesday promised a medical test to determine the age of Munna's bride, did an about turn yesterday, lending credence to Opposition claims that the case was being hushed up to protect the state BJP chief. As Tala Marandi floated conspiracy theories targeting him through his son, and Mahila Congress wing burnt his effigies, the case is becoming a free-for-all. Seeking to restore order, Jharkhand State Commission of Child Rights member Manoj Kumar today wrote a letter to Sinha demanding inquiry and action taken reports within three days. ""We have taken suo motu cognisance of the reported child marriage and want the culprits to be taken to task,"" he said. Incidentally, under Section 13 (3) of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act of 2006, the court of a first-class judicial magistrate or metropolitan magistrate may take suo motu cognisance on the basis of a reliable report or information. ""The judiciary's silence on the issue is rather intriguing,"" said Jharkhand High Court advocate Raj Nandan Sahay. But, Jharkhand High Court advocate-general Vinod Poddar refused to comment. ""I cannot comment on the basis of media reports,"" he said. Though Munna's bride has not spoken yet, the Simra girl had had to go to great lengths to make her voice heard. Initially, Godda SP had refused to entertain her sexual exploitation complaint. After state women's commission stepped in, the police filed the FIR."

Telegraph pictureImphal, June 17: People in the Manipur valley have stopped supply of essential commodities to the five hill districts to counter a 10-day economic blockade imposed by tribal organisations in the hills. Vehicles leaving Imphal are being regularly checked by valley people since Tuesday to stop transportation of essential commodities to the hills. If rice, potato or any other edible item is found in the vehicles, it is being unloaded. However, those accompanying the goods are allowed to proceed. People turned up along Imphal-Churachandpur, Imphal- Ukhrul, Imphal-Tamenglong, Imphal-Senapati and Imphal-Chandel routes to enforce the counter-blockade. Several hill-based indigenous groups had imposed a 10-day economic blockade on the state's lifelines - National Highway 2 (Imphal-Dimapur highway) and National Highway 37 (Imphal-Silchar highway) - on June 9 midnight, disrupting supply of commodities to Manipur. The blockade was called jointly by the Joint Action Committee against Anti-Tribal Bills, Hmar Inpui, Mizo Peoples Convention, Thadou Inpi, United Naga Council, Zoumi Council and the Outer Manipur Tribal Forum against the Protection of Manipur People Bill 2015, Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms (Seventh Amendment) Bill 2015 and the Manipur Shops and Establishments (Second Amendment) Bill 2015, which were passed by the Manipur Assembly in August last year. The bills are awaiting the President's assent. The Okram Ibobi Singh government has so far brought loaded trucks, stranded at various points in Senapati district, to Imphal with police escorts twice since the blockade began. To counter the blockade, people in the valley stopped commodities moving towards the five hill districts at various places in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts - all in the valley. ""We are checking vehicles going towards Ukhrul. We unload if commercial items are found in the vehicles and allow the people to proceed. We told the owner of the goods that they can come back and collect the unloaded goods after the 10-day blockade imposed by tribal organisations is over,"" a counter-blockade supporter said. Sources said the counter-blockade was launched after prices of essential commodities, including vegetables, soared after the economic blockade was imposed. An independent researcher said the price of potato had increased from Rs 25 to Rs 35 in Imphal city. The prices of other edible items have also increased, ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 40. Unlike in the past, consumers are not facing any scarcity of fuel as all the pumps are open this time. In the earlier blockades, some of the pumps were closed while others witnessed long queues. ""The IOC is releasing adequate petrol and fuel this time. Therefore, there is no problem of fuel this time,"" a petrol pump owner said."

58feeae87be9e0420db29610,Naidu spin on cabinet rejig,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160708/jsp/nation/story_95450.jsp,2016-07-08,"New Delhi, July 7: The country's new information minister has decoded what Tuesday's cabinet rejig means. M. Venkaiah Naidu, who took over information and broadcasting from Arun Jaitley, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's underlying message in the changes in the council of ministers was ""perform, reform, transform and inform"". The shuffle, he also explained, was aimed at ""effective utilisation of the available talent"". On Smriti Irani's shift from the human resources development ministry to textiles, Naidu said ""too much is being read into it"". ""Both Prakash Javadekar (the new HRD minister) and Smriti Irani are dynamic persons. I think too much is being read into the change of portfolios,"" Naidu said while addressing the media after taking charge of his new ministry. ""Distribution of portfolios is a prerogative of the PM."" The I&B ministry will be an addition to the urban development ministry that Naidu holds. He was relieved of parliamentary affairs, which has been handed to Ananth Kumar. Welcoming the changes in the cabinet, Naidu thanked Jaitley for the time and attention he had devoted to the ministry despite his other heavyweight responsibilities - finance and corporate affairs - and said he would carry forward Jaitley's approach. ""Effective communication is the key to realise change. I would like to focus on the task of information empowerment,"" Naidu, who represents Rajasthan in the Rajya Sabha, said. ""The government is a reservoir of information relating to socio-economic, cultural and political aspects of a common man's life. We need to ensure a proper flow of information - undiluted and unadulterated,"" Naidu added. Known for his one-liners, Naidu tried his hand at rhyming at yesterday's media briefing too. ""I am very frank and outspoken and I have Frank beside me now,"" he said, referring to the government's chief spokesperson, Frank Noronha. Another wordplay was aimed at his deputy, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. ""I have got an energetic MOS (minister of state) and whenever there is an SOS (save our soul) situation, I will turn to him. We will perform and inform together."" Sources close to Jaitley said it had been ""almost expected"" that he would be divested of I&B. ""He was never very keen on the ministry, but was brought in because of his media management skills and good connections in the (media) industry,"" said an official close to Jaitley. ""However, the ministry had become too much for him. There is little work here compared to the other ministries but too much headache, particularly as it involves dealing with the film industry,"" the official added. The I&B ministry and the ""autonomous"" bodies under it - the Central Board of Film certification and the Film and Television Institute of India - have been dogged by controversies. While Pahlaj Nihalani, ever since his appointment as chief censor in January 2015, has been facing the wrath of the film industry for his controversial decisions, the government had to deal with a student agitation when it appointed small-time actor Gajendra Chauhan as FTII chairman. ""The censorship issues, in particular, have been a hot potato for the ministry and, despite Jaitley's tactical and strategic handling of matters, the ministry often cut a sorry face,"" another official in Jaitley's team, who will now move to the corporate affairs ministry, said."
58fef68d7be9e0420db2a384,"Nutty success story: 
",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160713/jsp/bihar/story_96302.jsp,2016-07-13,"Workers sort roasted gorgon nuts and (below) 'makhana king' Satyajit Kumar Singh. Pictures by Ruchira Gupta Jugeshwar is a Mahadalit sharecropper living off the edge of a pond in a remote village in Araria. Satyajit Kumar Singh is the CEO of Shakti Sudha Industries in Patna. Both are 46-year- old Biharis. Their lives are interconnected by the euryale ferox. This water lily with bright purple flowers is a common sight in wetlands and ponds in north Bihar. It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.
