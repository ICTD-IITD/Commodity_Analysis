The people must be able to procure essential items at reasonable prices and towards this end, trade and business organisations must lend a helping hand by keeping a tight leash on prices, he said.Sonowal asked business organisations and wholesale dealers about the stock and availability of essential commodities and wholesale and retail prices. He said the wholesale dealers must strictly conform to the strictures of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department.""Wholesale dealers have equal responsibility towards the people as that of the government. By maintaining a close rapport with the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, the businessmen have to keep the prices under check,"" he added.He asked the department and the wholesale dealers to ensure that there was no scarcity of essential commodities in view of the flood situation in the state. Minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Rihon Daimari made it clear that businessmen would have to keep prices under check in tune with the guidelines of the department.Daimari apprised Sonowal of the slew of initiatives taken by his department to control prices of essential commodities by holding discussions with trade and business organisations.The meeting was attended, among others, by representatives of Chambers of Commerce, fruits and vegetables, potato and onion and egg wholesale dealers."
58fef9a77be9e0420db2a861,"Rain whips up tomato, potato price",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160709/jsp/jharkhand/story_95578.jsp,2016-07-09,,Telegraph,"A vendor sells precious tomatoes in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Friday. Picture by Hardeep Singh This week, Ranchi vegetable customers are moving around markets with long faces and half-empty bags. Reason? Heavy rains of last weekend have damaged a bulk of local potato and tomato crops, hiking their retail prices to Rs 24 and Rs 50 per kilo, respectively. Members of Pandra Bazar Samiti, the wholesale hub in Ranchi, said wholesale prices of potato and tomato are Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kilo. ""Water-logging in farms has destroyed both crops,"" said horticulture scientist of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) K.K. Jha. Explaining why, he said: ""The recent heavy rains led to water-logging in poorly drained farms. So, potatoes rotted underground. Heavy downpour tore tomato skins and lack of sunlight led to their getting fungus."" Bhuidih, Mandar and Itki in Ranchi district, Gumla, Simdega and Hazaribagh are the state's tomato bowls. A bulk of potatoes are brought from Bengal, but the tuber also grows in Ratu, Ormanjhi, Pithoria, Namkum and other places in Ranchi. Imports from Bengal had also reduced drastically since monsoon picked up steam, rued a Ranchi wholesale trader Naresh Sahu, saying compared to last week's two trucks, only one came this week. BAU scientist Jha stressed it was possible to save tomatoes from tearing or fungus. ""Growing tomatoes in polyhouses in a controlled environment will enable them to survive heavy monsoon, but then, only a fraction of Jharkhand's tomatoes are grown that way. More farmers need to adapt to progressive ways,"" he stressed. Raj Kumar, MD of Jharkhand State Agriculture Marketing Board, added another valid point. ""We need cold storage for perishable items so that the produce we get is kept properly. So far, a few private ones have come up at Bero, Ormanjhi and other places, but we can't monitor them. The situation will improve when our 5,000 metric tonne cold storage comes up in Pandra,"" he said. But for now, the scene at Lalpur vegetable market, one of Ranchi's largest retail hubs, is dismal. A vendor had stocked 5kg of tomatoes against the 20kg. ""Due to heavy rain, the local tomato crop is damaged,"" rued Munna Oraon, when asked why there were so few tomatoes. ""I brought 5kg tomatoes from Bero farmers but that too is of poor quality,"" he admitted. Potato vendor Lokesh in Lalpur said he was selling them for Rs 24 a kilo. ""Last week, it was Rs 18 per kilo. But, what to do when supply is so poor? Our margins are thin."" Homemakers are feeling the pinch. ""I'm substituting fresh tomatoes with ketchup and using less potatoes in subzi,"" Lalpur homemaker Anju Saxena said. ""French fries are out of the menu for the time being."" But, scientist Jha had a word of hope. ""New cropping is on at tomato and potato hubs. By September, Ranchi customers can expect the duo at affordable prices,"" he said."
58fefa227be9e0420db2a925,Singur lessons,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160428/jsp/bengal/story_82682.jsp,2016-04-28,,Telegraph,"Asha Patra, whose husband Shankar hanged himself in 2008 when his shop fell intoin the car factory area. Asha lives in a tiny brick house in Khasherbheri village.Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta No party other than Trinamul can enter these villages, declares a young man standing at the meeting point of Beraberi, Khasherbheri and Bajemelia villages, under a tree with a poster on the SUCI candidate. The SUCI was part of the Singur protests before their takeover by Mamata Banerjee. ""The CPM will be beaten up,"" the young man adds. Whether the youth means business or not, the villages under three panchayat areas, Gopalnagar, Beraberi and KGD (Kamarkundu, Gopalnagar, Daluigachha), which were most affected by land taken forcibly from anichhuk (unwilling) farmers to build the Tata's Nano factory, is still a Trinamul bastion. This is Ground Zero of Mamata Banerjee's ""paribartan"" in probably more than one sense. It is remarkable what goes unremarked: Didi's abandonment of Singur. After driving the Tatas out of the proposed factory here and walking into Writers', Mamata has hardly visited Singur. Saturday's meeting was only an election campaign. After becoming chief minister she also said the Singur legal case could take between five and 50 years, which looked like she was washing her hands of the issue after she had promised the unwilling farmers that she would return their land. But Singur is not angry enough, not with her. Many of the ""unwilling"" farmers who lost their land, refused compensation and threw in their lot with Mamata, are still with Mamata. Not only because their anger against the CPM cadre who assaulted and humiliated them is still on the boil, but also because of something more tangible: Didi's event management and the Rs 2,000 and 16kg of rice package issued by her government and disbursed by local Trinamul leaders. What the package of money and rice is doing to neighbourly relations, not to say families, is another story. It is raising questions about who is entitled to be a victim and how much. "" Shahid parivars"" or martyr families dot the Singur villages affected by the loss of land. Krishna Bag, a well-known woman in Beraberi village, home to most protesting villagers, is from one such. Krishna became a face of the protests for having been jailed with her toddler. On September 25, 2006, Krishna was among 2,000-odd protesters who thronged the BDO office demanding that the 400 fertile acres that were taken from the ""unwilling"" farmers without consent be returned. Krishna's husband's family had lost three bighas to the Tata factory. It was their livelihood. With Krishna was her younger daughter Payel, a two-year-old then. But the police did not spare her or her child. After being beaten up severely, Krishna, with Payel, was thrown into the lock-up and then sent to Chandernagore jail for three days, with 23 other women. ""The cadre would enter our homes and beat us up,"" remembers Krishna. ""We had to see our land being turned into concrete, into drains."" The next year, Krishna's father-in-law, Haradhan Bag, unable to cope with the loss of land, hanged himself. Krishna's husband Arun, who used to work on the land that yielded several crops, including potatoes, jute, rice and vegetables, is a carpenter now like many of his neighbours who lost their land, commuting to Calcutta daily for Rs 200 a day. Krishna, diagnosed with low haemoglobin levels, was recently hospitalised. Her elder daughter Anamika, a college student now, had to give up her dream of studying in an art college. It has been 10 years and things have gone from bad to worse. But Krishna still looks up to Mamata Banerjee. She meets the chief minister two times every year, once during July 21, the annual Martyr's Day, when Krishna and Payel are on display on stage as Singur victims, and once before the Pujas when they are given money, a few thousands, and clothes. If they do not turn up, Didi sends over the Puja clothes meant for Payel to their one-storey concrete house in Beraberi. On every occasion, Didi talks to Krishna. Krishna feels she is in touch with Didi. But Didi possibly does not know something. Her compensation for the martyr's family has split it. Neither Krishna, not her family members, speaks to one of Arun's closest relatives who has claimed the mantle of "" shahid"" and is regarded by Krishna's family as having taken several lakhs that Didi apparently issued to the family. ""I am sure Didi doesn't know where the money is going. Do you think I should tell her?"" Krishna asks. If the CPM should learn that no one forgets losing land under duress, Didi should know that she cannot make everyone happy with dole politics. Asha Patra is the widow of another "" shahid"", Shankar Patra. She lives in a tiny brick house in Khasherbheri village, next to Beraberi. Shankar hanged himself in 2008 after the small shop he ran became a part of the land for the small-car factory. Frail and slow in her movements, Asha cries as she speaks, but her eyes remain alert. She, too, attends the two annual Trinamul events and is given the clothes and money. But she wonders why, if she is a martyr's widow, she is not entitled to the monthly package of Rs 2,000 and 16kg rice, especially when she is almost starving. The Trinamul government sanctioned the package to individuals affected by the Tata factory protests in Singur, as to others in other parts of Bengal, shortly after coming to power. Official records are not available readily, but local Trinamul sources say about 3,400 individuals are getting the money and rice in Singur every month: 2,500 ""unwilling"" farmers, who did not want to give their land, 300 bargadars and 600 farm labourers, or the families of such persons. Asha is not one of the 3,400 beneficiaries, because her son's name was taken down by local Trinamul leaders. She discloses with some difficulty that her son, a grille mechanic, keeps all that he gets, but in families like hers, which do not enjoy the blessings of the party, no one can claim to be a victim. But many close to the party can. ""You have to see what is going on,"" she adds. It seems that the dole given by the Mamata government has benefited some more than others. A few feet away stands the prosperous household of Shonali Das, an attractive articulate homemaker with long black hair streaming down her back as her skin glows from the golden yellow of her tant sari. A well-tended tulsi mancha stands near the entrance. Her family enjoys the support of the local Trinamul. She bursts into anger when she remembers the CPM cadres. ""They would wait outside, watching. They dragged me out by my hair out of this room when I was seven-months pregnant,"" she says. "" Jomi amader ma (the land is our mother). We will never forget,"" she says, her eyes flashing with anger. But Didi has provided adequate compensation to her family, Shonali says. ""Not everyone could be included, but five adult members of my family get the victims' package, including me,"" says Shonali. It means Rs 10,000 per month and 80kg rice. Why does she get the package? ""I don't know,"" she says, and asks Tapas Das, a neighbour. ""Because you are a farm labourer,"" says Tapas. ""I am a farm labourer?"" asks Shonali and doubles up in laughter. Tapas's family, which lives next door, is another "" shahid parivar"". His brother Prashanta, who was a ""very good farmer"" and knew each of his plants, killed himself after the 4.5 bighas owned by the family went inside factory land. This family gets six packages: Rs 12,000 per month and 96kg rice. Tapas says all the rice is used up by the household. The Trinamul candidate from Singur, former minister Rabindranath Bhattacharya who is known as Mastermoshai, is confident that he will win. But so is the CPM, which is fielding Rabin Deb. Local CPM leaders point out that Becharam Manna, who is the Trinamul candidate in the adjacent Haripal, practically runs the panchayats in Singur (15 belonging to Trinamul, one to the CPM), and is Bhattacharya's sworn rival. He can do more harm to Bhattacharya's prospects than good. Besides, they point out, that Singur is not restricted to those three panchayats: there are 13 others in the constituency, where the disaffected are many and they want industry. They also claim that the number of ""unwilling"" farmers has been exaggerated greatly by Trinamul: there were 562 of them, nowhere near the 3,400 on the Trinamul's records who are being given the compensation. ""People have realised they have made a mistake. Singur now is hungering for industry,"" says Amar Chandra, CPM zonal committee member, Singur. ""Outside the affected villages, the rest of Singur is like the rest of Bengal."""
58fefc1f7be9e0420db2ac26,Will the Sylheti paradox be solved?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/opinion/story_102933.jsp,2016-08-18,,Telegraph,"There was a time, just a few years ago, when recent events in Bangladesh were a cause for celebration. After decades of famine and war and natural disaster, the country had achieved the longest life expectancy and the lowest fertility rate in South Asia. From 1990 to 2010, the rate of infants who suffered an early death fell by more than half. Over 90 per cent of tuberculosis cases were being cured. Long series in The Lancet and The Economist expressed admiration and wonder at these transformations. The latter compared contemporary Bangladesh to Meiji Japan, which enacted ""the most dramatic period of improvement in human health in history."" This progress remains incomplete. Bangladesh is still one of the most malnourished places in the world. Well over a third of the country's children are ""stunted"", the technical term for being intensely and chronically undernourished. The sundry permanent effects include a lifelong reduced cognitive capacity. Within Bangladesh, child stunting is worst in the northeastern division of Sylhet, where Helen Keller International has reported the rate to be fully 50 per cent. I recently travelled to Sylhet with HKI, one of the foreign NGOs combating malnutrition there. Around 20 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Habiganj, and beyond the outskirts of the town of Nabiganj, I visited three remote villages struggling with extreme malnutrition. Every last child in the area I met had the underdeveloped bodies, and particularly the skinny arms, that are the telltale signs of stunting. In other respects as well, Madhobpur, Manderkandi and Sreemotpur seem to epitomize rural South Asian poverty. The cows are skinny and sickly; medical clinics lack electricity; the local water has as much as 100 times the safe limit of arsenic. So it was a jarring moment when a bunch of children saw my group approach and produced smartphones to photograph their visitors (picture, above). Globalization had brought advanced mobile operating systems, but not adequate protein. This was evidence of the contradictory nature of development in Bangladesh more generally. Sylhet is a relatively rich district with, reportedly, Bangladesh's worst stunting rate; the southwestern district of Khulna, conversely, has one of the highest poverty rates in the country and also one of the lowest stunting rates. ""'The Sylheti paradox' is what we call it in our office,"" said Nicolas Syed, a United Nations official working on rural poverty in Bangladesh. The Sylheti paradox is a measure of the degree to which standard metrics of development and positive social outcomes may be disconnected. On the one hand, the remarkable success of Bangladesh in improving the well-being of its citizens has been strikingly detached not only from nutrition but also from economic growth, which has not been as dramatic as the health statistics suggest. The Economist pointed out that the average Bangladeshi lives four years longer than the average Indian, even while Indians are twice as rich. In explaining many of the most basic improvements in the everyday lives of Bangladeshis, wealth seems curiously tangential. The miserable health of Sylhetis exemplifies exactly what money alone may not bring. An enterprising people once known as sailors, the Sylhetis were reported by The Guardian to make up 95 per cent of the Bangladeshi population in the United Kingdom. In both New York and London, a vast majority of ""Indian"" restaurants are actually run by Bangladeshi Sylhetis. A great deal of the money made by Sylhetis abroad returns to their homeland. Twenty years ago, Habiganj lacked phones and roads; it used to take one or two days of travel by foot or boat just to reach an adjacent upazila, or county. When I stayed in the city a few months ago, my new hotel offered free WiFi, and I experienced no trouble driving from place to place. Yet these advancements have had surprisingly little effect on the health and diet of most Sylhetis. Sylhet is full of haors, floodplains underwater for so long that even well-maintained gardens often don't last over half the year. Many locals live on little hills surrounding the haors, which means they have trouble receiving basic services every year when their home becomes an island. Meanwhile the dense, tropical soil in Sylhet is not well-suited to agriculture, and a lack of crop rotation has led to a dire nitrogen deficiency. Culturally, Sylhet has a long history of religiosity and conservatism. Shah Jalal, the preacher who spread Islam in Bengal in the 13th and 14th centuries, lived in Sylhet, and his tomb is an important site for pilgrims. According to research cited by the Asian Development Bank, 60 per cent of Sylhetis pray daily, as compared to 35 per cent countrywide. In 2004 and 2005, Sylhet faced multiple Islamist terror attacks. Both religious and social conservatism have had a negative effect on the health of Sylhetis. As in other South Asian cultures, women tend to eat at the end of meals, after the men and children have their fill, leaving poor women only meagre leftovers. During my visit to Manderkandi, a leader of HKI's garden program named Chaiti was showing off her chickens. After a few minutes, one of her male in-laws, Shamanandha Vattacharjo, nudged her out of the way to take over the tour. The economist, Binayak Sen, among others, has demonstrated the strong correlation between female empowerment and nutrition in Bangladesh. Khulna, the poorer yet healthier district, also boasts a much higher level of female education than Sylhet. This link between female empowerment or education and family nutrition is evident in villages all over the district of Habiganj. According to local HKI officials, some of whom are from the area, many pregnant women refuse to eat protein out of fear that their babies will grow too big and make for an uncomfortable childbirth. Once born, children frequently do not receive sufficient breastfeeding for the first six months of their lives. The better-educated mothers of Khulna ensure that their children have notably diverse diets; in Sylhet, the lack of adequate breast milk is only one way in which babies and infants are deprived of essential nutrients. Until their teeth are strong enough, for example, children are not fed the small fish that Sylhetis eat whole, bones and all. In Manderkandi, Vattacharjo told me that these fish, caught in a muddy pond nearby, have been the area's only source of protein. Many of the relatively wealthier residents of Habiganj city suffer from similarly skewed diets. I had a glimpse of the city's eating habits at the restaurants Sky Queen Chinese and Mango, which is brand new and maintains an active Facebook page. Neither restaurant served a single dish with a healthy amount of vegetables, and most orders came with only scraps of protein. Across Bangladesh, malnourishment is not only a problem for the lower class: in the wealthiest quintile of society nationally, 21 per cent of children were underweight in 2010, according to The Lancet. If economic development is not solving malnutrition in Sylhet, what can? During my visit, I saw numerous ways in which NGOs improve the health of Sylhetis through modest interventions. (Here I should state an interest: an old friend of mine works for Helen Keller International, and I travelled with her to Sylhet, where HKI set up its project to combat malnutrition last year.) Not everyone in Bangladesh views foreign NGOs in the benevolent way they view themselves. Their strength and size have drawn criticism from those who charge that they disregard the national government as well as local power structures, leading to grassroots resistance, waste and NGOs exaggerating their achievements. The anthropologist, Lamia Karim, has argued that NGOs co-opted Bangladesh's intelligentsia and the allegiance of its poor, defanging overtly political left-wing resistance to the inequalities of the country. More troublingly, many of the recent terror attacks in Bangladesh have specifically targeted foreign citizens, including Japanese aid workers at the Holey Artisan Bakery and an Italian aid worker out for a jog. These killings may already be achieving their desired effect. ""They are leaving,"" Jillian Waid, leader of HKI's local research unit, wrote me of her fellow NGO expats. The United States Agency for International Development and Britain's Department for International Development have both, according to Waid, withdrawn their employees with families. Waid herself, who has worked in Bangladesh for the past seven years, now intends to get out soon. On my trip, I saw examples of the substantial small-scale help that has been provided over the years by foreign groups like HKI, Save the Children, and USAID, all of which are fighting malnutrition in Sylhet. In each village I visited, new gardens were producing nutritious vegetables such as okra and bitter gourd (picture, above). Where white-fleshed sweet potato has been common, HKI was helping to introduce a much healthier orange-fleshed sweet potato in its stead. The organization was also trying to popularize kangkong, a spinach that grows even in the watery soil of the haors. In Madhobpur, HKI had staged a test in which three separate plots showed the results of planting using the village's customary methods alongside two different natural fertilizers introduced by HKI. The difference was stark: large plants had grown in the second two plots, while the first was nearly bare. Popy Rani, a village mother who told me she had initially been sceptical of HKI, said she was persuaded to set up her own new garden after looking at the flourishing plants of a neighbouring village. HKI has led many other initiatives: classes on breast-feeding and preparing children well-rounded meals, for instance (picture, above), and financial help and instruction with poultry farms. The most concrete symbol of the potential of its efforts is the humble ""tippy-tap"". This is a plastic bottle tied to a post at an angle so that, if the top is unscrewed, air pressure causes a stream of water to pour out through a hole at the bottom of the bottle. The rest of the time, when the top is screwed on, the bottle retains its water. The tippy-tap is, in effect, a home-made faucet. In Sreemotpur, nobody used to wash their hands because of all the water wasted by pouring it out from a bucket. Now, a bar of soap and a tippy-tap stand at the centre of the village as basic tools of everyday life. In 1974, Bangladesh was a brand new state facing a famine while its government teetered on the brink of collapse. International aid shot up, and Bangladesh welcomed foreigners who said they wanted to improve the lives of Bangladeshis in ways the shaky government could not. The significance of aid efforts launched from abroad have since been surpassed by domestic groups, especially Grameen Bank and BRAC, which have collectively acquired well over 10 million microfinance borrowers. Grameen has also founded the country's leading telecommunications service, with over 56 million subscribers, while BRAC has established 400 legal aid centres and over 22,000 primary schools. Grameen and BRAC are not going anywhere anytime soon. Still, in places such as Sylhet, neither market forces nor the State and its domestic surrogates have supplied some of the basic necessities of a good life. Foreign NGOs bring expertise, initiative, and funding that are intensely needed. As murderous attacks on aid workers grow more frequent, the continuation of their work is imperiled. Bangladesh is on its way to providing unprecedented good health to a wide array of its citizens - but much more remains to be done. These are the stakes for a country whose violent fringe is beginning to drive the rest of the world away."
58fefcaf7be9e0420db2ad0d,Solar power to fields,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160810/jsp/bihar/story_101608.jsp,2016-08-10,,Telegraph,"The solar plant set up in Jamui. (below) Manoj Tanti. Telegraph pictures Manoj Tanti, a 35-year-old farmer in Jamui district's Kedia village, is brimming with pride and joy these days and the source of his happiness is a huge, white container positioned in the nearby fields. The container is the state's first solar-powered cold storage and is expected to change the fortunes of the village, around 170km southeast of Patna, home to 650 and odd people. ""We had to sell potatoes and onions at throwaway prices to middlemen. We could not store them for long at normal temperatures,"" Manoj told The Telegraph. ""But with the solar cold storage, we can keep our vegetables for longer periods and sell them at our own discretion."" This state-of-the art cold storage set up in the Barhat block of the Maoist-ravaged district has a capacity of 5 tonnes and a back-up power supply of around 30 hours. Normally powered by solar panels that heat a thermal plate replete with various devices, the cold storage can run on regular power supply and diesel generator during the monsoon. Greenpeace, the environmental NGO that adopted Kedia village in 2014, has facilitated the cold storage worth Rs 12 lakh - the funds for which were collected from the villagers and crowd funding. Over the past two years, the farmers have diversified their crops and started growing a variety of vegetables with the help of organic fertilisers and minimum use of pesticides. ""Crowd funding was managed in metro cities, with several film and television celebrities such as Waheeda Rehman, Pooja Bedi, Meiyang Chang and Pankaj Tripathi,"" said Ishteyaque Ahmad, Greenpeace's campaigner for sustainable agriculture in Kedia. ""Though there is a good demand for vegetables from this village in the market, farmers had to sell their produce at throwaway prices in the absence of a cold storage. The cold storage will be managed by the farmers' cooperative and will help them save their own seeds for crops like potato."" In a country where 40 per cent of farm produce is wasted because of no storage space and inability of small and marginal farmers to afford exploitative rates of regular cold storages, this is a boon. Ishteyaque said the cold storage is just one part of the ""Kedia model"" of sustainable agriculture developed in consultation with farmers and government officials to utilise existing central and state government schemes and subsidy programmes for rural development, agriculture and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Act. The money from these schemes have been used to construct 282 vermicompost units to provide organic fertilisers to farmers, 11 biogas plants to provide better cooking fuel, five pucca cattle sheds to help collect cowdung and urine to feed the biogas plants and for pest management solutions, and ecological toilets, with a possibility of turning excreta into fertilizer. For the next step, Greenpeace has invited labour resources minister Vijay Prakash to inaugurate the solar facility on Thursday. ""After inauguration, we are aiming to advocate for the 'Kedia model', including solar cold storage, with the Bihar government to have it on a pilot basis in at least one village in each of the 38 districts,"" said Ishteyaque. ""It should be extended to other villages as no aid is required for it and the technology is easily available."""
58feff7c7be9e0420db2b144,The importance of questioning the message,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160802/jsp/opinion/story_99957.jsp,2016-08-02,,Telegraph,"Literacy today does not imply just the ability to read and write. It implies the ability to think critically about all the communications that reach us in different forms including images and sound-bites. As educators today, we are called upon to deal with multiple literacies concerning medical, consumption, computer, financial and so on. But media literacy is what I wish to focus on just now. Media literacy indicates the ability to sift through, analyse and apply critical thinking skills to messages that inform, entertain and sell to us every day, round the clock. Perhaps it would be more accurate to use the term, ""media and information literacy"". The term, ""information"", is especially important in current times, in view of the number of young people being influenced and converted through information over the internet. For some years now, children have had access to all kinds of information and have been the recipients of all kinds of messages. The fall out is that either their minds are invaded or their pockets - rather, their parents' pockets. By the time they reach their teens our children would have spent thousands of hours in front of the television, surfing the net, playing video games, listening to recorded music or engaged in socializing on the internet. It is evident that their understanding of the world around them - which they seem totally oblivious of at times - does not come from other human beings but from the media. Although our children have almost unlimited access to information we tend to agree with the general belief that they are quite ignorant about the real world, that children of the information age watch more and know less but feel as if they know more. One of the reasons why they appear to know less is that since information is so easily available they do not feel the need to process the information deeply enough. This reminds me of an applicant for a teaching job who on being asked a very simple conceptual question replied that she knew the answer when she was preparing for her MA examination but had forgotten it since and would have to look up her notes. Clearly, this person had not assimilated the concept in question. She had merely learned it for an exam and had consequently not been able to retain it in her memory after that. A senior scientist friend had lamented once that these days the purpose of learning had been reduced to doing well in exams. There are several problems with regard to the abundance of information that is accessible to all and the undesirable nature of some of it. While educators are concerned about helping students sift, validate and process the information that is available, parents worry about the dangers of the cyber world, about the impact of sex and violence, and the risks involved in the interactive nature of social networks. But also, there is an urgent need to look out for stereotyping, gender biases, inaccuracies and questionable value judgments that come across ever so often. It is futile to try and control the onslaught of the media or to try and protect our children from them. The media are all-pervasive - the sides of buses and trams, backlit hoardings, television, radio, newspapers, magazines, flyers, banners, slogans on carry-bags and messages on t-shirts - you just cannot avoid the exposure. Nor can you screen them. In these circumstances the best strategy would be to teach children to engage with the media sensibly and intelligently. This way their critical thinking skills would be honed, they would learn to ask pertinent questions and they would develop the qualities of a responsible citizen. They will soon learn to interpret the cryptic messages on their friends' t-shirts and decide what messages they themselves wish to spread. Incidentally, I have often wondered why people wear offensive, rude and sometimes obscene pieces of writing or images across their chests. And worse, why do parents make helpless toddlers sport t-shirts with ridiculous slogans like ""I am cuter than your kid"" or ""My mom is hotter than yours"". By learning to process all information, the chances of young minds being influenced, manipulated or brain-washed would be considerably reduced. The last is vital today in view of the large scale ""radicalization"" that is taking place with chilling consequences. Hate speeches, rhetorical grandstanding, fiery pronouncements and the biased reporting of events are leading to a climate of intense intolerance. No matter what is done to maintain vigilance in the virtual world, it is in the real world that these issues must be tackled. So, the earlier we begin the likelier that peace will have a chance. When media literacy was first introduced in our school a few years ago, it was partly to address an increasingly consumerist society. The recognition of the power of children to influence the buying decisions of the family had led to them being made the chief targets of corporate selling. Children successfully nagged their parents into buying the things they desired. It was also observed that clever advertising lured them into certain behavioural paths such as eating junk food or throwing tantrums to get adults in the family to buy them the latest gizmos or toys. It is children who increasingly decided on the brand of toothpaste, shampoo, cereal or potato chips to be bought, and they even played an important role in selecting the new family car. In the recently released book Nawabs, Nudes, Noodles, the author, Ambi Parameswaran, says that ""as India changes, its advertising will also change and become a force multiplier. That is the power of advertising."" So we thought that if we taught children to ""question the message"" appropriately they would not only become responsible consumers but they would also develop the habit of not accepting any message passively. We were also concerned about the images of masculinity and of the 'perfect' female body, of fair skin and silky hair that were being constantly projected. We wanted our children to know the truth behind these images and to tell them about air-brushing and Photoshopping and to look out for biases and inaccuracies. The set of questions we had in mind were: Who is the message for and who wants to pass on this message and why? Have they left out anything I should know? How have they grabbed my attention? Do pictures always tell the truth? Have I been influenced by marketing strategies and powerful ""hidden persuaders""? Our domestic help, Jamuna, gets really annoyed with marketing gimmicks which she terms chalaki byabsha or ""clever business tricks"". She is not formally educated nor is she media savvy or consumer literate, yet she does not get taken in by the free bowl that is given with the package of detergent powder or by the attractive packaging or by the ploy of enticing the customer to buy three articles for the price of two. She is especially wary of extra-large containers that turn out to be only one-third full and she has learnt to look at the weight and the MRP marked on the packet and is able to compare different branded products by working out the unit price. Impressively, she is also suspicious of the terms, ""new"" and ""improved"". She firmly believes that these words were yet another of those business tricks to deceive the customer - ""What is 'new'?"" she protests, ""they are selling us the same stuff in a dressed-up box."" This reminds me of a ""new"" or ""latest"" edition of a textbook, which, on closer examination, is found to have added just one new poem or rewritten chapter. I find Jamuna far more informed, aware and canny than many educated people when it comes to buying consumables or even responding to news. All parents want their children to be abreast of current affairs. As far as the school is concerned, general awareness is an intrinsic part of education. The old method of reading out newspaper headlines in class does not work anymore as reporting styles have changed drastically and children have to be taught afresh what is meant by news. Some of the questions to ask children pertain to the difference between news and entertainment, the meaning of infotainmentand the meaning of tabloidization. Here too, they must look out for biased reporting and find out the political leanings of the owner of the newspaper, magazine or news channel. Our senior students know that business houses and political parties try to gain control over print and electronic media. They are old enough to understand the question of vested interests and what happens when the advertiser is the main source of revenue. They are well aware that dailies and news channels owned by political parties are likely to be blatantly one-sided in their reporting. Media literacy is not media bashing. Children can be taught to construct their own mass media with themes like ""Save Water"" or ""Do not Honk"". Through such activities they will learn the importance of the media. Media and information literacy is an essential form of literacy for the 21st century. It should not be regarded as an additional subject but must be woven seamlessly in the school curriculum in such a manner that students will apply their critical skills to every message and every bit of information that they are exposed to. It is hoped that through this sort of education they will also question their textbooks as well as their teachers and, most important, they will question the right of others to impose their beliefs on them.

58ff00777be9e0420db2b2be,Message to Cong in Modi salute to Rao,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160629/jsp/nation/story_93856.jsp,2016-06-29,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, June 28: Narendra Modi today began his day with a laudatory tweet on P.V. Narasimha Rao. The Prime Minister said: ""Tributes to Shri PV Narasimha Rao on his birth anniversary. He led India at a crucial time and his leadership was both notable and vital."" With that post, Modi stamped his approval on the BJP's ongoing project to appropriate another Congress leader who was not a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family and make its point that the Congress was an alibi for a dynasty and not democracy and, therefore, had no place in India. Historically, the BJP has had a love-hate relationship with Rao, a political enigma of sorts who never clearly revealed his stance on Hindu-Muslim relations. The BJP's co-option of Rao was characterised by symbols and political pragmatism. On March 31 this year, the Modi regime announced its decision to build a memorial ghat for the late Prime Minister at Delhi's Ekta Sthal Samadhi Complex, adjacent to the site housing Jawaharlal Nehru's memorial. The reason given was he was entitled to state honours as a former Prime Minister and the ""harbinger of economic liberalisation"". As Rao and Manmohan Singh, who was his finance minister, unrolled economic reforms to pull the country out of a crisis precipitated by currency over-evaluation, fiscal imbalances and balance of payments' issues, the BJP had initially piped in with the Left to oppose his measures. The BJP's opposition to opening up the economy was encapsulated in a slogan coined by the RSS's swadeshi hardliners - ""Yes to computer chips, no to potato chips"". A way of saying that FDI in technology was acceptable but not in processed food. Economics was not the BJP's only plank to confront Rao. It had moved a no-confidence motion against his government after the demolition of the Babri mosque in December 1992. BJP veteran L.K. Advani, aided by jurist Ram Jethmalani, had accused Rao of accepting a ""one crore rupees bribe"" from stockbroker Harshad Mehta. Jethmalani arraigned him in other cases and nearly got him behind bars in the Lakhubhai Pathak fraud case. The BJP sharpened its talons even more when Rao tried to hit back at its leaders with the hawala case, based on the names of prominent politicians that figured in the diaries maintained by ""hawala brokers"" Jain brothers. These politicians had received payoffs from the Jains. Among the alleged recipients was Advani, who helmed the party at that time and was also an MP. A special court directed the CBI to frame charges against him. The revelation forced Advani to resign from Parliament and vow that he would not contest another election until his exoneration. Although Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been declared the BJP's prime-ministerial candidate before the hawala scam broke, the party's rank and file idolised Advani who had led the Ram rath yatra. Advani was subsequently acquitted but the Rao strike had wounded the BJP deep enough for it to harbour a grouse against him for a long time. Vajpayee charted a different course on Rao. Despite knowing he was pitted against Rao in the 1996 elections, he invited Rao to release his book of poems in the run-up. A photograph depicting the rivals together adorned the wall of Vajpayee's home. He acknowledged then: ""Whatever be our political differences, he is a scholar and he was the first to grasp the most significant of my poems."" It was called Geet naya gaata hoon (I sing a new song). The BJP's voyage of discovery of Rao's ""virtues"" coincided with two developments: the former Prime Minister's ignominious fade-out from the Congress and the rise of Sonia Gandhi and the BJP's embrace of economic liberalisation. The Congress's shoddy treatment of Rao after his death was grist to the BJP's campaign. In 2013, Modi took it on himself to tell the Congress to ""take lessons"" from Rao on how to run the country at a public meeting in Delhi because he claimed like Vajpayee, Rao had ""robust common sense"". More encomiums flowed. In February 2014, Arun Jaitley, then the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader, described Rao's regime as the ""turning point"" for India's economy while releasing a book, ModiNomics by Sameer Kochhar. Rao will shortly get enshrined in the BJP's pantheon of Congress greats that already include Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Madan Mohan Malviya and Lal Bahadur Shastri."

Modi listed the Mudra scheme, increased LPG coverage and rural electrification as big achievements at a closed-door parliamentary party meeting in the morning. During the Lok Sabha sitting soon after, at least two BJP members voiced discontent on specific issues and got support from other party MPs. ""You have given a very elaborate reply but the problem remains as it is. The price of pulses is not coming down and that of onions is not going up,"" BJP MP Hukum Singh said during Question Hour. Hukum appeared unhappy that agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh had washed his hands of the problems of onion farmers, raised by another BJP MP. Replying to Sumedhanand Saraswati's plea to save onion farmers, the minister had said: ""A price stabilisation fund has been set up for potato, onion and pulses. Earlier it was with the agriculture ministry but now it has gone to the food and civil supplies ministry."" After the minister spoke about e-trading being introduced by the government, Hukum said: ""Of what use is e-trading, when farmers are being compelled to sell their onion at Rs 2/kg and even Rs 1/kg? The government should provide a solution...."" The caustic remark led to mild flutter in the treasury benches and many MPs were seen expressing their support. On another issue, another MP, R.K. Singh, embarrassed home minister Rajnath Singh. After Rajnath had firmly denied there was ever a provision for housing in the Centre's police modernisation scheme, R.K. Singh spoke up. ""I just want to clarify one fact. There was a provision for housing in the police modernisation scheme... it has been stopped since the Centre has increased the share of taxes to the states,"" the BJP MP said. Many party members were seen suppressing giggles. ""He should be made the minister,"" an Opposition MP quipped, prompting Rajnath's junior, Kiren Rijiju, to step in. ""What is this?"" he protested. The intervention seen as ""undesirable"" by many party leaders came after Rajnath had rejected Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge's claim that earlier there was a provision for housing. ""Police modernisation fund is never allocated for housing,"" the minister had said. Congress members loudly contested the denial. Rajnath remained firm till his own party MP overruled him. The minister did not contest the MP, who had retired as home secretary before joining the BJP and intermittently speaks out against the government and the party. Yesterday, another BJP MP from Bihar, Bhola Singh, had said: ""With regard to Reliance, the policy of the previous government and in some instances the present government remains the same. I want to know what is the compulsion of the government in resolving the dispute clearly and firmly with the company."" Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said with Modi as Prime Minister, there was no question of compromise, but many BJP MPs were seen congratulating Bhola."
58ff0b537be9e0420db2bd0a,Potato factory flop cloud on polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160430/jsp/bengal/story_83096.jsp,2016-04-30,,Telegraph,"Calcutta, April 29: The Bengal government has recently abandoned its proposed potato wafer processing unit in Hooghly's Sheoraphuli after no private company showed interest in the project, leaving the ruling party in a soup ahead of elections. ""The fate of the proposed unit was never bright but the final decision was taken a few months ago.... The project could have helped us in the elections if it had taken a proper shape, but we could not do it because of lack of proper planning,"" a minister told The Telegraph. Eighteen Assembly segments in Hooghly will vote on April 30. According to sources at Nabanna, the government had floated an expression of interest inviting private partners to set up the unit under a public-private partnership in 2013. As none of the established private companies came forward, the project was abandoned at the end of 2015. Government sources said no private investor showed interest in developing the processing unit for two reasons - lack of a suitable variety of potato and ban on contract farming in the state. The potato processing units prefer the Chipsona potato to make wafers but in Bengal, priority is given to the table variety potatoes such as Jyoti and Pukhraj. ""The processing unit would have overcome the problem had there been a scope for contract farming.... But in Bengal, we did not want contract farming and that's why no major processing unit would invest here,"" said a senior government official. The project had initially drawn attention as the unit could have helped around 8 lakh potato farmers of Hooghly. The Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority had released a sum of Rs 8 crore to start the ground work. Senior government officials said the project had the potential to give mileage to the ruling party in Hooghly for two reasons. First, the state government was trying to focus on agro-based industries in the absence of big-ticket investments in the five years of the Mamata Banerjee-led government. If this unit had come up, it would have been seen as a success for the government. Second, it could have helped lakhs of potato farmers in the district who often face trouble in the years when there is surplus production of the tuber. ""In a district where the Tata Nano small-car factory in Singur was abandoned because of Trinamul resistance, the potato wafer processing unit could have been a game-changer for the ruling party,"" said a senior government official. Although, Trinamul had bagged 16 out of 18 Assembly seats in the district in 2011, insiders said the party was facing questions ahead of this year's elections. ""We cannot reply properly when we face questions on why the fate of potato farmers has not changed in the past five years... This unit was important for us to answer this question,"" said a Trinamul leader. Hooghly produces about 25 per cent of the state's average 100 lakh tonnes of potato every year, sources said. The question of the well-being of farmers in Hooghly is important for the ruling party this year as it wants to win all the seats in the district. ""According to reports that we are getting from other districts where elections have already been held, it is clear that we need to win the maximum number of seats in the last two phases on April 30 and May 5 to retain power.... Hooghly is one of the districts that could decide our fate,"" said the minister. As there is little scope for potato processing in the state, farmers face trouble in getting a fair price for their produce whenever there is a glut. ""The state has an annual consumption requirement of 60 lakh tonnes, but we often produce 120 lakh tonnes.... Such huge surplus production cannot be managed by exporting the crop to other states,"" said an official pointing out the necessity of potato processing units in the district. A senior agriculture marketing department official said: ""The government will try to use the funds in other projects such as setting up packaging units or a cold chain project."""

Pictures by Ruchira Gupta We enter a world of trees dripping with mangoes in Muzaffarpur. Lychee season is over and we are in the middle of the mango season in Bihar. Muzaffarpur is known as the Lychee Kingdom. Two varieties are famous, China and Shahi, available from May to June. Its cultivation covers a farm area of about 8,000 hectares with a production of about 75,000 tonnes of lychee every year. Kranti Prakash, a local farmer, believes that the lychee is a gift from China in exchange for the gift of Buddhism from Bihar. ""That is why one of our main lychee varieties is called China."" He grows lychee, rice, mustard, bananas, squash and three varieties of mangoes - Malda, Bambaiya and Langda - on his land. He also has four kathal trees. The whole district is lush. Rice-fields, sugar-cane fields, banana groves, guava trees, grass for thatching and making ropes, and vegetables. Bihar has become the largest producer of vegetables - potatoes, onions, eggplants, and cauliflower. It is also the third largest producer of pineapple. All Bihar's rice varieties - Katika, Jagar, Satthi (ready in 60 days), Sonachur, Hathia Jhulan, Jaswa, Kasaunjih, Bakol, Tulsimanjari, Badshabhog, Laldhari, Darmi, Jagar, Kessore, Selha, Kamod, Katani, Ladaura, Mircha - are grown by farmers in the district in spite of the pressure of the markets. Mill owners tend to buy only two varieties and government agencies as well as loan companies keep pushing the high yielding variety. ""We have edible soil, that is the best variety of soil. It comes from Nepal in the Budi Gandak river every year,"" says Kranti Prakash. When I see this abundance and prosperity, I cannot understand why Bihar is poor and why so many Biharis are malnourished. Kranti explains: because of lack of amenities for the cultivator. ""If we keep promoting the high-yielding variety seeds, we will lose our diversity,"" says Kranti. He adds that he keeps back a sack of Sonachur every year to re-grow. ""If the market has its way, this will disappear."" He is also apprehensive of the micro-credit companies driving the market of the high-yielding variety seed, chemical fertilisers, and irrigation systems catering to corporate farming. ""We have a top-down approach to farming. For example a dam has been made near my village. This will lead to malaria for all and my own village is going to go under water,"" he said. I feel sad. I love the diversity of Bihar. I can get a variety of vegetables here that we cannot find in a US supermarket. Fruits are still flavourful because they are not genetically modified. The variety of rice is a part of my life as is the variety of mangoes. I eat different rice for chuda and different rice for a pilaf. I hardly touch the ubiquitous Basmati. I have been tasting different mangoes since I started the Safarnama. Bambaiya came first, then the Dasheri, Kishen Bhog and Zardalu and now my all-time favourite, Langda. I will be gone by the time Fazli, Neelum and Chausa are available in full force. It won't matter that I won't be here for the Bathua in late September, I will get the pickle made from it. It would be a pity if Basmati is the only rice left in the world, Shahi the only lychee and Alphonso the only mango. It would also be a pity if corporate farming destroyed the small landholdings with their rice-fields, vegetable patches and banana groves, a way of life that is the backbone of the country that I know.

The chief minister will hand over cheques to many of the farmers who had not accepted compensation to protest land acquisition The dais on Durgapur Expressway. Picture by Pradip Sanyal MEETING VENUE On the Calcutta-Durgapur flank of Durgapur Expressway, in front of the main gate of the abandoned Nano project area. WHY HERE This is the spot where Mamata had set up a stage in August 2008 to protest the land acquisition. THE STAGE A 2km stretch of the Durgapur-bound flank from Calcutta has been taken up to build the two-tier stage for Singur Divas. The median divider has also been taken up to create space for the crowd. More than 1.5 lakh people are expected to be present. TRAFFIC Around the meeting venue, the Calcutta-bound flank of Durgapur Expressway has been divided with iron barricades to allow two-way movement of vehicles. The expressway is used by around 30,000 vehicles daily. TIME Mamata is expected to arrive around 4pm. Senior party leaders will come before that. Around 600 unwilling farmers who have applied for compensation will reach the venue by noon. Police said the rally would begin at 4pm and continue till 6pm. It will take at least an hour for the vehicles that will bring participants to disperse. The stage is unlikely to be dismantled on Wednesday. CROWD MANAGEMENT The police said Trinamul supporters would start arriving from 11am. The crowd will be allowed to sit on the road, covered with tarpaulin. Special invitees will be provided green chairs. DIVERSION The police have decided that till 11am, normal vehicular movement will be allowed, although at a slow pace, near the venue because one flank has been taken up by the stage.  After 11am, goods vehicles from Calcutta will be diverted to Delhi Road, which runs parallel to Durgapur Expressway, from Dankuni, 20km from the rally venue.  The vehicles can return to Durgapur Expressway from the Maheswarpur crossing, 10km from the venue, or continue on Delhi Road.  Calcutta-bound goods vehicles will have to take the diversion to Delhi Road from the Maheswarpur intersection. They can return to the expressway from Dankuni.  Private cars and other modes of transport other than goods vehicles will be allowed to use Durgapur Expressway till it is possible. If the crowd swells, cars from Calcutta will have to switch to Delhi Road from Ratanpur More, 3km ahead of the meeting venue.  Cars from Durgapur will have to take the diversion from the Maheswarpur intersection. Report by Kinsuk Basu Singur, Sept. 13: On a September night a decade ago, Dilip Samanta was inside the Singur BDO's office with Mamata Banerjee and many other land protesters demanding that the 400 fertile acres that were acquired ""forcibly"" from farmers be returned. Police had switched off the lights on the premises and lathicharged the 1,200-odd protesters, Dilip said. He had taken blows and fallen down. His motorbike was allegedly seized and kept in the police station for three days. When Dilip walks up to the Singur Divas stage to receive his compensation cheque from Mamata tomorrow, it will be one of his ""biggest moments of triumph"". Dilip, whose 14 bighas are part of the land that is supposed to be returned to the owners in keeping with a Supreme Court order, said: ""I will carry green abir with me. When Mamata Banerjee hands me the cheque, I will throw it in the air. It will be Holi for me and my family and for several others like me."" Dilip, the eldest of three brothers, has taken several loans from a farmers' cooperative society to cultivate potato and rice on the 8 bighas that had not been acquired. The accrued loan amount that he is yet to return is Rs 1.4 lakh. ""I am not sure of the amount I will receive tomorrow. But it won't be less than Rs 26 lakh. We have calculated,"" said Dilip, whose son is a government employee and daughter is married. ""Before the acquisition, we used to grow our own rice. Now, we have to depend on the Rs 2 a kilo rice the government provides,"" he added. Dilip will have to share the compensation amount with his brothers, Sushanta and Jayanta. The priorities of the Samantas are to repair their crumbling house, arrange for the marriage of Sushanta's eldest daughter Riya, a college student, and ensure that Jayanta's school-going daughters, Titli and Tania, do not face any hurdles to their education. ""If the land is made fit for cultivation, we will be able to make a turnaround. We had to sell ornaments to get my daughter married,"" Dilip said. He said when his name would be called tomorrow, he would run up the stairs to the dais. ""The fight to get back our land has finally yielded results,"" he said."
58ff12a57be9e0413616232f,"Wrong to outsource pulses, oilseeds production",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579039/wrong-outsource-pulses-oilseeds-production.html,2016-11-02,,Deccan Herald,"Wrong to outsource pulses, oilseeds productionDevinder Sharma, Nov 03, 2016 22:36 ISTAt a time when the country is faced with a massive unemployment crisis, the decision to invite BRICS countries  Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa  to cultivate pulses and oilseeds and ship it to India will only end up pushing more and more farmers out of agriculture.This will also add on to the growing unemployment crisis. With a minus 0.43% drop in job creation in the April-June 2016 quarter, India continues to be in the grip of what is called jobless growth.Renowned scientist M S Swaminathan had once remarked: Importing food is like importing unemployment. I had thought this was a loud enough warning and that the government would at least be careful in not deliberately destroying the tremendous potential agriculture has in creating gainful employment.But agriculture doesnt seem to be an area of concern for the government. Only a few days back, addressing the BRICS farm ministers meeting in New Delhi, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said ministers from these countries have agreed to promote production of pulses and oilseeds in their respective countries after India asked for help in meeting its shortfall in domestic production.This offers huge business opportunities to the BRICS countries, he added. Earlier, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had also acknowledged Indias efforts to woo Brazil into cultivation of pulses to meet the growing domestic demand. Since Brazil has not been growing pulses, India even offered to provide improved seeds of pulses varieties.The move to outsource production of oilseeds and pulses to the BRICS countries comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had about two months ago signed an agreement with Mozambique from where an import of one lakh tonne of pulses will hopefully begin in two years time.He had promised to procure every grain of the legume that farmers would cultivate in Mozambique and at a price which would not be lower than Minimum Support Price (MSP). India had also been searching for a possibility to grow pulses in Myanmar and some other African countries like Ethiopia, Uganda etc.As if this is not enough, the government has slashed the import duty on potatoes from 30 to 10%; on wheat from 25 to 10%; on import of crude palm oil from 12.5 to 7.5% and on refined oil from 20 to 15%. Lowering the import duty means opening the floodgates to cheaper imports. Although reduction of import duties is justified in the name of taming food inflation, when cheaper imports come in, it is the small and marginal farmers who are forced to abandon agriculture.The growing reliance on cheaper (and highly subsidised) imports of agricultural commodities, including pulses, edible oils, wheat, apple, rubber, coconut, silk, fish, a horde of fruit products and juices, are linked primarily to the policy imperative that aims to drive farmers out of agriculture. This approach follows a directive from the World Bank way back in 1990s wanting India to move 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by 2015.To achieve this, successive governments have been systematically squeezing public investments in agriculture and by denying farmers a fair and remunerative price kept farming impoverished. Cultivation of pulses is a classic example. Although the area under pulses cultivation has increased in kharif by a whopping 57%, and the production in 2016-17 is estimated to go up to a record 20 million tonnes, there still would be a shortfall by 3 to 4 million tonnes.Although the government has hiked the MSP for some of the pulses, the fact remains that it is the volatility in prices that discourages farmers to take up pulses cultivation. If the government can provide an assurance to farmers in Mozambique and in Brazil that it will procure whatever is produced I fail to understand why the same assurance cannot be given to Indian farmers?It is the lack of assured procurement that is the primary reason why farmers have been reluctant to take up pulses cultivation. Instead of helping the domestic farmers, the government is now outsourcing pulses production to Africa, Brazil and Russia.WTO disputeAfter India lost the WTO dispute with America over import of chicken legs, the poultry industry should be ready to take a hit. The dairy industry too is under pressure to open up to cheap imports from the European Union, Australia and New Zealand. In fact, some mainline economists have been openly vouching for it.They even want the sluice gates to be lifted for vegetable and fruit imports, endorsing the demand that the European Union is making under the Indo-EU Free Trade Agreement. Already, apple imports are coming in from 44 countries.While on the one hand India is expected to protect its food security concerns as well as farm livelihoods at the international negotiations, the autonomous liberalisation that goes unheeded at the domestic policy level is likely to inflict a much bigger blow to the future of Indian agriculture.For a country which has 600 million people dependent upon agriculture, and given that urban employment opportunities are fast drying up, the challenge should be on how to make farming economically viable.Contrary to the dominant economic thinking, agriculture alone has the potential to reboot the economy. Outsourcing food production to BRICS countries, and opening up to cheaper imports will not only destroy food self-sufficiency but once again make India to stand with a begging bowl."

Just not in the quantities the meat, dairy and fast-food industries might have you ingest.Unless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, theres no reason to cut anything  not butter, ice cream or Porterhouse steak  completely from your diet as long as you mainly eat plant-based food (vegetables, fruits and whole grains), lean animal protein and fish and dont go overboard on foods rich in saturated fats that can cause harm in excess.Thats the conclusion of the best available evidence Ive reviewed for maximising the health of body and brain and enjoying a long life. The unending controversies about a wholesome diet provide much fodder for this column.An extensively researched book by science writer Nina Teicholz (The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet), published in 2014, has raised serious questions about the evidence that nearly 40 years ago prompted the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to recommend that Americans follow a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol to curb what was then a runaway epidemic of heart and other cardiovascular diseases.Those recommendations spawned an outpouring of low-fat and fat-free processed foods that replaced the maligned fats with carbohydrates, primarily sugars and refined starches, which the body treats like sugar.A result: Heart attacks and coronary deaths are way down (thanks largely to the decline in smoking and use of cholesterol-lowering medications along with dietary changes), but obesity and Type 2 diabetes have soared. So what should we do? Cut back on carbs and go back to eating lots of high-fat meats and dairy products? Not if you value your health. The task now is to appreciate the effects that different nutrients have on the body and adopt a rational and enjoyable diet that takes both health benefits and risks into account.Upon reviewing the newest reports, Dr Boris Hansel, a French endocrinologist-nutritionist who specialises in obesity management, wrote in a Medscape commentary: Butter is one of the foods with the highest saturated fat content, and consuming it on a regular basis promotes an increase in blood cholesterol levels.But, he added, It should be considered a pleasure food for those who are fond of it, provided it is consumed in moderate amounts and not consumed in addition to other foods that are high in saturated fatty acids.At the same time, a lot more attention should be paid to the overconsumption of simple and refined carbohydrates  the sugary drinks, desserts, pastries and snacks, as well as white bread, white rice and potatoes  that promote obesity and now threaten to reverse the decades-long decline in cardiovascular disease.Not all fats and not all carbohydrates are created equal, Dr Frank Hu, the senior author of a recent report on saturated fats, told me. The types of fats and carbohydrates are more important than the quantity.Hu is a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and a member of the nations Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that last year recommended a diet lower in red and processed meat, which have been linked to heart disease and cancer.Saturated fat is still bad for heart disease risk, Hu told the Nutrition Action Healthletter, published by the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group.Evidence from studies on thousands of people shows that if you replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, you reduce your risk of heart disease. If you replace saturated fat with refined carbs, you dont reduce your risk. Studies that seem to exonerate saturated fats often fail to compare their effects with the appropriate nutrients, Hu said in an interview.Furthermore, he claims that, heart risk aside, diets low in saturated fats do not prevent premature death have now been refuted by a huge observational study published online in July in JAMA Internal Medicine.With Dr Dong D Wang in Hus department as first author, this study of 83,349 female nurses followed for 32 years and 42,884 male health professionals followed for 26 years found that both total death rates and deaths from specific diseases like heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer and dementia were reduced among those consuming the least amount of saturated and trans fats, replacing them with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.Simply substituting 5% of calories from saturated fats with the equivalent amount of polyunsaturated fats reduced total deaths by 27%, and replacing saturates with monounsaturates (from foods like olive and canola oil, nuts and avocados) reduced deaths by 13%. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish also modestly lowered total mortality, the researchers found.Saturated fatsHowever, when saturated fats were consumed in place of carbohydrates, there was no significant drop in cardiovascular death rates and slightly higher death rates from cancer.Wang and colleagues wrote that this finding was not surprising because the major sources of carbohydrates in a typical Western diet are highly processed foods with large amounts of refined starch and sugar that can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of saturated fats.For the various diseases with death rates linked to diets high in saturated fats, chronic inflammation is believed to be a main underlying cause. Chronic low-grade inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, leading to cholesterol-clogged arteries and setting the stage for heart attacks and strokes. The same process affects arteries in the brain and can result in vascular dementia, a common cause of memory loss.On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet rich in olive oil and nuts but relatively low in saturated fats not only protects the heart but also has been shown to improve cognitive function and may reduce the risk of Alzheimers disease, according to a report from Barcelona last year.Diets rich in red meat and processed meats have repeatedly been linked to an increased risk of developing colon cancer. And an ongoing study of young nurses under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health is exploring evidence that higher intakes of saturated fats (as well as too many simple carbohydrates) can raise the risk of premenopausal breast cancer.All saturated fats are not alike, which is good news for chocolate lovers. Stearic acid, the saturated fat in dark chocolate, does not raise unhealthy cholesterol. And theres room for an occasional indulgence  if you eat healthfully most of the time."

There is one about a few farmers in a nearby village, who sold their land to a corporate and bought the chaar bangle waali car (referring to the Audi logo). Another one concerns a farmer near the Jamnagar district, who sold his land, bought a bike, and even hired a driver to take him around town.If you were willing to listen, farmers in Dholera will tell you more: of those who sold their land for a good price, refurbished their houses and bought shiny new Altos and Scorpios.So why wouldnt they do so too? Because if you lost your land, you would only end up as someones slave. Those who sold their land to the companies are now doing majoori (manual labour) on other peoples farms, or working in factories. The farmer who was once a malik (owner), is now taking a dabba (lunch box) and going to work every day, says Roop Sang Bhai of Sarasla village in Dholera.Labourers work on Togubha Dilubha Chudasma's land holding where they earn Rs 200 per day. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Money cannot be eaten, residents of Sarasla insist. The cars are standing stationary, the bike chauffeurs have turned unaffordable, and the promised jobs either didnt come, or didnt pay well, they lament. Villages nearby are full of those who have been ruined after selling their land to industries. The khet (fields) has always given us enough to eat. So why should we give it away? asks Roop Sang, echoing the sentiment of the group in the Sarasla cotton field.In the 22 villages of Dholera, the site for the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR), its a question that farmers want to pose to the authority in charge of acquiring land for this project.Like the rest of the country, in the town of Dholera too, land has become the flash point of conflict between its owners and the government. But what makes Dholera different  and a test case for alternative models of acquiring land for industry  is the state governments land pooling policy, as opposed to the contentious one on acquisition.Announced in 2007, the ambitious DSIR project was pitched as a global manufacturing and trading hub, with a smart city and an international airport to boot. It is the first industrial node  there are 24 planned along the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor  that was taken up for development. Touted to be PM Narendra Modis pet project (the CM of Gujarat when it was announced) the DSIR didnt see much activity until last year, when the project received a sanction of Rs 2,784 crore from the central government.Watch | Farmers explain the problem in DholeraThe funds, or the lack thereof, however, seem to be not the only hurdle that the project is up against. In December 2015, the state High Court ordered a status quo on land acquisition in the DSIR, in response to a petition by a group of farmers under the aegis of the NGO Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) and a local organization, Bhal Bachao Samiti, who are contesting the governments land pooling policy on grounds that it limits the powers of the Panchayat.Its a conflict that DSIR Development Authority (DSIRDA) planners were only hoping to avoid. With the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act, 2013, turning into the proverbial political hot potato and the messy processes of acquisition leading to a face-off between the owners and the government (or, the corporate) in several projects across the country, the alternative of pooling held much promise, policy experts and planners argued.A Smart City hoarding in Dholera. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Land pooling -- at least on paper -- offers the new module of partnership between the owner and the developer. Here, the owner does not lose his property, as opposed to land acquisition, where the sale of land implies loss of all rights for the original owner.Typically, after acquisition, a change in land use (from agricultural to commercial) leads to a rise in the price of the land, often creating enough ground for discontent and resentment among the original owners. For instance, in places such as Gurgaon and Faridabad, where the state government acquired land and transferred it to private developers, theres widespread discontent among land owners who lament that while the developers made huge gains off the land, the farmers were left with a compensation that was incommensurate with the market price of the property anyway.In pooling, however, the premise is that the owners are willing partners who give up their land, and accrue the benefits of development. After the industries come in, roads, schools and hospitals are built up, the owner gets a portion of their land, the price of which has gone up now. The owner can either sell it, or build something of his own on it. Gujarat has always had a progressive policy of acquisition, where farmers get a share in the benefits of industrial development, says noted economist Yoginder K Alagh.So what went wrong in Dholera? The answer lies in the Gujarat SIR Act, 2009, under which the state government can take 50% of the farmers land without compensation, and return the other half at a different site after readjustment. The logic here is that after development of the site, the price of the farmers land would increase, and he would be a direct beneficiary of it. We are only taking barren land anyway, and also planning to give compensation for the 50% land that we are deducting, a senior official from the DSIRDA says.Bhagwanbhai has sold his land holdings and distributed the proceeds from the sale among his children. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)But farmers in Dholera are far from convinced. The best quality of wheat in the country, the Bhaliya, grows here; if it rains moderately, theres good cotton too. We also grow gram and cumin here. How can they say its barren? says Bhagwanbhai, 65, a resident of Sarasla village.The draft Environmental Impact Assessment report for the DSIR maintains the authoritys position on the fertility of the land in the region -- about 40% of land in Dholera is classified asagricultural fallow land, and only 7% is crop land, the report states.However, activists such as Sagar Rabari of GKS refute this claim: More than 60% of land in Dholera is fertile. Agricultural yield in the region amounts to 600-700 kg wheat per acre, and 400-500 per acre in cotton. Here, agriculture is still a profitable enterprise, he insists.Sagar Rabari of Khedut Samaj  Gujarat talks about farmer issues in Ahmedabad. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Farmers in the region second his opinion, and add that if the state government resolved the water scarcity issue, they could plan multiple crops on the same land and enhance their yield by two-fold. The fact that there has been a delay in making that a possibility the delay in the completion of the canal network that will deliver the waters of the Narmada to their fields  is also being perceived by the farmers as a ploy by the government to ensure that they would not hold on to their land.Resistance to the project is further complicated by the mess of land records in the region, an issue that plagues several regions in the country. Take the case of Faljibhai Nagjibhai Bauliya , 38, of Haibatpur village, who claims to have 96 acres of land, of which not even one half is finds mention in the computerised land records of the area.On a crisp cotton sheet spread on a wooden cot in his home in the village of Haibatpur, Faljibhai spreads out a stack of sepia-toned documents to substantiate his claim: land that his father received from the state in 1968 is still not in the computerised land records of the village.The talathi (village revenue secretary) wouldnt do it until we paid up, says Faljibhai.The mess of records can be traced to land reforms in the state, where landless families such as those of Faljibhais father received land under several schemes such as the Land Ceiling Act, the state tenancy law and the central governments Santhani scheme (where government wastelands were redistributed to the landless), explains GKS Sagar.However, he explains that the names of the new owners never made it to the records because of illiteracy, fragmentation of landholdings through the years and corrupt officials.Now, with the DSIRDA planning to take their land for the project, farmers such as Faljibhai are only left wondering how the planners would allot them their rightful share of land after deduction.Armed with information on the SIR Act by NGOs such as GKS, those such as Faljibhai argue that the policy doesnt seem to be working in their favour.For instance, Dholeras farmers argue that shifting to a new plot would imply fresh investments be made on farm infrastructure such as tubewells, and brings with it the question of viability of agriculture in a new place. Some villagers from nearby areas have told us that the new plots for us are being craved out of the saline area near the sea. We are not even educated enough to do much else; if agriculture fails, what are we going to do? asks Faljibhai.The fear of being given fallow and saline plots is predominant among the farmers of Dholera, who trace it to the emergence of real estate brokers in the area. These brokers deal in the sale and purchase of land, often a murky process involving the rich and powerful in the region, and beyond.Faljibhai shows documents of his land which are not acknowledged in the computer records of the authorities. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)It is in this trade and its underlying skewed power equations that farmers such as Faljibhai feel they might lose out. Playing in real estate is not for farmers like us; its for the dalaals (middlemen), he says.Land pooling as a scheme rests on the logic that owners can become entrepreneurs in their own right, but residents of Dholera point to the clause in the SIR Act stating that aside of the development charge that they would have to pay on the new plot, they would need permission from the authority to build something. The new plots that would be given to the farmers would be in specific zones such as IT, entertainment, recreation sports, and if the farmer wanted to build a structure that didnt fall in the zone of his new plot, he would need permission from the development authority.The official from the DSIRDA told HT that in light of the resistance to the project, the authority is willing to negotiate with the farmers and even pay compensation in the lieu of the land deducted to address their concerns: This project will increase job opportunities for the locals, and ensure that they benefit from the development of the region.But in the cotton fields of Sarasla, farmers say that for them, development implied better irrigation facilities for a robust yield.  We dont want the industries at the cost of our livelihood. We will resist this acquisition of our land. Jaan de denge par zameen nahi (we will give up our lives, but not the land), says Roop Sang, as the group standing in his cotton field nods in agreement.But Bhagwanbhai, who is landless now and depends on the trade in cattle feed procured from the fields, stops to correct them: Jaan bhi mat do, aur zameen bhi mat do (Dont give your lives, or your land), he tells them."

Pictures by Amit Datta Singur, Aug. 31: Ranju Malik, who says she could be 85, is the matriarch who presides over a family of nine spread over four generations and almost nothing else. This afternoon, with only a few minutes to go before the Supreme Court's judgment, the family, residents of Khaserbheri village in Singur, gathers desultorily in the narrow front passage of their one-storey home that leads to two rooms inside. Ranju, seated on a plastic chair, says she will speak. Her grandson's wife Rita Shee, a pretty young woman, and Rita's two sons, Rajesh, 18, and Rakesh, 17, stand near her. ""We had about 1.5 to 2 bighas,"" says Ranju. ""We lost everything to the factory."" Ranju's family was one of the onichhuk (unwilling) farmers whose land was forcibly taken away for the Tata's proposed Nano factory and who did not accept compensation. Mamata Banerjee had given their anger the shape of the Singur movement. But neither Ranju, nor any member of her family shows much interest in the verdict that is imminent. Because they seem crushed still by the impact of what happened after the Tata takeover. ""We did not have to buy rice and vegetables, including potatoes, as we got them from our fields, and sold the surplus,"" says Ranju, whose husband and two sons were farmers. Her husband also worked at a jute mill in Serampore. Then suddenly the land was taken away. Everything collapsed. ""My husband fell ill,"" says Ranju. ""The only thing he would say was jomi, jomi, jomi (land). He developed cancer. It was because of this,"" says Ranju, tears rolling down her wrinkled face. Her sons' lives changed. From farmers, they became daily labourers. Her grandson's sons, Rajesh and Rakesh, stopped going to school. Rajesh is working as a carpenter's apprentice and Rakesh is looking for similar work, getting about Rs 500 to Rs 700 every week. Their sister, Sumana, is a student of Class IX. She has been able to continue her studies to a great extent because of the bicycle given by ""Didi"", Mamata Banerjee. ""It is thanks to Didi that we have been able to live,"" says Rita, referring to the 16kg rice and Rs 2,000 allotted as compensation by the state to the ""victims"" of the acquisition. The family only switches on the TV in a room inside after some prodding. As the news breaks with the historic judgment, the family sits motionless. Rita smiles faintly when she hears the family will get the land back. ""We will wait,"" she says. Outside, the rejoicing with green abir is about to start."

Official figures released by the central water commission (CWC) said the water level was dipping by a centimetre every hour at both Digha Ghat and Gandhi Ghat. On Monday morning, the water level at Digha Ghat was 51.77m. and had dipped to 5.19m at 3pm. The danger level is 50.45m at Digha Ghat and 48.60 m at Gandhi Ghat. But the CWC official also said the water level would rise at places like Buxar, Munger, Kahelgaon, Sahebganj and Farakka on Tuesday. An official said because of the rise in Ganga level in Khagaria district, water rose over a 4km stretch of the embankment, damaging it at two places. Engineers have been rushed for repairs. Other rivers flowing above the danger level include Punpun, Ghaghara, Budhi Gandak and Kosi. Special secretary of disaster management department Anirudh Kumar said 1,39,330 people have been evacuated. He said 162 relief camps are being run in flood-affected districts, where 1,05,000 people are taking shelter. Anirudh said adequate number of state disaster response force (SDRF) and national disaster response force (NDRF) teams have been deputed to the flood-affected areas to rescue people. The CWC official said water discharge from the Indrapuri barrage over the Sone increased from 2.5 lakh cusec at 6am to 3.8 lakh cusec at 2pm. With the riverine locality flooded, many have come to Patna in search of relief. The district administration is trying to provide them and their cattle food and shelter. However, The Telegraph saw a contrast when it visited two relief camps being run by the district administration. One such relief camp is at the Bihar Vidyapeeth campus where over 500 people are staying after water entered their houses. Rice-dal and mixed vegetable (potato and soyabean) was being served to inmates of the relief camp being monitored by Patna Sadar executive magistrate Rajeev Mohan Sahay and deputy collector Atul Verma. Bind Toli resident Umesh Choudhary (32) praised the district administration for providing them food and shelter. ""Yesterday we were served khichdi and today we are getting dal, rice and vegetable,"" Choudhary said. ""Many more people are on the way. Our area is badly affected, water has damaged my house too."" People in the relief camps also demanded that the administration allow them to take the beaten rice and jaggery given to them for distribution among people. But the official said the relief material would be given only at the camp and those who receive will not be allowed to carry it outside. A medical team was also deputed at the relief camp and arrangement to provide important medicines made. But the condition at another relief camp at B.N. Collegiate Inter School, 4 km from the Bihar Vidyapeeth campus, was a study in contrast. Around 2pm, cooking was yet to start and no arrangements had been made, even though the district magistrate had announced measures on Sunday. Cows, buffaloes, calves and goats are scattered at the camp. Complete mismanagement was evident camp and people complained that they were not getting food. ""The authorities brought us here last (Sunday) evening, but they didn't provide us food, but for some beaten rice and jaggery. We want dal and rice, but the process of cooking is yet to start,"" said Ram Janam Mahto, an inmate at the relief camp. A veterinary doctor was also there at the school premises. The Patna civil surgeon's office on Monday formed two more mobile medical units in the district in addition to 24 units already working. ""Each team is equipped with a doctor, an auxiliary nurse midwife and medicines,"" said Patna civil surgeon G.S. Singh. The teams were also providing aid in the various relief camps.

It is late afternoon and customers are already arriving. He is a prosperous man, compared to the Singur average, with a spacious concrete house, shining white in the sun. A fridge stands at one end of the long verandah. Sacks of potatoes lie on the floor, as do coils of golden jute. He buys them from farmers and sells them in the market. He has been made more prosperous by the Supreme Court judgment. But it was the Tata's land acquisition that made him prosperous in the first place. Ali, 62, a thin, wiry man, owned about a bigha and 6 cottahs land with his siblings. A CPM sympathiser, he had convinced his two brothers and three sisters to sell the land to the Tatas. He got Rs 84,000 for it. But he and his friends, soon after the land was acquired, started a ""syndicate"", a word that resonates differently these days, to supply construction materials. It proved very lucrative. ""In the two years that the factory was being set up, between 2006 and 2008, I made about Rs 4 lakh,"" says Ali. His mudhouse became the shining white house. His two elder daughters were married off well; he is now looking for a groom for his youngest daughter, Shoukina Khatun, a smiling girl who has just been taken off school. ""Marriage is the destiny for Muslim girls because we don't get jobs,"" says Nasima Begum, her mother, in a matter-of-fact way. ""I had reasoned that I would earn more if I sold my land off. I was right,"" says Ali. ""It would create more jobs here and more business than anyone could think of."" He had dreams for his son. But after trouble started, his son went away to Uttarakhand to start his own jewellery shop. ""It is good that we are getting our land back,"" says Ali. ""I am happy because we will get our land back, but I am happier because I think now that compensation will stop,"" adds Nasima. She is referring to Mamata Banerjee's compensation to the khet majurs (farm labourers), who did not own land, and did not work, but get Rs 2,000 and 16kg rice every month. Ali looks at another possibility. ""The land taken over by the factory is no longer irrigable. Roads, bridges, drains have been built. I still think a factory is a better idea."""
58ff1d987be9e0420db2cdc4,Anandi misses list,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/nation/story_103098.jsp,2016-08-18,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Aug. 17: Anandiben Patel today remained a former chief minister. The anticipated ""recompense"" in the form of a Raj Bhavan posting did not come. The former Gujarat chief minister, who demitted office early this month, did not figure among the quartet appointed as governors today, with BJP sources hinting at several reasons for her absence from the list. The four who made it are Najma Heptullah, a former Union minister who has been assigned Manipur; V.P. Singh Badnore, a former Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan who goes to Punjab; Banwarilal Purohit, a former BJP MP from Nagpur and owner of the multi-edition newspaper The Hitavada, who moves to Assam; and Jagdish Mukhi, a Delhi BJP leader who will take charge in Andaman and Nicobar as lieutenant governor. Mukhi, a former professor, had aspired to be projected as the BJP's chief minister candidate in the last Delhi elections but was beaten to it by Kiran Bedi, who has since moved to Puducherry as the Union territory's lieutenant governor. After Anandiben left office as Gujarat's chief minister, BJP circles had expected her to be ""recompensed"" with a gubernatorial post. Sources said there were three reasons why she was not on the list. One, Anandiben had ""refused"" to leave Gujarat that votes in December 2017. She had publicly said so just before resigning as chief minister. A Gujarat BJP source, who made it clear that he was not aligned either with Anandiben or her adversary, party president Amit Shah, claimed the former chief minister was ""lobbying"" for her daughter Anar's induction into the party ""in lieu"" of her forfeiting her post. Anar, who describes herself as a ""social worker"" and an ""entrepreneur"", is alleged to have used the clout she derived from her mother's position to help her business associates set up a company on land near the Gir lion sanctuary, purportedly in contravention of established rules. The case, highlighted in sections of the media, became a hot potato for the BJP after the Congress gunned for Anandiben. It was believed to have precipitated her exit. ""In these circumstances, there is no way that Shah or the Prime Minister will facilitate Anar's entry into the BJP,"" the source said. Although Anandiben is considered a close political associate of Narendra Modi, sources said the Prime Minister had apparently taken a ""grim"" view of the Anar controversy. Since her departure, Anandiben, not exactly known to court publicity, has reportedly kept herself in the news. On August 15, she hoisted the flag at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's headquarters. Tomorrow, on ""Rakshabandhan"", she is scheduled to host a get-together at a school in her Assembly constituency, Ghatlodiya, in Ahmedabad. Two, Anandiben would have to resign as an MLA if she becomes a governor. A by-election will have to be held in her constituency within six months. Sources said the BJP fears that if it loses Ghatlodiya or even retains it by a margin lower than what Anandiben had secured in 2012, it could scale down the morale of party cadres in the run-up to the state polls. Three, the governors of two large states, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, are due to retire by end-August. Both K. Rosaiah (Tamil Nadu) and Ram Naresh Yadav (Madhya Pradesh) were appointed in 2011 by the then UPA government. Sources said it was ""possible"" Anandiben might be sent to one of these states, after BJP leaders take into account the political factors, especially the by-election and the fear that her seat might go to the Opposition."
58ff1e3f7be9e0420db2cea9,Difficult episodes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160910/jsp/opinion/story_107250.jsp,2016-09-10,,Telegraph,"""What's done cannot be undone,"" mutters Lady Macbeth in her sleep, maddened by the fact that she would never be able to wash the blood of murder off her hands. Tragedy leaves no room for apology or amends. But history is different, as some would like to think, though in the face of some scepticism. Georgetown University in the United States of America has recently apologized to the descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold to pay off the university's debts less than three centuries ago. Being a Catholic institution, it would atone for its sins not only by acknowledgement and apology but also by a series of measures. These would include naming a building after one of the men who were sold and giving preferential treatment for admissions to descendants of those who were enslaved. This is unprecedented in academia. More than a dozen American universities, including Harvard and Brown, have publicly recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. It is no secret that the Codrington Library of All Souls College in Oxford was built with the endowment of a fellow who wanted his plantations in the West Indies to be kept ""intire"" with ""at least three hundred negroes to work the land"". If not slavery, then colonialism and apartheid are inextricable from the history of Cecil Rhodes, on whose munificence a great deal of the glories of Oxford stands, generously partaken of by postcolonial - including Indian - Rhodes Scholars to this day. The historically pragmatic approach to the problem of apologies and amends is to ask in a commonsensical tone, ""So, where does one draw the line?"" Once the whole of the white world begins to return to the rest of the planet the booty of imperialism, what would be left of the lands and riches of Western civilization? Think not only of the United Kingdom, but also of modern America and the nations Down Under. Germany is paying to this day for the sins of its 20th-century atrocities, for who can say that behind Angela Merkel's controversial hospitality towards migrants from the East there isn't working the guilt of the Holocaust taken on from her ancestors? And this crime, in turn, puts a nation like Israel in a difficult spot with millions of killed and displaced Palestinians. Perhaps this is why most of such apologies made in the modern world remain - unlike the one offered by Georgetown University - rhetorical or symbolic gestures, confined to formal public utterances: Tony Blair to Ireland for the Potato Famine of the 1840s, Japan to the Koreans for its wartime ""comfort women"", or Canada to the descendants of the Sikhs aboard the Komagata Maru. Perhaps Elizabeth II, with her characteristically Windsor hard-headedness, did it right at Jallianwala Bagh, 50 years after Independence.

58ff20087be9e0420db2d116,Willing to sell now,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160907/jsp/bengal/story_106766.jsp,2016-09-07,,Telegraph,"Singur farmers Sanjoy Kumar Dey, Jamini Karmakar. (Pradip Sanyal) Singur, Sept. 6: Sanjoy Kumar Dey has had a change of heart, but it has taken a decade. Dey, a farmer in Singur's Gopalnagar, had fiercely resisted attempts by the government to acquire his two bighas for the Tata Nano project. Although many of his neighbours had accepted compensation, the 55-year-old farmer had held on in the face of alleged police torture and threats. A decade later, Dey, one of Singur's ""unwilling"" farmers, plans to sell his land for a ""good price"" once it is returned to him. Many of Singur's unwilling farmers, who had been the foot soldiers of Mamata Banerjee's anti-land acquisition agitation, feel the same. Dey said he was no longer sure whether his plot, tucked in one corner of the project area behind huge factory sheds, would be cultivatable again. A mixture of bricks, mortar, iron and stone chips may have changed the texture of the soil that once used to yield a rich harvest of paddy, potatoes and jute, he said. ""We need money,"" Dey said as he walked around the heavily guarded main entrance gate of the abandoned Tata Motors project site. ""Mamata (his wife) and I have endured a lot of pain to survive after our land was taken over. Now, we run a small roadside eatery."" ""If we get a good price, we might sell the land to a realtor or a developer. But first, let's get back the land,"" Dey said. As the initial burst of euphoria in the aftermath of the Supreme Court order on the return of the Singur land wore off, many landlosers are waking up to realities and are considering selling their land. A bachelor in his fifties, Jamini Karmarkar of Berabari, who jointly owned five bighas with his two brothers, is in the throes of a dilemma. Age has caught up with him, Karmakar said, and he was not certain whether he or his nephews would return to farming. Karmakar and his family, who used to cultivate paddy and potatoes, now run eateries and grocery stores. In Singherbheri, Beraberi and Gopalnagar, many farmers are thinking whether selling their land once it is returned would be a better idea than resuming cultivation. First, most are not sure whether the new generation in Singur would like to return to farming. Second, the rise in the prices of fertilisers, seeds and diesel used in pumps have eaten into farmers' income. Third, the character of the land has changed because stone chips, concrete and sand have been mixed with it and construction has been done, rendering the plots unfit for cultivation. Although the government has said it will return cultivable land, doubts remain. Fourth, the government will have to set up submersible pumps and deep tube-wells to ensure water is available for farming. ""Would the government spend so much on building infrastructure?"" asked Joydeb Ghosh of Gopalnagar. ""The land has been lying unused for over 10 years now."""
58ff21367be9e0420db2d2b7,Full-body scanner to be tried out,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160911/jsp/nation/story_107587.jsp,2016-09-11,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Centre plans to introduce full-body scanners at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport ""on a trial basis"", with officials hastening to clarify that the machines would be withdrawn if passengers object. Full-body scanners, used routinely in Western airports, hold a key advantage over the metal detectors that India uses: the ability to see under people's clothing and detect hidden non-metal objects such as plastic explosives too. But they also display a chalk-like outline of the passenger's body on a screen, which the government fears can raise serious privacy and cultural issues in India - and which Shah Rukh Khan once joked can embarrass those ""not well endowed"". ""The scans won't be mandatory. We need to first gauge the move's acceptability among passengers as it may hurt Indian sensibilities,"" a home ministry official told The Telegraph. ""Ours is a very conservative nation; we must tread with extreme caution."" A similar experiment had flopped five years ago when the government had installed four full-body scanners at IGI Airport after the January 2011 airport bombing in Moscow. ""But the passengers protested vehemently. Even the jawans behind the machines were visibly embarrassed,"" said a senior official of the CISF, which mans airport security across India. The experiment didn't survive two weeks. This time, sources said, the government will launch an awareness campaign through TV and newspaper ads before introducing the measure, perhaps in November. Most Western airports do take steps to protect passengers' privacy by modifying the computer programs to ensure the images cannot be saved, stored, printed or transmitted. Usually, the other passengers and the security personnel doing the scanning cannot see the screen display, visible only to an operator in a separate room - with the passenger's face blocked out. Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials have long been demanding full-body scanners but the Centre has preferred to avoid what can be a political hot potato. ""At a recent meeting, both IB and CISF officials wanted body scanners at IGI Airport on a trial basis. If it works, they will be installed at airports across the country but if there's a controversy or protests, we'll block the proposal,"" the ministry official said. A body scan is as good as a strip search but without actual removal of the clothes, and is much faster, an IB official said. America installed body scanners after a Nigerian passenger was detected wearing an ""underwear bomb"" at Detroit airport in 2009.# Passengers now go through a two-step security check at India's airports: passage through a metal-detector doorframe and manual frisking with a handheld device, with a possible pat-down if there's any suspicion. ""Body scanners reduce queues by cutting down the frisking time and also improve security by scanning through clothing,"" said an IB official. Some CISF officials said that even if body scans are not made mandatory, they should be allowed in cases where security personnel become suspicious during frisking. In 2010, Shah Rukh Khan had jokingly alleged that staff at London's Heathrow airport had printed and circulated his naked image from a body scanner, and that he had even autographed them. British airport authorities took the remark seriously enough to issue a formal rebuttal. SRK had also joked in a BBC interview that the ""new machines, body scanners... it makes you embarrassed if you are not well endowed"". Full-body scanners have also raised questions of radiation safety but the US Food and Drug Administration says: ""A person would have to be screened more than a thousand times in one year in order to exceed the annual radiation dose limit for people screening that has been set by expert radiation safety organisations."""

Picture by Partha Banerjee Burdwan, Nov. 1: A private tutor and his seven-year-old son were killed when the bike they were riding to a relative's home for Bhai Phonta collided with a truck in Burdwan this morning. Soumen Chatterjee, a resident of Burdwan town, was around 15 minutes away from his sister's house in Jamalpur when his bike hit the truck. The 44-year-old tutor and his son Abhigyan were killed on the spot while the rear tyres of the truck ran over the legs of Soumen's wife. All three were wearing helmets but they came off in the impact of the crash. The accident happened around 9.30am when Soumen was riding down the approach road to the Karalaghat bridge across the Damodar river. The truck, laden with potato seeds, was coming from the opposite direction. Farmer Sheikh Kalam, who was working in a nearby field, said: ""The truck had accelerated as it was moving up the slope of the road. It looked like the driver lost control and the vehicle collided with the bike."" A police officer said: ""The riders were thrown off the motorcycle. Soumen and his son suffered head injuries after hitting the road while the rear tyres of the truck ran over Soumen's wife Mahua's legs."" Alerted by Mahua's screams for help, local people rushed her to Jamalpur block hospital. She was referred to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. The driver and the cleaner of the truck fled the spot, leaving behind the vehicle. Soumen's sister Rekha Chakraborty, a homemaker in her fifties, wouldn't stop crying. ""I was waiting for my brother to come and take Bhai Phonta from me. But I can't believe that I, being the elder sister, could not protect him on Bhai Phonta,"" she sobbed. Doctors in the emergency ward of the Burdwan hospital said Mahua's left leg was broken completely. ""The condition of her right leg is relatively less serious. We will do a CT scan of her brain as she has also complained of headache,"" a doctor said. A police officer in Jamalpur said: ""We are looking for the driver and the cleaner of the truck. The truck has already been seized."""
58ff21c47be9e0420db2d37c,Great Brexit bake off,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161018/jsp/opinion/story_113956.jsp,2016-10-18,,Telegraph,"Well, well, the pound sterling is crashing. Nobody knows what the Brexit plan is and all is uncertainty and worse to come. Nobody really knows how to start making a plan that is anything more than a statement of intentions. Whatever sort of Brexit we think or hope we are going to get actually depends on all the other countries in the European Union. Why on earth should they bother what happens to the rat leaving the ship that may or may not sink quicker as a result? We must all have said almost everything it is possible to say pro or anti Brexit and as regards our low or high expectations of a solitary future, but none of it is quite real. We simply do not know what is going to happen. All we do know is that each side, and the sides are consolidating rather than receding, is getting increasingly angry. The hard-line Brexiteers keep crowing while those manufacturers of any nationality that remain on these shores, businesses large and small, banks and every sort of financial institution are more quietly engaged in damage limitation. Our newspapers have lined up more determinedly than usual to Right or Left, British success or British damnation, and it is possible to read the same event, speech or statement at the same time with two completely opposite conclusions. If need be two different interviewees from the same institution, the Bank of England even, can be spun to have given entirely different opinions. We are all in limbo. It is as if we had been hit by a natural disaster that could have been avoided and are now clearing up the chaos that we never should have had and that is only going to get worse. Even those who genuinely believe we will be better off in the end know and say that it is going to get worse before it gets better. I have a feeling that might be well after I am dead and gone. What on earth are we doing? Leaving the next generation to pick up the pieces? Few of them are seduced by the political life. Ordinary MPs have no power. Even ministers have very little. It is quite hard to know who really calls the shots although Theresa May could yet out-Thatcher Thatcher. The Iron Lady Mark II or just making noises, so we think she might know what she is doing? The executive led by her is fighting against a parliamentary vote on whatever the Brexit plan may turn out to be. That is frankly quite odd when we are theoretically still a parliamentary democracy. It now seems that Parliament is constantly to be bypassed. You either go direct to the country via a referendum, the result of which fewer people now want than they thought at the time. Or, the executive makes all the decisions. Our parliamentary representatives don't count for anything and are no longer able or allowed to represent us. The only people who might yet shoot themselves in the foot worse than we have are the Americans if they vote Donald Trump into the White House. Thank God he is doing an ever better job of talking any sensible American out of that disastrous step but, as we have discovered here, there is no accounting for the lunatic fringe. I suppose the presidential election has become so bizarre that it is at least providing the US with reality viewing as compellingly ghastly as the O.J. Simpson trial. Here we have settled in for utterly mindless but harmless pleasures to take our minds off worse outside. There has been a huge drama over the selling of a programme, probably unknown elsewhere, called the Great British Bake Off. Filmed here during the spring and summer in an enormous tent in the garden of a historic house, various baking challenges are given each week to the group of competitors. It is all amazingly British as the rain lashes down outside and our favourite national treasure of the moment, cook Mary Berry, aged 81, judges the various cakes, breads, tarts and so-called showstoppers. These are remarkable confections meant to show off the participants' imaginations and skills to the nth degree and usually involve some fairly peculiar sounding ingredients. The least successful competitor each week is eliminated until, after about 12 weeks of floury excitement, the winner is decided. Now, shock and horror, the makers of the programme have sold it away from the BBC to a commercial channel for large amounts of money. Whether or not we hate the BBC half the time, we still apparently want it to be the platform for the programmes we love best - we are clearly fearfully conflicted in this country about everything. Now the beloved Mary and almost equally loved co-presenters, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc (believe me, these are names to bandy about here), have announced that they will not go elsewhere. This has left bad cop judge, Paul Hollywood, previously unknown, blue eyed, bearded, baker extraordinaire, to go forth from the BBC on his own and we hope for nothing but disaster for him and any revamped baking programme he appears in henceforth. Emotional stuff, you understand, and so much safer than anything happening in Westminster, in Europe, or anywhere that doesn't include a good level of comforting schmaltz. More of the same sort of thing cheers us up, courtesy of Strictly Come Dancing, yet another unlikely TV competition. Various stars of stage, screen, even politics, are paired up with professional dancers to compete weekly in front of a team of judges. The judges include our greatest living former ballerina, Darcey Bussell, who must think she has arrived in an alternative universe, and three men who veer from flamboyantly insulting to terribly nice in their judgements. Weekly eliminations are again the order of the competition amid an explosion of glitter, fake tan and gleaming crocodile smiles. It is all good clean fun even when there are tears and flying sequins. This season, the competitors include former shadow chancellor of the exchequer, Ed Balls, not the first politician or ex-politician to take part, but perhaps the most surprising. Ooh and everyone loves Ed now. Strictly certainly seems to be the way to become Mr Nice Guy and the nation's favourite, barring Mary Berry. It must be a nice change from the political mayhem although there has been controversy over Ed's determination not to turn himself the expected shade of glowing orange with the spray-on tan. As the nights get colder and darker, we are blessed with other television excitements to take our minds off worse outside. We have Cornish drama with Poldark involving wrecks, mines and extremely glamorous leading actors. There will be other excitements in the lead-up to Christmas specials and then a little something or two in the way of dramatic series to get us through winter weeks and weekends. After endless disputes over BBC licence fees, they may shortly be one of the few things we can afford. The giant supermarket company, Tesco, has let it be known that supplies of Marmite were running low due to the company's determination not to pay the higher prices demanded by the suppliers after the fall in sterling. Fuel prices are set to rise for the same reason. It looks like it will be one of those grim winters when people wonder whether to have heating or buy the luxury marmite or even the basic potatoes. Let's hope that they keep Strictly going and find a few other feel-good TV programmes, so that we have something to look forward to as we sit wrapped in blankets over our baked beans on toast - if we can still afford them when the pound settles further into the bottomless pit we have dug for ourselves."

58ff220a7be9e0420db2d3e9,Singur topsoil search,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161019/jsp/bengal/story_114326.jsp,2016-10-19,,Telegraph,"Calcutta, Oct. 18: The Mamata Banerjee government has launched a search for topsoil - the uppermost fertile layer on arable land - to fill up excavated areas of the abandoned Tata factory in Singur. Work in progress at the abandoned Tata plant site in Singur to return land to farmers ""The district magistrate of Hooghly has been asked to find out if the excavated areas can be filled up with topsoil from somewhere else so that the farmers can start cultivation as soon as the plots are handed over to them. The DM will see if such soil can be made available from nearby areas. If not, he can seek the help of other DMs,"" a government official said. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by the chief minister at Nabanna yesterday, sources said. Government officials had said that 35 per cent of the total 997.11 acres had suffered topsoil loss because it was dug up to make a drainage system, water bodies and to lay roads. According to analysts who had tested samples of the factory soil, cultivation is possible in areas where there has been no construction. The chief minister had yesterday announced that the government would hand over possession of the land to farmers from Thursday. ""Till now, 80 per cent of the land is cultivable.... The government is working to make the other portion arable too,"" she had said. Officials said arranging for topsoil from other areas could prove to be difficult because no farmer would allow the most fertile layer of his plot to be taken away. The top eight inches on any plot is called the topsoil. This part contains organic matter and micro-organisms. ""Taking away the topsoil damages the productivity of any land. As Hooghly is rich in agriculture, the DM might find it difficult to find farmers who would agree to give away the topsoil of the plot,"" an official said. Scientists in the agriculture department said it would better if the government tells the farmers, who own plots where construction has been done, to wait for a few years before starting cultivation. ""These farmers could be given compensation until their plots acquire the fertility,"" a scientist said. A minister told this paper that the government could look for topsoil in coastal areas. But scientists pointed out that as the soil in coastal areas was saline, it would facilitate the growth of only specific crops such as coconuts and cashewnuts. ""Farmers in Singur would look to cultivate paddy and potato that they have been growing traditionally. But soil brought from coastal areas would not be good for such crops,"" a scientist said."
58ff225b7be9e0420db2d45b,Peanut skin benefits for milk chocolate,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161101/jsp/nation/story_116775.jsp,2016-11-01,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Oct. 31: Call it a sweet waste-to-health trick. Scientists have shown that peanut skin extracts, an agricultural waste, may be used to inject some of the nutritional benefits of dark chocolate into milk chocolate without affecting its taste. Food science specialists at the North Carolina State University in the US have extracted biologically-friendly phenolic compounds from peanut skins, encapsulated them into an edible powder from starchy food such as potatoes or rice, and incorporated them into milk chocolate. An abundance of evidence accumulating over the past two decades has suggested that dark chocolate through its poly-phenolic constituents is beneficial for health, but some people share an aversion to its extra bitter taste. Lisa Oehrl Dean and her colleagues investigated peanut extracts as a novel source of antioxidants to enrich milk chocolate. They encapsulated the peanut skin extracts into a starch-sourced substance called maltodextrin to lessen their bitterness and determined through chemical analysis the amount to be added to milk chocolate. The scientists compared the enriched milk chocolate with unaltered milk chocolate on 80 volunteers and found that both were equally well liked. ""Consumers found the antioxidant fortified milk chocolate to have acceptable flavour,"" the researchers said, describing their findings in the Journal of Food Science. ""If applied to commercial products, peanut skin extracts would allow consumers to enjoy mild tasting products and have exposure to compounds that have proven health benefits,"" Dean said in a statement issued through the US-based Institute of Food Technologists. Several research studies have indicated that antioxidants in dark chocolate may protect people from high blood pressure among other health disorders. Studies by Luc Djousse and his colleagues at the Harvard Medical School have found an overall drop in blood pressure among people who eat more chocolate. A University of San Diego research team had reported in September this year that dark chocolate can improve the exercise capacity of sedentary people. And scientists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, had earlier this year independently presented study findings that indicated that dark chocolate with 70 per cent cocoa solid appeared to improve spatial memory in laboratory rats serving as models for Alzheimer's disease. However, a US National Institutes of Health newsletter cautioned five years ago that despite the evidence in favour of chocolate and biological mechanisms to explain why chocolate is health-friendly, processed chocolate contains other ingredients and the amount consumed could influence health impacts. ""Controlling how much chocolate people eat and tracking them for long periods of time is not an easy task,"" it said, adding some health tips for people who already consume chocolate. ""Eat ask dark a chocolate as you can, avoid, white and milk chocolates, make hot chocolate as unsweetened cocoa, and watch your total calories."" Nutrition specialists also point out that chocolate, even dark chocolate, is laden with calories and consuming too much chocolate could negatively compensate for any benefits from its ingredients."

""She is not letting anyone near the baby and is getting nervous at the hint of strangers."" Rohini with her baby at the zoo on Monday Even the vet and officials have seen the two from a distance. Which is why the foal's gender is still unknown. It will happen only after the mother settles down, a zoo official said. A separate enclosure has been carved out of space allotted for zebras for Rohini and the baby. The official said the baby would be kept under observation for about a fortnight before visitors can see it. The zoo authorities were extremely cautious as a foal had died in 2014. Attendants were posted 24X7 outside Rohini's enclosure and the vet regularly checked on her, the official said. A little after midnight, Rohini became restless and whinnied. Around 1am, the striped bundle of joy made its entry to the world, taking the zebra count in the zoo to six. Of the six, four are adult, including a male. All of them were brought from Israel. In 2014, a zebra had given birth to two foals, of which one had died. The baby has had only mother's milk. And the mother is on a diet of carrots, sweet potatoes and grass, along with calcium and vitamin supplements. A keeper said the other zebras kept flocking near the gate of the enclosure where Rohini and the baby had been kept throughout the day. ""It is like neighbours visiting to meet a newborn,"" he said."

The first words of district magistrate (DM) Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on his arrival at the Patna Law College relief camp left little to imagination. The Telegraph, in its edition dated August 26, had reported about watery dal and vegetable curry being served to flood victims at BN Collegiate School relief camp. The DM is scheduled to visit BN Collegiate School camp on Sunday The people had just started eating their lunch when Agarwal had reached in the camp during the inspection to check the quality of food being served to flood victims. Though it was not the same relief camp, the mission was to check the quality of food. Agarwal also tasted it in front of the flood-hit people. Agarwal asked the volunteers serving the food to bring what the flood victims were served -rice, dal and mixed vegetable curry (potato and brinjal). ""Show me the dal bucket. Yes, this is thick,"" exclaimed Agarwal, before lunch was served to him on a steel plate. While eating the meal, he asked a child standing in front of him whether he had food or not.

(File Photo)In a bid to connect with North Indian voters ahead of BMC elections slated next year, ruling BJP has organised a public dinner with a traditional menu at suburban Goregaon on September 2 which will be attended by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. BJP city unit, which has organised the function, said 5,000 invitations have been sent out for the function, to be held in the western suburb.We are elated to announce that our chief minister would be having quality time with the people of North India over Baati-Chokha wherein he would interact with the intellectuals as well as commoners invited from all walks of life, BJP city unit president Ashish Shelar said on Thursday. He said Fadnavis will be first such CM who wanted to connect with commoners over a dinner with their traditional food.While baati consists of wheat and sattu (powdered roasted blackgrams) formed into balls with spices, and then dipped in ghee (clarified butter) chokha is a dip prepared by mashing boiled potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant together with some spices. It is no surprise that the BJP is aggressively trying to woo Uttar Bhartiyas as they form 28 per cent vote share in countrys financial capital. The outreach has another objective with forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, due next year.BMC has been ruled by Shiv Sena, which plays its agenda of sons-of-soil vs outsiders, with the BJP as a junior partner for over two decades. On the choice of venue, as Shiv Sena recently held a function to mark its golden jubilee at the same spot, Shelar said, We are organising this programme at same place where one party had recently celebrated its 50 years without connecting with the commoner, but our case it different. Our all top leaders of state, including Fadnavis ji, would have a direct interaction with the invitees.Mumbai BJP general secretary Amarjeet Mishra, who often organises such functions for North Indians, said, the work that chief minister of Uttar Pradesh didnt and couldnt do here in Mumbai (to connect with the North Indians), is being done by Devendraji.Mishra, who recently organised a music festival dedicated to Kajri form of singing which is popular in Northern belt, said, Our CM is connecting with North Indians very fast and this was very much visible when he instantly donned gamachha during a programme when he came to know that it was a typical a traditional cotton towel used in North India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo) The Dalits who have relocated to Sodapur. (Express Photo)Priyanka Meghwa was in Class X when she was forced to give up school in her village in Ghada. At her new home 15 km away, with nothing much to do, the 15-year-old spends time watching television. Ghar Ki Lakshmi Betiyaan, a soap celebrating daughters, and Sapne Suhane Ladakpan Ke are her favourite shows, she says.Two years ago, Priyankas family was among the 27 Dalit families who were forced to move to Sodapur from Ghada, both villages in the Deesa taluka of Banaskantha, the potato capital of Gujarat. All of them victims of untouchability, now refugees in their own state, which saw Dalit anger boiling over last month following the public flogging in Una of youths for skinning dead cattle.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that it was our duty to protect and respect the poor and Dalit people of our country. For the Dalit families of Sodapur, these words come as cold comfort.At the entrance to Deesa, near the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) building, a huge potato installation welcomes you. Deesa is also where Canadian food giant McCain sources its potatoes from. Large potato cold storages dot the way to Sodapur. On one side of the road that cuts through the village, stand rows of shacks covered with asbestos and lined with tarpaulin. This is the home of the Dalits from Ghada. Across the road, lives the rest of the village.The practice of extreme untouchability, the Dalits claim, led to the murder of one of them nine years ago, forcing them to first sit in protest outside the local revenue officials office for five years after which they came to Sodapur, leaving behind 100 bighas of land where they grew potatoes, castor, wheat, groundnut, bajra and rapeseed.Priyankas sister Savita, 20, is married in Dhaneri village, which is a happier village, but says this is home, where her parents and siblings live.Savita came home for her delivery and a week ago, gave birth to a daughter. The newborn lies on a charpoy, wrapped in a white cloth, flies hovering over. I have to keep it completely wrapped even in this hot weather, she says. The buffalo tied outside belongs to her grandmother Puriben who brought it from her brothers house to source milk for Savita.All the girls gave up studying when we left Ghada. What do we do? Here, we have to take them across the busy road and fetch them back, which is not possible, says Savita.Watch Video: Whats making newsAn orange cycle stands in the corner against a wall, one of the government freebies handed out to Savitas brother, who freelances as a mason, at a Garib Kalyan Mela.Even the boys gave up school. Dashrath, 18, dropped out in Class V, and is now a labourer, as his younger brother who dropped out in Class VII. They didnt let us sit together. They never played with us, says Dashrath, about his upper-caste darbar (OBC) classmates in Ghada.Talbiben weeps at the mention of Ramesh, her eldest son among five children. Her husband Devjibhai is too traumatised to put together the story of what happened.Their 22-year-old son was fairly educated and worked as an insurance agent. But he had dared to enter a temple nine years ago, breaking the rules of Ghada. And paid for it. They ran a tractor over him out of revenge. The police were also from their community and did not heed our pleas to consider it murder, alleges Devjibhai.Bhurabhai Parmar, the leader of this Dalit group, says, We protested outside the mamlatdars office for five years. Finally, the mamlatdar and other government officials came to escort us here two years ago, but have not yet built us homes.Babarsinh Vaghela, sarpanch of Ghada at the time the Dalit families left, denies allegations of discrimination and describes Rameshs death as an accident.There was an accident in which the boy died. We tried hard to strike a compromise between the Dalits and the upper castes but they just did not listen. Finally, after the 12th-day ceremony of Rameshs death, they left the village, he says.There is no untouchability in our village, says Vaghela, who was the sarpanch till 2010.But the Dalits allege that discrimination hit them every minute back in Ghada. We could not go with uncovered heads before upper castes, could not wear pants, footwear or any gold. There were two buses to Deesa, at 9 am and 12 noon, from our village. If we got a seat and a darbar got on board in the packed bus, we had to vacate, says Bhurabhai.They had to send separate vessels for their children to have midday meals. Our children were made to sit separately in the anganwadi, too, he says.The worst was when an upper-caste death occurred. We would have to carry the body, collect the firewood and do all the rituals for 12 days for free. Ramesh opposed all these discriminatory practices. His murder was the last straw that provoked us to leave, says Bhurabhai.The few Ghada children who go to school in Sodapur are happier. Ashwin, who studies at the Bhakotar primary school in Class VIII, says everyone eats and studies together.The Ghada Dalits are also grateful to the sarpanch of Sodapur, Amarsinh Dansinh Rajput, who got a resolution passed in the gram panchayat to let them stay.But only I know what I went through to get this done, says Rajput, from the only Rajput family in Sodapur which has a large population of Brahmins, Patels and other OBCs.I needed five signatures in the sabha of nine members. I cajoled and convinced them to endorse it. But later, I got booked in two criminal cases and went to jail for 10 days. In one case, a Patel accused me of loot and I paid Rs 2.65 lakh for a compromise, claims Rajput.He continues to stand by the Dalits, who now total 35 families in this village. There was a police inspector here who was a friend and he asked me if I could give some land to the Ghada Dalits and I agreed. I allotted them two bighas, says Rajput.All of the Sodapur resettlers have EPIC cards and all of them are registered under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA) since 2014, but they say none of them have got any work or wages under it. It is all on paper. We work as labourers  masons or farmers, says Bhurabhai.They are upset with the government for not building them homes, and point to half-built houses on one side of the land assigned to them. They gave us only Rs 45,000 per home of which we spent Rs 10,000 on the landfill itself, says Kaliben, one of the Dalits who moved to Sodapur.Banaskantha collector Jenu Devan says, They were given homes under the Dr Ambedkar Awas Yojana covering two installments, one of which was given. They will get the rest of the installment only after completion of their homes. This is as per the guidelines of the scheme.According to Devan, since the exodus was the result of an accident to Ramesh, it was not considered as migration. Migration is declared by the state government when conditions in the native place are not conducive to return and there is no scope of compromise with the upper castes.While Devan says that one of the Dalit families returned to Ghada, sarpanch Vaghela claims that five families have come back from Sodapur.Kaliben, meanwhile, settles down with three other women to mourn the drowning of her infant grandson in a water tank, a month ago. Their wails, and the mooing of the buffalo, rise over the everyday sounds in the basti.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: August 10, 2016 3:24 am"

(Above) On November 26, 2006, she had planted potato seeds in the same area to protest the acquisition of land for the Tata car plant. (Pradip Sanyal) Singur, Oct. 20: Mamata Banerjee today scattered mustard seeds to symbolise the return of farming in Singur, a day before her scheduled meeting in New Town with industrialists. Mamata delivered an address of triumph as farming was set to resume on a swathe of land acquired for a Tata car plant 10 years ago. Tomorrow, Mamata will meet businessmen at Eco Park in New Town for a Vijaya Sammilani that is an annual affair, a sequence that underscores the chief minister's compulsions to strike a balance between her pet themes and the demands of governance. At Gopalnagar in Singur today, Mamata said: ""It gives me great joy that Singur is smiling again.... The movement will become an international model for land rights."" In all, 2,216 farmers got documents for 103 acres. Sources in the administration said Gopalnagar was chosen for the first lot for land return because most of the plots that were acquired in this area were untouched in the intervening 10 years and returning land from here was easier. Trinamul leaders such as Haripal MLA Becharam Manna, however, said Gopalnagar was chosen as it was the first site of acquisition for the factory in 2006. Mamata said the government had already made 931 acres out of the total 997.11 acres arable and 10,436 farmers would get their land by November 10, 33 days before the Supreme Court set deadline of November 23. ""Singur teaches us that we should never run from a fight and that rights are not served to you on a platter. You have to snatch them,"" Mamata said, before scattering the mustard seeds on their plots. Mustard, according to agriculture minister Purnendu Bose, was chosen because it is a dry season now. Mustard cultivation, he said, does not require major irrigation as slightly moist land is enough. CPM central committee member Mohammad Salim questioned the reason for such celebration. ""What was she celebrating? The decimation of the hope of Bengal's reindustrialisation? She is sending out all the wrong signals to industry, which she shouldn't if she is serious about drawing industry to the state,"" Salim said. Mamata, who has visited Singapore, England and Germany to court investment and is slated to visit Thailand next month for a business meet, has been sending out bureaucratic delegations to various countries in Asia and Europe to boost participation at the Bengal Global Business Summit. A senior functionary in a city-based trade chamber said that although many industrialists now understand the importance of Singur and Nandigram to Mamata, she can no longer afford to make mistakes on industry in her second term as chief minister. 'Impostors' The chief minister said many of the people yet to receive the record of rights for the return of land were impostors who had taken compensation cheques 10 years ago. When the government tried to locate these ""willing"" farmers, they were nowhere to be found. ""These were impostors who posed as willing farmers to take the compensation. A lot of these malpractices took place back then. We are looking into these things,"" she said. Unlike in her September 14 address, she did not say FIRs would be lodged against such people."
58ff383f7be9e0420db2e9a7,Indians to set record in Congressional polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161104/jsp/foreign/story_117353.jsp,2016-11-04,,Telegraph,"California's attorney general Kamala Harris (left) and Washington state Senator Pramila Jayapal Washington, Nov. 3: Next week's legislative elections in America concurrent with choosing a new US President will set a new record which few people are talking about: yet it is very important for India and for Americans of Indian origin. The new US Congress will have a record representation by men and women of Indian origin. Women in America are openly exulting that next Tuesday's voting could take female representation in both chambers of Congress to more than 20 per cent for the first time. Also, depending on whether you are a rich American, not-so-rich or a poor citizen, the millionaire class which will proliferate the next Senate has become a hot potato or a matter of pride in the ongoing election campaign. But the record about to be set in legislative representation is a landmark in the history of Indian immigration to the US. Although Indian American presence on Capitol Hill will go up by record numbers, it will still not be as high as in Canada where Punjabi is the fourth most spoken language in its House of Commons. Not yet. If all goes well for Kamala Harris in Tuesday's voting in California, she will become the first American with Indian roots to become a member of the US Senate. Harris is California's incumbent attorney general. In nearby Washington state, Pramila Jayapal is equally on the way to making history for the Indian American community if she is elected - a virtual certainty going by opinion polls - to the US House of Representatives on Tuesday. The US Congress has never had an Indian American woman in its ranks. Jayapal is an incumbent state Senator in Washington. She will replace a retiring Congressman who has a stellar record of helping India and promoting Indo-US friendship although he is racially white. Jim McDermott, one of the founding members of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, represented Seattle and neighbouring areas in the House for just under 28 years. In a part of Silicon Valley which is home to technology firms Apple, Intel, Yahoo! and eBay, Ro Khanna, a former Stanford University lecturer who is only 40, is likely to replace incumbent fellow Democrat Mike Honda. California's curious election law allows the two top contenders from the same party to contest against each other in the poll. Another near certain win next week contributing to the new record is Raja Krishnamoorthi who is contesting in Illinois for a seat being vacated by incumbent Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a fellow Democrat. When Louisiana's Bobby Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, Indian Americans were over the moon. Since Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, no Indian American had gone to Capitol Hill as an elected representative in the lower chamber of Congress. When Jindal was elected Louisiana's governor five years later Indian Americans once again became unrepresented in the US national legislature although their disappointment was tempered in due course by having him - and later in 2011 - Nikki Haley, South Carolina's incumbent governor in two significant gubernatorial positions in America. Ami Bera filled that gap in 2012 when he was elected to the House from California. He and Tulsi Gabbard - who is not Indian, but Hindu - have since become emblematic of Indian causes on Capitol Hill. Bera faces a tough contest this year and Indian Americans fear he may not be re-elected. Although she has only been in a state-level contest the cynosure of this election season for people with Indian roots in this country has been Kesha Ram, who unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primaries for Vermont's Lieutenant Governor. She continues to be a member of Vermont's General Assembly. Her popularity among Indian Americans is owed to her success eight years ago in being elected to the state legislature at the age of 22, the youngest member of the community to win any public office in the US. Meanwhile, widespread expectations of a Hillary Clinton victory in the presidential election have prompted Indian Americans to lobby with her campaign for positions in the next US administration, especially in a Clinton cabinet. Among the Indian American front-runners is Neera Tanden, president of a Democratic-leaning think tank, the Centre for American Progress. Speculation is rife that Tanden could be in the next cabinet as the secretary for health and human services. Clinton has promised that if elected, 50 per cent of her cabinet will be made up of women. Since her victory, if it comes through, is significantly owed to African Americans, Hispanics and Asians, Clinton will go out of her way to ensure ethnic diversity in her administration. Tanden's strength is that she worked for the drafting and adoption of Obamacare formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama's signature health care reform which Clinton has pledged to uphold. Circles close to John Kerry, the secretary of state who succeeded Clinton when she quit to enter the presidential campaign, indicated that Richard Verma, the incumbent US ambassador to India, could be the next Permanent Representative to the UN, a position with cabinet rank in the American system. Ajay Banga, who headed the US-India Business Council for several years, the president and CEO of Mastercard, is being talked about for a senior economic position in the Clinton administration as is Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general. Other Indian American names doing the rounds are Vivek Murthy, the current US surgeon general, and Raj Shah, whom Obama appointed as head of the US Agency for International Development."

Shah, who addressed a public rally in Etawah, Samajwadi boss Mulayam Singh Yadav's home district, also called on young BJP supporters to take a ""pledge"" to stop the ruling party's thugs from venturing out of home during elections. ""I know very well where I am standing, and still saying that central forces must be here to prevent the goons (from capturing booths). But I also appeal to the youths of the BJP to stop the goons from venturing out of their homes during elections,"" the BJP leader said. With 10 to 25 per cent Yadav voters, the 11 Assembly constituencies in Etawah and its adjoining districts - Mainpuri, Auraiya, Farrukhabad, Kannauj and Etah - have for long been strongholds of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP). Mulayam's native village Saifai is in Etawah, around 250km from Lucknow. ""You take a pledge today that you will not let the goons of the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party take over the election this time. Enough is enough. Now UP has to take the path to development and strengthen (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi,"" Shah said. Shah asked the people whether they needed parties like the Samajwadi and former chief minister Mayawati's BSP, which, he said, have ""promoted criminals during their rules"" or a leader like Modi ""who has been giving jobs to youths"". The BJP has not projected a chief ministerial face and the decision so far is to let Modi lead the campaign. Shah said the BJP would once again give the state a ""Kalyan Singh-like government"" if it won the Assembly elections. The BJP claims that Kalyan, a two-time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and now governor of Rajasthan, had given the heartland state clean governance when he ruled. It was during Kalyan's first term as chief minister that the Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992. The Supreme Court had later held Kalyan responsible for the incident and punished him by asking him to stand in the courtroom till the court rose for the day. Shah also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi, who recently completed a kisan yatra in the state. The BJP leader claimed that the Congress vice-president was not aware of the fact that ""potatoes are not manufactured in a factory"". ""Rahul is a big leader. He was recently on a kisan yatra in Uttar Pradesh and said in Agra that he would open new factories to increase the production of potatoes. He doesn't know that potato is not produced in a factory; it is grown in fields. But we will certainly open factories in the state to produce potato chips if the BJP comes to power,"" Shah said. Rahul's critics had spread an unsubstantiated rumour last month that he had said he would open factories to increase potato production. BSP boss Mayawati said Shah's promise of a government like that of Kalyan Singh amounted to insulting Uttar Pradesh residents, adding that the former chief minister had been ""punished"" by the Supreme Court. ""Shah has insulted the 22 crore people of UP by promising a Kalyan Singh-like government,"" she said."

Government officials dubbed the move ""routine"", saying bureaucrats holding key posts were transferred every two to three years. Agarwal, considered close to Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, had been the JDA commissioner for two years. But many in the administration said Agarwal had been ""shunted"". Sixty other officials were also transferred today. Agarwal and Diya Kumari, who had joined the BJP at Raje's insistence, had on August 24 argued in public over a government takeover of 12.5 bighas of land around her family's Rajmahal Palace in the heart of Jaipur. Civic officials had come armed with a bulldozer to take possession of the land, said to be valued at over Rs 1,200 crore, surrounding the palace, a heritage property inherited by Diya Kumari's son and now run as a hotel by a business group. The JDA had said it acquired the land legally in 1993 and was only taking over what was the government's land. Diya Kumari, who had rushed to the spot with a court decree, claiming the family's right over the land, had a public spat with commissioner Agarwal. She accused Agarwal of ignoring the court papers. The spat had sparked a street protest on September 1, led by Diya Kumari's 73-year-old mother Rajmata Padmini Devi and son Padmanabh Singh, 18, the family's heir. Several thousand people, including those from Diya Kumari's constituency Sawai Madhopur, traders and Rajput communities from across the state, had lent support to the 6km rally in a show of Rajput solidarity. Sources said the issue had become a political hot potato as the Rajput community and several BJP leaders and royal families had got sucked into the controversy. The JDA had sealed four gates of the palace, including the main entrance to the hotel. Raje's silence on the issue had fuelled suggestions that the JDA's move had the support of the chief minister. Earlier, Agarwal had come under fire for the demolition of temples for a Metro project. Some of the temples were rebuilt following protests by people."
58ff3a647be9e0420db2ec82,Nayagarh village that safeguards forest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161023/jsp/odisha/story_115070.jsp,2016-10-23,,Telegraph,"Ranapur, Oct. 22 (Reuters): For the tribal women of Gunduribadi village in Odisha, an early morning patrol is essential to conserve their forest, but what they are protecting goes far beyond food security or even their livelihoods. Four decades ago, logging and theft of commercial timber and bamboo had denuded hills, depleted groundwaters and dried up streams around Nayagarh district, forcing people to migrate in droves, said Arjun Pradhan, 70, headman of Gunduribadi village. The crisis prompted the community to embark on a campaign to nurture their forest and restore the ecosystem, he said. ""What you see today as Nayagarh's democratic movement to sustain community forests resources and become self-reliant was born of necessity 40 years ago after six droughts in 10 years shattered its farm and forest-based livelihoods,"" Pradhan said. Today, the revitalised ecosystem provides water all year round, with a stream irrigating small farms even in mid-summer, when pond floors dry and crack in many parts of India. The conservation plan is so successful it has become a template for forestry across Odisha, Arjun Pradhan said. Now the tribal women who conserve the forest are fighting for legal ownership under India's 2006 Forest Rights Act (FRA) law, which recognises forest-dwellers' rights over their traditional lands and resources. Government data shows that between early 2008 and July 2016, out of a total 4.2 million claims for titles filed under the FRA, only 1.6 million, or a third, were awarded. Out of this figure, just 44,500 titles were given to communities or villages, out of a potential 170,000 villages. Progress in implementing the law has been slow as India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, seeks land for industrial use and development projects, land experts said. Across Nayagarh, a total of 850 villages protect around 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of forestland. In 2015, Nayagarh's forest cover was 53 per cent of its total geographical area, more than twice that of India's 21.3 percent. In India, almost 150 million people in 170,000 villages live inside or on the fringes of forests, which they rely on for subsistence and income. There are just 27 households in Gunduribadi, owning barely a hectare (2.4 acres) of land each. But as rain falls on farms in the foothills of the village, it carries nutrient-rich humus from the forest, enriching the soil and adding to the bounty of crops and wild food. The soil is so packed with nutrients that each hectare provides around 6,500kg of rice each harvest, three times more than on farms near unprotected forests, locals say. The forest also provides a range of seasonal food for local families, as well as extra income from medicinal plants that can be sold at market. ""This forest is like an old friend that never fails to help us cope during droughts and bad crop years, saving us from starvation and (the need for) migration,"" Dami Nayak, a local woman aged 80, said. Another woman living in Gunduribadi, Janha Pradhan holds out a small harvest of sweet tuber, known locally as pichuli, which she collected on her morning patrol. For the 44-year-old widow on a meagre income, these wild yams are more nutritious than potatoes - and cost nothing. Such food is harvested carefully to nurture the forest.

58ff3b1c7be9e0420db2ed73,A give-and-reap forest model,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161023/jsp/nation/story_115104.jsp,2016-10-23,,Telegraph,"A forest in Odishas Nayagarh district Ranapur, Oct. 22 (Reuters): For the tribal women of Gunduribadi village in Odisha, an early morning patrol is essential to conserve their forest, but what they are protecting goes far beyond food security or even their livelihoods. Four decades ago, logging and theft of commercial timber and bamboo had denuded hills, depleted groundwaters and dried up streams around Nayagarh district, forcing people to migrate in droves, said Arjun Pradhan, 70, headman of Gunduribadi village. The crisis prompted the community to embark on a campaign to nurture their forest and restore the ecosystem, he said. ""What you see today as Nayagarh's democratic movement to sustain community forests resources and become self-reliant was born of necessity 40 years ago after six droughts in 10 years shattered its farm and forest-based livelihoods,"" Pradhan said. Today, the revitalised ecosystem provides water all year round, with a stream irrigating small farms even in mid-summer, when pond floors dry and crack in many parts of India. The conservation plan is so successful it has become a template for forestry across Odisha, Arjun Pradhan said. Now the tribal women who conserve the forest are fighting for legal ownership under India's 2006 Forest Rights Act (FRA) law, which recognises forest-dwellers' rights over their traditional lands and resources. Government data shows that between early 2008 and July 2016, out of a total 4.2 million claims for titles filed under the FRA, only 1.6 million, or a third, were awarded. Out of this figure, just 44,500 titles were given to communities or villages, out of a potential 170,000 villages. Progress in implementing the law has been slow as the country seeks land for industrial use and development projects, land experts said. Across Nayagarh, a total of 850 villages protect around 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of forestland. In 2015 Nayagarh's forest cover was 53 per cent of its total geographical area, more than twice that of India's 21.3 per cent. In India, almost 150 million people in 170,000 villages live inside or on the fringes of forests, which they rely on for subsistence and income. There are just 27 households in Gunduribadi, owning barely a hectare (2.4 acres) of land each. But as rain falls on farms in the foothills of the village, it carries nutrient-rich humus from the forest, enriching the soil and adding to the bounty of crops and wild food. The soil is so packed with nutrients that each hectare provides around 6,500kg (14,330 lb) of rice each harvest, three times more than on farms near unprotected forests, locals say. The forest also provides a range of seasonal food for local families, as well as extra income from medicinal plants that can be sold at market. ""This forest is like an old friend that never fails to help us cope during droughts and bad crop years, saving us from starvation and (the need for) migration,"" Dami Nayak, a local woman aged 80, said. Another woman living in Gunduribadi, Janha Pradhan holds out a small harvest of sweet tuber, known locally as pichuli, which she collected on her morning patrol. For the 44-year-old widow on a meagre income, these wild yams are more nutritious than potatoes - and cost nothing. Such food is harvested carefully to nurture the forest. ""We never pull out the entire root but carefully cut out a portion and leave the remaining root beneath the soil to regrow,"" she said. The wild food includes bamboo shoots rich in protein, wild mushrooms, spine gourds and bean vines that proliferate on sturdy trees, as well as iron-rich spinach that wards off anaemia, a major health concern for rural women and children. While the women also obtain wood for fuel from the forest, they never chop the trees for firewood. ""On our morning patrol we break off dry branches and carry them home,"" said Kama Pradhan, 35. ""But we are selective, we know which species of wood does not give out harmful smoke."" #Conservation is based on simple yet binding rules set by the village council, which permits villagers to collect dry shrub fuelwood, fodder and edible products sustainably, based on need. Felling trees needs permission, and taking axes into the forests is banned. Over the years, the plan has entailed sacrifices: as forests regenerated, goats were sold and banned for 10 years to stop them nibbling green shoots. The twice-daily meals of rice were cooked once to reduce fuelwood and let forests grow. A community policing system was introduced. Known as thengapali, it entails members of four families passing on the duty of forest patrol to four other families by placing sticks outside their homes at night. Gunduribadi's patrols say they are protecting benefits that are key to the future survival and wellbeing of the community. Despite protecting the forest with their lives - sometimes literally, when confrontations with gangs plundering timber or bamboo risk turning violent - most forest-dwelling communities lack legal recognition of land ownership. Activists say collective rights have been sidelined and that millions of forest-dwellers are still struggling with the complicated process of registering claims. They say that a 2015 law that outlines a framework for the use of compensatory afforestation funds shuts village councils out of the planning and implementation of afforestation. This will not only encourage the exploitation of community land, they say, but destroy the bio-diverse and climate-resilient forests that communities like Gunduribadi survive on."

Sonup Maity grows roses too along with hibiscus on his do bigha zamin in Charkatapukur. So does the Durga Puja and Kali Puja bring in some extra dough for Adak and his friends? ""Nothing like that. There is a demand for flowers all through the year. During Pujas, demand rises, but so does the supply,"" said Maity. ""I also buy flowers from others and bring them to the market,"" he said.

Dhanurjaya Dehury, a Class-VIII student, was awarded for his innovation ""Pedal-Operated Vegetable-Cutting Machine"" and Sebati Kutruka, of the same class, bagged the award for her project ""Machine to Dig out Sweet Potato"". Dhanurjaya Dehury and Sebati Kutruka The duo are among 30 winners selected for their innovations from among 59,400 projects received by the National Innovation Foundation-India, an autonomous body of the department of science and technology. The foundation declared the annual awards on October 15, on former President Kalam's birth anniversary. The occasion is also celebrated as the Children's Creativity and Innovation Day. Both Dhanurjaya and Sebati will leave for New Delhi on November 5 and receive their awards from President Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan on November 7. KISS director P.K. Das and headmaster Sushanta Kumar Swain will accompany them. Both students belong to tribal families. While Dhanurjaya hails from Koida in Sundargarh district, Sebati is from Bissam Cuttack in Rayagada and both have been in KISS for the past five years. ""I have seen people at my village putting in a lot of physical effort to dig out sweet potatoes, yam and other tubers that are commonly consumed in those parts. Often it results in a lot of drudgery, especially for the women. This is why I tried to make a machine to solve this problem,"" said 12-year-old Sebati. Expressing happiness over the success of KISS students, institute founder Achyuta Samanta said tribal students were second to none if provided with proper care and quality education. ""These two students have proved their mettle at the national level - which is a great achievement not only for KISS, but for the all tribal communities,"" he said. In another development, KISS has signed an MoU with Ahmedabad-based Adani Foundation to set up a branch of the institute in the tribal-populated district of Mayurbhanj. Samanta inked the pact with Adani Foundation chairperson Priti Adani. The foundation will finance the institute's infrastructure facilities. KISS has bought land in Baripada to set up the institute. According to the MoU, Adani Foundation will provide one-time infrastructure assistance for the institute, which will start operating from the next academic year. It will provide the underprivileged tribal students of Mayurbhanj quality education, said sources. The authorities also said land had been purchased in many tribal-populated districts, including Koraput, Kalahandi, Balangir, Sundargarh and Keonjhar, to set up KISS branches. Ten branches of KISS will start functioning in those districts, said Samanta, adding that each branch would have 1,200 students."

It has come as a blow to farmers, who are already under financial crisis, due to drought and related issues, he said.Sheshegowda alleged that the board had failed to abide by the guidelines of the government. He said, only a few tobacco growers possess licence and they too have not taken up tobacco cultivation.The number of unauthorised tobacco growers is more, compared to license holders. They can sell their produce only with the cooperation of licence holders. If they have to sell their produce directly, it is inevitable for them to pay a fine to the board. The Tobacco Board has set such regulations, causing inconvenience to the growers, he alleged.CompensationThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had directed the manufacturers of tobacco products to display large visual warnings that cover 85 per cent of the pack surface. But, the Centre has rejected it and decided to use warnings that cover 40 per cent. With the government mulling to control tobacco cultivation, it would affect the farmers, he added.Agents meetingCriticising the meeting held at the Deputy Commissioners office to discuss about seed potatoes on May 12, he said, not a single farmer was invited for the meeting. It was purely a meeting of middlemen, he alleged.The potato growers have been facing loss for the past nine years. Instead of supporting farmers, the district administration is giving importance to traders. There is no proper information on the quantity of certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar and the expenses incurred. The district adminstration is extorting innocent farmers, he alleged."

This has indirectly helped the traders, who are said to be fleecing the farmers by selling the seeds at a higher price.Potato is a major commercial crop of the district and about 50,000 farmers are involved in its cultivation.Not a single farmer was present at a meeting convened by the district administration on Thursday here, which many farmers felt showed the negligence of the authorities concerned in lending an ear to the problems of farmers.Speaking to Deccan Herald, farmers explained that potato growers usually attend the meeting every year. But, this year, upset over the authorities attitude, no farmer attended the meeting. The failure in fixing the price for the seeds is beneficial for traders, who sell seed potatoes on credit and fleece the farmers, they complained.The traders do not give any receipt for the seeds sold. The farmers too are forced to buy the seeds, accepting the price quoted by the traders under fear that the stocks may exhaust. As there are no receipts, the farmers are eligible for a financial assistance of Rs 5,000 issued by the Agriculture department  Rs 450 for manure, Rs 3,090 for pesticides and Rs 1,540 for other expenses.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner V Anbukumar had intervened and held meetings with the farmers, inspected godowns and fixed a suitable price. This was helpful to the farmers. But after his transfer, the district administration has not shown much interest in the issue. Elected representatives too have turned a blind eye to the problem, the farmers complained.Certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar, Punjab, are just 2,065 tonnes. This is sufficient for about 500 farmers. According to reports, 56,000 farmers had sown potatoes last year. Hence, 55,500 farmers will get only ordinary seed potatoes, they added.The farmers said they fear blight disease attack and loss of crop if they do not get certified seeds."

Similarly, the relief amount has been doubled for commercial crops like orange, arecanut and coconut too.The relief for orange plants (less than five years old) is fixed at Rs 200 per stick against Rs 100 earlier, while that of the plants above five years will get Rs 320 per stick against Rs 160 earlier. For areca and coconut trees less than five year old, it has been increased up to Rs 400 as against Rs 200, followed by Rs 800 (Rs 400) for the trees as old as seven to nine years and Rs 2,000 (Rs 1,000) for the trees 10 years and above.

The drinking water requirement of Hassan city and other villages is around 3.5 tmcft and 56.26 tmcft is required for cultivation of 6.56 lakh acres of land in the command area of the dam. Water from the dam is released periodically for cultivation only when the dam is full. Hence, water should not be released from the dam at any cost. If the government releases water, staging a highway bandh would become inevitable. I am even ready to go to jail, he added.All the 28 MPs and 224 MLAs of the state should resign on moral grounds. The government should take a firm stand on the issue and be ready to face consequences, he suggested.The farmers have sought Rs 50,000 compensation from the government for crop loss. The government should not force the farmers to take the extreme step. So, all the eight taluks of the district should be declared as drought-hit and compensation should be announced.Potato, coconut, arecanut, ginger and cardamom crops have been totally destroyed.

Legal action will be taken against those traders selling substandard quality of seeds in the district, warned Deputy Commissioner Deepti Kanade.She was speaking at a preliminary meeting to discuss about potato cultivation organised by the Horticulture department here on Tuesday. The meeting was attended by the traders, farmer leaders and the representatives of the Horticulture department.Farmers should not go for low-quality seeds which are available at a cheaper rate and thereby compromise with the quality. This would only lead to low quality production and thereby bring in only loss for the cultivators. Only quality seeds can ensure quality yield and the traders should also sell only quality seeds. Usually there will be variation in the weight of a 50 kg bag of seeds. Slight variation up to one or one-and-a-half kg is not a matter of concern. However, a larger variation in weight should be brought to the notice of the trader, she said.District unit president of the Raitha Sangha Bhaktarahalli Bhairegowda said, For the last three years, the farmers from the district had been facing potato crop loss. It is better to take all the precautionary measures. The traders who sell seeds should also provide bills for the goods sold. Measures should be taken to halt the private traders who are engaged in the sale of low quality seeds.Not sufficientThe traders informed the meeting that only a couple of companies sold certified seeds. However, this was not sufficient to meet the demand for certified seeds that is required in the district.Senior Assistant Director of the Horticulture department, Munegowda said the traders from the district often purchased potato seeds belonging to a general variety from the farmers of Jalandhar. However, there are a number of seed selling centres which have been certified by the National Seeds Coporation in Punjab, which sell certified seeds. Our farmers can purchase from these centres also, he informed.The deputy commissioner said that a list of certified sellers will be handed over the Horticulture department. The traders can purchase seeds from these sellers.For the first time in Hassan district, certified seeds were distributed by the Horticulture department directly to the farmers houses, on an experimental basis. The certified potato seeds were sold at a subsidised rate and the department has supplied 2,800 tonnes of seeds. And there have been reports of good yield too from the district. In order to distribute seeds on the similar lines in Chikkaballapur, an aeroponics project has been created, informed Munegowda.The deputy commissioner said, The farmers should transplant the potato plants during the period which is most suitable and recommended by the scientists and the traders should not sell the seeds before the stipulated time, she said.The potatoes, if cultivated between 18 and 22 degree celcius, will give a good yield. Such warmth in the atmophere is reported in the September-October months in Chikkaballpur. Hence, the potato produce should be transplanted between October 15 and Novermber 30, according to the experts, Kanade informed.A few traders informed the meeting that the sale of seeds had already begun at Bangarpet in Kolar district. Most of the farmers from Chikkaballapur were visiting Bangarpet to purchase the seeds. This should be avoided.Kanade assured them that she would be speaking with Kolar deputy commissioner in this regard.Biggest centreThe district has the biggest potato seeds producing centre. But so far, it has not produced any seeds at all. The centre should start the production of seeds and provide them to the farmers, the meeting was informed.Taluk unit president of the Raitha Sangha Maralukunte Ramanjinappa, joint secretary C B Shrinivas, leaders S Eshwarachari, S Ramesh, Taduru Manjunath, Potato Traders Association president R Vijaykumar, vice-president Ramaswamy, traders Prabhakar, R H Narayanswamy, Venkatesh, Mohan Murali, Horticulture department deputy director B Raghu, APMC secretary Ramdas, Agriculture Marketing department assistant director Bathula, tahsildar and several others were present on the occasion."

Youth should develop interest in such aspects of the country.Guha said the uniqueness of India lies in the adoption of universal adult franchise especially in a young nation ridden with poverty and illiteracy. Comparing the evolution of democratic models of different countries such as England and France, where the model of one language, one religion and one enemy united the nation, Guha pronounced that Indiaa relatively young republic was a successful democracy. This audacious gamble not only worked but was hugely successful as well.Drawing parallels across diverse countries such as Great Britain and Sri Lanka, he opined the plurality of languages and religion was the strength of India. The credit goes to farsighted vision of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Ambedkar and others.Unity in diversity is the essence of India that makes it a confederation of more than 30 states and Union Territories with different cultures, languages, music, dance, drama, art and architecture.He warned against the concept of Hindi, Hindu, Hindustani or one language, one religion, one nation theory citing examples of countries, which have ruined themselves having gone that route.Today, different states of India follow different languages but follow single rulebook called Constitution of India, which has given equal rights to all citizen irrespective of their caste, creed, region or religion. He elaborated the importance of celebration of multiple languages and history tells that imposition of one language and one culture will have dire consequences. He cited the examples of separation of East and West Pakistan and civil war in Sri Lanka.While bringing up the virtues of work life balance, he highlighted the importance of music, literature, art, architecture and being with nature. Work life balance does not mean, sitting at home as couch potato and watching IPL, but exploring other dimensions of life, so that one would have a better understanding about oneself and the society in which one lives, he said.DH News Service"

This had made them to sow seeds of commercial crops.However the eluding of rains even after completion of one month of rainy season has made the growers to worry over the future of the crops. If rain fails, farmers will incur huge loss this year as well, said an onion grower.To cultivate onion on one acre land, the growers have to spend at least Rs 45,000 including sowing, removing weeds and applying fertilisers. A good yield can fetch at least 80 quintals of onion from one acre land. The lack of rainfall will, however, affect the yield per hectare.At present, the onion growers are dependent on borewell for irrigating the farm land. Onion plants have grown well in Nagenahalli, Biluvala, Maccheri, Chikkabasoor and other areas.

Through e-NAM, the farmers will have a choice to log on to the platform and sell their produce at the best price discovered through a wider base of market players competing for procurement. In the first phase, 21 mandis have joined the trading platform but the government wants to connect 585 mandis in the next two years. Hopefully, if this target is achieved, the initiative will not only help significantly increase the monetary yield for the farmers but also bring about wider positive spin-offs for the economy equivalent to the potential gains from the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST). Even as the GST remains a football between the BJP and the Congress, e-NAM can integrate the entire rural landscape into uniform market, helping both growers and consumers.Since agriculture is a state subject, the Centre needs to take states on board in sewing up the e-platform into a single market without the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts coming in the way. The APMC Act, which has since been amended by 14 states to allow such a technology-driven initiative, could have been dealt with in a manner that did not require the tedious processes of amending the laws. In any case, the states which have agreed to join the initiative must be lauded for their honest intentions to help the farmers who are witnessing a crisis like situation even as the Met department is giving some hope to look skyward for normal Monsoon this year after back to back deficit for two years.As many as 25 crops would be traded on the e-NAM which is partnered in the first phase by Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh. Farmers should be able to seek the best bids for their harvest in wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, potatoes, onions, and spices among others. Such reforms which can ride the technology and involvement of trade, industry, cooperatives and NGOs, should be the top priority of the government. Similar path-breaking steps should be encouraged in water management, dry land farming, farm tools and equipment, allied activities like dairy farming and fishery and micro-financing."

On Friday, Bharuch district administrative department received a circular from the state agriculture department, which was sent out to all the 33 districts in Gujarat, to organise a temporary Sunday Bazaar for the vegetable farmers. Bharuch district collector Sandip Sagle, along with his staffers, started the awareness drive in Bharuch city to invite people and purchase vegetables directly from farmers at Grahak Khedut Bazaar.Watch what else is making news:The farmers market was organised at hostel ground in the middle of the city on Sunday by Bharuch district collector officials. Around 50 farmers, from eight different villages  Kansiya, Muland, Chhapra, Mangaleshwar, Nikora, Kuarwada, Bet and Borbhata in Bharuch district  gathered with their produce early Sunday morning.People got attracted to the market because of competitive rates. The market opened at 9 am. It had fresh-from-the-farm vegetables  sweet potato, bottle gourd, brinjal, amaranth leaves, pumpkin, cabbage, capsicum, organic banana etc. Within an hour-and-a-half, the farmers had sold all their produce. The farmers later met the district administrative officials and thanked them for the initiative.Talking to The Indian Express, Amrat Rathod, a farmer from Kansiya village, said, I came here with two gunny bags of Tur and everything was sold. We are thankful to the district administrative officials for organising such bazaar for us. Earlier, we use to sell our produce to the traders of Bharuch APMC through commission agents. The agents used to take their cut and sell them to the trader who also kept a profit margin before selling it to the local retailer. The customers directly purchase from the retailer who also keeps his profit margin. Like this, the prices of the agriculture produce are higher after passing through different stages. Rathod sold the pea stock at Rs 30 per kilogram against the market rate of Rs 40 per kilogram and earned Rs 10 on every kg.Bharuch district Assistant Collector Amit Yadav said, We acted on the circular of the state government and the results were overwhelming. The farmers are happy and so are the customers. Now, the farmers get sufficient price of their products. We will continue this trend in the coming days. At present, we are organising it once in a week at one place. In the second week, we will organise such a bazaar at two different places  one at Hostel ground and another at Zadeshwar area. Many farmers are listed in the agriculture department of the district panchayat so we could easily contact them.Bharuch APMC Secretary Dipak Patel said, We welcome the initiative by Bharuch district collector who is acting on the state governments decision. This business will not affect us and seeing the current situation in the wake of demonetisation, the vegetable-producing farmers were more affected as their produce is perishable. The farmers who participated in the Grahak Khedut Bazaar are not big suppliers of vegetables. We purchase vegetables in bulk. Earlier, these small farmers used to come to us with vegetables and we used to purchase from them. Our business will not get affected by this initiative.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The things that cannot be achieved directly by technology can be outsourced for a price tag.So, we have people taking care of our daily chores. Then there are people answering attendance and writing examinations for students who want their services. We have stories of senior pourakarmikas who kindly allow their poorer cousins to do the job for them for a pittance. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, builders and other professionals off shoulder their responsibilities to their juniors in the name of teaching them the tricks of the trade.Then, there are always those few people in every family who are specially identified to attend functions and events on others behalf. There are goons who can bump off the guy you dont like. If you have not yet grasped the general drift of all this dribbling, let me spell it out for you. The mantra goes this way: Every activity that can be done by a substitute is almost always substituted.That explains all the lifestyle diseases. Apparently, all of it stems from our couch-potato mode, preferably with a bag of potato chips by our side. If only we could squarely shift the blame on all those innovations and the underprivileged populace who have geared up to enslave us, make us obese and redundant and get them suitably punished for making us look silly slobs. When this kind of collective murmur became a clamour it was heard by the world of technology.Lo and behold, they came up with an application called Pokemon Go. The tech savvy and the body watchers geared up to catch virtual monsters and burn those unwanted calories. Just around the time when the world thought things were falling into place, a news brief updated us about how lazy gamers can avail the services of a firm called Poke Walk. The ones who want to boast of a high score without sweating it out can hire the service of people who will walk their phone and catch creatures for a fee! Wonder what they will come up with next?I am waiting for the day when the brilliant brains of this world will come up with a technology for satiating our senses or even breathing on our behalf. However, I will not be overly surprised if some enterprising lot gives us the option to outsource the function for a fee!"

Out all day, when she returned home to change in to fresh clothes, she was aghast to see her body turn blue!No. She did not suffer any heat stroke. Nor did she have any allergies to hot or humid climes back home. As a matter of fact, it was the colour of her peacock blue bandhani top that had run all over her and despite taking what she calls a hot soapy shower, she could not get rid of her blues completely.Next, she had a nasty, red rash. She first thought that it must have been due to prickly heat but it was not. A doctor friend told her that the dye of her top had something in it and had affected her skin. He told her that these dyes could be poisonous. So much so that these dyes also affect the dyers in the villages where it is made, with many artisans having their hands and fingers damaged. This shocked Shailini, who claims that now she was turning red and blue. Not because of dye but with anger!The incident made Shailini, the niece of Indumati Chamanlal, a freedom fighter and Gujarats first textile minister, think. Ironically, it was Chamanlal who had set up Khadi Mandir, Indias first khadi store, in Ahmedabad in the 1950s, where Shailini had spent most of her formative years working in the outlet. She thought about the clothes we buy and wear, their manufacturing process, the people involved and what their characteristics are.A trained career architect, travelling between India and England, Shailini was closely involved with various aspects of green, energy efficient and sustainable built environment projects. Her passion was about conservation and heritage support of buildings, people and places. Having committed equal time for paid and community-based voluntary work all through her career, she had been involved with research and work on initiating action programs for village level groups, artisans and international communities.My experience of turning blue and red had remained with me. When I returned from England to Ahmedabad a decade ago, my first project was to build a house for my family and myself. That experience of finding our roots again and experimenting at grounding took me closer to my personal heritage. It took me beyond architecture and I became very passionate about handcrafted fabrics, Shailini says.The other strength Shailini had was that having lived in England and in India, she had been exposed to both sides of international textiles change - from the producer side and from the buyer/consumer side. Influenced profoundly by her aunt Indumatiben Chamanlal and close family association with Mahatma Gandhi and Indias Freedom Struggle, Shailini was influenced by the ethical, moral and social values the freedom movement had generated.Polluting industryWhen she began her tryst with the textile industry, she knew that this industry is the second biggest employer in the world but had become one of the most polluting and exploitative industries. Many times the buying houses, distributors and mills show very high profit margins for their shareholders but the people lower down the supply chain are overlooked. The workers are exploited by very low wages and they work in questionable health and safety conditions. The farmers become victims of buying agents and get paid very little. Many times greed and apathy play a larger role, she says.So in 2007, she began her journey by setting up MORALFIBRE - the fabric made using almost no electricity and no harmful chemicals. One that is almost Carbon Neutral and allergy-free.Generally the manufacturerer of the cloth use about 600 to 800 chemicals; many of them harmful to the body.Her endeavour was to be able to source and sell a fabric that uses more of natural materials that are not harmful to the body and the environment, reducing the chances of allergies and illnesses caused by skin contact and fumes of the harmful substances from the fabric. This also protects the health of the artisans too.Today, the MORALFIBRE cloth is made of biodegradable materials, using finite energy and resources so that it makes less negative impact on the environment. Unlike other industrially manufactured woven and knitted ones, these hand crafted fabrics making involve hand spinning and hand weaving using people energy instead and has far-reaching economic and social benefits to the artisans living in remote villages.The primary source of raw material too remains certified organic cotton and non-certified cotton sourced from local farmers from the Saurashtra region and within 450 km radius of Ahmedabad. Natural alternatives such as natural spinning oils that biodegrade easily are used to facilitate spinning; potato starch is used for sizing. A good boiling wash removes the cotton wax. Fabrics are natural, greige (unfinished woven or knitted fabric that hasn't been bleached or dyed. It can be used for upholstery, window treatments, clothes and more) and white, yarn dyed and fabric dyed with azo free dyes.The weaving is single yarn, double yarns, plain or twisted. The prints are mainly hand block printed by local artisans in Indo- Western and contemporary styles. All this is done by over 3,000 artisans from various cooperatives in the region.For marketing, MORALFIBRE acts more as a web-based social enterprise, using the world-wide optic fibre network to connect producers to the buyers. On one hand it works locally with co-operatives by creating work opportunities in fabric production, processing, dying, printing and tailoring. On the other, they approach buyers and potential buyers through networks, mainly in a B2B wholesale marketplace spread internationally across the UK, the US, Australia and many EU countries, over the internet.Though the venture has been making a few ripples in the world fashion industry, the big bang break came last year when the fabrics were used by Warner Brothers in their Hollywood production and Hugh Jackman-starrer Pan. Currently into clothing, Shailini now plans to soon launch a range of garments that too will be sold only online."

No wonder, James Joseph is called the jack man of Kerala. A series of incidents transformed an engineer into an entrepreneur with a social cause and its impact is interesting.James worked in the corporate sector for about 2 decades, held key positions, specifically marketing roles, in leading companies, and worked from cities in three different continents. But, no matter where he was and how sophisticated the life was, his passion for hometown was alive in him. When he was appointed as a director (executive engagement) of Microsoft in India, he decided to connect his passion and profession. He wanted to explore the possibilities of working for a corporate company from his native in Aluva in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Both the company and the family supported him to try out the idea.In May 2009, James started his new journey. For over three years, his work and life were in perfect sync and he could achieve better while working from his village. I worked for different companies in three continents, but achieved my career-best professional performance, at the global software giant Microsoft, from my village, says James.When he realised that people can return to their villages without sacrificing their career and even perform better while experiencing the peaceful environs of rural India, he decided to spread the message and launched a pioneering initiative, Professional Bharati.Through this startup, he has been encouraging professionals who grew up in villages and are working in cities to return to their roots. He points out to advantages from avoiding the traffic to stress-free life and a healthy environment. Also, they can facilitate the transformation of villages and work for social causes. To advocate the cause, he started the Come Home campaign on October 2, 2012.He has shared his experiences on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Youtube, Twitter and Facebook, he has also been writing for publications. He has been posting information about his activities in his blog ProfessionalBharati.com.After successfully working from the village for 3 years, which he considers the most peaceful and productive years of his career, James decided to write a book to spread the word. He took a break from his work for the purpose and as he was in the process of writing, the turn of events compelled him to work for the cause of the most neglected crop of the state  jackfruit.Though I cherished jackfruit in all its forms, specifically jackfruit meal  a unique tradition of Kerala, I never thought that I would be so much associated with the fruit, James said. While I was working on the book, unknowingly I was observing the jackfruit tree in the backyard, different stages of the fruit from tender to ripe and slowly realised that most of the fruits go waste not only in Kerala, but also in the entire country.Soon curiosity gave way to planning and action. Jackfruit, though known for its utility value, has been given the tag of a poor mans food. James decided to take it to larger cross-section of society and experiment with different dishes--both traditional and exotic. After research he realised that in certain areas the crop is popular as a vegetable and in most places it is used as a fruit. The arduous task of cutting the fruit kept it away from consumers. Thus he wanted to try it out in different recipes both as a vegetable and as a fruit.Whenever I had food with potato as base, I felt that jackfruit would be a better substitute for mashed potato both taste and health-wise, says James. His idea was to make jackfruit a universal vegetable and ensure that it replaces potato at least in places where it is grown.For the purpose, he contacted leading chefs with whom he had a good network. But convincing them took some time as they were reluctant to use it for three reasons--seasonal, messy to prepare and the strong aroma. Though it proved to be a task, he succeeded and the result was amazing. Chefs were fascinated to see the range of dishes that could be prepared using a jackfruit. This led to experimenting hundreds of dishes from jackfruits, both traditional and contemporary.He also launched jackfruit365 to sell freeze-dried ripe jackfruit and raw jackfruit. The venture solved two problems attached to jackfruit--seasonal and messy. The venture evoked overwhelming response. Soon he became the flagbearer for jackfruit in Kerala, also networking similar efforts.As the jackfruit initiative became popular more and more people expressed keenness to know more about the Come Home campaign too. All credit to the jackfruit campaign, a reputed publishing house like the Penguin Books India came forward to publish my first book  Gods Own Office. The book, which was released on October 2, 2014, narrates Jamess fascinating journey from the backwaters of Kerala to become an achiever in the corporate world and then treading the unique path of working for the corporate world out of his village.Here is a response from a professional - Reading God's Own Office gave me the courage to chuck up a full-time corporate role and return to Kozhikode. I've co-founded a boutique BPO, voice call centre and tax and financial advisory in Kozhikode.By the time he completed writing the book, James decided not to go back to corporate life and continue the jackfruit campaign and founded another start-up called Gods Own Food Solutions for the purpose. James had observed that the jackfruit meal of Kerala, where unripe jackfruit displaces rice and wheat, had resulted in hypoglycaemic incidents when taken with insulin.He also found that in many instances, where jackfruit when used instead of rice or wheat, has reversed the diabetes condition. He took this clue forward, worked with doctors, scientists, chefs and consumers. The recent study by Sydney Universitys Glycaemic Index Research Service has mentioned that the glycaemic load and carbohydrate content is the lowest in unripe jackfruit compared to rice and wheat and its high fibre content leads to low absorption of sugar."

They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."

The educated form a big percentage of the beggar population in our country, announced a recent survey. Such reports bring back my childhood memories in a close-knit town of Kerala (now is a big city) where beggars were a part, albeit remote, of society rather than faceless entities.It was a time when giving alms was looked upon as ones duty and a way of helping a fellow being in distress rather than an insult to humanity and endorsement of idleness. The social scenario then had its own way of efficiently and instantly lapping up the problems thrown by the society, and the issues of destitutes and beggars were one of them.Beggar colonies were unheard of, as were starvation deaths. Beggars were seldom shooed away to make way for VIPs and their visits, for they restricted themselves to their shelters in temple compounds and other public places that could afford to house them and made their presence felt only one day a week.Beggars begged out of real and utter helplessness, thankful for what ever they got and seldom laid their hands on what ever came their way. Perhaps, all this lent a semblance of respectability even to this group. The aim of this write-up is not to glorify beggary but to recall the interesting characters who frequented our locality and how things were then.The sick and the infirm, the old and handicapped, childless couples with none to fall back on  the households were familiar with them all and took their weekly visits in their stride.Questions were seldom asked, judgements rarely passed and none went back empty handed because it was just a few handful of grains that each household had to spare to nurture a life or two.There was this interesting old man who collected a cup of rice from one house, dal from another, a bowl of oil from a third, couple of potatoes and papads from others, thus filling up his larder for the coming week. The coins that he earned could have gone into buying spices, fuel , tea and milk, I suppose. A fine example of prudent management of resources and life!The Hindi-speaking Kamalabai-Damodar pair, who managed to eke out their living despite the language barrier is still etched in my memory. The dominating wife and the hapless husband often formed the subject of discussion for the families during times of limited modes of recreation. I remember how Kamalabai once gulped down a coconut shell full of pickle that my mother gave meant to last them for days, just to spite the husband who looked on helplessly!Beggars on the move caught my attention when my sister got married and train travels to visit her became frequent. The blind beggar on the train, who groomed himself in the waiting room mirror unaware of being watched; the mute who distributed printed matter attested by some obscure VIP explaining his plight and requesting help (which the VIP himself couldve have done) became all to familiar to me.These days, in mega city Bengaluru, my encounters with this tribe is limited mostly to the traffic signals. Here, they seem have devised their own ways to suit the fast city that shelters them."
59042d817be9e02646bdcc22,Diabetes and diet:  the low-carb debate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/572608/diabetes-diet-low-carb-debate.html,2016-09-26,,Deccan Herald,"Diabetes and diet: the low-carb debateBy Gina Kolata, Sep 27, 2016, International New York Times 23:58 ISTA few years ago, Dr Richard Kahn, the now-retired chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organising a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes.When you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak, Kahn said in a recent interview. Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss  and for weight loss, there is no magic diet.But people want diet advice, Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agricultures food pyramid.Why? Its a diet for all America, Kahn said. It has lots of fruit and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat.That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss programme at the Joslin Diabetes Centre at Harvard Medical School.There is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts  or, according to Hallberg, severely restricts  carbohydrates.If the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan, Hallberg said in an email.This would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method. She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a startup developing nutrition-based medical interventions.But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that low-carbohydrate diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a low-carbohydrate diet  it can vary from doctor to doctor.There have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best, said Dr C Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Richard Kahn. But, he said, the answer isnt so straightforward.In support of a diet like Hallbergs, there is one recent short-term study, by Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical centre where they ate carefully controlled diets.The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50% with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.Since diabetes results when the body cant produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating very low carbohydrate diets, Hall said.Some longer-term studies, though, failed to show that low-carbohydrate diets benefited glucose control. Even if diets are effective in the short term, Hall said, the difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term.In an analysis of weight loss diets (not specifically for diabetics) published this summer, he and Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa wrote: Diet adherence is so challenging that it is poor even in short-term studies where all food is provided. When diets are prescribed, adherence is likely to diminish over the long term despite self-reports to the contrary.But short-term studies of just a few weeks, which constitute the bulk of the diet studies, can be misleading, said C Ronald Kahn. In the short term, the low-carbohydrate diet sometimes does better on glycaemic control, he said. But as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with long-term weight loss.The reason the advantage sometimes seen with a low-carbohydrate diet tends to vanish, C Ronald Kahn added, is probably a mixture of people failing to adhere to the diets and their bodies adjusting to them.Lon-term impactAnother issue with low-carbohydrate diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.)Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr Rudolph Leibel, co-director of Columbia Universitys Naomi Berrie Diabetes Centre, effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a benefit. In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks.Hamdy, whose recommended low-carbohydrate diet is less restrictive than the one Hallberg suggests, reports that many patients in his clinic have been able to stay with the diet for as long as five years, losing weight and keeping it off. He presented his study at the 2015 annual conference of the American Diabetes Association and has submitted it for publication. It involved 129 patients. Half were able to lose weight and keep it off, and those who did maintained an average weight loss of 9.5%. Their diabetes was much improved.It is impossible, Hamdy said, to separate weight loss from the diets effects on diabetes because people following such a diet  which limits but does not forbid things like breads, pasta and rice  also lose weight.But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss  the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term  there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates.Experts like David Nathan, director of the diabetes centre and clinical research centre at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes.But, he said, when we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight. What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Nathan said, is how much weight you lose."

For onion, it was (-)64.19 per cent.The rate of inflation in sugar was at 35.36 per cent and that for fruits rose by 13.91 per cent during the month.""The pick-up in wholesale inflation was broadly in line with our expectation, with an adverse base effect outweighing the cooling effect of lower food inflation,"" ICRA Senior Economist Aditi Nayar said.Assocham said prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, has been rising at industry level but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should address using supply side responses.""Government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least 6 months,"" Assocham said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65 per cent and minerals (-)3.44 per cent.The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.42 per cent in August, up from 1.82 per cent in July.ICRA further said core-WPI inflation is expected to inch up further in the coming months and remain in a range of 0.5-2 per cent in the remainder of this fiscal.The WPI inflation for June has been revised upwards at 2.12 per cent, against provisional estimate of 1.62 per cent.""Wholesale inflation has undergone a sizable upward revision of 40-50 basis points for the last four months, which is a source of some concern,"" Nayar said.WPI inflation is expected to print between 4-4.5 per cent in the remainder of 2016, whereas CPI inflation would range within 4-5 per cent in the same months, ICRA said.The rise in WPI inflation in August is in contrast to the retail inflation which eased to a five-month low of 5.05 per cent in the month.The cooling of retail inflation and 2.4 per cent contraction of factory output in July has revived hopes for a rate cut by RBI in its next policy meet on October 4 to boost growth.In its monetary policy review last month, the RBI had maintained status quo on key rates citing upside risks to 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017.Moving towards the new regime, the government had in July notified 4 per cent inflation target for the next five years, based on which the monetary policy committee (MPC) would take its decisions going forward.It also provides for a margin of plus or minus 2 per cent in this target, thus fixing the upper tolerance level at 6 per cent till 2021.The MPC will set interest rates by majority, with a casting vote for the central bank governor in the event of a tie.Out of six members of MPC, three will be from RBI - the Governor, who will be the ex-officio Chairperson, a deputy governor and an executive director.The other three members will be appointed by the central government, on the recommendations of a search-cum-selection committee, headed by the Cabinet Secretary.It remains to be seen whether the October 4 policy could be decided by the MPC."

The official data showed CPI eased to 5.05% in August, compared with 6.07% in July.Two indicesThe divergence in the WPI and CPI is because of the weightage given to items such as food in the two indices. Food prices form a large part of CPI. The August CPI fell on the back of a decline in food prices.But, inflation in both the indices is above the inflation target set by the Monetary Policy Framework. The Monetary Policy Framework, signed by the RBI and the government, retained inflation target at 4%, plus-or-minus, two percentage points.Policy responseIndia Inc, which apprehended that inflation will spike in the coming months, urged the government to take a concerted policy response.Assocham said that prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, have been rising at an industry level, but a recent concern is sugar, which has begun to rise at a much higher rate, and that which policymakers should address using supply-side responses.The government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least six months, it said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65% and minerals (-)3.44%. The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.42% in August, up from 1.82% in July.Rating agency Icra further said that core-WPI inflation is expected to inch up further in the coming months and remain in a range of 0.5-2% in the remainder of this fiscal."

The WPI had fallen 0.85% in March. The industry did not expect change in prices going forward as the monsoon forecast cited a delay in arrival of south-west monsoon.While some price pressure is noted in case of select food items, we dont foresee any significant change in the near term in the inflation trajectory, industry body FICCI said.Prices of products of national interest, including pulses, food articles, cereals and wheat, have been continuously rising, the policymakers should check and address this through supply side responses, said Assocham."

This is the time when night shift workers and party hoppers pack up and go home to have a good days sleep. Once in Bangkok while briskly walking on the footpath, I heard loud music blaring from a parked vehicle and saw empty liquor bottles indicating a pavement party. Some partying sex workers who were there accosted me and would not allow me to move forward. With great difficulty, I could sneak out. In Cape Town, a bunch of drunk goons were about to rob me and thanks to a police patrol car, I could get away to safety.Pre-dawn, is also the time to see and smell freshly arrived vegetables, fruits and flowers. Any passerby in front of K R Market in Mysuru will be exhilarated by the smell of Jasmine and sight of brinjals. Early birds in coastal towns can see freshly caught fish being sorted out and, if lucky, buy the best catch at reasonable price. Seeing the faces of satisfied fisherfolks coming back home with a substantial catch is elevating.Early mornings are also peoples fitness time. One can come across people walking, jogging, doing yoga, clapping their hands. In Hanoi, I saw a group of elderly women convert a footpath into a gym and perform Chinese dance.This is also the time to see different breeds of dogs. I was amused to see walkers in New York carrying plastic bags and scoops to take away their pet dogs poop. I was surprised that people in Antwerp allow their dogs to spoil pavements despite seeing warning signs of hefty fines.Mornings are the times to know the local breakfast habits. It is the time when roadside vendors do roaring business. In Saigon, one can see footpath vendors serving pho, a soup with rice noodles, to customers sitting on low plastic stools. In Ghana, it is burgers and sandwiches, whereas in Sri Lanka it is string hoppers with curry. While walking in the Little India area in Singapore the smell of fresh Idlis linger and while in Belgium, it is the smell of waffles and potato chips. The smell of filter coffee in Tamil Nadu makes one stop and savour a tumbler. It is a sight to see busy office goers grab a plateful of breakfast on the streets and rush to their offices.Dawns are also the time when the smell of printing ink wafts through. Road corners are full of newspaper vendors. As a media man once, I would learn which newspaper sells most in that town by talking to the vendors, apart from quickly glancing at all headlines. As the sun slowly rises, the air smells of petrol and diesel, the chirps of the birds recede and the city comes to life with a lot of noise. Mornings, wherever in the world, are a mirror to the lifestyle of the people of that place."

59043d1b7be9e02646bdd99e,A case for men's handbags,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/528942/a-case-mens-handbags.html,2016-02-14,,Deccan Herald,"A case for men's handbagsAnubhooti Kabra Rathi, February 15, 2016 0:05 ISTWhy can't men carry men's purses or satchels? Don't they have stuff to carry around?I have a strong feeling that ladies handbag is a conspiracy against womankind. Its a contraption to make women lug stuff around. To that end, it's been so successfully glamorised and projected as a must-have accessory that women pine to own not just one, but several of them and are ready to pay a bomb for them too. They gladly tote big versions at the risk of injuring their arms, neck and shoulders.I agree, its a need based thing. Men have pockets. Women have bags. All fair there but as one gets out of single life, a man's pockets are still for himself while a woman's handbag becomes a free for all. All things that a man can't carry in his pockets, find a respite in the ladys bag. Picture a family outing. Dad is hands free whereas Mom is saddled with a bag. Let's have a look inside this bag. Hankies or tissues, a little snack, a bottle of water, coupons for shopping, house keys, shopping bags (if she is a green person like me), a pen, a little notebook, sanitiser, safety pin, an umbrella (depends on weather), charger, a band-aid and what not! Of course her wallet, phone and makeup also manage to find a place in it.During my student days, when my class went to an industrial trip, there was a guy who carried a camera around. He would always request a girl in the group to put his camera in her bag. To carry a backpack for a camera was just too much work and it was convenient to pop it inside the nearest available bag and who else would be carrying a bag but a lady in the group!In Singapore, I spotted a guy holding his girlfriend's bag. Over my few days stay there, this was a recurring sight. I found it to be very endearing. If men didnt carry their own bags, they were at least ready to give respite to their better halves. They did it with quite an aplomb too. But back home, if you ask your worse half to carry your handbag for a while, he would consider it no less than an act of hara-kiri. He would look around furtively lest he is caught red-handed by an acquaintance, then grudgingly carry it for the minimal possible time and dump it back on you like a sack of hot potatoes at the next opportune moment.Why cant men carry mens purses or satchels? Yeah, mens bags are available in store shelves but are quite a rarity on mens shoulders. Dont they have stuff to carry around? Ladies, why dont we encourage menfolk to carry their own bags? I am quite looking forward to the day when I am not carrying a bag and still, all my stuff is accessible because my husband is carrying one. Time for some sweet revenge! If you are looking for a gift for your beloved this Valentines month, do consider a mens bag for the man in your life. Trust me, you will thank me for it and so might he!"
590466d27be9e04154df657a,Murud Janjira: The unconquered fort,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/paperweight/a-frugal-bachelor-king-rama-for-india/,2016-12-26,,The Times Of India,"The passenger behind me shook his head. I curled my finger, a little disappointed, a lot relieved. The small island fort out in the sea was not it after all. It was only Kansa Qila, built by Shivajis son Sambhaji to capture the mightiest sea fort of them allMurud Janjira.The bus raced down another bend in the road, then another and another. The sea wormed in and out of the rocks on the shore just the same. I cast another hopeful look at the passenger behind me. Its behind that hill, he replied, calmly emptying a packet of supari in his hand.That hill seemed light years away. How did Sambhaji hope to take janjira from his fort on this side of the hill, I wondered. The bus went around another curve, this time uphill. A fairytale palacespires and allcame into view. We had reached Murud without a trace of Janjira.Early BirdThe first catamaran for Mandwa leaves Gateway of India at 8:10 a.m. I had reached Churchgate station before seven. Outside, the pavements were already alive. Men in vests were peeling boiled potatoes for the samosas and vadas that would feed thousands in the course of the day. A rickshaw puller emptied a bucket of water over his head. Some others slept culled up under worn sheets.I walked slowly, saving every calorie for the long day ahead. At 7:30, I pocketed my ticket and walked into the catamaran waiting at the jetty. The sleek boat was a world apart from the noisy and smoky launch that I had taken to Elephanta a month ago. The padded interior was a little musty but the plush seats and air-conditioning more than made up for that little inconvenience. The best part was that the boat did not roll. No sir she was steadier than a train all the way.We reached Mandwa jetty in just under an hour. Some of the passengers were spending the weekend at the beach resorts in Mandwa itself but most others bundled inside a connecting bus for Alibag. Forty minutes later it dropped us in a busy market place. My watch showed 10:00 a.m. Everything had moved with clockwork precision this far.The state transport bus stop was just down the road. A five-minute wait at the stop ended with two Murud-bound buses rolling in together. But there was no question of being spoilt for choice as both were packed. I squeezed into one, apologising at every step for my tripods misdemeanours.Not for long, I reassured myself every time the bus hit a bump or pothole. Indeed, how long could a journey worth a 26-rupee ticket last? An hour, give or take 10 minutes, right? I was wrong: it took all of two hours to cover the 50 km to Murud!The invasionThe bus did not stop at the fairy-tale palace but I made a mental note to see it later. For now my mind was entirely set on seeing Janjira, which had eluded us right up to the town market.Shared rickshaws ply between Murud and Rajpuri village, from where one takes a boat to the island fort. I was lucky to find a rickshaw almost upon alighting from the bus. Ten minutes of phut-phutting later I got my first fleeting glimpse of Janjira through a gap in the hills. All I could make out in those few moments was that the fort was big. Well worth the visit.The chase ended in Rajpuri. Janjira stood like a giant baiting fish in waist-deep water. Its black middle stretched like an ogres belly. The turrets dipped in the sea like so many thick arms And it waited rock-like as our tiny boat sailed in quest of its maw.StoriesThere were 23 of us on the boat. Three crew and the rest visitors. The boat made good time under sail. It first shot at a tangent to the fort, then turned right to approach the main gate. It was time for the lead boatman to get into his act.See that, he cried out pointing to a piece of rock, It was a beacon. The soldiers lit a lamp on it every night to warn incoming ships. Swinging around, he pointed to the forts front. You wont find the main gate even if you looked for it all day but dont worry, we know every inch of the fort.It was an obvious preface. As the boat was about to dock on the island, the boatman again cleared his throat. Now youre at the fort, he announced, but believe me you wont see any of its wonders on your own. Take one of us along as a guide. Itll be just 200 rupees.The water reached almost to the top of the steps leading up to the main gate. The boat docked against a large rock near the first turret. We disembarked and slid along the wall, the boatman following with an offer to guide us for Rs 150.The sea, though it lapped gently against the rocks, didnt lull anyone into believing it. One look at the sunken blocks of the fort wall told a tale of its deceptive fury. Standing under the arch of the main gate I wondered how the kolisfisherfolkhad fortified the island with wood. The story goes that the kolis built a wooden fort in the early 16th century to fend off pirates and robbers. However they themselves became an unruly lot after that and their headman Ram Patil began defying orders of his sovereign, the ruler of Ahmednagar. When the king had enough, he sent a detachment to consign Ram Patil and the wooden fort to history.Construction of the existing fort started in 1567 and was completed in 1571. in the next three centuries it came under attack from the Marathas, Portuguese and the British but its Abyssinian governors managed to beat back every attack.I had expected to see some stout buildings within the robust walls but was disappointed. The fort did have many buildings but all of them, including the large palace in the centre, were in ruins.I was studying this desolation fro the fort wall when the boatman came up from behind and pointed to a small room right below. that was the entry to the tunnel leading to the mainland. I motioned him to lead the way but he laughed, oh no, the government closed it in 1972.A boat was coming in to dock at the fort. I peered over it through the battlements, one hand resting on the biggest cannon in Janjira. Kalal Bangri, said the boatman slapping the cannons rump. It is the third biggest cannon in the country: all of 25 tonnes. She could shoot up to 12 miles.Two other cannons looked out on the sea by the side of the big one and numerous others were strewn around. Not the best post-retirement arrangement for Janjiras fiery defences.Sambhajis Kansa Qila was in firing line of the northern walls battlements. It sat on the waves like a sniper stalking the giant of Janjira. The boatman pointed to the breaks in its walls, see, Kalal Bangri did that. He sounded like a proud father of the gun. Then he clapped to draw everybodys attention to the cracked battlements of janjira. This is the seas doing. In the rains, the waves strike the rock below and splash this high, he said, drawing oohs and aahs.Walking around the fort we came across two large gardens of algae. At one time they held fresh waterJanjiras strongest defence while it lasted and undoing if it ever ran out.The water never ran out, of course, and the boatman thanked pir baba for it. As we were coming out of the fort, he bowed before the saints mazaar next to the gate and spun his last yarn as a guide.This fort was built to protect the mazaar from the sea. So you see the mazaar is even older than the fort, which itself is 1,000 years old, he spoke expansively. how thousand years, I asked him. why, dont you know the fort was built in 1111, he replied. But AD or AH, mny friend? The fellow had got the date from a plaque commemorating some additions to the fort.Taking LeaveOne thing I dearly wanted to do before leaving Murud was to photograph its palace but I hadnt factored in the time it would take to gain a royal audience. When my card showed no sign of returning with a reply even after half an hour of waiting outside the gate, I did what Sambhajis Marathas were famous forshoot and scoot. Not that it hurt Muruds invincibles in any way"
590470fe7be9e04154df6c8e,Bikaner’s amazing street food,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/paperweight/national-anthem-tales-from-long-ago/,2016-12-02,,The Times Of India,"The mirchi bada is as big as a brinjal, and tawny like a camel. It stands amongst others of its kind on the counter of Bhikaram Chandmal, one of Bikaners best snacks-and-sweets shops. It isnt the thing for me, I know, but my finger has pointed at it. Now, it is lying on its tummy, turning around slowly in the white microwave. In a few moments, it will rest in my hand, daring me to bite. Were the shop crowded, I could have slunk away, but it is that in-between hour, between breakfast and lunch, when Bikaneris reluctantly go off to work.Beep-beep-beepmy time is up. A paper plate floats before me eyes. The idle salesman fixes his gaze upon me. I clamp my eyes shut, open my mouth wide and dig into the mirchi bada Nothing happens at first. The thick jacket of deep-fried besan lulls the taste buds into dropping their guard. Then, the chilli strikes with its full incendiary force. It has been deseeded and filled with even more potent spices. It sets my tongue aflame, makes my ears turn red and leaves my brow dripping with sweat. But I am glad I have been introduced to Bikaneri food the Rajput way, with a trial by fire!Savouring itIt is only the first of my three afternoons in Bikaner: the land of bhujia and legendary bhujiawalas like Haldirams and Bikanervala. And I am determined to savour every one of the towns many sweet and spicy treats. So, shortly after checking in at the RTDC hotel, I have made my way towards Station Road, the new hub of Bikaners bhujia- and mithai-walas.After the mirchi bada, everything else on the counter seems tame stuff. Some of it, like the dhokla and the besan papdi, is not even of Bikaneri extraction, but then the Bikaneri, although blessed with a discriminating palate, never discriminates against food from other places. As one friendly local puts it, We love food, not politics. I certainly admire his sentiment but see no point in celebrating the masala dosa and aloo tikki in Bikaner. For now, I want strictly Bikaneri treats, and the mirchi badas counter-mate, the kofta, becomes my next prey.Kofta? The Bikaneri variety doesnt look like any I have eaten before. It is round and batter-cased like a batata vada,probably a pakora by another name, but it signs off like neither. Behind its thick besan defence lies a thin shield of soft, white paneer. And then, the invading teeth sink into a spicy mash of potatoes mined with plump, juicy raisins. Salty, spicy and sweet (in that order), the flavours rise and fall with each move of the jaw. The kofta doesnt stand a chance against my appetite, but even in its loss it wins a lifelong adherent in me.Bhikaram-Chandmals stands in a lane leading towards Kot Gate, away from Station Road, but from its entrance I can clearly see the small outlet of Bikaji, flagbearer of the nationwide Haldiram brand in Bikaner. Further down Station Road lies Laljis, precursor of the not less illustrious Bikanervala and Bikano brands. And still further stands the local favourite, Chhotu Motu Joshi. I reckon it is time to move on from Bhikaram Chandmal, but not before some gond halwa.This halwa is a winter specialty: quite evident from the number of black peppers in it. It is also completely soaked in ghee. It would be the perfect thing to have of a January night in Delhi, but this is a February afternoon in Bikaner, so I decide to go easy on it. Although made out of whole wheat flour, it just melts away in the mouth, leaving behind a taste of coconut, almonds and pepper. As for the gond (gum), the halwa contains some amount of a natural gum (gum Arabica), which also goes into the making of its (rather distant) cousin, the gond pak, but that I will try laterThe Bikaji outlet is a maze of namkeens. Jars and packets full of the crisp, spicy savouries line its counter and shelves, but I am only interested in the original, unevolved bhujia, Bikaners most famous export and a national habit today. Although the bhujia has spawned many variants, including the very popular aloo bhujia, the basic variety remains by far the most sought after. In Bikaner, it is invariably mixed with thick, extra spicy nuggets called dhankoli.Now, bhujia is made across the country today, so what makes the real Bikaneri bhujia stand apart, I ask the old salesman. The flavour, he says. Everything from the air of the place, to the water used for mixing the ingredients and the oil used for frying the bhujia matters, he explains. Talking of oil, the better shops in Bikaner all use groundnut oil for frying. It is expensive, but imparts a splendid flavour and aroma to the bhujia that palm oil, vanaspati and other cheapies are completely incapable of producing.The first-time visitor would be astonished by the number of bhujiawalas and mithaiwalas in Bikaners markets. Every second shop here is a shrine to the palate, seemingly of considerable age, and evidently with no dearth of patrons. At Laljis, for instance, the crowd always spills out onto Station Road. Although gond pak is at the top of my mind as I approach the shop, its their moti pak that tempts me most.This one is a rich sweet that looks the part. It is decorated with silver leaf and rose petals, and tickles the palate with its granular, albeit soft, texture. Although it tastes very different, the moti pak turns out to be a sibling of the ubiquitous motichoor laddu thats a staple of north Indian weddings and also temple prasad. Unlike the laddu, though, it has more ghee and considerably less sugar. So, the stomach, rather than the palate, is the limiting factor!Laljis also does numerous halwas, and while I can resist the newfangled pineapple variant, their moong dal halwa is another thing. How much, asks the man at the counter. A plate, I say, then quickly correct myself: would 50 grams be possible? The man gives me an amused look and hands me a sampler  gratis. And I finish it, although my stomach is now threatening to do rude things. Phew! And Ive only been to three shops so far Station Road suddenly seems an interminable stretch. I give up  for the time being  and head back to my hotel.This kind of indulgence needs serious practice. And in order to do better the next day, I need to calm my stomach now. So, no dinner tonight: only bananas and oranges. The restraint pays off, and morning arrives to find me VERY hungry. I leave the hotel at a very early 8am (its winter), and walk the 3km to Station Road with the twin aims of killing time and further honing my appetite. But I arrive none too soon. The discarded daunas outside the shops suggest the party is already over.Well, not quite: jalebis are still frying at Chhotu Motu Joshis. And theyre supposed to be the best in town. The Bikaneri jalebi, unlike the fat, juicy one at Chandni Chowks Jalebiwala, are very thin and very crisp. The batter for them is not squeezed out of a cloth but allowed to leak out of a pot under its own weight. And while I do have reservations about their cheery red colour, a bite is all it takes to banish them.I have begun the day on a sweet note, and were I a child still, I would be happy to pamper my sweet tooth some more. But age and last nights fruity dinner make a strong case for something salty, and spicy. The kachoris in Chhotu Motus hot case are probably an hour old now, but a microwave can easily remedy that. Two kachoris later, I am all set for one last sweet before starting with the sightseeing.Its a tossup between the ghewar and the gond pak at Bhikarams. And not willing to spurn either, I try a bit of both. The ghewar, well, is milder than what we get in Delhi, and topped with cream to boot. But the gond pak is a revelation. Although made from humble wheat flour, and closely related to the gond halwa, it has a character all its own. Yes, it wouldnt melt in the mouth without the plentiful ghee, but whoever said sweets would help you to a size zero figure!To neutralise the sweet taste, I pop in some crisp hara matar (sun-dried and fried green peas) and moong. Neither of these simple, healthy and delicious namkeens are mainstream in the big cities. Sigh! Tonight, it will have to be a normal dinner, and tomorrow, again, I might not find the time to indulge myself on this many-flavoured street. But before leaving this town, I promise to find Gulab Singhs shop in bhujia bazaar that specialises in phini, that oh-so-fine delicious labour of love. Its said that an expert phini maker can draw 4,000 strands of phini from a lump of dough. Ill see how, before I go!"

Lets be honest  there is no better phase in life than childhood. This Childrens Day, users on Quora reveal the most foolish things they did while growing up1. I tried to prove that girls can pee standing.This traces back to the second or third grade. I wondered how was it that guys could pee standing. That gave them the advantage of peeing anywhere they wanted, especially in cases of urgency. That was unfair. I thought it was because their pants had a zipper. But then I discovered, we have zippers too. Perhaps we can pee standing too, just someone needed to set the trend.The day came when we were at a relatives marriage party, and I needed to pee urgently. My mom took me to the washroom and I decided to prove it.I came out with wet pants. My mom didnt understand how her little genius suddenly managed to wet her pants completely after years of peeing properly. I spent the rest of the party in the car. I was still unable to understand why I failed.Yeah. I get the reason now. Barbie Giri, med student from Jamshedpur2. I was a curious child, a very curious child. I had a lot of questions, lot of answers, and it was my lifes motive to know how things worked and cranked. And yes, I was especially curious about how fire worked!Age 5: While sitting on the balcony in my grandmas house (on the 2nd floor) I saw a black cat strolling on the roadside. So like any 5 year old, I gauged the height of my jump, considered the acceleration due to gravity, and calculated the velocity at which I would hit the ground. And I jumped. (Un)fortunately I fell on the 1st floor and by the time I regained my senses, the cat had run away (much to my dismay). I told everyone how my pencil had fallen down, and earned praises of being stupid but studious. Score.Age 7: During summer vacations, I borrowed homework notebooks of my neighbor, took them under my bed (with her), and set them on fire. Yes, under the bed. Needless to say that the bedsheet caught fire, that she outed me, that there was a lot of explanation to do and a ton of apologies to be made by my mother. Score.Age 8-9: During Diwali, the festival of lights, I was curious to know if a Chakarghinni would rotate when kept in my palm. Yes, in my palm. I learnt a lesson that it would surely rotate, but at the same time, would burn the hell out of my hand. My hand was ash white for 2 weeks, and I chose to bandage it with 20-30 bandaids and hide it from my parents for 2 weeks by wearing gloves, day and night. Ouch.Age 10: Now I wanted to know how plastic burned. I began collecting different kinds of plastic materials  cellophane sheets, plastic bags, pens, bubble wraps, balls, packaging, and even my toys  and started burning them sequentially. Little did I know that plastic drops like this (see image below), when burned. I have faint marks all over my left foot to prove the phenomenon.Age 11: Now I knew how plastic burned and also how crackers burned in my hands. However, I didnt know how they burned if someone lit the entire lot  rockets, anaars, bombs, etc.,  altogether. My theory was that they would burn in a matter of seconds in a huge explosion and of course I decided to test the theory. 15 odd people sitting in the living room suddenly rushed for cover as rockets came hurling at them from the lawn. Rest is history.Age 12: My interest now shifted to anything electronic and mechanical. I would take apart every toy to see how it worked, and mostly manage to put it back together too. So one day I found an LED and found it to be very pretty  such glorious light! Such glory! However, the LEDs light was quite dim, so I hypothesized that it wasnt getting enough current. Guess what, I decided to put it in the AC socket while holding it (yes, while holding it), and switched on the power button. Ouch.Age 12: Did this, many many times, at the top of a 4 storied building because we were just being playful (yes, just being playful) and this felt like being on the edge, quite literally.Age 13: Electronics was still the in-thing in my life. Once our Television set stopped working, so the electrician came home to repair it. This is how the back of a television set looks when zoomed in:Curious, I decided to see what these little colored cylinders were. I pulled them all out, and took them to the electrician to ask him what they were. Yes. The TV was destroyed (for a while!) till they could find a replacement PCB and it cost a bomb.Age 14: We had just learned of solenoid  a thin loop of wire, often wrapped around a metallic core, which produces a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through. The concept of seeing electricity and magnetism work together made me drool with delight. So of course, like any excellent physicist, I considered the current, number of turns, and the length, to calculate the magnetic field (calculated it incorrectly by an order of 2), and then I decided to test it. I used makeshift garage parts, and plugged the wires into an AC socket Yes and ouch!There were many more of these foolish, funny, and scary acts that I did as a child. In hindsight it all sounds quite scary! I must mention that I was an extremely mischievous & sneaky child and it was difficult to find me if I didnt want to be found; my parents really did their best! I am very lucky to survive most of these unscathed (for life, at least!).PS: Whatever little my parents know, those things are still talk of the town when my aunts and uncles visit from other cities. Akash Raman3. Managed to get my right thumb chopped off.Take a look at this contraption:Can you see the long handle/bar at to the 4 oclock position of the wheel? My brother (15) and I (9) were playing a game where I would sit on that handle, and my brother would then grab hold of the rim of the wheel and give it a quick half-circle spin, clockwise. As the wheel turned, and the handle went up, I would rise up 4 feet in the air, and then come down when the wheel turned the other way as my brother let go of the wheel. It was fun. In fact, exhilarating. It was our own mini-amusement-park, experience-free-fall ride.Did I forget to mention that the curved S shape in the the middle of the wheel (giving the wheel a yin-yang shape) is actually two semicircular blades? This contraption is used for chopping sticks and other cattle-fodder into little 1-inch bits. You stuff a stick in the gaping mouth like opening that you see just above the handle, and as you turn the wheel the two blades alternately slice off anything thats sticking out of the mouth.So, we were playing there. And since the handle was a little high off the ground compared to the height of my butt, so I couldnt get on it without support. So here was the sequence we followed:1. Put my hands in the mouth of the machine for support2. Sit on handle3. Remove hands4. Brother turns the wheelNeither of us had yet done our computer science degrees, so we did not see that the algorithm has a race condition, and we ended up doing #3 and #4 in the wrong order. I was lucky to get my left hand out, and most of my right hand out of the mouth before the blade descended, but ended up losing my right thumb in the process.This was the result:Fortunately, it wasnt as bad as you might expect. I learnt to write with the remaining fingers of my right hand  I hold the pen between my index and middle fingers. Thats me holding a bottle:My studies did not suffer  nor did anything else. In fact, I am not disabled or even inconvenienced in any way. The only things that I cannot really do well are peeling potatoes, and bowling  thats it. Otherwise, it is hardly noticeable. Navin Kabra, founder of a startup and father of 2 kids4. I tried to make my own powerpuff girlsWhen I was some 5 years old, I was always curious while watching the show on how did Professor Utonium create those girls. The starting theme of the show gave some instructions (sugar, spice and everything nice) but I never got to know what is the coveted chemical X.Then in one of the episodes, The Rowdyruff Boys (Episode), it was shown that Mojo Jojo made Rowdyruff boys by accidentally dropping everything in the toilet. EUREKA!!Next thing which I did, I gathered all my toys and things which were fun (everything nice) some sugar and salt to create my own Powerpuff Girls. I threw everything I owned in the toilet, and flushed. Expecting to see some creatures flying out, I was disappointed when I saw nothing but everything getting ruined and making loud noises.My mom came running to see and demanded an explanation. I tried my best but she just couldnt understand. If only she knew how big of a genius I was. Sigh. Shobhit Bakliwal, Rajasthan5: Disclaimer: This post contains a nude child, undies and sambar.This happened when I was 5/6 years of age. My family and some visiting cousins were having lunch in the dining table. I had finished early and wanted to use the loo. Now, I had this habit of removing all my clothes before I went into the bathroom (sadly enough). And so there I was, in the hall, underwear in hand, ready to run towards the bathroom, for which I had to pass through the dining hall.I start running, and as I pass the dining table, I see my mum. And all of a sudden I feel like she should be the one holding my undies, and so I throw it at her!Now let me explain how throwing works.That day came to be called the Jetty Sambar day. I remember feeling really stupid and embarrassed after that. I mean, who wouldnt!? Shyam Krishna, KozhikodeWhat was the most foolish thing you did as a kid? Let us know in the comments section."
590471497be9e04154df6d05,The killer loved his kids,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/afp-journalists-diaries/the-killer-loved-his-kids/,2016-12-08,,The Times Of India,"Long before I met Joseph Kony I knew his handiwork. I had covered attacks by his Lord Resistance Army rebel group in Uganda for years, including one in 1996 that will stay with me forever. It was in the village of Acholpii, where his henchmen massacred some 100 people. As in other LRA raids, the village was burned and bodies were scattered all over. But thats not what struck me. As I walked into the bush at the edge of the village, I saw a baby, alive and sucking at the breast of his mother. Who was dead.The LRA had razed plenty of villages like this. In April the previous year 300 people died in Atiak, in February 2004 more than 200 would die in Barlonyo. Kony, a self-styled mystic and prophet, launched a bloody rebellion against Kampala some three decades ago, seeking to impose his own version of the Ten Commandments on northern Uganda. Since then, his LRA has slaughtered more than 100,000 people and abducted some 60,000 children.The LRA was pushed out of Uganda around 2004. Before the eviction, a series of failed peace talks were held with Kony and his lieutenants  thats when I met him and his top commanders, including Dominic Ongwen, who this week went on trial at the International Criminal Court at The Hague on 70 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the first LRA member to ever go on trial.When the peace talks were announced in July 2006 I scrambled to get there. There turned out to be a Congolese hamlet few people could locate on a map. The first leg of the journey to get there took place in a UN Antonov, to the notorious town of Maridi in South Sudan. We landed in heavy rain, with the nervous Russian pilots not even turning off the engines, so that they could leave the lawless town as fast as possible.Bullets for boozeI sheltered in a bar where South Sudanese soldiers traded their bullets  measured out in plastic cups  for the same volume of moonshine gin or bottles of Ugandan beer. Afterwards they staggered off into the darkness, assault rifles and light machine guns dangling from their shoulders as they swigged their drinks and threatened to shoot anyone who stood in their way.A journey to nowhereThe next day we travelled further into the unknown, by 44 towards the place where South Sudan, Congo and CAR meet and where Kony had agreed to meet the press and the peace delegates. If it can be called a road at all, it was without doubt the worst I have ever seen, not that it slowed our South Sudanese military drivers (some of whom Im sure I recognised from the bar the night before and some of whom drank beer as they drove).Branches and thorns tore at my clothes as I bumped along in the back of the pick-up, clinging hard to the side. On at least three occasions different drivers rolled their vehicles over, sending passengers and possessions flying.After a long day we reached an isolated South Sudan army camp called Nabanga and were offered abandoned, flea-ridden huts without doors to sleep in. For the next four days sacks of maize were my mattress and pillow, and biscuits and water were my meals as we waited for Kony. He never showed up.Despite the disappointment I tried again when another opportunity arose. This time the UN airlifted us to Nabanga, avoiding the drunken high-speed drive through the forest. From there we drove deeper into the jungle to a place called Ri-kwangba where Vincent Otti, Konys number two and himself an alleged notorious murderer, was waiting for us.When we got there, dreadlocked young LRA rebels searched us, then disappeared with our bags as the march began. It was a fearful six-hour walk through forest and across rivers. What if Kony changed his mind and killed us all?As darkness fell we reached a clearing that was the LRAs main camp. It nestled beneath dense forest cover, with a high rock shielding its northern side and another on its eastern flank which doubled as a lookout. A spring on top of one of the rocks was said to be a sacred place for Kony. The water issuing from it was pristine, clear and cold, gushing into a narrow gorge overlooking the camp. In another clearing there were gardens of sweet potatoes, beans and vegetables. In a way, it was idyllic.We were told to wait and ordered not to use phones or cameras until given permission to do so. A fire was lit as the temperature dropped.Later, I was shown to a thatched shelter where a basin of warm water had been placed outside along with a bar of soap, a towel and a sponge. As I washed I wondered how I would find my way back to Uganda if things went wrong. I wondered whether the rebels would kill us in the night or if the Ugandan army would launch an assault. I wondered whether Kony would show up this time around.We ate a dinner of rice, maize bread, sweet potatoes, fresh vegetables and smoked game meat. It was a welcome change from the dry biscuits of the previous Kony expedition. After supper I spoke with Otti by the fire. He was curious about life in Kampala, the Ugandan capital.It was shortly after dawn when I saw Kony. He was behind a grass fence, wearing a T-shirt and an army cap, and playing with a baby who looked to be just a few months older than the one I had found suckling at his dead mothers breast in Acholpii.The time had come at last to meet this notorious warlord and his top commanders, including Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen who, like Kony and Otti, were wanted for war crimes by the ICC. Today, only Ongwen has been arrested after turning himself in. Kony remains at large, while Otti and Odhiambo are believed dead.We drank tea together but spoke little. Ongwen was especially quiet and guarded. When Kony finally appeared he had changed into full military gear. We shook hands.During a rambling two-hour speech Kony  who claims spirit guidance  was frequently incoherent and prone to sheepish laughter. He denied killing people, claiming instead that he was fighting for my people meaning the Acholi tribe of northern Uganda. Otti later clarified that sometimes people might die during crossfire.We stayed for days as efforts to start formal peace negotiations between Kony and the Ugandan government dragged on, and the LRA fighters and leaders got used to us being around. One evening Kony joined us as we watched a Jackie Chan kung-fu movie on Ottis portable DVD player. I dont remember which movie it was, but I remember that he often giggled, laughed and stamped his feet as Jackie Chan delivered punches to his opponents.The day after, we began the long journey back to Kampala. The talks, sadly, did not result in peace and although the Ugandan massacres I once reported on have stopped in Uganda, the violence continues elsewhere  after being pushed out of Uganda, LRA continues to terrorize part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.Displaced people from the villages around the northern Uganda town of Lira return home 22 November 2003 after having spent the night in safety downtown Lira.Meeting in person some of the worlds most wanted men was a surreal experience. As I shook hands with him, I thought of the hundreds, if not thousands, of people who had been brutalized because of those hands. When our eyes met, he looked nervous and looked away. He appeared to be engrossed in his own world most of the time, but enjoyed the company of others.But it was a rewarding experience as well, because it helped me to better understand the conflict and its players. I never expected Kony, a man allegedly responsible for so much death and suffering to be loving with children. But he was. His numerous wives and children were at the compound when we were there and I often saw him playing with his children. He bounced one on his knee and carried others around on his chest.He had several wives and the children had nannies, mainly young girls who had been abducted from their homes and who would eventually become his wives too.He laughed. It was rare, but he would usually burst into laughter unexpectedly. He didnt smoke or drink alcohol, but he served me locally-made brown wine, which he said was made from sap from trees in Garamba and that he said he served only to his most valued guests. It was sweet and it made me tipsy for a little while, but that quickly vanished, leaving a sour taste in the mouth. He was a very good host, asking me if I had eaten.I may not be covering the LRA actively anymore, but the story is not over for me. The next step for me  and many in northern Uganda  will be listening to Ongwens testimony during his trial at The Hague and following the course of justice for LRAs victims, like that mother all those years ago whose baby was orphaned in the village of Acholpii.This blog was written with Yana Dlugy in Paris.

590471897be9e04154df6d78,Fortune Tikki at Katra Neel,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/delhi-belly/fortune-tikki-at-katra-neel/,2016-12-07,,The Times Of India,"This aloo tikkiwalla in Old Delhi owes his fortune to a wicket gate. He sits within the historic red-coloured gateway to Chandni Chowks Katra Neel.In another era, this gateway was a mute witness to shots fired from British guns to suppress the waves of men and women who rose to the Mahatmas call during the Quit India Movement in 1942.Gopal Kishen, 60, says he started selling tikkis here in 1975, the year Indira Gandhi declared Emergency. Fearing forced sterilization, the rickshawallas soon vanished from the streets and it was difficult to cart my wares daily from Katra Mangal Sen (near Jama Masjid) to Katra Neel.As a teenager, Gopal learned tikka making from his elder brother, who used to sell them from a pushcart in Kinari Bazaar. What seems like a simple, ready-to-fry snack, he says, involves considerable labour and attention to detail.Preparations begin early morning at Gopals kitchen, in his tenement in Katra Mangal Sen, where pahadi aloo is boiled with minimal water, just enough to cook the potatoes and not let them crack open. The cooked aloo is peeled and left to cool.Then begins the coarse grinding of chana dal that has been soaked overnight. The dal ki pitthi is fried in ghee with jeera, hing and haldi, topped with homemade masala and freshly cut green chilli, ginger and dhania. The stuffing is ready.The aloo is then grated, kneaded with cornflour and stuffed with dal ki pitthi to make patties, which are later shallow fried, at Katra Neel, on a large tawa till they turn golden brown. The crispy tikkis are finally served with a topping of green dhania-pudina and methi chutney or sandwiched in bread.The green chutney is prepared daily but the methi chutney, made with amchur, sugar and kachari powder (derived from a wild variety of cucumber growing mainly in Rajasthan), has a longer shelf life.Gopal says Katra Neel was an affluent neighbourhood when he opened shop, selling a plate of two tikkis with bread for 25 paise. By the mid-80s, rapid commercialization of the area started driving away the families. Even the smaller bylanes are now filled with shops, and houses have turned into godowns, rues Katra Neels RWA president, Harish Chander Mehra.Mehras second-floor house is adorned with photographs of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru awarding him the first National Gallantry Award as a boy scout.Now 73, Mehra says small businesses such as Gopals chaat shop are a community initiative to help economically weaker sections of society. Gopals tikki now sells for Rs 25 a plate.Resting on a cot at his home, Gopal says long hours of sitting in a cramped space have made his knees weak, forcing him to employ workers to man the prized wicket gate. Were it a full gate, the story would have been different.But he takes immense pride in his children doing well in academics  one is an architect, the other an MBA, the third a graduate in hotel management, and the fourth on way to a PhD. All thanks to a humble snack, lapped up by shoppers on the move."
590473777be9e04154df709d,A village where the Earth came back to life,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/environy/a-village-where-earth-came-back-to-life/,2016-08-06,,The Times Of India,"What is home to over a 1000 different species of life and takes a thousand years to grow a centimetre? More clues? Its trampled upon; considered dirty and washed off as soon it comes in contact with you. Always taken for granted, it has never got its fair share of appreciation. Yours truly only realised its importance while researching for this blog post. The answer is soil and the rest of my blog is an ode to this magical harbinger of life.United Nations decided to celebrate 2015 as the year of soil. According to the UN Food Agricultural Organisation, due to the degradation of soil, we can only meet the projected food demands if agriculture production increases globally by 60 percent and in developing countries by 100 percent by 2050.In other words we have just about 35 years to double our agriculture production. For this to be possible it is crucial to improve the soil health.Improving soil healthLets look at some more statistics about our soil health. The populationwhich is set to cross the 9 billion mark by 2050is bound to put immense pressure on the soil as forests, farmlands, pastures and urban areas compete with each other for their fair share of soil. FAO says that about 33 percent of soil globally is already highly degraded due to human activity (read bad agricultural practices, deforestation, pollution, mining etc). This has led to salinisation, erosion, compaction and acidification, chemical pollution and nutrient depletion in the soils around the world.The good news is that sustainable soil management can actually account for an increase in global crop yields by 58 percent. This involves increasing soil organic matter. Now organic matter is the basic building block of soil. Simply put, it consists of decaying plant and animal matter that adds nutrients to the soil and enriches it. The microbes present in the soil help in their decomposition.Organic matter is the life of a soil. You take away the organic matter from the soil it is considered dead. Thats what happens in mining areas, for instance. There is scientific research going on to study the genome of soil, which simply means the living organisms in soil. Bigger the gene pool, healthier the soil is. Not only does it help in recycling of the nutrients back in soil, but it also helps in carbon sequestration (storing carbon in the soil) that can help alleviate global warming , says Dr Samar Datta, former principal scientist with Division of Soil Science and Agriculture Chemistry, Indian Agricultural Research Institute. Dr Datta has developed the Soil Test Fertilizer Recommendation Meter  a portable machine that instantly tests soil samples and prescribes the adequate amount of nutrients that need to be supplemented.A village called KediaSeveral kilometres away from the research labs and the corridors of power, oblivious to rhetorical promises, there lies a small village in Jamui district of Bihar called Kedia, with 99 farmer families. Two years ago the villagers decided to bid goodbye to chemicals and adopt ecological agricultural practices to bring their soil back to life. This meant using biofertilizers and biopesticides, but much more broadly, adopting new techniques to replenish the soil with nutrients from human and animal waste. The results are visible today: good, healthy yields with low input costs with a farmer saving up to Rs 4,000 per crop.Facilitated by Greenpeace India, the farmers in Kedia formed the Jeevit Maati Kisan Samiti to apply for the schemes that were initiated by the Bihar government. Chunni Yadav, a farmer and a member of Jeevit Maati Kisan Samiti was sceptical at the beginning but acknowledged that the mindless use of fertilizers and pesticides had yielded declining results, and was leaving the soil depleted of life-sustaining nutrients. There are several innovative techniques we use instead. Sometimes we use Amritpani (a mixture of cow dung and urine decomposed over a period of several days) and sometimes we use Neemamrit (a pesticide that can be made out of neem) and tobacco stems as pesticides.He admits that it may not work every time. It is mostly trial and elimination for us. You cannot expect a miracle to happen, and certainly not overnight. But we need to conserve the soil for our future generations and we have started to see some amazing results already, says Yadav. Insects and birds such as earthworms and kingfisher birds, which had decided to pack their bags from Kedia are now back in the farms completing the complex food web that helps recycle nutrients back in the soil.Do schemes reach the farmers?Experts and environmentalists have been pointing it out for years, but when FAO set the alarm bells ringing, countries across the world began launching schemes to alleviate soil poverty. Sustainable soil management is now being considered as a potent way to solve global food requirements. But can it be practiced in India where 80 percent of the farming community comprises of small and marginal farmers?Prime Minister Modi too launched a slew of schemes  one of which was a Soil Health Card (launched in December 2015) that over the next three years will target over 14 crore farmers to check the excess use of fertilisers. The card, to be issued after testing soil, would help them save up to Rs 50,000 in 3 acres of land.Schemes have been initiated by the government. There have been research studies carried out to minimize use of chemicals, but it is important that all this reaches the farmer who works at the grassroots, says Dr Datta. While there are research studies underway on the efficacy of these agricultural techniques on increasing yieldsa lot still needs to be done. Depending, as always, on the governments sustained will for effective implementation.With the present schemes and subsidies available, the 96 farmer families in Kedia are championing the cause of eco-agriculture. They now have 282 vermi-composting units installed, with 42.6 percent reduction in chemical fertiliser usage. They have also installed EcoSan (short for Ecological sanitation) toilets that collect and decompose human waste to create manure. Besides this, they are beginning to use smoke-free bio gas plants to cook food the slurry or residue of the plant is then used either as manure or for preparing vermicomposts in a reduced time-frame.As a direct result, the village is now 100 percent pesticide-free and there has been no negative impact on the yield.The beauty of the Kedia model is that it can be easily replicated by the small and marginal farmers all over the country. It is an ideal village that represents 60 percent of the cultivated area of India, which is largely rainfed. A huge majority of the landholding in the village belongs to small and marginal farmers, which further represents over 80 percent of the farmers of the country. Also Kedia has a number of cattle which is crucial for any ecological farming model.Impact of ecological agriculture on Indias economyIshteyaque Ahmad, Greenpeace India campaigner who has worked with the farmers in Kedia explains why Kedias success is both, an ecological and economic one: After one-time investment on creating infrastructure for eco-agriculture, the government can significantly save on fertiliser subsidies of Rs 70,000 crore to Rs one lakh crore every year. It will also reduce the dependence on imported chemicals hence the burden on the countrys exchequer will dramatically reduce.Moreover, lesser exposure to dangerous agro-chemicals will get translated into improved health of the growers and consumers alike and will reduce health costs.Looking AheadEcological agriculture is a labour-intensive process, and some techniques still require further scientific research. Restoring the health of chemical-laden soil, effectively undoing years of damage, will necessarily need hard work and close attention.However, one challenge for the farmers here, is wastage of farm produce due to lack of storage or water harvesting structures. Even with subsidies, small and marginal farmers cannot afford them. Kedias story so far has inspired several people in urban areas to volunteer and donate for a crowd-fund created to raise money for a solar-powered eco-freezer that would reduce crop spoilage. With good storage facilities, not only can a small farmer increase the shelf life of his/her crop, but can also store their own seeds for crops like potato. Everyday the farmers inch closer to their eco-freezer. This small step by Kedia farmers can be a giant leap for the whole small and marginal farming community, which has been vulnerable to financial losses due to crop spoilage.But our farmers are no strangers to challenges. With their hard work, they are ready to go that extra mile to overcome obstacles and ensure safe, healthy food for our future generations.A tiny villagewhich is barely a fraction of a dot in the agricultural map of India, has shown the way, but it is up to the government and civil society organisations to follow suit."
5904737a7be9e04154df70a3,Surging food prices have pushed the wholesale price levels to a 23 month high,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/surging-food-prices-have-pushed-the-wholesale-price-levels-to-a-23-month-high/,2016-08-16,,The Times Of India,"With good monsoons in the current monsoon season breaking a fairly long period of patchy rainfall and the country soon expecting a bumper crop with farmers going on a sowing spree one would have expected the inflation rates to dip in in anticipation of the coming bounty. Unfortunately for the government and the monetary authorities the reverse seems to be happening with wholesale prices almost doubling in the most recent month even as experts caution the government to be on guard against a crash in commodity prices.Thus the WPI indices show that after a fairly long period of falling prices inflation has suddenly started surging with the increases going up from 0.79% in April to 1.24% in May, 1.62% in June and then finally to 3.55% in July. And commodity prices have largely fuelled the pickup. Price of rice, which has been falling till February this year, is now going up by 4% while that of wheat has moved up by close to 7% for a few months now.Similarly prices of other commodities like pulses, potatoes and fruits are soaring up in double digits some rising above even by as much as 50%. Other products like oil seeds have seen prices slowly crawling up to above 5% in recent months even as that of fibres has shot up by more than a quarter in the most recent month mainly due to the anticipated shortfall in cotton output. Sugar has also been doing badly with prices shooting up by more than a third in July.The surge in prices of important commodities, albeit by varying levels, has caused food prices to more than double over the last three months to 11.82% while that of primary articles has almost trebled to 9.38% over the last four months. There is certainly a concern as these price signals could be transmitted into the other sectors of the economy if they remain unchecked.But then prices of other products in the wholesale price index remain under check. Though commodity prices, especially that of food products, has suddenly shown an upturn the world over the huge excess capacities in heavy industry has ensured that prices of metals and metal products continue to fall and that prices of minerals remain far below the peak levels. The trends are also reflected in fuel and power. All this could neutralise the negative trends and hopefully contain the overall impact of the surge in food and commodity prices to some extent.Interestingly the pickup in commodity prices has been followed by a slow increase in manufactured good prices which turned positive in March this year and then slowly edged up to 1.82% by July. A deeper investigation shows that this is more likely to be a cost push inflation as it has been fuelled by an increase in prices of food products, sugar, edible oil and beverages. In fact the surge in cotton prices seems to have even pushed up prices of cotton textiles after many months of decline.Prices increases in most other manufactured goods, like wood, paper, leather, rubber and chemical products however remain sticky at the lower end. Only in case of cement has there been any significant improvement in prices after a long time. Prices of other important manufactured products like machinery and machine tools and transport equipment has almost remained stable for an extended period now. Thus one can say that the huge excess capacities in large segments of manufacturing will help contain the overall impact of any surge in commodity and food prices on the WPI to some extent."

It has provided them with a tool to address crop loss due to damage caused by biotic and abiotic stresses.Agriculturally advanced countries have been using the technology to improve farm output for their people as well as for exporting purposes. The US has several food crops made from GM technology that include maize, soyabean, cotton, potato, canola, papaya, alfalfa and squash.Recently, we have seen as many as 109 Nobel laureates come together to support GM crops and their benefits. In India, however, more weightage is still given to many environmentalists, NGOs and swadeshi groups whose arguments against GM crops are not based on science but on emotions.This acts as a hindrance not only to the introduction of new technology to improve Indias farm productivity, but also severely leaves a negative impact on the economy.The agri-biotech industry takes risks by putting in huge money, effort and valuable human resource in conducting research over years to bring innovative technology to the farm. Scientists need about 10-12 years of work globally to develop a crop biotech product. After developing the product, there is much effort needed for regulatory approval before commercialisation.If the breakthrough research does not get to the market after such humongous efforts, it not only discourages the scientific community but also the industry, farmers and consumers, who are deprived of latest technological advancements in agriculture.Bangladesh has shown how embracing technology can enhance farm income significantly. Bangladeshs agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has been at the forefront of raising such awareness. She was convinced by the research and partnership mooted by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (Bari) to bring new technology to its farmers struggling to find solutions to farming challenges with conventional methods of cultivation.Sowing New FutureBangladesh is successfully sowing and harvesting Bt Brinjal, a technology developed in India, for the past three years. So enthused are they by GM technology that they are in advanced stages of research in crops like transgenic cotton, golden rice, salinity-tolerant rice and late blight-resistant (LBR) potato, all of which can take the country far ahead in terms of farm productivity as well as achieving food security for its citizens.In India, regressive anti-science measures at the behest of certain vested interests are still the order of the day. This is quite clear from Indias recent price control measure for Bt cotton and capping of royalty on GM technology. These send wrong signals to the world and also project India as a country that does not honour technology agreements and intellectual property rights (IPR).The Indian government will have to take a long-term view on the way forward for technology in agriculture. Getting swayed by vested interests or specific ideologies leading to such abnormal anti-R&D and anti-IPR policies can benefit only a few at the cost of the farmers and the nation.The unusual action of the government in bringing price control and draft licensing guidelines has a backdrop of a commercial dispute between a few licensees and the technology provider. These measures appear to be in support of a few seed companies who have defaulted on payment of trait fees to the technology provider.The licence of the biggest seed company that has defaulted has been cancelled and its promoter is also the president of the National Seed Association, which represented to the Indian government for price control, leading to a perception that the stated objective and the actual intent of these measures are different.The proposed compulsory licensing of technology and price control where the price reduction to farmers on a weighted national basis is less than the reduction in trait fee is widely believed to benefit only the sublicensees, not the farmers.Indias leading seed company, Nuziveedu, has been playing a game to ouster Monsanto from the country in the name of safeguarding farmers interest. Since Monsanto challenged Nuziveedu for not honouring the licensing contract agreement for Bt cotton and also cancelled its technology licence for defaulting on trait fee payment, all hell has broken loose.This also shows the world how Indian companies like Nuziveedu can still manipulate the local system for their personal interests.Technology is InclusiveBy interfering in bilateral private agreements between technology providers and licensees, the government is weakening investor and innovator confidence. This will see a slowing down of research and no new technology will be made available to our farmers from outside, who are already under stress due to the vagaries of agriculture.In the larger interest of Indian agriculture and the economy, one would urge the government to reverse the anti-innovation measures. GM Mustard, if approved, would have addressed the edible oil shortage in India  as will Bt Chickpea and Bt Brinjal in providing nutritional food intake. To be globally competitive in food production and curtail imports of food grain from other countries, it is high time India has a conducive policy environment to promote and adopt modern and well-proven technologies like GM crops.(The writer is professor, plant genetics and genomics, Tuskegee University, US)"

Of baguettes and bistros,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ooh-la-la-of-baguettes-and-bistros/,2016-07-27,,The Times Of India,"It is a perfect summer day in Paris. The sky is a perfect cerulean blue, the trees are a vibrant green and the streets are full of happy people dressed in a symphony of colour. As I stride down the Avenue des Champs-lyses, I joyously break out into an old Maurice Chevalier song from the movie Can Can, I love Paris every moment. After one horrified look at me yodelling away, the family nimbly hops it over to the other side of the road, keeping a safe distance from the warbler with the non-musical prowess.We have been in France for the last few weeks for the Euro Cup tournament and now that it is over, we can finally get down to business: the art of fine dining in Paris. However, this time I am discovering something entirely different: While Paris may not be the melting pot that its sister cities New York and London are, what makes this city so special is the outdoor cafes which come alive in spring and summer. Between casual strolls along the river Seine and visits to the numerous cultural offerings in the City of Light, a good way to soak in the local scenery and sun is to eat at one of the thousands of pavement cafes across the city.As the temperature rises into the pleasant 70s, Parisians head to their favourite cafes to while away the day on a sunny pavement terrace. These cafes can range from a landmark locale to a small hole-in-the-wall noshery. Tiny rows of tables facing the street under gaily patterned umbrellas are overflowing with chattering, smoking Parisians, all occupying every corner in every square. With an astonishing number of cafs at which to park yourself and enjoy the City Of Lights anything-but-pedestrian (couldnt help that pun!) culinary offerings, the hangouts du jour are those with bustling crowds, and the best vantage points for scoping the latest Parisian trends.And these outdoor cafes serve everything, from the ubiquitous croissant to more elaborate culinary meals like ducks filet candied in cider and served with a side of grated potatoes. As we roam around the city, I eat a number of meals at these cafes. A staple food on the menu is the croquet-monsieur, a deliciously oozy and crisp grilled ham and cheese sandwich splashed with just a touch of Bchamel sauce. If you are an egg-lover, get the croque-madame, which adds a fried egg on top. Or there is the Jambon beurre, which is a fresh half-baguette, lavishly smeared with cool butter and garnished with jambon de Paris, a pink-hued cooked ham, served with optional cornichons or pickled cucumbers.As we settle down at a caf on a beautiful spot overlooking the Notre Dame and the River Seine near the Latin Quarter, I decide to show-off by ordering my meal in French. Je voudrai une glace deau avec une salade Caesar, I say primly in my best college-level French. After a moments hesitation, the hostess, a pretty French girl, says kindly, Madame, you just ordered an ice cream of water. I think you mean un verre deau. As the rest of the table collapses into titters, I say with as much dignity as I can muster, Oui oui, cest vrai glowering at my fluent Spanish-speaking boys.Another day, tired after fighting the hordes inside the massive Louvre and a bit miffed at Mona Lisas know-it-all smirk, we decide to re-energize at the nearby Caf Ruc on the Rue Rivoli. The H has ordered a layered fruit and veggie salad combined with a yogurt dressing and served beautifully in a jar. The older son is savouring his Blanc de Volaille Provenale (or chicken breast marinated in a thick sauce of tomatoes, garlic and olive oil) served on a bed of fresh tagliatelle pasta and the Foodie is about to launch into an artfully constructed club sandwich with homemade frites or fries. As for me, I sip on my glass of Merlot and do what Parisians do best on a lovely summers day: unabashedly eavesdrop on conversations around the cafe, while watching the world go by!"

Besides routine checkups and scans, there are certain foods that should be avoided and there are a few which are perfect for a healthy start.To maintain a high nutritional content in body, following an organic food diet is a good option. Organic diets are a great source of essential vitamins, minerals, potassium, iron and proteins that are healthy for you and your child.Why choose an organic diet over a normal diet?There are many reasons how organic is better but I would consider these to be the most important:Free from toxins that may cause damage to brain and nerve cellsSupports childrens neural and body developmentReal food and not pesticide factoriesReduces risk of cancerSimply tastes betterIs there a difference between natural and organic foods?Yes, both of them are different. Natural foods are usually considered as minimally processed foods that do not include hormones or artificial flavors. On the other hand, organic foods are strictly regulated and do not contain toxic substances such as synthetic pesticides, herbicides or chemical NPK fertilizers.Organic diet ideas for pregnant mothersBreakfast:Breakfast is the prime meal of the day for would-be moms as it helps you stay active throughout the day.

How can one forget the slightly sinister undertones embedded in the familiar nursery rhyme? Thats the thing about nursery rhymes and fairy tales  behind the innocuous words, there is always a deadly message. Children get it automatically. It takes adults much longer. Decoding nursery rhymes/fairy tales is a pretty specialized art. I am guessing there are still a few brains and self-professed intellectuals left in the Congress party to inform their soon-to-be-anointed emperor about the weight of that crown, and the discomfort of the throne he will occupy. Poor man  from a reluctant prince of India to the king of the Congress party, it has been a long and troubled journey.The timing couldnt have been worse  for the Congress. It resembles a tattered army, fatigued and demoralized after several convincing defeats on the battlefield. For all practical purposes, the troops have deserted the camp, after being headless for years. Not a single general has stepped forward to lead from the front. The king-to-be looks lost and adrift. The dowager queen is unwilling to let go of control. Her courtiers are scattered and no longer in a position to call the shots. She remains inaccessible and unapproachable, except to her trusted advisers. Palace intrigue suggests there could be more problems ahead, with foot soldiers moving away to the enemy camp. The dowager queen is in no mood to abdicate. This is a do-or-die moment for her personally. The future of the kingdom she believed was hers as a birthright, is now in other hands. And there is further trouble brewing in the royal familys inner circle.In this fascinating fairy tale, there is also a fair princess the one who is considered the rightful heir to the throne. The princess royal is well-loved by her subjects. Even the courtiers agree it is she who should wear the crown and rule for the next 40 years. By then, the princesss son will be old enough to take over, and the kingdom will carry on as planned.Unfortunately, there is a large fly in the ointment. It is the princesss consort, and he is being seen as the main hurdle preventing the accomplished princess from playing the role she is vastly cut out for. Since the consort does not come from a royal lineage (even if he does behave like the king of kings), the princesss elevation is unlikely to take place. Especially now that the consorts personal palace in a foreign land has been discovered. Surprisingly, the existence of the said palace has never been a secret! But since the news broke, the dowager queen is faced with a fresh scandal. She is an expert on keeping a lid on the royal familys many scandals. But this one seems like the hot potato even she is finding hard to digest.Meanwhile, the king-in-the-wings is wondering what on earth to do with his new position. Its an elevation he was clearly not keen on. For years, he has succeeded in keeping the dowager queen off his back in the hope that she would leave him alone and find some other candidate for this thankless and hopeless job. But he also realizes it is a borrowed crown he wears. So long as his formidable mother is right there, to undertake the plotting and scheming that is a part of the royal duties, he will have enough time to take frequent breaks and enjoy spa sessions when the heat in the kingdom gets to him.In this fairy tale, there are several wicked witches, not just one. These witches are capable of brewing magic spells that can make monkeys out of men  very powerful men. Dealing with them wont be easy. There is also an ogre with a gigantic ego who is out to finish off this dynasty once and for all. He has a well-trained army of Lilliputians, who are so obedient, all they need is a raised hand, and off they go to attack and demolish the giants enemies. The dowager queen realizes this is the last pitched battle to save herself, her family. The not-yet-king has a monumental job ahead of him. People keep reminding him that the kingdom is changing and good days are here. He laughs. He sometimes forgets he is the king-in-waiting now and not the court jester."
5904740b7be9e04154df717f,Natural ways to treat PCOS to improve your fertility,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/your-fertility-friend/natural-ways-to-treat-pcos-to-improve-your-fertility/,2016-06-02,,The Times Of India,"Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a leading cause of infertility in women around in the world. This condition is characterized by the presence of small cysts in ovaries that inhibit healthy egg production leading to difficulty in conception.It is rarely curable but one can regulate PCOS symptoms with doctors advice. The most common symptoms of PCOS are obesity, acne, mood disorders, polycystic ovaries and irregular menstrual cycles. All these symptoms may lead to infertility and even cardiovascular diseases. In addition, PCOS may also lead to abnormal menstrual bleeding, darkening of the skin in the armpits or at back of the neck and, in some cases, recurrent miscarriages. PCOS can be managed both with medication and without medication through lifestyle tweaks. Sometimes, PCOS may also result in Type 2 diabetes if not treated in early stages.So lets take a quick look at how to treat PCOS naturally.Eating healthy breakfast is a must. The time of calorie consumption has a huge impact on the glucose, insulin and testosterone levels in your body. So if a woman having PCOS eats a high-calorie breakfast every day, an evident improvement is noticed in the glucose and insulin levels. In addition, a 50% drop in the testosterone levels in observed in women who consume a light dinner as compared to those who consume heavy meals at night. Therefore, a PCOS patient should have low-calorie foods towards the evening. It is advised to take 5 meals a day instead of the usual 3.PCOS patients will also benefit by reducing consumption of AGEs or Advanced Glycation End Products. Doing this helps control glucose levels. Foods with higher AGEs are processed and meat-based products. Other cause of increased AGEs in food is when it is cooked on high flame  grilling and roasting. To have a healthy and balanced diet, increase your intake of wholegrains and cut-down on simple carbohydrates like potatoes, flour and rice.Have Vitamin D and calcium supplements daily. When consumed with metformin (1500 mg) daily, these supplements improve BMI level, menstrual cycle difficulties and other symptoms.Regular intake of magnesium and chromium supplements result in improved insulin sensitivity. Diabetes is usually caused by low magnesium levels in the body. Daily intake of magnesium helps in increasing insulin sensitivity in your body.300 mg of magnesium is sufficient to lower insulin levels and live a healthy life (Note: Metformin works in the same way as magnesium to influence insulin levels).Daily intake of Omega-3 supplements helps in stabilizing androgen levels. Women who consume 3 grams of omega -3 every day have noticed a gradual decline in androgen levels in their body."

590474607be9e04154df71ee,Mr Modi goes to Washington,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/strategic-insights/mr-modi-goes-to-washington/,2016-06-06,,The Times Of India,"Mr Modi, beware. You are heading to D.C. to bond with a lame duck president. That is a wasteful exercise, and I will tell you why.The New York Times has carried an article today portraying you and President Obama as an odd couple; how great he is and how tarnished you are. But ignoring your alleged record in Gujarat for a second, let us understand what Obamas record is.The New York Times portrays Obama as a fervent protector of minorities, code words for blacks. But blacks continue to be slaughtered by Americas mostly white police, which often gets away scot-free. America is more racially polarized today than when Obama came into office. His own polarizing lecturing is the principal reason why so many whites are plumping for Donald Trump.Obama continues to take civilian lives, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. He has droned Pakistan and Afghanistan to death, way more than George W. Bush ever did. Now W. was a real friend of India. I met him just before he became president, and he promised me that he would treat India at the same level as China. In one year after entering office, he had ushered in a landmark nuclear deal with Manmohan Singh. He then personally coerced China to agree to the deal.Obama says that he will enable Indias entry into the nuclear suppliers group, but it is an empty offer, because he knows that China will block the deal, and everyone knows that he will not be able to budge China. His foreign policy is in shambles. The minute he discovered oil in the U.S., he signed an agreement with the Iranians, spurning and scaring the hell out of Americas long-standing allies, the Israelis and the Arabs. If Trump comes into office, quite possibly the first thing he will do is to rescind the deal with Iran.Obama left Iraq because the Iraqi government would not let him have his version of AFSPA. He thus enabled the creation of ISIS. He abandoned Muammar Gaddafi, who had become Americas and W.s friend by destroying all his weapons of mass destruction. North Korea and Iran got a valuable lesson: never stop creating nukes and toxins. Today, Libya is a playground for ISIS. In Syria, Obama promised to bomb Assad if he used chemical weapons. He did, and he didnt. Nobody believed the word of the US president anymore.In Afghanistan, he carelessly set an artificial deadline for the withdrawal of his troops, thereby emboldening the Taliban and Pakistan to wait him out. He first told India to keep her hands off Afghanistan, and then when the Pakistanis started troubling him, asked India to get involved in Afghanistan. Then when the Pakistanis started playing ball with him, he cut India out of the post-US negotiations in Afghanistan.This is a man whose senior advisers didnt know where Tunisia and Egypt were on the map when the Arab Spring broke out. Despite his horrendous human rights record, W. bonded easily with Manmohan Singh, Karzai of Afghanistan, Mubarak of Egypt, Blair of England. Obama by contrast is a loner. He has few friends in D.C. He can hardly call any world leader a firm friend. Would you ever tell him that the people of India dearly love him, as Manmohan told W. Yes, many in India mocked Manmohan then, but W. gave us the nuclear deal. What has Obama given us?Mr Modi, you are better off spending your time in D.C. bonding with Trump and Hillary. If they are out of town, go and meet them there. Obama will not get you a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. He well knows that China will block that as well, so his promises are just empty rhetoric.Today, India is flooded with American goods, from cars to potato chips to everything. America has become our number one arms supplier, whereas anyone with institutional memory of the army will tell you that the Americans will be the first ones to cut off spare parts if India gets into war. What good are arms without spares, especially in wartime? Russia and France have never betrayed us like that.Mr Modi, please honor your publicly-pledged Rafale deal with France. In many cases, Russian and French arms are superior to Americas. When the Chinese came out with their stealth fighter, the American media scoffed at it until they discovered that it was better in many ways than their own stealth fighter.A big problem has arisen in India today. Many of your senior bureaucrats, politicians, and military personnel have offspring settled in the US. They visit the country often and are completely enamored by it. I overheard a conversation between a former cabinet secretary and his friend at the Delhi Golf Club. The friend obviously lived in the States, and invited the retired bureaucrat to visit him there. The bureaucrat said that he was going to the US anyway to meet his family. The friend said, come spend a week with me and completely relax yourself. I laughed. As if the retired bureaucrat was working ever so hard in India.Mr Modi, these are the people who are misleading you into a strategic partnership with the US. There is nothing strategic nor partnership about it. This is all empty rhetoric with no substance. If the US can abandon Israel for Iran, when Jewish people have so much influence in America, then what are we.American media seems oblivious to the poor human rights record of its own leaders. The millions of Muslim civilians that W. and his cohorts have killed and displaced in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tens of thousands of civilian deaths that Obama has caused in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. And then American media portrays Third World leaders as killers and kings of corruption. The white man loves to feel good about himself by painting the dark man black.So Mr Modi, play your cards right. Even your detractors have been stunned by the awards and the warmth that you have received in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Obviously spending most of your time overseas has taught you something about the world. Obama hasnt learned a whit about the world in eight years in office. Jettison him, as well as Indian bureaucrats, et al who are trying to mislead you to frame foreign policy so that they can keep visiting their families in the US. Russia, France, and Israel are our time-tested friends. In comparison to the US, hardly any Indians live in these countries. But that doesnt make them any less than the US."
5904746d7be9e04154df7204,Ethiopian food: Thaal se thaal bajaa!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ethiopian-food-thaal-se-thaal-bajaa/,2016-08-25,,The Times Of India,"There are no forks or knives on the table. Not even spoons. Everyone is eating with their fingers and the only sound punctuating the Oohs and Yums is the occasional slurp. As I look around the room, I notice that even the most well-heeled customers are uncomplainingly and happily rolling up the bread, scooping the stew or vegetables and paying tribute to the chef by a single-minded focus on the delicious meal in front of them.I am at an Ethiopian restaurant Zeni in San Francisco with my sister, her husband and my younger son, The Foodie. We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left.

590474d07be9e04154df72a1,Will O’ The Wisp: Techno-animism gets a global facelift with Pokémon Go,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/will-o-the-wisp-techno-animism-gets-a-global-facelift-with-pokemon-go/,2016-07-19,,The Times Of India,"Launched less than two weeks ago, the Pokmon Go game has already sent more than 20 million people exploring their city streets from Delhi to Canberra and Chicago. Its a new chapter in the joining of real and virtual worlds, where you train fantastic creatures in a flesh and blood neighbourhood. Your park, dhaba, cinema or subway suddenly become really exciting. Even the office  because see, hovering over your colleagues head is a Pikachu or Charmander or Sandshrew or Jigglypuff. Hurry up and catch it.The games Japanese creators draw heavily from Shinto mythology but the resulting spiritual subtext communicates across cultures. The players have been likened to wandering Sufis, in search of the higher meaning hidden in everyday existence. A sort of techno-animism where material reality becomes alive with transcendental connections. In India a large number of virtual pokestops, where Pokmons hide, are actually located in temples and other places of worship. So playing this game has been likened to a pilgrimage.One thing the success of Pokmon Go proves is that the future will be a surprise. All calculations about what technologies will dominate could be turned upside down by unforeseen innovations. Till now such games were blamed for turning the youth into alienated couch potatoes but suddenly theyre crowding the streets and having face to face conversations with strangers around their city. The only catch is that the app keeps freezing at painfully frequent intervals in India  a reminder that theres only so much magic on tap in a call-drop country. Pokmon Go gives us a glimpse of a future of augmented reality, but also reminds us that it will take a lot of spectrum to win these and other digital stakes."

While Sloans guidelines to prevent cancer are being discussed, the understanding of this diet and how to follow it has some serious gaps. For one, a ketogenic diet is high on animal protein, and some animal protein like red meat and milk actually feeds cancer cells. The hormones in chicken create a ripe environment for hormonal cancer. So what form of modified ketogenic diet do we need to follow to ward off cancer? Heres what I follow, as a nutritional therapist, which I have also seen work on my cancer patients, so it doesnt just keep cancer at bay, but reverses it as well!Watch out for your pH: Most high protein diets mean an acidic pH. Check your pH by a routine urine test. For cancer cells to die, the pH needs to be above 7.4. Most of us have a healthy pH of 6.5 which can be raised by eating more alkaline foods like raw salads with extra virgin olive oil, wheatgrass juice, coconut water, almonds, chestnuts (other nuts are acidic), fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables. If your pH is 5 or below, the cancer cells can multiply faster.Pick your proteins carefully: Full eggs (only egg whites can get acidic), almonds, fish and tofu are the neutral pH items to consume. These are essential to avoid muscle fatigue due to low muscle mass and fatigue caused by a compromised immune system.Switch the carbs: The only carbs that prevent cancer are oats. The rest, like millets and quinoa, are neutral so these also can be consumed. I make oats cutlets with chopped spinach, carrots, half a boiled potato, mashed, rolled in oats to bind them, rolled in beaten egg and rolled again in oats to give a crispy golden covering, before shallow frying in less oil. These cutlets combined with a raw fresh greens salad with olive oil make a delicious, high protein (oats have more protein that other carbs) anti cancer lunch or dinner. Combine with a glass of red wine over dinner, and you also get the anti-cancer properties of resveratrol in red wine.Oxygenate: Moderate exercise like 40 minutes of walks 4 days a week and gentle pranayamas like anulom vilom (alternate nose breathing) create an oxygenated environment inside our cells, making it difficult for cancer cells to survive.While you do all the above, remember the nos as well: sugar, lack of sleep, high stress all contribute to growth of cancer in the body. Ultimately, cancer is like any other disease: if you take care, you can side step it pretty well, even if you have it. The bodys immune system fights it if you make the immune system strong. And strong immunity will keep other diseases at bay too.Now dont stress so much over all the data on cancer. Just go and empty out your fridge and throw away the breads, desserts and cold drinks. Its a start."

Customers crowd around his stall that has stood at the same spot for last so many years, as the areas most popular golgappa wallah caters to them without a pause, dipping his golgappas into one pot, then another, and lands them into paper plates without spilling more than a few drops.Try walking past a stand selling phuchka or golgappa; and you cant resist the urge to have at least five or ten of them. I call them phuchka, as of course if you are born and brought up in Kolkata, you will not think of any other name. It is said that the smell of phuchka triggers your taste buds and then the temptation emerges to gulp them one after the other.Sold on every nook and corner across the streets of India, golgappa beats every other form of chaat. In different regions of the country, it is known by various different names, such as paanipuri in Mumbai, golgappa in central and northern India, gupchup in Orissa, puchka in eastern India, pani ke batashe, and probably many more.I think golgappa is a unanimous choice when it comes to peoples favourite binging snack; the thin, fried balls filled with a spicy mash of potatoes, and ducked in tamarind water. Put it in your mouth, the whole of it and it crumbles, throwing up the most divine sensations on your palate. The trick is to put the entire golgappa in your mouth, without it bursting, and only the most seasoned of golgappa lovers can do that perfectly! Golgappa throws up cravings and nostalgia, the happiness of crowding around the golgappawala in the evening, and gulping down as many as you can, and beating your friends at it, is one of the favourite competitions every folk would remember with a smile.And lastly to say that golgappas have certain relation with the dim light of dusk. The sky turns to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars; and I just enjoy that people come out of their homes, take a stroll in the nearby parks and savour the taste of golgappas."

Children in this region of south west China have to climb a 2,625-foot-high bamboo ladder to get to school.These 15 schoolchildren use a precarious bamboo ladder to scale a sheer cliff face once every two weeks in order to get to the village in Zhaojue county, southwest China, where they are educated.After pictures surfaced of the challenging trek faced by schoolchildren in a poor corner of Chinas mountainous west, the village may be getting some assistance by way of a safer, more modern piece of infrastructure: A solid set of steel stairs.The hardship faced by residents in the village of Atuleer in Sichuan province underscores the vast gap in development between Chinas prosperous, modern east and parts of the remote inland west that remain mired in poverty.The bamboo ladder is the only means of access to the village to which the 15 children age 6-15 return every two weeks from the school at which they board. The 72 families who live there are members of the Yi minority group and subsist mainly by farming potatoes, walnuts and chili peppers.The Liangshan prefectural government on Friday said a set of stairs would be built as a stop-gap measure while officials consider a longer-term solution.It quoted local residents as saying that in addition to the safety issue, the ladder-only access exposed villagers to exploitation because traders knew they would be unable to carry unsold produce back up the cliff.The most important issue at hand is to solve the transport issue. That will allow us to make larger-scale plans about opening up the economy and looking for opportunities in tourism, said the county Communist Party Secretary General Jikejingsong.The dramatic photos that appeared online earlier this week show children wearing colorful backpacks climbing the 17 separate ladders accompanied by a pair of adults. The photos garnered even more attention after appearing on the front page of the English-language China Daily and other newspapers on Thursday.A team of 50 officials from the Zhaojue county governments transport, education and environmental protection departments traveled to the area on Wednesday to assess safer alternatives, the Global Times reported Friday. It said the county is considering building a road to the village, although the cost would be exorbitant for such a poor region.China pulled almost 700 million people out of poverty following the implementation of economic reforms in the early 1980s and says less than 10 percent of the population still suffers from extreme privation.Most of Chinas poorest people are from long-marginalized minority groups or are farmers and herders living in the mountainous southwest, where rope bridges, aerial runways, canoes and cliffside ladders remain crucial to accessing the outside world.(Photos & story by Chinatopix/AP)"

Located on the lowest deck of the ship, the fourth class was meant for soldiers and poor labourers who could not afford the higher compartments. Rationed food comprising boiled potatoes, millet, groundnuts, and buns was served twice to the passengers. The man had just recovered from a fever and was troubled with an occasional cough. He hailed from a wealthy family and could have easily afforded a comfortable cabin in a ship. But he chose to travel in the fourth class as his trip was neither for business nor for pleasure. He was on a mission to learn about the functioning of the political and social movements of different nations and how these factors contribute to the socio-political and economic development of their respective societies. The man was none other than Periyar E V Ramasamy.On December 13, 1931, Periyar accompanied by S Ramanathan and Erode Ramu embarked on a ten-month visit to Europe. Enroute, he halted at Colombo for a few days and addressed several meetings there, talking mainly against superstition, caste, and religion. He addressed the Adi Dravida Association much against the wishes of caste Hindus. In his speech, he asserted that the empowerment of Adi Dravidas would be possible only when the entire community joined hands and fought against caste prejudices and atrocities. The next months went in visiting countries like Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Germany, England, Spain, France, Portugal, and Russia. Reading the Communist Manifesto had sparked his interest in the Russians and Periyar was impressed with the functioning of the government in Russia. In June 1932, at Barnsley, England, he addressed a historic gathering of 30,000 workers affiliated with the labour party in the presence of Geroge Lanbury, a social reformer who led the British Labour Party. Interestingly in his address, Periyar mockingly told the labour leader how contrary to their ideals in England, the British government meted out ill-treatment to the labour-class people in India. Periyar also visited the offices of the various communist fronts in Great Britain and met Shapurji Saklatvala, the first British Communist member of parliament. In Germany, Periyar visited various socialistic organisations and a nude society to understand their perspective of life.For Periyar, the primary motive behind the trip was to understand the functioning of other progressive movements in the world before setting out his own Self-Respect Movement. On his return, he wrote articles on the political, social and economic scenario, administration and justice system of the countries he visited in his party organ Kudi Arasu.Earlier in 1929, Periyar had visited Malaysia at the invitation of friends who had shown a keen interest in strengthening the Self-Respect Movement in the country. He sailed from Nagapattinam port on December 15. More than 50,000 people had received him at Penang port. In his address to people in several cities of Malaysia and Singapore, Periyar was vociferous in demanding people to discourage religion and religious practices and concentrate on economic growth instead. He appealed to the Malaysian Tamils not to return to India and instead become citizens of Malaysia. It was during this trip that Periyar started to grow his trademark long white beard, which he never parted with until his death. Periyar visited Malaysia again in 1954, with the trip coinciding with the International Buddhist Conference in November 1954 in Burma. After a two-week stay in Burma he came to Penang on December 11. Incidentally, at a conference in Burma he met B R Ambedkar. While Ambedkar tried persuading Periyar to embrace Buddhism, Periyar told him that strategically he preferred to remain in the Hindu fold to challenge it from within.Periyar never completely relied on secondary data. He believed in his own exploration and sought knowledge with the bent of a researcher. In the pursuit of that knowledge, he was never hesitant to travel either within India or abroad despite the discomforts of the journey. After all, he had chosen a path less travelled by others."

Living with a problem is not a solution. A lot of our problems are caused by wrong actions, words, associations and decisions. We focus so much on a problem we dont realise that our entire focus is the problem, not the solution. Dr David Lincoln, Master NLP practitioner told me, the problem doesnt exist without you, because if you take yourself out of the situation, the problem ceases so that means you are the problem. So first things first, stop blaming others. You got yourself into the issue, you can get out yourself. Hence, whatever you wish to change in your life, make a change within you. It may mean changing your goals, your mind-set and putting in place a course of action in which you steer your ship out of stormy waters. There is always a solution from the most basic to the complex issues. If you put too much salt while cooking, add a potato, but if you spill red wine you should douse it with salt. The cause of a problem in one situation is a solution in another. The person who is a pain in the butt to you, is a hero in the life of someone else. So the ingredient or person isnt the problem. The situation is. Your expectations are. Your equation is. And its always about being proactive and not complacent. If something or someone matters to you, you will stop complaining, fight the fear and find a solution and not pity yourself, because there is a solution to every problem, you just have to find it, implement it and do away with it. And if its not worth the effort, then why be bothered about it in the first place?After my parents divorce, my mother has started dating someone. Ive realised though he makes my mom happy, his intentions arent good towards me. What should I do?Clearly hes not in love with your mother, so her happiness will be short-lived. Better to give your mom a disguised hint. Tell her one of your friends has this situation and speak to her about yours. Either she will understand what you are trying to say or she will give you the best advice on how to deal with it. You can then apply to her. And she cant disprove of her own advice.Ive recently got married through an arranged setup. My husband is always busy with work and has no time. In fact, we arent even physically close. Please help.That is not normal at all. You need to have a serious heart-to-heart with him and tell him there will be no drama, no tears, no guilt, no blame game but you deserve to know whats going on. Let him know that whether he is gay, impotent, or in love with someone else, there are always solutions to every problem. Add that you are okay with whatever truth there is, its just that you both need to amicably come to some sort of agreement, since youve both committed for a life together.Ive recently broken up with my girlfriend. We were physically close. Now, I feel a constant urge to get intimate. I dont know how to control this urge. Please help.Theres always masturbation to the rescue!

According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a forum for disseminating and sharing technologies for agriculture sustainability and development, the acreage under GM crops declined for the first time after the commercialisation of GM crops in 1996.The acreage under GM crops, also known as genetically modified or transgenic crops, which had steadily grown to touch peak levels of 181.1 million acres in 2014, dropped by one percent to touch 179.7 million hectares in 2015. This was mainly on account of the fall in acreage under important GM crops like Maize and cotton. This is a major setback because acreage under GM crops had shot up almost 100 fold from the meagre 1.7 million hectares in the last 19 years, making it the fastest adopted agriculture technology in recent times.Latest estimates show that GM crops were raised on 28 countries which is home from 4 billion people of which 8 were developed countries and the rest from the developing world. However the bulk of the 180 million hectares under GM crops were concentrated in five countries which accounted for 90% of the acreage and included the United States (39%), Brazil (25%), Argentina (14%) and India and Canada with 6% each. However, in China the most populated nation which stood 6th in the hierarchy, the share of GM crops was a mere 2% of the global total. But what is exceptional is the acreage under GM crops in developing countries has exceeded that of developed countries for the fourth consecutive year which raises hopes of increasing its acceptability in poor countries.In the United States the vast majority of the GM acreage was under three crops namely maize, soybean and cotton where the high technology variety covered more than 90% of the sown area each. The scenario was similar in Brazil and Argentina too where the three were the most popular GM crops. In Canada the largest GM crop was Canola followed by maize and soybean while that in India was mainly cotton. In China too cotton reigned supreme followed by papaya.The United States not only had the largest acreage under GM but also had the most diversified one. The number of GM crops including, apart from Maize, soybean and cotton, also canola, sugar beat, alfalfa, papaya, squash and potato. And 2015 was also a notable year for GM crops in the United States as it commercialised a new strain of potato and a new version of canola and secured approval for two varieties of apple.The year was also important for United States as salmon secured approval to become the first GM animal for commercial production. It also secured approval for a new GM chicken. The GM community also was able to foil efforts to introduce labelling for GM crops in four states. However, despite all this it was the fall in acreage of 2.2 million hectares under maize, cotton and Canola, due to the falling prices that cause the global acreage to fall for the first time.A country attempting a significant push to GM crops among developing countries is Bangladesh. Though the commercial acreage is still low the area under bt-brinjal has been doubled to 25 hectares and efforts are on to exponentially increase the quantity of bt seeds to meet growing needs. The country has also stepped up efforts to initiate field trials of blight resistant potato in the next year and also initiated measures to evaluate crop like bt cotton and golden rice in field trials. All this indicate that the fall under acreage of bt crops is an aberration and would be reversed in the coming years."

Poor residents of Wellington, Oakwood, Carlton, Belaire, Magnolia, Aralias, Laburnum, Princeton, Ridgewood, Richmond, Beverly Park, Hamilton Court and other aptly named residential buildings (in nearby Delhi they still call these housing societies). On Tuesday, they were rudely reminded of the millennium that exists down below between their homes  all of them, along with those malls and indoor promenades spiritually located in Seattle or Chicago. And in Vegas, of course.With mass exodus now on the cards, the Millennium City has been yanked back nomenclaturally to the same level as Model Town, Rajendra Nagar, or worse, New Rajendra Nagar. Suddenly, Patparganj and Trilokpuri in east Delhi seem ominously close.Indian brand managers in Gurgaons multi-culti-national corporations have their heads in their hands  while their foreign colleagues look on in puzzlement. The land of Dronacharya? Really? But then, what do you expect from an administration headed not by David Cameron or Donald Trump (Barack Obama was always a bit too world music for the people of Gurgaon) but by Manohar Lal Khattar.Here was a town to match New York and London before Shanghai got into that act, born out of a meeting between DLF chairman K P Singh and GEs Jack Welch and the wunderboys of Sam Pitroda, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Jairam Ramesh. Welch would set up a GE shop in 1996, and the rest, as they say, is plexi-lexi cement-steel-and-glass history.And now, once again, were back to square one in some 1980s Ramanand Sagar production called  conch shells alert  Gurugram. What next? The Johnnie Walker Classic replaced by the Pan Parag Classic at the DLF Golf and Country Club?Sure, everyone knew that Gurgaon meant exactly the same as Gurugram  the (Management) Gurus Village  when they stepped into those apartments from their earlier 3BHKs scattered wherever else across Hindustan. Guru itself would have worked, in Gurugaon, which is anyway how white people pronounce the place to get into a tropical mood. But the malleable gaon  with its cosmopolitan rendition that doesnt conjure up a stinky, dry Indian village but gives out heavy East Village, Manhattan village vibes  now has been turned into the unrecoverable, unhideable gram.Say it aloud, especially in an MNC kind of way, and youll realize why the greatest qualitative exodus since Partition (not of India but the one along the Mason-Dixon line) is about to take place. Gurugram. Yes, one Gurugram of potatoes. Which will remind every resident of Gurgaon-Gurugram that Haryana is now upon them. A generation is readying itself to be scarred.But surely, Gurugram, still home to corporate giants and hi-tech companies, can weather the name-change and perhaps turn its new old name (or is it its old new name?) into an advantage by deploying cutting-edge brand-hurrahing irony? Theres Greenwich Village in NYC, and theres Gurugram in NCR.All that the proud, rooted people of Gurgaon-Gurugram now need to develop is a Gram Culture  apart from visiting malls and believing that microbreweries are really art galleries, minus the art. But then, cutting-edge brand-hurrahing irony that is indigenous will have to be dredged up from somewhere outside Madmen and Mad magazines. That could prove a bit tiresome for folks more familiar with Kim Kardashian than with Yo Yo Honey Singh.Village people: All that the proud, rooted folks in this town need to develop is a Gram CultureWas Gurgaons Millennium City tag really that successful? Did the words Millennium City make your follicles turn all futuristic and make you want to take your Millennium Falcon out for a warp drive with your incredibly tall and hairy eye-candy Wookie spouse in the next seat (with the driver driving in front)? After all, the switch from Gurgaon to Gurugram does seem less drastic than, say, from Pepsi to Poop-Cee. But then, what do we outsiders know?Bengaluru is a ghost town today, as is Mumbai. No one listened then about the utter economic and cultural destruction that would come upon those two real, historic, organic cities.And no one has listened to the poor, aspirational folks of Wellington, Oakwood, Carlton, Belaire, Magnolia, Aralias, Laburnum, Princeton, Ridgewood, Richmond, Beverly Park and Hamilton Court as they get gobbled up by the dark, dehati forces of Gurugram. Barbarians!"

The showily decorated ballroom of a city 5-Star is awash with the sound of people talking and munching their way through food of the continents. I am at yet another of those endless weddings which take place during the hitching season between November and March and balk at the sight of the gastronomic feast which assails the senses. As I ponder on finding the nearest exit to make a quick getaway, a friend trips by laden with diamonds and food. Suneeeta, have you tried the Jaapaanese stall? The tappanyaaki (read teppanyaki) is to die for, she trills, before teetering off on her Manolo Blahnik shoes.I am not in my element in big weddings. The glitterati and the chatterati disorient me and I get tired after a while of the air kissing and fake bonhomie. Worst of all, the sight and smell of myriad cuisines, to showcase the wealth and ingenuity of the hosts, creates a confusing babel of tastes which neither appeases nor gratifies the palate. Japanese Lebanese Thai French Turkish Greek: the hostess wants you to taste it all even as she trips over her shawarma, er, sharara.My mind wanders back to a few days ago when I attended another wedding in a tiny hamlet in the southern part of Maharashtra. Here the atmosphere, while as chaotic as any city wedding, is more welcoming and traditional. The village is small but the festivities are big considering my host is the sarpanch of the village. Everyone in the village is invited and everyone is lending a hand to make sure it is perfect. Out of town guests are housed in neighbors homes (there are no hotels here). All the women of the village have spent the last few days preparing all the savories and desserts needed for the spread. No event managers, no liveried staff, no Yo-Yo or Happy-Shappy to provide the entertainment.And the food? Simple and utterly delicious, bringing to mind those happy days in childhood spent at my maternal grandmothers place where every tidbit at the dining table was freshly cooked. Here too, from the pickles to the papads to the vegetables (straight from the fields), all the edibles are sourced from the village itself. In a large room fragrant with the smell of rose water and jasmine gajras, the guests are seated in pangats or parallel rows in front of chowrangs.  These are short wooden tables decorated with traditional rangoli on which is placed a banana leaf. There is the traditional food offered at weddings such as ussal (sprouts cooked with minimum amount of spices, masale bhaat (spice-flavored rice), aamras (mango pulp), tak (buttermilk) along with vegetables ranging from potatoes to yam. At the end of the meal, there are paanch pakwaan which are mandatory in a wedding feast. The host has decided to go with motichur laddoos, puran polis, karanjee, kheer and basundi (all indigenous Maharashtrian desserts).With a sigh, I come back to the hullabaloo in the ballroom and will myself to try the opulent food on display. From lobsters flown in from Maine, cheese from Switzerland, truffles from France: the hosts have put on a gastronomic blitzkrieg. To add to the adventure, there is even an iceboat filled with shrimp and crab legs and a table with a five-tier Marie Antoinette cake.Just as I have decided to go and try the Japanese counter where the Michelin-quality chef is meticulously putting together Donburi bowls (a bowl of cooked rice served with different meats and a sweet/savory soy-based sauce), I see my friend approaching. This time she is accompanied by two other friends and all of them are advancing purposefully. Oh no, not her, whispers the chef furtively. I raise an eyebrow. She wants me to season her Japanese dish with a bit of tadka. She says my food is too bland! I flee from the station before I am eating Japanese food tadka-maar ke!"
5904d1bc7be9e04154dfc3cd,Change your food to change your life,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/heartchakra/change-your-food-to-change-your-life/,2016-03-13,,The Times Of India,"I just learned about the 3 elemental forces of the Universe: Tamas, Rajas and Sattvas. Although esoteric in nature, its interesting to see how the correlation between food and personality tie together and hence how food can even affect your relationships. Sounds strange that food can affect your personality, but the subtle energy of food enters the mind and directly affects your thoughts.Tamasic people are static, lethargic, stagnate and tend to procrastinate. They settle for less and need to sleep all the time. Tamsic foods include potatoes, carrot, brinjal, root vegetables.Rajasic people are dynamic, energetic, filled with passion and vibrancy. They are also restless and goaded by power, glory, achievement even at the cost of health and happiness. They love to travel, love to party and accumulate material wealth. They possibly delude themselves saying that all that they do is for others, but its in actuality for them and their pursuit of what brings them pleasure and satisfaction. They love meat, chillies, spices and flavours.And then we have the Sattviks, who echo with a spiritual subtle energy. They are calm, peaceful, attentive and joyful. They have a wonderful aura of wellbeing and generosity of spirit. Sattvik foods include fruits, vegetables, sprouts, seeds and nuts.Change your diet brings change in your personality and hence the nature of your relationship with all those that surround you. Sounds unbelievable, but it is said that the noticeable changes are visible within six months. If you want to change your relationship with loved ones, including the relationship you have with yourself and the life youre trapped in, its time to change your food habits.I am 18 years old. I lost my virginity to a man I loved. But he betrayed me and did shoot our intimate moments. Now he is forcing me to meet again and if I dont turn up, he would upload the video online. I dont want my parents to get involved in this. I feel guilty of my deeds. Please help.First and foremost, record a conversation with him threatening to do so. Then tell him that the minute he does so, you will take it to your parents and the law authorities and that he will go to jail for a very long time. If you feel your parents would naturally be upset, but support you, record the conversation and straight away ask them for their help as setting the police onto him and recovering the video is a good idea. At least it wont hang over your head for the rest of your life and he will be off his power trip once he knows his actions have landed him in serious trouble.I was friends with two girls in college, got closer to one of them and married her in 1996. During a college reunion in 2007, I met the other girl and she confided in me that she loved me and could never forget me in 20 years. She is also married now. Both of us do have feelings for each other, though our individual families are top priorities for us. We are planning to meet once in a while alone but still dont know if it is the right thing to do. Please help.Its the stupidest thing to do. Why are you wondering if its the right thing to do? When did an extra marital affair ever become a right thing? Typical case of ghar ki murgi daal barabar.I am a 24-year-old girl dating a 26-year-old guy for one-and-a-half years now. Before this, I was involved with another guy. I broke up with him as he was not ready to be married but just interested in a physical relationship. I have told my current boyfriend about this relationship. At times, he gets terribly upset and angry thinking of my past, especially about the fact that I was physical with that guy. How do I help him cope with my past?Ask him if he would like to get counselling for the same and that you would be happy to accompany him for the same. Tell him you cannot have a future if youre still stuck in the past. Add that punishing you for honesty isnt fair and only makes you wonder if you should be honest in future with him about other stuff."
5904d25f7be9e04154dfc4ac,Sleepless in Guwahati: BJP’s alliance troubles with AGP could blunt its rise in Assam,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/sleepless-in-guwahati-bjps-alliance-troubles-with-agp-could-blunt-its-rise-in-assam/,2016-03-14,,The Times Of India,"BJPs prime hope in upcoming assembly elections in April and May rests on Assam. And it got off to an early start in its Assam campaign by forging alliances with four regional parties. But the alliance is now facing challenges. Former Assam chief minister and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) founding president Prafulla Kumar Mahantas warning that AGP will take a suitable decision on its alliance with BJP and decide whether to keep the alliance or call it off  at the right time reflects growing grassroots opposition from disgruntled AGP leaders.Mahantas demand for equal treatment and respect from BJP follows splits within both AGP and the local BJP unit after AGP was allocated 24 seats within the alliance. While breakaway AGP leaders have formed the AGP Anchalikatabadi Mancha to contest at least 50 seats, some disgrunt led BJP workers have formed the Trinamool BJP .Whatever their chances, these rebel outfits are counterproductive for the alliance, negating its primary purpose of consolidating the anti-Congress vote.With union sports minister Sarbananda Sonowal as its chief ministerial candidate, BJP which won only five seats in Assams 126-member assembly in 2011 is now hoping to capitalise on its unprecedented gains in the 2014 general election when it won 36.5% of Assam vote share, leaving Congress (29.6%) in second place. As in neighbouring West Bengal though, BJP has to overcome a host of local identity issues. A major fault line is the Centres 2015 decision to grant citizenship to illegal migrants from Bangladeshs minority communities who crossed over to India before December 13, 2014.Legalising any Bangladeshi is a political hot potato. Mahanta says the decision violates the 1985 Assam accord. Tarun Gogoi, chief minister since 2001, is banking on precisely such debates to blunt BJPs rise in the state and retain power for an unprecedented fourth time."

Speaking with Sugandha Indulkar, Lakshmi discussed being a single mother, an Indian in America, her inspirations  and, on the eve of International Womens Day, how women are judged far more harshly than men:What is life like being a single Indian mother in the West?Well, i am quite fortunate to have a lot of resources compared to most single mothers in the US  certainly a lot more than what my mother had when she was raising me. She was a single mum who worked full-time and attended college at night.With me, i am single because i want to be. I love being with my five-year-old daughter.Youre globally known now  but how difficult was breaking several glass ceilings?There are two issues here  one is being a woman and the other is being from a minority.One of the reasons i am well-known is because there arent too many Indians on American television  theres me, Sanjay Gupta and now, Priyanka Chopra.The standards for women on television are definitely different from those for men. If youre at the top, everyone wants to know everything about you  especially how i stay in shape. Its natural to be curious  but nobody asks my colleague Tom Colicchio how he stays in shape!The pressure to look a certain way and stay in shape for women in media or television is much higher than for men. Women have to excel in everything they do, on or off screen. They are constantly being judged  against men who are accepted the way they are.What was your cultural journey like?I went to America when i was four. Im basically from South Kerala. My grandfather moved to Chennai first. I learnt to balance life between Chennai and Manhattan.It wasnt easy as we were hardcore vegetarians. In New York, wed seek restaurants which served rice and so, frequented Chinese and Mexican joints and salad bars.It was difficult to eat out or mingle with kids in school because our food was so different from theirs.How did you hone your culinary skills?My mother and grandmother were great cooks. My aunties and women in the family spent a lot of time in the kitchen. I loved listening to their kitchen stories and started helping out when i was quite young. As a 12-year-old, i was allowed to peel peas and skin potatoes. I loved watching the women in my family cook.In the US, i started assisting my mother in her kitchen to take some workload off her back.Have you observed transitions in the Indian food scene abroad?A change has been brought by a new generation of Indians. This younger generation has grown up in the West  as the world has shrunk because of social media, theyve strengthened their bond with authentic Indian food, just as its made in Indian households.Indian restaurants in the West have become more authentic now  they no longer worry whether western people will like it or not.Indian food is delicious. We just need to demystify it a bit for more people, so they try it in their kitchens. Indian food is about to have its great moment soon  i dont think its had it yet.Who is your most powerful inspiration?Definitely my mother  she was a single mother, a great cook and a great mother. She used to work full-time as a nurse and attend night college to complete her MD.Despite all the hardships that came her way, she was always smiling, helpful and retained her sense of humour.I can never feel bad for myself because whenever i think of her, i am reminded of the difficult things she has been through  and how well she found her way out of all the difficulties.What drives you in life?I want to leave the world a better place than the one i was born in. Thats what my Endometriosis Foundation is about. Weve educated thousands about this disease which affects 10% of women. Today, we get funds from the state of New York to run our education programme.I know as women, we are very powerful  and we have a different way of doing things."

Working as executive chef at Park Hyatt, Chennai, Greg (call me Greg, he offered after seeing me struggle with his name) oversees the kitchens of the all-day dining, The Dining Room and the iconic specialty restaurant, The Flying Elephant built over five levels. He considers Mediterranean and Thai cuisine as his forte, as well as his favourites.For Saulo Bacchilega, executive chef of Park Hyatt Goa Resort and Spa, Italian food is home turf and also his best-honed cuisine, (in his near-three-decades old career), despite his expertise at Asian cuisine and his overseeing operations at their in-house epic Goan restaurant Casa Sarita. Saulo, with a quirky sense of humour and multi lingual skills (English, French, Spanish and Italian, of course) just feels Italian food is simplest to make and good to eat!For Lars Windfuhr, executive chef Park Hyatt Hyderabad and German by birth, it is food cooked with freshest seasonal produce which matters. While Continental cuisine would be his most specialized skill, Murgh Makhni, as he would prefer calling Butter chicken, is his all time favourite carry away memory from India. Lars also confesses his wife and daughter love to snack on the ubiquitous Chindian Veg Manchurian.Three chefs from three different countries ruling the kitchens of different corners of India. Now if that isnt true blue globalization of the F&B industry!As part of the first season of Park Hyatts Chefs on Tour (under the umbrella of their Masters of Food & Wine initiative), a chefs table was set up recently at Tre-Forni, the in-house Italian specialty restaurant of Park Hyatt Hyderabad, which also saw the chefs in animated conversation on a range of food-related topics, with a select few bloggers and journalists.While we were looking forward to Chefs Greg and Saulo dishing out their signature stuff, their flight schedules put those plans to rest, and we settled down to a fabulous, nonetheless Italian meal. On the menu was Asparagus Tart, Seared Scallops & Prawns (with mashed apple, rucola pesto, sundried cherry tomato), Ravioli (provolone cheese and porcini sauce), Herb Crusted Lamb rack with rosemary roasted potatoes (magnifique!) , a delightful green apple sorbet as well as a perfectly bitter-sweet tiramisu.The chefs on tour included a cooking class showcasing Park Hyatt classics and unique home-grown recipes like Chef Gregs Polish Pierogi, dumplings served with mushrooms and sauerkraut.In the end, it was a chefs table which had a lot of takeaways, especially in terms of perspectives on global food trends and what good chefs want."

If not, dont worry. For the chances are that, given a little time, it eventually will, thanks to what has become a routine feature of all budgets, presented by all FMs: the roll-back.The roll-back is a figurative backward somersault by which the FM reverses a budgetary proposal which meets with disapproval from the opposition or from the public at large.Indeed, the roll-back has become as much a part of the budgetary ritual as poetic quotes and humorous quips devised to provide comic relief to the FMs jittery audience.Critics have been heard to mutter that roll-backs have become so regular that the Budget should be renamed the Fudge-it, as successive FMs fudge the whole exercise by doing a sharp about turn on unpopular measures.Are roll-backs an indication that FMs, all FMs, dont know their own minds, or that they harbour split personalities, like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, so that what they hand out with the right hand they take back with the left?Such suspicions are both uncharitable and unjust. Because in reality the roll-back is nothing more or less than the celebration of the timehonoured Indian tradition of striking a bargain through a process of haggling.Bargaining is intrinsic to what is often called the Great Indian Bazar and is the ingredient that gives what would otherwise be humdrum everyday transactions a unique zest.Whatever the purchase in question  be it a kilo of potatoes to a princely palace  the buyer and seller enthusiastically enter into protracted negotiations (Thirty? Youve got to be joking. Tell you what, ill give you five, and thats my final offer, take it or leave it) before a deal  referred to as a boni if its the first sale of the day  is finally struck, to the satisfaction of all concerned.The roll-back is the FMs way of ensuring that instead of having a bone to pick with his Budget we pick a mutually beneficial boni.Time to start rolling, Arunji ?"
5904e3e57be9e04154dfd4be,"Of magic, maple & memories!",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/O-zone/of-magic-maple-memories/,2016-02-28,,The Times Of India,"Unless you weave stories and create magic moments, how are you going to make good memories?Some moments stay frozen in time  and come back later to delight. Greedily we wait and plot for them to be repeated, but the truth is that you never get the same moment twice  never in quite the same way. And even if you did, you would never feel the same about it! So, the best thing to do is to savor it while it happens and record the memory for later times. And meanwhile, keep gathering the treasure of other magical moments.I knew this moment would delight me many a time in the future even as I lived through it. This one was a literally frozen moment at minus seven degrees in a rustic Sugar Shack nestled in the mountains of Brigham near Montreal. It is the beginning of Maple season and all of Canada, particularly Quebec, which supplies 80 percent of the worlds maple, goes maple-crazy. They liberally pour the golden syrup into all  from soups to cocktails to salads, eggs, dishes, desserts, and even beauty masks and medicines! And they are eager to share their maple tales  legends, recipes and the syrup.But the most fascinating experience was the celebrated Maple Snow Taffy  a moment I awaited eagerly. This is a tradition during maple season where you create simple taffy on actual snow and then  what else, lick and chew it all up! Out into the freezing air stepped Pollender Andre, the smiling patriarch of the shack, in his red plaid shirt, with a snow tray and a jug of the golden syrup. With great flourish he poured little ovals into the spotless snow, and then before these totally froze, expertly wrapped the sticky semi-frozen maple around popsicle sticks. Standing in that frozen dreamscape, the resultant taffy was possibly the best dessert Ive ever experienced, given the entire hoopla around it!But then that is the kind of sensational packaging that creates the hype for moments that click and cling. Unless you weave stories and create magic moments, how are you going to make good memories? You need to weave magic in order to create magic moments; gather stardust in order to stay starry-eyed. Remember, someone has put in an effort behind every palpable memory. And this is a trick we need to learn. Those little stories, the romance of exciting phrases and names, and the creation of legends. In India, we have all the content and the legends, but when it comes to translating these into moments that can be marketed for tourism, we lag behind dismally.Here you may just stumble upon moments and legends, but how about having these dished out to you professionally? The Canadians have maple, around which they have built an entire industry and their tourism sector. What have we done with its equivalent  honey or palm jaggery, which is a part of the very fabric of our lives?And so a cocktail in a Montreal hotel that uses a spoon of maple syrup in white wine gets called A Little Kiss  now, who can resist the name? In the middle of the wintery Quebec landscape, a rustic shack with real fire in real hearths serves a traditional lumberjack meal on wooden tables and benches  and you are told the shack has been built by the owner with his own hands using maple wood from his own land. His apple-cheeked wife has used maple in every dish she has prepared with aplomb  from pea soup to crispy pork rinds to sliced roasted potatoes, maple sausages, maple beans, salad with maple vinegar  uff! Can you forget the magic of such an afternoon?Magic doesnt always happen; quite often it needs to be created with a sense of purpose, so as to leave beautiful moments and memories. Just a visit to the Taj Mahal isnt good enough. You want to be able to get a whiff of the times, be caught up in the legends and feel the love and pain. That is what stays with you. You want to hear the voices of the time, echoing down the years and you want to have someone weave the ancient tapestry alive before your eyes. That then is magic.A lasting memory is built when pleasure meets delight and the emotions get caught up in the thrill of the moment. That is when magic happens, and that is when the memory clings, to be revisited later for thousands of lasting, delightful moments. And yes, never try to relive a memory in exactly the same way. It doesnt happen!"
5904e4b17be9e04154dfd5dc,"GM animus dooms Indian farmers: Innovation, not price control is the answer to affordable Bt cotton technology",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Plainspeak/gm-animus-dooms-indian-farmers-innovation-not-price-control-is-the-answer-to-affordable-bt-cotton-technology/,2016-03-03,,The Times Of India,"The biggest threat to cotton farmers is the bollworm, because of its ability to cause extraordinary damage to crops and livelihoods. In the 1990s, pesticides were the only weapon farmers had against the bollworm. Half of all the pesticide consumption in India was accounted for by just one crop  cotton.Yet, the ability of the bollworm to develop pesticide resistance meant that millions of small cotton farmers in India were being pushed into poverty. The situation changed only after the Indian government, having conducted extensive and stringent bio-safety tests, allowed farmers to switch to using genetically modified (GM) Bt cotton seeds in 2002.Bt cotton contains genes from the naturally-occurring soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). GM technology is used to introduce the Bt gene into cotton seeds, which then produce a protein that effectively tackles insects like the bollworm. GM technology thus offers the cheapest and most efficient method of protecting the cotton crop from this belligerent pest.Resulting higher yields and lower costs of cultivation have enabled Indian farmers to realise higher profits on their produce over the past decade. It has also averted a potential environmental crisis from excessive pesticide use.The only GM product allowed for commercial cultivation in the country, Bt cotton has made India the largest cotton producer in the world and converted the country from a net importer to a net exporter of this important cash crop. Over 90% of the countrys cotton growing areas today grow Bt cotton, which has resulted in the doubling of cotton yields over the last decade.Bt cotton amply demonstrates that responsible introduction of GM crops can be one of the most potent ways of increasing productivity of crops in this country. Yet, fear mongering by activists over the bio-safety and environmental safety of GM crops has led to a hostile policy regime and resulted in amoratorium on transgenic crop trials.As field trials are the first step towards cultivation of GM crops in India, this ban prevents biotech researchers from introducing indigenously developed GM technologies in the market. This has created a technological monopoly for Monsantos Bt cotton seeds.Indian seed companies have to pay a licence fee for using Monsantos proprietary Bollgard technology that was approved for use in the country over a decade ago. The failure of successive Indian governments to stand up to anti-GMO activists has led to this monopoly-like situation.The current government now wants to tackle what it perceives as high Bt Cotton seed prices through price controls. To this end, it has recently passed the Cotton Seed Price (Control) Order (CSPCO) 2015 to fix a uniform maximum sale price for Bt Cotton from March 2016. But two wrongs seldom make a right. Price controls will create more market distortions by further dis-incentivising the development of alternative Bt cotton technology.Price controls on cotton seeds through state and central government orders are the latest example of Indias schizophrenic approach to innovation. On one hand we are asking foreign companies to come and innovate in India, but on the other we have tied the hands of Indian innovators with regulations and prevented them from bringing indigenous technologies to farmers.Advances in agri-biotechnology have led to the development of transgenic varieties of rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, cotton, brinjal, mustard, potato, sugarcane and chickpea. Apart from this, agricultural scientists are leveraging molecular markers in crop breeding for the selective propagation of genes that improve yields and resist disease.Recently, eminent agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan made a strong case against the moratorium and in favour of a smooth approval process towards field trials for GM crops, saying that they are absolutely essential to assess risks and benefits. He even suggested that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) should organise an All India Coordinated Project for the field testing of GM crops in the farms of agriculture universities.The government should certainly pay heed to Swaminathans suggestion as GM crops not only have the potential to bring succour to millions of needy in this country but also ensure food security for the entire nation. While the government understands the importance of food security, it needs to translate this understanding into action.The constitution of the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) as an independent regulatory body is thus critical to the countrys progress in biotechnology. BRAI is proposed as the final authority on issues related to biotechnology with the mandate to take science-based decisions after due discussions and safety trials on GM products. But the BRAI Bill has been hanging fire for several years now because of the hostile public view propagated by a few, on GM crops. This has resulted in a Catch-22 situation.It is of paramount national interest for the government to unshackle agri-biotechnology, which can provide powerful solutions to irrigation and arable land challenges in a country that has only 2.3% of the worlds land area but must ensure food security for 17.5% of the world population.The writer is Chairman and Managing Director, Biocon"
5904ed3c7be9e04154dfdddd,"Phuchkanomics workforce bigger than TCS, SBI, Infosys",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/phuchkanomics-workforce-bigger-than-tcs-sbi-infosys/,2016-02-07,,The Times Of India,"Everybody knows Bengalis love fish. It was left to Radhaproshad Gupta, raconteur, connoisseur of fine things and writer of delightful essays on Bengals social history, to dig up this long-forgotten proverb: When they hear of fish/ Even trees spy a tasty dish.Bengalis also love their phuchkas  panipuri or golgappa to you  but little has been written about it. This neglect is surprising, because Bengal has a vast culinary literature: everything from shukto to sandesh has been chewed over and digested.Phuchka shares the same basic characteristics as a panipuri or golgappa, but there the similarity ends. It is futile to debate, as some do, which variant is best. Kolkatass phuchka beats others, well, hollow. But as Romans used to say, de gustibus non est disputandum: dont dispute other folks tastes.I am a phuchka addict. Luckily, in the south Kolkata neighbourhood where I grew up and where my mother lives, Im spoilt for choice. Each vendor has a wicker stand, nearly keeling over with the weight of a steel handi full of spiced tamarind water, pots of spices, boiled chana, and the red-cloth-wrapped container full of paper-thin, deep-fried balls. These are filled with spicy potato paste and tamarind water and served apace.For the last four years or so, my local vendor, a youngish man, used to work alone. But recently he has employed a helper, a chhotu, who peels potatoes, mixes ingredients and serves lesser snacks like churmur and aloo-kabli to customers.If a relatively small phuchka vendor needs at least one helper, how many people are employed in the trade across Kolkata? The best person to bounce this off was, naturally, my childhood friend Somen Gaine: government babu and peripatetic encyclopaedia on everything Bengal eats.We needed to first reckon how many phuchkawalas plied their trade in the vastness of Calcutta. To estimate that, we selected a 40,000sqm (200m x 200m) area of the city we know backwards. Fairly fast, we counted the number of phuchka vendors in this area.We then extrapolated this number on the roughly 201 sq km area of the metropolis, defined by the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. With some qualifications  areas like New Alipore, say, had fewer vendors than places like central, north or south Kolkata  we realized that the total number of standalone phuchkawallas was around 200,000.Since the smallest, and most ubiquitous ones, could employ one person and larger ones anything from three to five helpers, we assumed a fairly modest 1.5 helpers per phuchkawala. That gave us 500,000, or half a million, people employed selling phuchkas on the pavements of metropolitan Kolkata.The vendors do not make those delicate shells, boil potatoes or prepare the delicious chana. These are made, from early morning onwards, by women working tirelessly with aloo, chana, dough and woks in sprawling shantytowns. The colonies are located in areas like Beleghata in north Kolkata, Narkeldanga in the east and Chetla south of that. This is labour-intensive work. We reckoned it probably takes at least three women to produce enough shells, boiled aloo and spiced chana for each vendor daily. Three women plus 1.5 chhotus working with each of 200,000 phuchka vendors: that should give us the total Phuchkanomics workforce.This number is a staggering 1.1 million folks. If you stretch the geographical boundaries of the trade to areas now included in Greater Kolkata, Phuchkanomics could employ even more people.Surprisingly, the ubiquitous phuchka is a relatively recent addition to Kolkatas streetfood. My father snacked on the traditional telebhaja (assorted vegetables crisp-fried in batter) or shingara (samosa) as a teenager around 1940. My mother gorged on phuchkas 15 years later.So, this all-conquering snack probably came to Kolkata sometime between 1940 and 1950. The people who brought it came from eastern UP and Bihar. In the following 75 years, Phuchkanomics grew to employ more than a million people in Kolkata alone.To see the scale, here are some numbers, based on a recent Economic Times report on top employers in 2014-15. That year TCS had three lakh employees, State Bank of India 2.2 lakh, Infosys 1.6 lakh, IBM India 1.5 lakh and Wipro 1.34 lakh. The Phuchkanomics workforce is larger than all put together.In February 2015, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said it was silly to harp only on big business as sources of livelihood: One can set up a tea stall or a telebhaja or sweet shop and have a decent income. Guffaws followed. Didi might have said this to score debating points, but factually shes not off the mark. If Phuchkanomics alone can sustain a million souls, many more are nourished by the manufacture and trade of ready-to-eat streetfood: telebhaja, sweets, kebabs, kathi rolls and momos.Bengal might be starved of big investments, but the gargantuan Bengali appetite, literally, feeds its engine of growth."
5904f8b27be9e04154dfe8d1,Bread-Poha or things like that,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sweet-n-sour/bread-poha-or-things-like-that/,2016-02-05,,The Times Of India,"Youve had a heavy lunch or a late one and if youre fitness (or thinness) freak you might forego dinner but if youre like me, who need their three-squares (and some intermediates), bread-poha is our salvation. Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"
590592bf7be9e04154e0019a,"Take my advice, I am not using it anyway!",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nirvanama/take-my-advice-i-am-not-using-it-anyway/,2016-01-16,,The Times Of India,"Being an 80s child, I had this phase of badges! How many of you remember that trend of pinning those cool badges on your t-shirts and feeling all fashionable. With the quirky and cocky messages, those badges were like the status updates of that time. And my brother had this particular badge that I found really clever because it said- Take my advice. I am not using it anyway.I only found its true meaning once I got pregnant. Starting from close friends to stranger aunties in the market, everybody had free advice to dole out to me. I was not only stomped down to the nave dumb first time mother figure but also my belly seemed to have become public property which everybody thought was okay to caress while dishing out their favourite pregnancy or parenting tip!And we all know that was just the beginning. All through motherhood we are surrounded by advice. Some from well-wishers and some for the heck of it. However close you might be to your advice-giver, there are times when it gets to you. What do you do with constantly being told about how to do things?Well for starters, ironically, I would say listen to the advice. I am not saying that you should incorporate it. But just listen. Sometimes you get some really good handy tips which can make your motherhood journey smoother. There is nothing like experience in the job called motherhood after all.Now once you have heard the advice, what do you do about it?Over the years I feel that advices can be split into three categories- usable, customizable and throw-able. Know which advice falls in which category and give it only that much heed.Usable advices are those that can be directly incorporated into your life. For instance, eggs make a delightful snack for your one-year- old baby. Since egg allergies are rare, its an advice you can just copy paste into your life. All new moms are looking for healthy snacks for their babies. And first time moms benefit with snacks ideas.So this kind of easy and good advices fall in the usable category. Dont think twice before using them.Second type of advices are customized advice. These are advices that you should try only after customizing it to suit your baby and other circumstances. And thats where your maternal instincts come in. For instance, if somebody advised you to try jeere wale aalo (an Indian potato dish) for your fussy eater call in your instincts to customize the dish your toddler is most likely to happily consume. If I need to feed my daughter potatoes, I know she will have plain boiled and salted potatoes instead of any other preparation.So customized advices require not only heed but some thought from your side as well. But the end results are usually very beneficial. Hence, its a good investment of your time.A large percentage of advices fall into this third category- throwable. Just thank the advice-giver politely and move on. These dont require any of your time and energy. For instance; Oh! My child was potty trained at 8 months! You better start training your kid too. He is almost a year old! Such statements can exit your head as soon as they reach it. You already know that each child is different and some things are just taught when you feel right. There is no hard and fast rule about them.So throwable advices should reach your mental recycle bin ASAP. They dont deserve your time or energy.But the underlying rule of being at the butt end of receiving advice is to remember that the person (usually) means it in the best of intentions. So no matter which category the advice falls in, first thank the advice giver and then do a mental categorization of the advice and give it the apt amount of time and energy required.There is no need to get huffed and puffed about getting too much advice. I know it can be overwhelming sometimes. But it doesnt mean that you dont know your job as a mother. It just means that a lot of people are out there to help you out.Dont misconstrue any advice to be a statement at your personality or capability.Its just advice. Take it or leave it!"
590592ff7be9e04154e001f3,Fishing for food in God’s own country,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/fishing-for-food-in-gods-own-country/,2016-01-12,,The Times Of India,"The maitred is reeling off a bunch of names and pointing to the glistening fish on glorious display on an ice rack. As he rattles off names like aiyla, mathi, kari meen, ney meen, aiykoora, my eyes glaze over. It all sounds very fishy to me!And it is. I am in Kerala on a holiday and spoilt for choice for a seafood preparation at one of the most exotic hotels in Kochi, Bruntons Boatyard. Steeped in Raj influences and mid-century elegance, the hotel is famous for its History Restaurant, which boasts a menu that is simple but innovative: each dish reflects the culinary history of the community it is culled from. And with about 30 different communities living in Kochi, the menu at the History restaurant tells its own special story.The First Class Railway Mutton Curry speaks of a time gone by when the British traversed the country building the Indian railways. Fish Cutlets tell tales of an Anglo-Indian heritage. Fish lovers savoring the flavour of Samak Bil Harder Asful are transported to Arabia. Then theres the fish Moilee which is a throwback to the citys Syrian-Christian roots. The Vindaloo transports you to the time of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese influence in the community. And not to be left behind, the Dutch Pudding with a lingering trace of cinnamon, harks back to the days when the Dutch East India Company made Kochi one of their settlements.At the History Restaurant, these cuisines have been given a new lease of life, recreated faithfully each evening by chefs who did their research in the best place possible  with the old families of Kochi. The staff is friendly and well-informed and I get to hear interesting nuggets of information as we wait for our meal. Niju, our waiter for the evening, tells us that the Portuguese taught the local people how to use coconut milk in the dishes and the Jews introduced the famous appam, pancakes made with fermented rice batter and coconut milk. While the Dutch didnt share much, preferring not to go dutch with the locals, the Dutch bread called Brooder is sold on the streets of Cochin even today.I want to sample the two signature fish dishes of this delightful old-world restaurant: Chuttulli Meen and Vypeen Moilee. The chuttulli meen recipe is one of the oldest recipes on the menu and the recipe for the marinade of the fish was handed over to chefs by one of the local Jewish families when the hotel first opened. The fish (mullet or Indian salmon) is filleted, covered with roasted shallot paste and grilled. It is then broiled in a salamander (not to be confused with the amphibian; this is a high-end broiler for kitchens!). The cooked fillet and a thick layer of potato slice is then draped over a liberal helping of saffron sauce and served with a side helping of roasted aubergine and okra.Even as I am cleaning out my plate with relish, my next dish, Vypeen Moilee, makes its grand appearance. Named after Vypeen or the island opposite Bruntons Boatyard, moilee is a take on the original Portuguese stew, with milk being replaced by coconut milk and local spices added to suit the local palate. Served with appams, moilee is a mlange of fish, squid and prawn, flavored with turmeric and tempered with fenugreek seeds.As I tuck into my aromatic stew, I glance around the room. Except for the gentle clink of cutlery and the discreet movements of the attending staff, everyone is concentrating on their dishes.Conversation is hushed, suitably reverent to the surroundings. The Foodie son is busy opening his three-storey Tiffin Meal, containing appam, vegetable khichdi and Kerala chicken cutlets. The H, has played it safe and gone with the more traditional meal of Malabari parathas, Kerala kela koftas and coconut rice.I turn back to my moilee and as I take another mouthful, I let out a little sigh of pleasure. The fare has been simple, but has left me fishing for more food in Kerala."
590593e77be9e04154e0033d,Grow this food: How to woo more states aboard field trials for GM crops,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/grow-this-food-how-to-woo-more-states-aboard-field-trials-for-gm-crops/,2016-01-14,,The Times Of India,"Eminent agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan has suggested that India should accelerate field trials of GM crops with the combined services of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) and state agriculture universities. Its a sensible idea and must be pursued diligently. The stalemate thats gripped Indias efforts to accelerate the development of GM crops, after its success with BT cotton, must be broken. Though the national Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee has approved field trials for new GM strains of important crops like rice, wheat, maize, potatoes, brinjal, mustard, sugarcane and chicken peas, its efforts have been stymied by many state governments refusing permission for field trials.A joint intervention by central and state research institutions, coordinating all-India field trials, will help secure greater acceptance from the states. After all they have an important stake in improving agricultures prospects. As the experience with cotton shows, GM crops help reduce the costs of cultivation, raise crop productivity, boost farmers income, critically raising agriculture output to meet the needs of a growing population.One reason various states remain inhibited about GM trials is that over the years some of governments own expert committees have taken a very negative approach, stressing the need for innovation much less than the need for greater caution in adopting new technologies  instead of seeking a balance. Actually, Indias safety mechanisms for GM field trials are already in line with those advocated by multilateral organisations like OECD and the International Plant Protection Commission. Some states like Maharashtra and Gujarat have already proceeded ahead with field trials. But a coordinated approach between ICAR and state universities can help bring more states on board, giving a big boost to Indias pursuit of greater food security."

(Source: AP) Israelis are finding new advice hard to swallow: in the name of proper nutrition, their health minister has gone on the warpath against the beloved Hanukkah tradition of gorging on sugar-laden, deep-fried, jam-filled doughnuts. (Source: AP)Israelis are finding a new campaign by their crusading health minister hard to swallow: in the name of proper nutrition, he has gone on the warpath against the nations beloved Hanukkah tradition of gorging on sugar-laden, deep-fried, jam-filled doughnuts. As head of a powerful ultra-Orthodox political party, the bearded and black-coated Yaakov Litzman considers himself a guardian of Jewish traditions. But in his other hat, hes a health-conscious official on a mission to stamp out junk food and child obesity.Watch What Else Is Making NewsLitzmans two roles have come into conflict with his high-profile call to avoid the lure of the high-calorie sufgania doughnut.I call on the public to avoid eating sufganiyot, which are rich in fats, Litzman told a conference last week promoting healthy eating. You can find alternatives for everything nowadays and there is no need for us to fatten our children.As part of his health food drive, Litzman has campaigned to have sugary drinks removed from schools and taken on fast food giant McDonalds  earning public praise for promoting proper nutrition.McDonalds out. Not in our country, he said, in a refrain that went viral.But going after doughnuts during Hanukkah is something else entirely.For most Israelis, eating the sufgania is as essential to celebrating Hanukkah as lighting the menorah and spinning the dreidel.Along with the latke  a fried potato pancake  it is the delicacy most associated with the eight-day holiday that commemorates ancient miracles and a triumph over oppression. Taking a page from the playbook of the ancient Maccabees who inspired the holiday, many are resisting Litzmans campaign.You have to eat it, but in proportion. Its yummy, its good, its the season, said Gideon Haba, a doughnut seller in the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem. I dont believe he (Litzman) meant it. Its like not lighting the candles. He just wanted to send a message.Yosef Lipsman, a customer buying his first doughnut of the year, said the tradition was harmless as long as you dont go overboard.White flour is not great for you, but its all a matter of how much, he said. You can enjoy it once in a while.Litzman declined a request for comment.Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, commemorates the Jewish uprising in the second century B.C. against the Greek-Syrian kingdom, which tried to force its culture on Jews and desecrated the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem.The holiday lasts eight days because  according to tradition  when the Jews rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem, one vial of oil, enough for one day, burned for eight days instead.Hence the tradition of eating oily foods.A sufgania is essentially a ball of dough deep fried in oil, packed with strawberry jelly and sprinkled with sugar. Other versions are alternatively filled with chocolate spread, cappuccino or dulce de leche.In recent years, it has become trendy for bakeries to offer embellished versions that are topped with marshmallows, crumbled cookies, pralines, popping candy and whipped cream. Some include a syringe that can inject toffee, pistachio cream and even vodka into the doughnut for an additional kick.The upgrades have created a 100 gram (3.5 ounces) doughnut that can contain as much as 500 calories.Burger King recently jumped on the bandwagon by introducing its SufganiKing  a standard Whopper stuffed between two doughnuts.At a Roladin bakery in Jerusalem, dozens of elaborate versions were laid out on display.Maybe they are fat  but they are good. Thats the reason why theyre good, said Haim Newman, a customer. My family came from a long, long tradition of baking and my father always says what his grandfather told him before: If you want something good, it has to be fat.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e1a17be9e033b96e928d,Cuba’s Fidel Castro made revolutionary mark on history,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/cubas-fidel-castro-made-revolutionary-mark-on-history-4396115/,2016-11-26,,Indian Express,"In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File) In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File)The son of a wealthy landowner, Fidel Castro turned his back on a life of privilege to lead a left-wing revolution in Cuba that endured for decades and was shaped by his political cunning, keen sense of destiny and boundless ego. Castro, who has died at the age of 90, was at once idealistic and pragmatic, sharply intelligent and reckless, charismatic and intolerant.Critics saw in him a stubborn bully who violated human rights, jailed his critics, banned opposition parties and wrecked Cubas economy. Admirers saw a visionary who stood up to US domination of Latin America, brought healthcare and education to the poor, and inspired socialist movements across the world.Even before leading the 1959 revolution that propelled Cuba toward communism and onto the Cold War stage, Castro saw greatness in himself. From an early age, he admired historys boldest figures, particularly Alexander the Great, and believed he and his rebels were part of that tradition. Men do not shape destiny. Destiny produces the man for the moment, he said in 1959.Castro toppled the unpopular US -backed dictator Fulgencio Batista by uniting a disparate opposition and outsmarting a bigger, better-equipped Cuban military. His alliance with the Soviet Union put him at the center of the Cold War, most notably when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took the world to the brink of nuclear war.He was a global celebrity, his beard, military fatigues and big Cuban cigars making him instantly recognizable. He owed his prominence in part to geography. Looking to bolster an ally just 90 miles (140 km) from Florida, Moscow helped him build socialism by giving him billions of dollars worth of aid and favorable trade, from oil to tractor parts.But Castro also mined Cuban nationalism and Latin American pride, stirring resentment of US power and influence. He managed to preserve his revolution despite constant US hostility even when Cuba reeled from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, showing the vigor of a man who intended to die in office.Instead, almost killed by a serious intestinal illness, he was forced to step aside in 2006 and he formally handed over to his younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2008.In his final years, Castro wrote opinion columns for Cubas state media but was rarely seen. His famously long speeches gave way to silence, at least in public, and comfortable track suits replaced the stiff black boots and crisp military attire.On Dec. 17, 2014, Raul Castro cut a deal to restore diplomatic ties with the United States. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro offered only lukewarm support, raising questions about whether he approved of ending hostilities with his longtime enemy.PERMANENT STRUGGLEKnown by the militaristic title of El Comandante, in some ways Castro was always replaying the exhilaration of revolt, exhorting Cubans to fight one battle after another, from confronting US hostility to boosting potato production.FILE  In this March 14, 1957 file photo, Fidel Castro, the young anti-Batista guerrilla leader, center, is seen with his brother Raul Castro, left, and Camilo Cienfuegos, right, while operating in the Mountains of Eastern Cuba.

(AP Photo/Andrew St. George, File)He survived numerous assassination attempts and outlasted nine US presidents in power, seizing control of Cuba while Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House and stepping down during George W Bushs second term.Throughout, Castro lectured Cubans.A magnificent orator who instinctively altered his cadence to fit the moment, he re-trod history and delved deep into detail about Cuban independence heroes, plans to perfect the revolution and the declared evils of US imperialism.Tall and physically commanding, fastidious in his attire, he often built to a crescendo of indignation, gesturing firmly with long-fingered, well-manicured hands.We shall endeavor to be brief, he told the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, then set a record for UN speeches by talking for nearly 4-1/2 hours.Castro never allowed statues of him to be erected or streets to be named after him, saying he did not want a cult of personality. Nevertheless, the cult was everywhere. His image and words were posted on billboards and his name was invoked at every public event.Most Cubans, whether for or against him, refer to him simply as Fidel.He was a night owl. He would keep foreign guests waiting until late at night and then summon them for talks. Even his critics would sometimes find themselves oddly charmed by such encounters.Tad Szulc, a biographer, called him Cubas great master of political seduction.EARLY YEARSBorn on Aug. 13, 1926, Castro grew up as a privileged son on his fathers plantation in the eastern village of Biran, where his playmates were children of impoverished workers living in thatched huts with dirt floors. He said the economic injustice he witnessed there inspired a life-long sympathy for the poor.FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File) FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File)He attended the Jesuit-run Belen School in the capital and then studied law at the University of Havana, plunging into the violent politics of the time and starting his drift leftward.Long-winded, intolerant and  unusually for a Cuban  awkward on the dance floor, he was not embraced by his fellow students at first but eventually emerged as a leader.He took part in an aborted 1947 plan to overthrow Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and was at a youth conference in Colombia when riots broke out and some 2,000 people died.After law school, he decided to run for Congress in 1952. When Batista staged a coup and halted the elections, Castro began plotting armed rebellion.In 1953, he led a raid on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. Dozens of followers died and he, Raul Castro and others were captured and imprisoned.History will absolve me, he declared at his trial.Pardoned in 1955, he went into exile in Mexico where he met Argentine revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara. Together with Raul, they trained a rebel band that in 1956 returned to Cuba aboard an overcrowded yacht called Granma.Ambushed at landing by government troops, only 12 of the 82 rebels on board made it to the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains.Castro denied Batistas claims that he was a communist but decades later he told Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in a book 100 hours with Fidel that by 1952, I was already a convinced Marxist-Leninist.Whatever the evolution of his views on communism, he was determined to throw off American influence in Cuba. When US-supplied aircraft bombed his rebels in 1958, he vowed revenge.I have sworn that the Americans will pay very dearly for what they are doing, he said in a letter to close friend and aide Celia Sanchez. When this war has ended, a much bigger and greater war will start for me, a war I shall launch against them. I realize that this will be my true destiny.US ENEMYWashington viewed him as a potential enemy even before his rebel army forced Batista to flee Cuba on New Years Day, 1959.It took just two years for the relationship to unravel as Castro nationalized swathes of the economy and introduced a broad agrarian reform. Thousands escaped the island, starting what became a bitter bulwark of opposition in Florida.In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File) In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File)In April 1961, when his military crushed a CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, he declared Cuba socialist and allied himself with the Soviet Union.Moscow put nuclear missiles on the island in 1962, touching off a 13-day superpower showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis.In an Oct. 26 cable to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Castro seemed convinced the Americans would invade Cuba and suggested the Soviets eliminate this danger with an act of legitimate self defense.Khrushchev felt Castro was advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike and rejected it, telling him he was satisfied with US President John F. Kennedys pledge not to invade.The Soviets withdrew the missiles and Washington secretly agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, ending the crisis.The United States imposed its trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 and the CIA admitted trying to kill Castro in the early years of his rule.Plots or plot ideas included trying to get Castro to smoke a poisoned cigar and taking advantage of his love of diving with an exploding seashell, or poisoning a diving suit.Castro reveled in his status as an elusive target.Im really happy to reach 80. I never expected it, not least having a neighbor  the greatest power in the world  trying to kill me every day, he said at a 2006 summit in Argentina, where crowds greeted him like a rock star.While the embargo was economically devastating, it allowed Castro to shift blame for chronic economic problems away from the system he built and onto the United States.He cast the fight as a David and Goliath story.Philip Bonsal, US ambassador to Cuba in 1959, later described Castro as a phenomenally gifted, erratic and unscrupulous autocrat who freed his country from American imperialism only to reduce it to a satellite of Moscow.REVOLUTIONIn a country that was prosperous by Latin American standards but riven by inequality and illiteracy and with an unsavory reputation as a brothel and gambling-rich playground for Americans, Castro sought to build a socialist society.His government trained thousands of doctors and provided free schooling, changes that have endured well into the 21st century, even as the states role in the economy was reduced in recent years.Those gains came at considerable cost to personal freedoms. Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the states long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibias independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.COMMUNIST OUTPOSTAfter the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castros communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the special period for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cubas economy.Little was known about Castros personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leaders only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a caudillo, or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term.

All 18 of Jakartas measures affecting imported horticulture, animals and animal products were prohibited under WTO rules dating to its predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the panel said.Watch what else is making news:The import restrictions cover products such as apples, grapes, potatoes, onions, flowers, juice, dried fruit, cattle, chicken and beef, the U.S. trade office said in March 2015 when challenging the measures. New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay on Friday welcomed the ruling, saying the restrictions were estimated to have cost the countrys beef sector up to NZ$1 billion ($690.20 million).This is an important result for New Zealands agricultural exporters  and for trade fairness, McClay said in a statement. The arbitrators urged Indonesia to bring its measures into conformity. All sides have 60 days to appeal any of the findings.Indonesia will file an appeal against the WTO ruling, the countrys trade minister Enggartiasto Lukita told reporters in Jakarta on Friday.

(AP Photo/File) Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions carry an effigy of South Korean President Park Geun-hye as they march during a rally calling for Park to step down in Seoul, South Korea. (AP Photo/File)As hundreds of thousands of South Koreans poured into the streets every weekend for two months to call for President Park Geun-hye to resign, the oppositions leading contender to replace her appeared reluctant to seize the moment. That is changing as Moon Jae-in, a 63-year-old human rights lawyer who lost the 2012 election to Park by more than a million votes, has in recent days taken a higher public profile as he seeks to lead the liberal Democratic Party into the next election and end eight years of conservative rule.Watch what else is making news:Like many on the left, he calls for sweeping reform of the chaebol  the big conglomerates that dominate the economy and have been at the heart of the current political crisis  calling them a source of unfairness in South Korea. He promises to move the presidential office into a multi-purpose government building and turn the palace-like Blue House, where Park remains while a court decides her fate after she was impeached by parliament, into a public museum.He has also said that, if elected, he would visit rival North Korea before making a trip to South Koreas main ally, the United States. Just two North-South summits have been held since the 1950-53 Korean war that divided the peninsula. The people who are angry in Korea want regime change, and the most realistic option and most probable person to do that is Moon Jae-in, Yang Jung-chul, a close aide to Moon, told Reuters.Moon had led opinion polls in recent weeks, although a survey released on Thursday by Realmeter showed he had fallen just behind United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, by 23.1 percent to 22.2 percent. Ban has yet to declare his candidacy or party affiliation, but has been expected to join a conservative grouping.Moons popularity among liberals stems from his time as chief of staff to South Koreas last liberal president, Roh Moo-hyun, a figure revered by the left for his experimental and anti-establishment politics that sought chaebol reform.Moon is a symbol of that experiment, said Yang.But Roh, derided by conservatives for his pursuit of engagement with North Korea that they say failed to change Pyongyangs behaviour, could also be Moons undoing, especially among South Koreas elderly. The majority of people aged over 60, most of whom are conservative, have turned out to vote in the last three presidential elections, according to National Election Commission data. In 2012, 85.9 percent of over-60s voted.By contrast, the least-avid voting group is people in their 20s or 30s, many of whom took to the streets for the first time during recent candle-lit protests in Seoul. At the last election their turnout levels were below 65 percent. That was high, by recent standards, for the demographic, but Moon will need to convince an even bigger share of them to turn out and vote for him in the upcoming election, which is no sure thing.He has a tendency to make ambiguous comments and be overly-cautious of crossing lines, said Moon Ji-hyun, a student activist at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. He wasnt in the frontlines at the early stages of the protests.The Constitutional Court must decide whether to uphold parliaments Dec. 9 motion to impeach Park, which could take up to 180 days and, if successful, trigger an election two months later.Sweet PotatoMoons parents fled North Korea during the Korean War and resettled in Busan, at the south of the peninsula, where Moon grew up in a shanty town. He was jailed in 1975 for protesting against the dictatorship of Park Chung Hee, President Parks father, whose rule lasted 18 years. After leaving mandatory military service, where he served in the special forces, Moon became a lawyer.As leader of the opposition last year, Moon adopted a more centrist stance to win over sceptics. But just 8 percent of those polled at the time said they thought Moons party was best on economic issues, compared with 44 percent for the ruling Saenuri Party.To win undecided voters, Moon needs to address security, diplomacy and unification, where many are distrustful of him, said Lee Chung-hee, a politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. Moon came under fire earlier this year for revelations in a former foreign ministers memoir that he had backed a motion to abstain from a United Nations vote against North Koreas human rights record.While Moon leads the race to represent his party in the election, new stars have risen. One is Lee Jae-myung, the mayor of Seongnam, just south of Seoul, who has gone from rank outsider to third place in polls, riding the crisis with populist speeches.By contrast, Moons caution and deliberate speaking style has earned him the nickname sweet potato  slow to cook, slow to eat, and a little difficult to swallow. Lee, meanwhile, has been dubbed soda for his refreshing new take on politics. In a recent radio interview, Moon said the Seongnam mayor was indeed like soda  refreshing but, unlike his own nickname, lacking substance.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e68b7be9e033b96e94b3,Irrigation Projects: Cabinet revises policy for cost escalations,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/cabinet-revises-policy-for-cost-escalations-4365174/,2016-11-09,,Indian Express,"Girish Mahajan (File Photo) Girish Mahajan (File Photo)The Maharashtra cabinet has revised the policy for approvals to cost escalation for major irrigation projects. Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan said revised administration approvals (RAA) wont be required now for projects where the variation in cost over the approved cost was below 15 per cent. The government has further ruled that increase in costs for acquisition of land and rehabilitation of the project affected, and expenditure incurred for acquisition of forest lands wont be factored in while computing the escalated costs for irrigation projects.Watch what else is in the newsSources said this relaxation by itself would regularise escalated project costs for a majority of the projects stuck for the want of a revised administrative approval. As many as 200 projects are presently stalled for want of revised approvals. At least 150 out of these wont need RAA under the revised policy, said I S Chahal, Principal Secretary, Water Resources.Ever since the previous Congress-NCP regime was stung due to approvals for arbitrary cost escalations in irrigation projects, the revised administrative approval issue has been a political hot potato in the state. Mahajan too admitted that authorities responsible for issuing such approvals are wary of facing the heat for irregularities which were committed in the past. He said this had impacted the pace of projects.He claimed that the government had now specifically defined parameters that could be considered for ruling that the projects scope had been modified, and required a revised approval. The projects scope would be considered altered in cases where technical changes in the dam or canal design or water use and allocation resulted in an over 10 per cent difference in the projects irrigation potential, or where the projects construction cost, as previously mentioned, has increased by over 15 per cent. A revised approval will be needed for a project where the live storage potential of dams has increased by over 1 per cent.In August this year, the government had cancelled 94 tenders of 14 scam-tainted irrigation projects worth Rs 9,196 crore, which had been allocated during the previous regime. While Mahajan said fresh tenders would soon be issued for these projects, he admitted that the new policy for cost escalations would also be applied to some other irrigation projects where the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had raised audit objections for irregular expenditure. The previous regime had allocated contracts for many of these without mandatory environment and forest clearances. Some were taken up without even acquiring the land required for the project.Meanwhile, for projects where the cost escalation are still considered arbitrary, the governments new policy has laid down a separate screening procedure, which include technical audits, ratification by a state-level expert panel, and project-wise reviews at the cabinet level.While the BJP has taken action against officials and contractors in scam-tainted irrigation projects in Konkan and Vidharbha after winning office, the government has drawn flak from certain quarters over its inability to turn tables on the slow pace of irrigation projects.On Tuesday, in another major decision aimed at revival of the irrigation sector, the government ring-fenced funds required for the maintenance of completed projects. Of 3,600 completed irrigation projects, maintenance of over 2,000 projects has been hit due to paucity of funds. This has adversely impacted the states water scarcity management plan, said Mahajan.The cabinet Tuesday cleared a proposal permitting non-deposition of revenues realised by water reservoirs through various means to the state governments consolidated fund. These would now be used only for irrigation purposes. The government has divested powers for irrigation management to the five statutory irrigation development corporations. These corporations will now be permitted to utilise up to 40 per cent of the revenues raised from dam projects in their respective areas for repairs, restoration, and maintenance works for completed irrigation projects. The remaining 60 per cent amount raised by each corporation would be deposited in a centralised irrigation management account, and are proposed to be utilised for special repairs and expansion of projects, dam security and safety works, strengthening and modernisation of water projects, revival of lift irrigation schemes, canal works, strengthening of water use committee, and training of personnel in irrigation management, among others.In another decision, the cabinet also divested its powers for decisions regarding water allocation from a dam. While reserving 75 per cent water in a dam for irrigation purposes, 15 per cent for drinking purposes, and 10 per cent for industrial uses, the cabinet has now allocated powers to a cabinet sub-panel to take such decision. The previous regime had courted criticism for large-scale diversion of dam waters for non-irrigation purposes.State protests sedition charges against Marathi youth in BelgaumThe state government has said it would be writing to the Karnataka government, protesting against the slapping of sedition charges and cases slapped against Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum.The move comes after the Shiv Sena raised the issue during the states cabinet meeting Tuesday. At the meeting, Shiv Sena minister Diwakar Roate even sought adopting a resolution demanding imposition of the Presidents Rule in Belgaum.While no such resolution was moved, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reportedly informed his cabinet colleagues that an official letter would be issued to the Karnataka government, conveying strong dissent over the action against Marathi speaking youth since November 1, 2016.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

For those involved in agriculture in West Bengal  estimated to be two-thirds of the states 91 million population  the question and its potential answers have dire consequences.While the average area owned by each household in Bengal is 0.174 hectares  the smallest in any state of India  officials said the sheer fertility of land in the Bengal delta meant that many, particularly marginal landowners, cultivated their land to supplement their income. Take for instance the case of Dharani Kanta Bhowmik (55), a schoolmaster who died on Tuesday in Cooch Behar after standing in queue for three consecutive days. Bhowmik owned less than 0.1 hectares and like many others in Cooch Behar, cultivated paddy. He had been trying to withdraw money to pay labourers who worked on his land.WATCH VIDEO: Heres Why RBI Restricted Withdrawal Limits On Jan Dhan Accounts To Rs 10,000On Thursday, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das announced that farmers would be allowed to withdraw up to Rs 25,000 per week against crop loans, subjected to limits. This would also apply to those who hold Kisan credit cards. Bank accounts needed to be in the name of the concerned farmers.On the other hand, traders with Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, would be able to draw of Rs 50,000 per week to pay wages and other sundry expenses.Almost 1,500 km away, at Boinchi in Hooghly, small-time trader Bibhash Sen who also grows potatoes on his land, is confused. I have three katha of land (0.1 hectares) on which I grow paddy. But I dont have a kisan credit card. Does that mean I would not be able to avail this relaxation? I went to the cooperative bank, but no one knew. I will go again on Monday. I desperately need money to buy seeds and begin planting.As of June 2016, only 31 per cent of the 17 lakh targetted Kisan credit card accounts had been opened, said State Level Bankers Committee records.Moreover, as per government records, Bengal only has 2,918 APMC markets and agriculture  in spite of the state being food surplus  remains largely informal. But unlike other food surplus states, small and marginal farmers contribute almost 86 per cent of the total output in Bengal. But the inherent informality of the agricultural system implies that these small and marginal farmers continue to be deeply in debt, with an estimated 88.7 per cent of all indebted ones owning land less than 1 hectare.WATCH VIDEO: Income Tax Law To Be Changed To Increase Penalty On Unexplained Deposits: All You Need To KnowOn the ground, farmers  many of whom are already in debt  are now finding that the traditional network of moneylenders do not exist anymore, following the governments decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.Prabir Sengupta, a small-time farmer in Howrahs Andul area, said: The demonetisation move has spelt disaster for me. As a BJP supporter, I had initially welcomed the move. But it is obvious that the government didnt think this through and take into account how agricultural practices are in different across the country.Claiming that wholesalers had refused to buy his potato crop citing inability to pay in cash, he added: I have a debt of almost Rs 7 lakh and will have to take more loans to pay for labour and fertiliser.

There has been months of speculation that 65-year-old Tsang, who tops popularity polls, would step down and enter the race to become the financial hubs chief executive. Hong Kongs unpopular incumbent chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, announced last Friday that he would not stand for a second five-year term.Watch what else is making news:The city government said Leung had already submitted Tsangs resignation to Chinas central government and the secretary for financial services and the treasury, Chan Ka-keung, would be acting financial secretary.Cable News reported earlier on Monday that Tsang may not make an announcement on standing for the top job immediately. Tsang was not immediately available for comment.Tsang, known as Uncle Pringles for a moustache similar to one worn by a character on a potato crisp brands packaging, is a U.S.-educated fencing and martial arts enthusiast who has been the former British colonys finance minister since July 2007. Candidates running for chief executive have to be vetted by a 1,200-strong Election Committee, which was selected on Sunday.The same committee will decide who will lead the city of 7.2 million people in late March. Tens of thousands of protesters clogged city streets for weeks in 2014 to demand a one-man-one-vote election for chief executive but they failed to win any concessions from Beijing.Hong Kongs next leader faces a host of challenges with concern growing over the influence of Beijing in city affairs as well as a fledging independence movement that has alarmed Chinas Communist Party leadership.Hong Kongs economy generally grew at a stable pace under Tsang and the government recorded surpluses every year. Last years surplus was HK$14.4 billion (US$1.86 billion).But critics say Tsang has failed to use the governments HK$842.9 billion (US$110 billion) in reserves to fund long-term social welfare policies, instead announcing one-off sweeteners in his annual budget addresses.Compared with Leung, who is generally seen as a dour, hardliner, Tsang has tried to present a more gentle persona, more in touch with the public. Tsang is also less closely identified with Beijings Communist Party leadership than Leung.Retired judge Woo Kwok-hing became the first person to enter the race and announced his campaign in October.

Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes. The farmers are also facing problem in buying seeds for the forthcoming Rabi season which is likely to go up manifold in Vidarbha and Marathwada. We have thought of some measures to address these issues, Kishor Tiwari, director of the mission, told The Indian Express.Watch What Else Is making NewsHe said they had requested the state government to approach the Centre with request to allow use of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 for purchase of seeds at government and registered private centres. We also want the banks to make enough new currency notes available to APMCs to tide over the payment problem. If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named.

(Representational)Centres demonetisation decision is taking toll on the mental health of many cash strapped businessmen in rural areas of West Bengal whose entire sales are in cash. Within a couple of days of the announcement, a potato wholeseller started having panic attacks since he has about Rs 50 to Rs 60 lakh of the perishable agriculture produce lying in a cold storage.He buys potato on credit in bulk and sells it in cash to smaller traders but now, as a result of cash crunch, there are no buyers. The wholeseller fears that his entire stock will go waste, incurring him a huge loss. He was suffering from panic and anxiety attacks and thought he will die, Senior consultant psychiatrist Sanjay Garg told PTI.According to psychiatrists, they have been getting a significant number of patients suffering from mental stress after the centres move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes. Garg said that most of such patients are from middle and upper-middle class families belonging from rural Bengal where the reach of plastic money is limited.Another psychiatrist Santasree Gupta said, One of her patient is a 50-year-old widow who inherited Rs 30 lakh in cash savings from her deceased husband. She had plans to buy a flat and spend the rest of the amount in her sons marriage. And now she is feeling very insecure. She had to put her on short-term medication to help her control the stress, Gupta said. Asis Ray, who owns a hotel in beach towns of Puri and Digha, was brought to a psychiatrists clinic by his family as he started drinking heavily and snapping at kids.Besides panic attacks, people are also suffering from irritable behaviour syndrome, Garg said.

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Prices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.Shortage of new currency notes has hit potato farmers in Punjab, who are now struggling to sell their stock of potato seeds. At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes. The seed supply season lasts only for three weeks. We are bound to incur heavy losses, said Satnam Singh, a potato grower.Doaba region, where potato seeds are grown on around 90,000 hectares, is considered the potato seed bowl of the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Although agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year.The agriculture sector is all set to bounce back leaving two years of drought behind and may well pull off record foodgrain output of 270 million tonnes in 2016-17 on good rains, but farmers woes may continue due to adverse impact of notes ban and low sales realisation. The farm growth is estimated to rise at over 5 per cent this fiscal, from 1.2 per cent in the previous year, on the back of record kharif foodgrain production at 135 million tonnes (mt) and likely bumper output in the ongoing rabi season, helped by good monsoon in most parts of the country.The agriculture sector has done well during the year. We received good monsoon after facing the drought year. Kharif in general was very good and rabi sowing has been brisk. We are hopeful of bumper production this year, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana Pattanayak told PTI in an interview.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAlthough agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year.Our target is to achieve foodgrain production of 270 million tonnes while our last peak production was 265.04 mt in 2013-14 crop year (July-June), he said.Agriculture sector growth was lower last year because of drought. But from that level, we will move higher.On farm sector growth, NITI Aayog Member Ramesh Chand said: It will be spectacular growth after facing two drought years. We are expecting a growth of 5.5 per cent this year.The growth rate of agriculture and allied sectors will be 5.3 per cent even if wheat productivity throughout the country is lower by 3 per cent due to rise in temperature, he said.Asked about adverse impact of demonetisation on farmers, Pattanayak said there is not much impact as the credit system has been strong in rural areas and farmers have become more resilient over the years.Our farmers have witnessed very strong drought in last two years and yet they have bounced back. I dont think it has really impacted, he said.However, farmers organisations as well as former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have expressed deep concern about impact of demonetisation, saying farmers are unable to buy quality seeds and fertilisers for their rabi crop and are also facing problems in selling crops for want of demand.Despite record kharif production this year and expected good crop in the rabi season, farmers conditions continue to be grim due to lower sales realisation, with domestic and global commodity prices staying depressed.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has also affected the domestic demand of fruits and vegetables, forcing farmers to sell their produce at throwaway price.About farmers woes, agri-economist Ashok Gulati said: This year, production is likely to bounce back and therefore, much better than last year. However, farmers are already under debt. And prices of cotton, basmati rice and, with demonetisation, many fresh fruits and vegetables are depressed. Because of that, despite higher production levels, farmers have not gained much.2016 began on a sticky note as the countrys overall foodgrain output remained flat at 252 mt in 2015-16 crop year due to second straight year of drought.Pulse output fell to 16.5 mt resulting in high prices for most part of the year that kept the government on its toes, which took various steps to cool prices and bring relief to consumers.The measures like domestic procurement and import to boost local supplies helped ease the prices of tur and urad from about Rs 200 a kg, but chana continues to rule high.As per the official estimate, wheat output rose to 93.55 mt, from 86 mt, but FCIs procurement fell sharply and domestic prices of wheat and its products began to rise towards the end of the year. The government scrapped import duties on wheat to boost domestic supply.To provide relief to farmers hit by the cash crunch, the government has given them an additional two months to repay their crop loans due in November-December and said prompt repayment will be eligible for the extra 3 per cent interest subsidy.The government had earlier allowed farmers to buy seeds through old Rs 500 notes from central and state-owned seed companies as well as from ICAR and central varsities. It had also asked fertiliser companies to sell soil nutrient on credit basis to farmers.To check food inflation, import duties on palm oils and potatoes were reduced. Stock limit on sugar mills were also imposed to check prices although improved domestic rates helped industry clear arrears to farmers.The year also saw the successful rollout of the landmark National Food Security Act (NFSA) across the country. Programmes like new crop insurance scheme and eNAM to link all 585 mandis on an electronic trading platform were announced to augment farmers income.In this years budget, the government raised agri-credit by Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 9 lakh crore for the current fiscal and levied 0.5 per cent Krishi Kalyan cess on all taxable services to fund farm initiatives.Eminent scientist M S Swaminathan hailed the new schemes, but stressed on proper implementation. He also wanted the government to pay farmers 50 per cent more than the production cost as part of the minimum support price (MSP).Expressing concern over poor implementation of agri schemes, Gulati, the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, said: The government should focus completely on agriculture and try to implement some of the programmes properly.The year also witnessed the government fixing the maximum retail price and royalty for cotton seeds, including Bt cotton, based on its order issued at the fag end of 2015.The move was opposed by biotechnology firms while the domestic seed manufacturers were in favour of the decision. Global biotechnology major Monsanto threatened to re-evaluate its India business. It plans to introduce new products, besides entering into the legal battle against this order.However, NCP supremo Pawar recently attacked the NDA government for taking such a move, saying Indian agriculture is being brought back to licence and control raj which is detrimental to the growth of the sector.The government of the day should not have hostility to improve systems and technologies, he said, adding that the government is overly cautious on the technology front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Her face breaks into an occasional smile when the emcee, Raja, says, Ise kehtein hain artiste taliyaan (This is who you call an artist. Applause).

A Bhojpuri industry sensation, she has starred in over 35 videos and commands a higher price than the other girls.Sonia Jaiswal, 30, who goes by the stage name Simran, is a wedding dancer. Tonight, she is performing at a reception party in Mau Dostpur village in Mau Aima town, nearly 40 km from Allahabad, the heart of the wedding orchestra, in eastern Uttar Pradesh. An online search for Allahabad arkestra throws up nearly 5,000 dance videos and and even more on private sharing forums. The contents are the same: women dancing to hit Bollywood and Bhojpuri film songs, before a largely male audience.A thriving industry in Allahabad for almost 40 years, the little-known world of wedding dancers made headlines in August this year when 32 girls trafficked from Chhattisgarh were rescued from an orchestra in the city. More recently, a wedding dancer was shot dead during a performance in Bathinda in Punjab, once again turning the spotlight on the lack of regulation and security in this largely unorganised industry.Sonia didnt let these events play on her mind as she set off from Allahabad in a Tavera with her group around 5.30 pm. She has been hired for this wedding season by Mohammad Arif, 42, the owner of Payal Orchestra who goes by the name Marshall. Today she is accompanied by two other woman dancers, a male singer, 10 orchestra artistes, the emcee, and her husband, Saurabh, a dance organiser.

In a corner, Seema Rawat, a.k.a Sapna, hurriedly slips into a red lehenga as the emcee calls out her name from the stage behind their room: Welcome the queen of heavenMake-up mein zyada time lag gaya (Make-up took a long time), Sapna tells Marshall, who walks into the room without knocking, urging her to hurry up. A final glance in the mirror and happy with her look  green lenses, fake lashes, silver eye-shadow and wavy hair extensions  she sprints towards the stage.Sapna is tonights star performer. A Bhojpuri industry sensation, she has starred in over 35 videos and commands a higher price than the other girls. Sapna ko dekh kar log stage pe paise bhi zyaada phenktein hain (People throw a lot more money on her on stage), says Marshall, sneaking peaks at Sapna, as she takes to the stage.As the 26-year-old gyrates to the tunes of the hit Bhojpuri song Chalakata hamro jawaniya, the audience goes into a frenzy. Unlike Sonia, Sapna is all smiles and expression, engaging with the men who have clambered onto the stage. And like Marshall had predicted, this time, the money comes in Rs 100 notes.The audience only wants Bhojpuri these days. Sab double-meaning songs hain, mujhe toh bhasha samajh bhi nahin aati (The songs are full of innuendo, I dont even understand the language), says Sonia, changing into her next outfit, a yellow lehenga. She wears a black slip inside to avoid any wardrobe malfunction on stage. On stage, everyone wants to touch us I pin my dupatta tightly. Mai toh sober dance karti hoon taki mahaul kharab na ho (I prefer sober moves so that the crowd doesnt go beserk), she says, as her husband Saurabh arrives with plates of noodles.As the girls take to the stage, several mobile phones, all set to video mode, go up. There are few women in the audience As the girls take to the stage, several mobile phones, all set to video mode, go up. There are few women in the audiencePehle paani toh pilwado (Get us water first), she yells at her husband, her voice drowned by the music on stage. She gestures to indicate water and Saurabh gets the message. They only want us to come and perform; no one is bothered about our food or water. At least here we have a room to change; in most villages, we are put up in a tent outside the stage. Koi izzat nahin hai (There is no respect), she says, now asking her husband, who has returned with a bottle of water, to find her earring which she has dropped on stage. He rushes off once again.In the wedding season, we perform at around five functions. The events continue till early morning and we get to sleep for only two-three hours. It gets very tiring, she says, relieved to see her husband return with her missing earring.Soon, Sapna walks into the room after her performance, all huffing and puffing. We have a break, she announces. Dulhe ke bhatija ka birthday hai, singer happy birthday gayenge abhi (Its the grooms nephews birthday. The singers will sing the birthday song), she says. She then asks Sonia if her husband can escort them to the toilet across the courtyard of the house.Saurabh instructs the girls to wrap themselves with shawls and walk behind him. As they step out of the room, all eyes are on them. The grooms friends, the cooks and cleaners and a few women guests look on as the girls walk, eyes on the ground, behind Saurabh. The girls take turns to use the only toilet in the house as Saurabh waits outside. A few men approach him and try to strike up a conversation. He ignores them and accompanies his wife and the other two dancers back to their room. The group of men trails them all the way up to the room and disperses only after Marshall intervenes.Sonia gets to keep 50 per cent of the money tossed at her on stage. Sonia gets to keep 50 per cent of the money tossed at her on stage.Once a source of entertainment for the landed gentry, over the years, wedding dancers have begun catering to people across social and economic strata. Earlier, the Thakurs and Brahmins organised mujras for their guests, where tawaifs (courtesans) performed. Sometime in the 70s, orchestra groups replaced the mujras and became accessible to everyone, says Shukla.But while these performances became accessible and affordable to more people, the lack of regulation and security has left the dancers vulnerable to exploitation  women have to perform in distant villages, before largely male audiences, with no police or security cover. Thats the security that Sonia found in Saurabh. Things can get out of hand at these functions. If not for Saurabh, I wouldnt have been able to continue in this job for so long, says Sonia.As the night grows darker and colder, the women and children leave the venue. Around 10 pm, it is time for Sonias next performance.This time, as she dances to Lata Mangeshkars 80s chartbuster Kaliyon ka chaman, her performance picks pace, the moves are racier and she even mouths the lyrics. Many in the audience move towards the stage, more money is hurled and Marshall is a happy man. Saurabh watches it all from a corner of the stage.*****In Allahabad, the world of wedding orchestra unfolds in the lanes of Kydganj, a locality that houses both the offices and the homes of its many managers, singers, dancers, announcers and musicians. Back in 1983, an orchestra group here gave Prashant Gautam his first break as a congo player. I later moved to drums, became a singer and announcer, and finally set up Gautam Orchestra in 1997, he says, sitting in his small office whose walls are lined with photographs from his days as a musician.Workers at the Mau Dostpur reception sneak a peak at the dancers. Workers at the Mau Dostpur reception sneak a peak at the dancers.Today, at 52, he says he is disillusioned with the industry. In Kydganj, there are over 150 orchestra groups, but they can hardly be called artistes. Teen dancer aur dedh metre ke banner ke saath sab apne aap ko orchestra group bolte hain (Anybody with three dancers and a one-and-a-half metre banner calls himself an orchestra), he says, angrily calling up dancers who havent arrived yet. His group has to perform at a wedding in a few hours.All of them must be sleeping. No rehearsals, no riyaz (practice) Bhojpuri orchestra has killed the industry. We used to sing songs of Lata, Rafi and Kishore and dancers did kathak. Now every time a singer gets on stage, audience usko bhaga deti hai (the audience hoots him out). Now they say, Bhaisaab, sirf dancer chahiye (they say, we only want dancers). And we are left catering to the demands of the dancers, he says. The wedding season is a headache, we are better off doing jagrans during Navratis. At least people listen to devotional songs out of fear of God, he says.Wedding entertainment, or janwasa as it is referred to in UP and Bihar, is an old tradition. In the early days, the brides family arranged for such functions for the grooms friends. Similar events were also organised by the grooms family after the wedding. Today, janwasas are limited to villages, and orchestra groups travel hundreds of kilometres to make such appointments.Wedding entertainment, or janwasa as it is referred to in UP and Bihar, is an old tradition. Wedding entertainment, or janwasa as it is referred to in UP and Bihar, is an old tradition.Ravi Shukla, or Ravi Raj, as he is known in orchestra circuits, remembers making a 700-km trip to Gondia in Maharashtra, only to find out that all the grooms friends had left before they could reach. A dance broker today, he says that while such setbacks are a part of the job, what irks him is peoples attitudes towards the industry. Bobby mein Dimpleji ne bikini pehna tha, swimming kiya tha (In the movie Bobby, Dimple Kapadia wore a bikini and swam), but you could watch the film with your family. That is because peoples thoughts were clean. In the 90s, parents of dancers and singers accompanied them to janwasa functions and watched the show. But around the year 2000, vulgar Bhojpuri songs were released and it all went downhill from there. Now no parent wants their children to join orchestras. It has become a big taboo, says Shukla, who gets dancers to Allahabad from Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar during the wedding season.He says its the taboo that has forced dancers to assume stage names. Till the 90s, dancers used their own names. They were famous artistes and people adored them. But over the past 15 years, since the advent of Bhojpuri orchestra, dancers have started seeking anonymity, says Shukla, who started his own career in the 80s as a jagran singer. At one point, we even tried to introduce duets, but they failed miserably. The men in the audience would get on stage and push the male dancer out, he says.Playing the video of the Bathinda firing on his phone, Shukla says, This is another worry. I am the local guardian for these girls. If something happens to them, I will be held responsible. I often warn them to stay alert and remain in their rooms after the performance These girls are smart, they know how to take care of themselves, he says, now making his way to the rented accommodation behind his office, where three of his dancers stay.*****Before she sets out for her performance at night, Sonia has to cook for her in-laws. Before she sets out for her performance at night, Sonia has to cook for her in-laws.Seven years ago, Jyoti, a resident of Punjabi Bagh in west Delhi, told her mother that she had landed a job at a neighbourhood beauty parlour. Her mother, who worked as a tailor, was elated. After her husbands death, the family was going through a rough time, and with seven daughters and a son to take care of, any income was welcome. What Jyoti didnt tell her family was that she had, in fact, taken up an offer to become a wedding dancer.My first performance was at a village near Gurgaon. I got Rs 800 for it. Fortunately, I was part of a group dance and simply copied what the seniors did. For outstation performances, I would tell my mother that I have been hired for make-up by the brides family. This time too I said the same thing, she says, sitting in a dingy room with pink cobwebbed walls in Kydganj. She has been hired by Shukla for this wedding season and he takes care of her accommodation and meals during the months. Two other girls  Esha from Delhi, who performed at the Mau Dostpur reception the previous night, and Nisha from Punjab  share the room with her.I take this place on rent for four months a year and hire a cook-cum-cleaner for the girls, says Shukla. The room is small, with a bed, a few racks and no windows. There are clothes, mostly embellished ones, and imitation jewellery strewn all over the place.As Jyoti informs Shukla that she is unwell and cant travel to Sultanpur, 100 km away, to perform, Shukla dials another orchestra group to arrange for a dancer and asks Nisha to pack her bags quickly. Around 5 pm, Nisha reluctantly steps out of the bed and asks Jyoti to help her out. Na nahaya, na khaya, bas bhagna padega (I havent taken a shower or eaten anything, I have to rush), says Nisha, who only returned at 5 am that morning from a performance.Sonia at her home Sonia at her homeNisha is my best friend, smiles Jyoti, asking her roommate to wear some perfume. Two years after I became a dancer, I married a man who did odd jobs at the Navy base in Delhi. I quit dancing completely then, but the marriage only lasted two-and-a-half months. He would often get drunk and beat me up. I got a divorce and returned to dancing. Nisha stood by me like a rock during those times, she says.I have a five-year-old son. He stays with my mother. Dancing has helped me pay for his education, she adds. She plans to quit the industry in another three-four years. There is too much pressure. Acha dikhna, gande Bhojpuri gaanon pe nachna, ajeeb logon se milna (You need to look good, dance to vulgar Bhojpuri songs and meet strangers). I am already 28, there are very few years I have anyway, she says, seeing off Nisha, who rides pillion on Shuklas scooty till the main market, where a Qualis with the other orchestra members is waiting for her.Before leaving, Shukla says, Dancers can only work till they are 35. Phir moti ho jati hain, jhuriya aa jati hain (Then they get fat, get wrinkles) and younger dancers replace them. But then, there is Sonia, who you met last night. She has really taken care of herself. She says she is 30, but she must be at least 40.*****There were many things that brought Sonia and Saurabh together 12 years ago. Four years into her job as a wedding dancer in Ludhiana, Sonia arrived in Allahabad from her hometown, Jalandhar. My father, who worked in the Army, died when I was 14. My mother died a few years later. I was their only child and suddenly, I was all alone. An aunty from Ludhiana got me into the profession. I worked with her in Ludhiana for three-four years. She taught me everything  dance, make-up She was the only family I had, she says. When I came to Allahabad for a performance, I decided to stay on.In a new city, Sonia, who only spoke Punjabi then, says she wanted some security, somebody she could rely on. Thats when she met Saurabh.Saurabh had been working as an orchestra organiser for five years and was looking to marry someone from his own profession. We dancers are a kasba (community) and we understand the pressures of the profession. I fell in love with Sonia the first time I saw her perform. Eventually, after two years, I asked her to marry me, he says, struggling to get out of bed around 6 pm. Hum maan gaye, kaise na karte (I agreed, how could I have refused), says Sonia coyly. We had an Arya Samaj wedding, she adds, now instructing her son, Anuj, who has just returned from his tuition classes, to get potatoes from the market. Her younger son is at her sister-in-laws home, a few houses away.After the marriage, Saurabh and his parents moved from their family home to Kydganj. We took this two-room place on rent for Rs 5,000 and have been living here ever since, says Saurabh, getting ready for the evenings performance. After a quick shower, he prays and asks Sonia to prepare dinner for his parents.Prashant Gautam, who runs Gautam Orchestra, one of the oldest in Allahabad Prashant Gautam, who runs Gautam Orchestra, one of the oldest in AllahabadSoon, Anuj returns with a bag of potatoes and hands it to Sonia, who is rolling out chapatis in the kitchen. Still dressed in her night gown, she says, A year ago, I told Anuj I was a dancer. It is better that he gets to know from me, rather than from neighbours. But I dont want him to get into this industry, she says. Par kismat to dekho, iske sar par bhi dance ka bhoot chadha hua hai (But just my luck, even he wants to dance). He watches all the dance reality shows on TV. Turning to her son, she asks, Kaunse show mein jaane ka bolta hai (Which is that show you want to participate in?). DID (Dance India Dance), he responds in a flash. Yes, that one. But I have asked him to study till Class 12 and then think of anything else, she says, preparing the curry.Haan, par do saal baad isko ghar par baithna hai, ab bahut ho gaya dance (Yes, but after two years, she has to sit at home.) I am planning to start my own orchestra group. We will have enough money to take care of the family then, says Saurabh, now ready to set out for one of the last events of the season.The children need me. I have to leave them at my sister-in-laws home every time we go out. If I am not around for them, they will turn wayward, she says, calling out to her father-in-law to say that dinner is ready. But will she miss dancing? Sometimes I wonder what will I do at home all day. I will get bored. Saari zindagi dance hi to kiya hai (I have been dancing all my life), she says."

Photographs: Tashi TobgyalMy name is Love, but I dont believe in love; ours is an arranged marriage, says Deepak aka Love Gola. At 5 pm, with only five hours to go for his wedding, Deepak is sitting slumped on the floor, dressed in a pair of checked boxers and a half-sleeved vest and leaning heavily on his mother Amita. The 22-year-old gym instructor and his extended family have congregated at Jattumal Dharamshala, at the far end of Sitaram Gali in Old Delhis Chandni Chowk, from where the baraat will set off this evening. I had big plans for my wedding. I wanted to go to the parlour to get dressed but all I could afford was a hair cut, says Deepak, running his fingers through his hair thats streaked blond.The baraat sets off The baraat sets offDeepak, the youngest of four siblings, had got engaged to Priya Prajapati, a 22-year-old from Nand Nagri in East Delhi, in April, six months before the Central governments sudden decision to scrap notes of Rs 500 and 1,000. The decision scuttled his dreams of a grand wedding and what followed was an endless spiral of cost cuts. Demonetisation ne sab pe paani pher diya (Demonetisation played the spoiler), he complains.Deepaks 53-year-old mother Amita, her face taut, is concentrating on the mehndi her niece is drawing on her outstretched palms. Deepaks sister Bhavna, 32, is lying on one of the three mattresses spread out on the floor, trying to put her three-year-old son to sleep. The few others in the dharamshala, a few cousins and friends of the Golas, are idly waiting for the ceremonies to begin.Since November 8, we have only been queuing up outside banks  I, my son, daughter, niece Sirf dimag mein tension hi tension hai (I have been very tense), says Amita, whose husband Roopchand, a property dealer, died four years ago. Amita gets nostalgic as she talks about their wedding in 1978, incidentally the year of the last demonetisation exercise. Of course, then I didnt know any better. Or at least I dont remember going through such trouble, she says.His nephew has woken up in time for the wedding His nephew has woken up in time for the weddingWe had saved up Rs 2 lakh for the wedding. We queued up to exchange some money but the first three days, by the time our turn came, the money at the bank would get over. We finally managed to deposit all the money after 10 days, and then began queuing up to withdraw it, says Deepak, stretching out his mehndi-painted feet. The family could eventually only withdraw Rs 58,000, the budget hence for Deepaks November 23 wedding.The government has set a withdrawal limit of Rs 2.5 lakh for weddings, with stringent conditions  claimants have to produce wedding cards and copies of advance payments made. Besides, withdrawals are allowed only from balance available before November 8. We didnt even try. We werent sure if we were eligible and there was no time anyway, says Deepak.Indu, 24, the third of Amitas four children, says, If this (the demonetisation) hadnt happened, bhaiyya ki baraat would have set off from a banquet hall, not from a dharamshala. The siblings exchange a quick smile. They had hired a banquet hall but cancelled it for the dharamshala close to their home.A few paces from the dharamshala, the forced austerity at the Gola household finds its echoes in the markets of Chandni Chowk, the Capitals hub for all things matrimonial.Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UP Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UPAt the office of Jea Band, one of the oldest wedding organisers in Old Delhi, Anil Thadani, 45, is busy handling the mood swings of his clients. All our clients are panicking Most of them come to us with old notes, phir gussa dikhatein hain, koi emotional ho jata hai (Some clients get angry, some turn emotional). But we have no option, we have strictly stopped accepting old notes, says Thadani. The company, which featured in the 2001 movie Monsoon Wedding, organises venues, tents, bands and decorations for weddings.There are 150 auspicious wedding days in a year and business is usually brisk then. But this year, 25 per cent of our bookings have been cancelled, many have been postponed, and 15 per cent is on credit. We have been forced to lay off some of our staff, says Thadani, stopping to admonish someone on the phone: Pooja shuru hone waali hai, ghodi nahi pahunchi (The puja is about to begin, where is the horse)!A lot of families are also opting for day weddings to cut lighting costs, he says, though adding that while the move has hit the industry, in the long run, it will make the sector more organised.***At the dharamshala, Amita is still disgruntled. Unmindful of the caked mehndi on her palms, she angrily pulls out a cloth bag full of Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes and says, This is all the money we have! We cancelled the reception and the sangeet. All the other ceremonies  haldi, mehndi and the wedding  are being done in one day. Ladki waalon ne kuch dahej bhi nahin diya. Unka cash bhi humne hi line mein lag kar exchange karwaya (The girls family didnt give dowry either; it was we who got even their old notes exchanged), she says. We didnt buy new clothes for ourselves or gifts for our guests. I am wearing a sari my mother gifted me. The only thing we bought was a suit for Love, she says, pointing to a beige-and-maroon sherwani hanging from a nail on one of the pillars.Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relatives Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relativesAt Chhabra Store, one of the most popular bridal wear shops in Chandni Chowk, Manoj Kumar, 44, a salesman, says many families have, like the Golas, cut down on their trousseau budget in the wake of the new policy. Lehenga sales have been hit. No one is buying lehengas for more than Rs 15,000-20,000, says Kumar. Bride toh lehenga kharidegi hi, par relatives ke liye ab koi kapde nahin khareed raha (The bride will of course buy the lehenga, but no one is buying clothes for relatives), he says, folding a bright red sari.Kunal Singh Chhabra, 18, the store owners son who is overseeing operations at the shop today, says sales have gone down by 80 per cent. The first three days after November 8 saw zero business. Even now, the ones who come to us insist on giving us old notes. So we take the money from them and send our boys to queue up outside banks, says Chhabra, who is an undergraduate student in Mumbai and is in the Capital on a break.However, he backs the demonetisation move. I want to become a politician when I grow up. So I think it is brilliant.All along Katra Asharfi, the lane in Chandni Chowk that has over 200 bridal-wear shops, including Chhabra Store, most are empty, with desperate salesmen calling out to people on the road. Across the street, there are lines but outside banks and ATMs.Chhabra, however, is hopeful. Have you seen the movie Band Baaja Baaraat? The actors in the movie say no matter what, weddings will happen. That is absolutely true. Just give it some time, says the budding businessman.A little more than a kilometre away is Dariba Kalan, the Mughal-era bazaar for silver jewellery. There have been no customers since morning. We have lost 70 per cent of our business. The artisans are suffering, they are not accepting cheques, complains Vineet Seth, 48, who owns Durgadas Seth Jewellers and Silversmiths. He is also anxious about the rumours that have been doing the rounds. People are very scared. Look around, most shops are shut. We have been receiving messages on WhatsApp about possible raids by the Income Tax Department, says Seth, who is also the general secretary of the Dariba Jewellers Association.Apart from the silver stock thats piling up in his shop  jewellery, bowls and cups  Seth is worried about his top-selling gift item, silver boxes with framed notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. No one wants them now. I have to get these notes replaced. Now, people are only buying silver coins worth Rs 250, he says.Seth is not completely convinced about the demonetisation, rattling off a few idioms to express his state of mind: We have entered a tunnel, lets see if there is light at the end of it Dekhein oont kis karwat baithta hai (Lets see how it goes), he says.A kilometre away is Kinari Bazar, the one-stop shop for wedding bling  shimmery laces, envelopes, turbans for grooms and chooda-kaleere (bangles) for the bride. Modi ji ne bahut accha kiya, sabko barbaad kar diya (PM Modi did a very good thing, he killed our business)! says Piyush Gupta, 30, who owns a shop in the market. Business has gone down by 50 per cent. People are opting for court marriages, no one wants turbans and bangles anymore. We sell items worth Rs 10, 20 and 50. But the few people who come to us come with Rs 2,000 and we turn them away, he says.***Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vessels Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vesselsShaadi ka mazaa hi nahin hain (the wedding fervour is missing), says Deepaks sister Bhavna. Around her, everything is moving at an unhurried pace, with little to suggest that Deepak will take his wedding vows in a few hours from now. There is no decoration  no marigold flowers or electrical streamers  no trays of food going around, no piled-up gifts.The family had got the wedding invitations printed before the notes were scrapped, but not everyone who received the invitation is here. Though I sent invitations to my four sisters, eventually, I asked only two of them to come. The other two have big families. Where would they have stayed? Now they wont invite me for their childrens weddings, worries Amita, hurriedly collecting her belongings to get dressed at a neighbours home. Beauty parlour bhi nahi gaye, khud hi taiyaar ho rahe hain (We are not going to the salon either), says Bhavna.Ram Veer, 23, a mehndi artiste from Aligarh who visits Delhi during the wedding season every year, says its been an exceptionally bad season for him too. We charge Rs 50 for designs per hand, but that hardly gets us any money. We usually make all our money from bridal mehndi  Rs 1,500 for both hands and feet. Earlier, we would be booked for the entire season, but this year, there are no customers, only cancellations, says Ram Veer, sitting on a stool outside a beauty salon at Sitaram Gali.Unlike the Golas, many families have also cancelled their orders for wedding cards. We have stacks and stacks of printed invitations but customers havent been collecting them. All the customers just disappeared. Sab thap ho gaya hai (Business has shut completely), says C P Singh, 42, owner of Maharaja Papers and Cards in Chawri Bazar, the Capitals biggest market for invitation cards. I have been sitting here for hours People say demonetisation is a good move, but I dont know, it all seems uncertain now, he says, looking out at the empty street.As the sun begins to set, there is some sign of activity at the Jattumal Dharamshala. Two workers from Radhe Radhe Snacks and Caterers, an 80-year-old shop in Chandni Chowks Sitaram Gali, have arrived. The menu is basic: samosa and chai. For its owner Pradeep Sharma, 45, that is a severe downgrade. Usually, there are 250-odd items on the menu during the wedding season. Kashmiri aloo, shahi paneer, kadai paneer, tawa sabzi they are all off the menu now. Clients are only asking for potato dishes. Four of my orders have been cancelled. At the Gola wedding too, we are only making snacks, he says.Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they say Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they sayThough the sudden note ban forced the Golas to trim their wedding expenses, Deepak had booked the band, dhol and photographers in advance. We had already given them some advance payment and they said if we cancelled, we wouldnt get the amount back. We still have to pay them some money. Right now, its all on credit, says Deepak, now slipping into his sherwani in the courtyard. His sister Bhavna and elder brother Sonu, 30, help him with the accessories. Indu has gone to a friends house to get her hair done.Outside, members of Rahul Band are getting impatient. Panch baje se aaye hain, pata nahin kab baraat niklegi (We have been here since 5 pm, dont know when the procession will leave), says band master Moolchand, dressed in a blue velvet outfit with yellow trimmings.Moolchand and his team of 11, all from Mahua village in Uttar Pradesh, come to the Capital only during the wedding season, and play bass drums, trombones, French horns, bugles, and sousaphones, set to tunes of old Bollywood songs. This time, however, Moolchand says, their trip has been wasted. This is our fifth wedding of the season, but we havent earned much. Some tell us to take cheques, but what will we do with that? says Moolchand, who has signed up for the Gola wedding for Rs 12,000. He has got no money so far.The dholwallahs, who have spread out in the courtyard now, are worried too. They are from Solapur in Maharashtra and, like members of the Rahul Band, make trips to Delhi during the wedding season. We are supposed to get Rs 6,000 for this wedding, lets see. Hopefully, they will enjoy the music and gives us good shagun (money), says Raja Chouhan, 23. We will stay back till March. If the income isnt good, we will return to Solapur.Dressed in a blue shirt, trousers, a red jacket and a red hat, Chouhan is keeping an eye on Rahul Band. We will have to make sure we lead the baraat. If we go first, before the bandwallahs, we will get to pick the money the guests throw, he says.***In the courtyard, Bhavna is giving final touches to the groom. A dupatta is tied around Deepaks waist, a turban placed on his head and a garland of Rs 10 notes put on him. Deepak turns emotional. Wiping away tears and hugging his siblings, he begins to head out. His mother and sister Indu still havent arrived.His best friend, also called Love (Anand), arrives with another garland of Rs 10 notes, interspersed with a few Rs 100 notes. Dost ke liye itna toh karna tha (I had to do this for my friend). It cost me Rs 1,500, he says, patting his friend on the back and posing for a photograph with the garland.Its dark now and the videographers flashbulb lights up the courtyard. For a little while, at least, the tension dissipates and Deepak tries to enjoy his big day. The revelry picks pace as the band begins playing the song Ye desh hai veer jawanon ka, and Deepak and his friends and relatives break into a dance. A few in the crowd pout for selfies and pose for photographer Vikas Kumar.Kumar and videographer Dharam Singh, from SR Studio, are happy to oblige everyone, though they admit being worried about their payments. They booked us for Rs 35,000 for three days. But now, that it is just a one-day function, I dont know Let them have a good time today, we will discuss money later, smiles Kumar, rushing to take the grooms photograph with his sister Indu, who has arrived in a dazzling green sari, matching eye-shadow, and crimped hair.After a few rituals, the group heads to the street outside, where Ajay Giri, 24, has been waiting with Rani, the mare which Deepak will soon mount. Rani is dressed for the occasion  a jasmine garland around her ears and a red, velvet cloth on her back. Giri and Rani have been booked for Rs 10,000, but all that money goes to his owner. The only money Giri makes is the shagun, usually in notes of Rs 100 and 500, or even 1,000 if he gets lucky. These days, he barely gets Rs 200 in all for a wedding. Earlier, Rani would do three weddings in one night; now one and some days, none. Here too, I am sure Rani will get gud (jaggery) and I will get nothing, he says.He is right. Bhavna feeds Rani some jaggery and Deepak climbs on to the mare with some help from his friends. Giri is forgotten.Finally, Deepak Golas baraat begins to take shape. The air is filled with beats of the band and dhol and the wedding procession dances with abandon. Neighbours look out, bodies bent over window sills and parapets of roofs. One of Deepaks uncles takes out a bundle of Rs 10 notes and flings it on the groom. As the band and dholwallahs rush to grab the notes, the uncle quickly collects the notes and stuffs them in his jacket. Disappointed, the band and dholwallahs return to their spots and switch to a new track, Aaj mere yaar ki shadi hai. Happy with the new song, another relative tosses some money in the air and this time, band master Moolchand alerts his team members in time. Two of them rush and get the money.The procession begins, making its way past homes and shops, many of which have signboards of Yahan udhaar mana hai (No credit here) placed outside. The procession holds up traffic on the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk.A few metres away from New Delhi Railway Station, the band, dhol and ghodi are relieved and members of the baraat accommodate themselves into a few cars, some of their friends and relatives, the others hired. They are off to Nand Nagri in East Delhi, where Deepaks bride is waiting for them.Ladki waalon ne sirf pachas logon ka khana rakhwaya hai. Kya kar sakte hain, choti shadi hi hogi (The girls side has arranged for food for 50 people only.

(Source: File) Not only does a banana form part of a staple starch diet for a sizeable population of the world, it has an extensive history of international trade. (Source: File)While the old saying goes an apple a day keeps the doctor away, its time we shift our focus to the earthy, humble and affordable banana.Thats right, the tropical fruit is as big a hit as a potato, if we may, across the world. Not only does it form part of a staple starch diet for a sizeable population of the world, it has an extensive history of international trade, is rich with vitamins B and C, manganese and dietary fibre and has plenty of use in the world of textiles too. So this week, we went bananas and in our quest, spotted banana trees in the city. Mostly seen in residential areas, the interesting fact about the banana tree is that this tall plant is actually a herbaceous plant that is also a fruit. You see, they actually have pseudo-stems formed from leaf sheaths and almost every part of the banana plant is useful.Watch What Else is Making NewsLets start with the leaves: large, flexible, waterproof, they are multi-purpose in use: as umbrellas, as plates or disposable food containers, used in cooking (excellent for steaming fish), and when dried are used as packing material. The tender core of the trunk is edible too. Now, banana shoots produce fibres of varying degrees rendering the plant a source of fibre for high quality textiles. Japan apparently has a long history in making use of the banana plant for clothing and household use, from making tablecloths to kimonos. In Nepal, the trunk is harvested and used for rugs and textiles with a silk-like texture. Down south in India, its used as a thread for garlands. Did you know there is a banana paper too? Wow!Steam it, bake it, fry it, cook it  the banana finds use in and adds flavor to an umpteen number of dishes. Speaking of uses, the peel, scientists have realized, can be employed to decontaminate water. For a tree whose cultivation dates back to 5000 BCE and even 8000 BCE according to archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence, bananas are important elements in trade talks. Botanically speaking, cultivated bananas are called Musa acuminate, Musa balbisiana and Musa paradisiaca (hybrid). It belongs to the genus Musa.For the quirky, the banana is also a popular emoji and has found its space in the world of phrases like go bananas, and songs, too. Its a fruit that is offered to Lord Vishnu and Goddess Laxmi for happiness and its leaves stand for growth and regeneration.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has made a forecast of above normal winter temperatures overall, but a milder winter in north India, the core cold wave zone of the country.Watch what else is in the newsA milder winter will also mean damage to crops, especially wheat, a phenomenon that was observed in the last season.Global warming is one of the major reasons behind this phenomenon. However, the year also depends on year to year phenomenon, said S Pai, a Long Range Forecast scientist with the IMD.M Rajeevan, Secretary, the Ministry of Earth Sciences, also cited global warming as a major reason for a milder winter.IMD has said that 2016 has been one of the hottest years since 1901. Pai, however, said that several other local factors have impacted temperatures in northern India.Cyclone (Vardah) has brought a lot of moisture, especially in central India, which has impacted the temperature. Then there is a Western Disturbance (WD) that is expected from December 19. So, temperatures rise a bit before that. However, the WD is also likely to bring snow and rain in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh and not the complete northern belt, Pai said.Rajeevan said that although global warming is now becoming a worldwide phenomenon, factors like El Nino and La Nina also have effect on temperatures.Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in Indian Ocean is 0.5 to 0.6 degree higher and this also has effect on the winter. Although La Nina (a phenomenon associated with cooling of Pacific waters) is at its nascent stage, this also has had an impact on winter. A full blown La Nina would have meant a colder winter, Rajeevan said.El Nino, which is associated with heating of Pacific Ocean waters, was one of the reasons for a warm winter last year and hot summer this year. Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, said that winters have become late and less intense in the northern hemisphere.The prolong cooling goes on even after winter months. But lets hope that this does not bring rain in March and April, the way it happened in 2014 and there was a significant damage to crops. A warmer winter will affect crops like wheat, potatoes, mustard. These crops need cold temperatures, Singh said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

I think political life of India has to accept that right under our nose, people are changing as far as their habits are concerned,"" he said.Giving out details of digital outlets in the country, the Finance Minister said there are 14 lakh POS machines which are there at retail level and this figure has to be expanded manifold.These machines are not manufactured in India, they are imported, he added.""Additionally, with regard to banks' existing customers, debit cards and prepaid cards, e-wallets as well as mobile apps, are going to be utilised by them. They are ready with their infrastructure,"" he said.Noting that one startling figure that came out in the course of meeting today is that there are already 80 crore cards in circulation, of which 40 crore are being actively used by people, he said this is a change which is already happening and therefore this has to be used as a great opportunity to further catalyse this change.""One of the principle single agenda for the meeting was to expand digital banking itself...objective of this meeting was to appeal to the banking system and prepare them in mission mode for expediting this entire exercise,"" he said.Defending the demonetisation drive, the Finance Minister said one of the principal objectives of the reform that has been undertaken by the government is that physical currency must shrink.The economy, he added however, has to expand and the trade has to expand and therefore what shrinks has to be substituted and further expanded by the digital mode.In order to promote digital banking a task force is being set-up under Anil Kumar Khachi, Additional Secretary in Department of Financial Services, which is going to oversee this entire exercise, especially with regard to POS machines, Jaitley said.Observing that there has been expansion in debit cards, e-wallets and other modes of transactions in the last few years, he said there has also been a series of mobile apps that have come up which facilitate payment.""When we look at the figure we see that the change is already taking place and the present exercise gives us great opportunity to catalyse that change at a greater speed,"" he said.So, the Finance Ministry has emphasised to the banks that this is a great business opportunity for them because a lot more transactions are going to come into the banking system, he said, adding therefore, they have to take it up with their existing customers and others on a mission mode.In this direction, most banks have already begun a promotional exercise by waiving-up to end December MDR charges on debit cards, he said.Banks will now be focusing on significantly stepping-up transactions in mission mode through alternate banking channels such as NEFT, mobile wallets, pre-paid cards, QR (Quick Response) codes, pay-roll cards, debit and credit cards and Unified Payments Interface (UPI).Besides, Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has been asked to promote digital transaction through advertising campaign including demonstration videos on how to use cards and other modes for cash less transactions.During the video conferencing with heads of the banks, the Finance Minister exhorted lenders to restart normal lending activities and in particular Mudra loans as the rush at bank branches is now reducing.These would help meet restocking requirements of enterprises by way of working capital delivered through Mudra cards, he added.With regard to rural lending, Jaitley said, sowing season for Rabi and crops like potato is currently underway in many States.""Necessary resources for the purpose have been provided by NABARD and daily releases to DCCBs (District Co-operative Banks) are a focus area of monitoring,"" he said."

These advisories, which include information on temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, cloudiness and wind speed, are issued for a span of five days.Based on these parameters, the AgriMet field units issue specific crop-based advisories for the district, intended to help farmers plan their agricultural activities.However, the district-level forecast is not always sufficient to meet the requirements of individual farmers, given the wide variation in the above five parameters a single district can experience, said Chattopadhyay.For example, while areas like Maval and Mulshi may experience excess rainfall, Baramati and Shirur often have to face drought-like situation. Small and marginal land holders, who comprise about 80 per cent of the cultivators in the country, were the worst hit by the vagaries of nature.A recent study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has shown that proper advisories can increase production by 25 per cent, said the IMD official. Better access to satellite data as well as newer and improved forecasting models would now enable IMD to customise their advisories, said Chattopadhyay.In order to understand the specific needs of farmers, we intend to tie up with grass-root level organisations. These organisations will help us build bridges with the local community and help us receive feedback from farmers, he said.The advisories will not only include five climatic parameters, they would also include details on how to improve productivity by fighting diseases or pest attacks. Citing an example from West Bengal, Chattopadhyay said farmers from the state had asked for prior information to fight diseases and pests which tend to attack the potato crop.This project is part of a global initiative which would be funded by agencies like the UNDP, World Bank etc. While the accuracy of district-level forecasts seem to have increased in the last few years, a recent study by IMD scientists pointed to certain shortcomings. The model had failed to determine the temperature in hilly areas accurately and the accuracy of the prediction was lesser for northeastern regions.While the weather predictions were 60-80 per cent accurate for states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, they had varied between 40-50 per cent for Haryana. The study had shown that weather predictions for states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh required improvement in accuracy levels.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The committee's members are made up of delegates from special interest groups.Analysts say despite the gains by pro-democracy groups, the pro-Beijing majority ensures the battle will be between figures favourable to the mainland government, BBC reported.The main contenders for the post are Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang who is regarded as a more moderate alternative to the outgoing leader Leung Chun-ying, who was accused of focussing more on protecting Chinas interests fuelling discontent specially among the youth.Known as ""Uncle Pringles"" for a moustache similar to one worn by a character on a potato crisp brand's packaging, Tsang is a US-educated fencing and martial arts enthusiast who has been the finance minister since July 2007.The big wins by pan-democrats was seen as reflection of dissatisfaction with the current government, and the slow pace of democratic reforms.Lit Ming-wai, of Health Professionals For Democracy 30, said it was a big surprise for the pro-democracy group to win all 30 seats in the subsector.Only nine pan-democrats or allies won in the 2011 polls. ""It reflects that the Election Committee poll is more than just an election, but is a fight to safeguard our core values,"" she told Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.""If chief executive aspirants want to take our votes, they must incorporate our calls for democratic political reform in their manifesto,"" she said.Camille Lam Tsz-kwan, of the group CoVision16, said victory by pan-democrats in the architectural subsector reflected its strong support for democracy. ""The sector was not hotly contested before and the pro-establishment camp used to take the seats. But now we know there are actually a lot of pro-democracy voters in the field.""In 2014, tens of thousands of people demonstrated for weeks to demand a one-man, one-vote election for chief executive, but they failed to win any concessions from Beijing."

(AP Photos/Massoud Hossaini)Marzia and her husband Qadeer thought themselves lucky when they moved into a 1, 700-year-old Buddhist cave hand-carved into the side of a mountain in Afghanistans central highlands. It was clean and dry, warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and there was plenty of work on the local farms. But now, even this bare-bones way of life is threatened.The family, along with another 242 cave-dwelling households dotted around the capital of Bamiyan province, also called Bamiyan, could be forced to move soon.Watch What Else Is making NewsThey are whats left of around 10,000 families who have been relocated over the past decade as part of the local governments program to protect the unique man-made grottoes that it hopes will transform Bamiyan into a global tourist destination once Afghanistans war with the insurgent Taliban, now in its 16th year, is finally over.The couple moved here from neighbouring Maidan-Wardak province because they believed it was a stepping stone to a better future.We had no money and my husband couldnt get a job, Marzia said as she breastfed her baby. We left because we were poor.But 12 years later they are still living in the cave, along with their five children aged from 10 months to 8 years, including 6-year-old Freshta who hasnt been the same since a land mine exploded close by her four years ago. Her mental development stopped and she spends most of her time lolling on the thin mat that covers the caves floor.Any original features, such as the brightly-coloured geometric murals that were painted by the monks who created these caves, are long gone. Theyve been destroyed by time, the elements and the wear-and-tear of hundreds of years of habitation, including the fires that residents build for cooking and heat.The provincial government is working with UNESCO to restore the valleys eight significant sites, including the Ghulghulah fortress, believed to be Bamiyans original staging post on the old Silk Road that linked China to India. The fortress was razed by Genghis Khans hoards in the early 13th Century and never regained its glory.Life here is difficult, Marzia, 30, said. Water must be fetched from a nearby stream, and a 9-volt battery charges a solar panel that provides light after dark. Cooking is done on a stove fuelled by a gas bottle. They have installed a door and a step up into the one room that all seven members of the family share. Smaller caves outside are used for storage.On the rural outskirts of the city, amid the rutted fields where the provinces main potato crop is grown, the cave-dwellers do what they can with their meagre resources, determined that the next generation will have a better life.As Shiite Muslims of the Hazara minority they have suffered historic persecution, but they have also benefited from immense largesse from international charities and governments.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(source: AP) At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. (source: AP)Bangladesh is set to make a splash at the UN climate talks in Morocco when experts and officials present a proposal for a national body to deal with the losses and damage the low-lying South Asian nation expects to suffer from climate change. The body, if established, would be a first among developing countries vulnerable to worsening droughts, floods, storms and rising seas  all threats to development in Bangladesh, where about a third of people live beneath the poverty line.Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development  who chaired an expert group on developing a National Mechanism on Loss and Damage  said the proposal had been given to the Bangladeshi prime minister, who is due in Marrakesh early next week.Watch what else is making news:I am pleased to see that the government of Bangladesh is taking such a pro-active position at the national level on this important topic, Huq said.Loss and damage from climate change has been a controversial topic at the UN talks over the past decade, mainly because it asks a tough question: Who should pay to repair the harm done by planet-warming emissions? Aid agencies say loss and damage occurs when stresses made worse by climate change  such as creeping deserts or rising seas  are too severe for people to overcome. That can mean losing your home as shores and river banks crumble, no longer being able to farm a degraded plot of land, or even the disappearance of culture after communities are scattered by repeated weather disasters.Following push-back from industrialised countries worried about being forced to pay for the cost of climate damage, governments agreed in 2013 to create the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM).At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. But for that happen, they had to accept a stipulation that the loss and damage provision in the agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation  a demand from the United States backed by other rich nations.At the November 7-18 climate change talks in Marrakesh, negotiators are sparring over when and how to conduct a planned review of the WIM, which has had little more than a year to get going on its key tasks. They include setting up a clearing house for information on climate risk insurance and a task force on climate-linked displacement.HOT POTATOBut it is the financing of measures to address loss and damage that remains the key sticking point.Who should pay for it? The hot potato of responsibility is being moved around, said Olivia Serdeczny, a research analyst with Climate Analytics and an advisor to vulnerable countries on loss and damage. The sources of finance is an issue that remains untouched. Most of the discussions around finance for loss and damage have focused on providing insurance against disasters  a popular measure with rich nations.In June 2015, for example, G7 states announced an effort to increase by up to 400 million the number of people in low and middle-income countries with access to insurance coverage against climate-related hazards, by 2020. But aid experts argue insurance cannot be the only financial tool to help people faced with loss and damage.Harjeet Singh of the global charity ActionAid said insurance does not work well for longer-term shifts such as sea-level rise and melting glaciers. But there is a reluctance to move beyond insurance on the part of developed states in the UN loss and damage discussions, he noted.CARE International says the WIM should develop instruments that can generate $50 billion in new cash annually by 2020. Sven Harmeling, climate change advocacy coordinator for the development agency, said there was a growing awareness that other types of funding would be needed, beyond insurance.At this stage, no one denies there is a problem, he said. There is a bit of a progress in terms of willingness to discuss what process might work, but not in terms of We will pay for the damage.ADAPTATION LIMITSThat is a key reason for this weeks hiccup in Marrakesh over the review of the WIM, which was due to be completed at these talks. Developing countries want the review to happen over the next year and cover the future of the mechanism, while developed countries fear that could trigger new demands over finance. Either way, it is clear the thorny problem wont just disappear, and needs more work.In a recent paper, Austrian researchers Reinhard Mechler and Thomas Schinko at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis said major scientific challenges remain, in particular to better understand the physical and social limits of adaptation  in other words, where loss and damage starts. Making more accurate projections of rising climate risks and the associated costs of measures to prevent and respond to loss and damage could help move the discussion forward, they added.In the meantime, Bangladesh is not waiting around. A 2010 World Bank study estimated the country would lose some $121 billion, or 5 percent of national GDP, between 2005 and 2050 due to climatic variability, including impacts such as a fall in rice production. Singh said the proposal to set up a national mechanism for loss and damage was a way of trying to speed solutions.It is saying we need to make progress faster at the international level, and we are ready to act at the national level, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Even the Food Ministry is also procuring pulses under Price Stabalisation Fund.""On onions and potatoes, he said that the centre will start MIS operation after the state governments send the proposal for the same. ""I have not received any proposal so far in case of onions and potatoes.""Asked for his views on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's demand to give bonus on rabi crops and farm loan waiver, the Minister took a dig at him saying that Gandhi is taking out his frustration for ""not being promoted as the party President"".He said farmers have faced some discomfort due to demonetisation but it has not impacted the ongoing sowing of rabi (winter) crops like wheat. ""In fact, rabi sown area till yesterday was higher than the year-ago period,"" he added.The Agriculture Ministry is aiming a record 270 million tonnes of foodgrains in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June), as against 252.22 million tonnes in the last year."
590a2e4c7be9e033b96eb8db,Painting a rosy picture,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/582350/painting-rosy-picture.html,2016-11-21,,Deccan Herald,"S Narendra Nov 22, 2016, 0:04 ISTThe economic growth indicators were seemingly favourable and the NDA government was in a celebratory mood until the demonetisation was initiated. The consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the comfort zone of 5%, considerable easing of food inflation, favourable monsoon of above 97% in most parts of the country (though 139 taluks in 26 districts of Karnataka were declared drought-hit on account of 78% deficient rainfall), robust core sector growth in eight key sectors at 5%, and a 22-month high in Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index at 54.4 (surpassing the 50 mark depicts growth and below 50, a contraction) and a surge in Services PMI to 54.5 in October depicts a rise in new orders.The Current Account Deficit (CAD) as low as 0.1% of GDP, adequate forex reserves at $370 billion, a slew of policy initiatives like the launch of Real Estate Regulation Act, scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A), passing of the GST bill, e-mandis, have all resulted in showcasing India as a bright spot in the global landscape.Responding to the positive signals, the RBI reduced the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.25% to prod banks to lend aggressively to industries and agriculture. However, the exuberance will be short-lived on misplaced half-truths and can betray us with the deepest of consequences in achieving our long term goal of real dev-elopment of wiping tears from every eye.The need of the hour is to understand, assess and undertake quick surgical attacks on the critical issues plaguing our economy. The negatives and discomfitures are many. Fiscal deficit in September 2016 touched Rs 4.47 lakh crore which is 84% of the budget estimate of Rs 5.33 lakh crore for 2016-17. This can lead to couple effect of double deficit, with the CAD of $300 million tagged on to fiscal deficit, which can have adverse effects on the economy.We have also missed the target of $4 billion surplus CAD on account of low exports and gains from temporary windfall of low international crude oil (expected to rebound early next year) and commodity prices  hence, this is not a durable indicator of sustained growth.It is shocking that the agriculture sector, which is the backbone of our economy, has been left in the lurch. Sixty crore of our population is dependent on agriculture, contributing 16% to our GDP. The government, however, seems to have allocated this critical portfolio to the vagaries of monsoon and to the act of god!Very little is being done to resolve the critical issues plaguing this sector viz, creation of gainful employment, timely supply of high quality seeds, fertilisers, fixation of minimum support prices on scientific lines, provision of low interest credit from banks for longer tenure, timely bank transfer of subsidies to the farmers, calibrated mechanisation to improve productivity (not machine displacing men), establishment of warehouses, cold storages, elimination of middlemen, uninterrupted power supply (not for gratis), proper healthcare, education to children, affordable housing, skill development and 100% waiver of loan liability of farmers who are victims of consecutive droughts.To add to the misery, slashing of import duties on wheat, potatoes, palm oil, ranging from 10-15%, will have serious economic and social ramifications. The rural distress, heavy indebtedness, poverty and mass suicides validate the time-tested idiom  an Indian farmer is born in debt, lives in debt and dies in debt.The elephant in the room is the NPAs of more than Rs 9 lakh crore. Even the acquired stressed assets under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act are not being disposed of on account of higher auction reserve prices, lack of bidders and doctored property valuations. Even scary are the defaults in the 60-90 days due, most of which are door dressing, which can explode with the bursting of the real estate bubble, expected any time.Many schemes launched to address to this chronic disease of stressed assets  corporate debt restructure, strategic debt restructuring, S4A  are not yielding the desired results. It is all the more unfortunate that the critical sectors which require huge funding-power, infrastructure, roads and highways, mining, metals and real estate, have the highest NPAs.Debt trapWith banks developing cold feet, these sectors are now being catered to by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Private Equity funds (PEs) at exorbitant interest rates, severely affecting their profitability and capacity utilisation, with many getting into the vicious cycle of debt trap.The credit offtake by banks to industries and SMSEs is less than 10%  a historic low. This is preventing the kickstart of the investment cycle and shying away of private investment, leading to low capacity utilisation both in agriculture and industries. So then, what is the growth that we are drumming up and for whom?The noise of certain rosy numbers of make believe is restricted to the urban consumer demand which is temporary and seasonal  the trigger being series of festivals and the windfall effect of the 7th Pay Commission. The GDP increase is driven by urban consumerism/services sector and not on account of real, durable, industrial and agricultural growth. Even the railways, which is the engine of growth, was short of earnings to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore during April-September 2016.We rank as low as 130 amongst 190 countries under the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) as per the World Bank survey coupled with a rock-bottom ranking at 97 out of 118 countries under the Hunger Index. Demographic dividend cannot be achieved on an empty stomach. Real development is not possible with unequal distribution of income and wealth concentrated with the microscopic minority of the rich and the affluent vis--vis macroscopic majority of the poor, who are leading lives of squalor and abject poverty.Rhetoric at high decibels and launch of a plethora of policies without the political will of implementation will be activity mistaken for achievement, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.(The writer is a Bengaluru-based banker)"
590a2e5f7be9e033b96eb8e9,Concerns and challenges,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/583127/concerns-challenges.html,2016-11-25,,Deccan Herald,"Commander (rtd) Chaitanya Chandel and Bidanda Chengappa Nov 26, 2016, 0:09 ISTAfter the 26/11 strike, though Navy is designated as nodal coastal security agency, it is not operationally oriented to take up this task.Today, coastal security remains as vulnerable to sea-borne threats as when Ajmal Kasab and his cohorts landed ashore and threatened Mumbai eight years ago on November 26, 2008.While the Indian Navy (IN), the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and the state police forces handle operations at sea, a multiplicity of agencies like the Department of Fisheries, mercantile marine departments of the coastal states, Director General Lighthouses, Ministry of Shipping and the Department of Ports among a host of others are stakeholders. Therefore, coastal security is a shared responsibility not limited solely to the IN, ICG and state police.Coastal security straddles both the military and police roles and therefore needs a force that can operate both like the navy as well as the police. Globally, the coast guard is the force of choice that carries out this role being inferior to the navy in war-fighting capabilities but superior to the police in training and firepower, besides airborne and marine platforms.However, today, both the ICG and IN lack the legal powers to arrest and hold boats and personnel at sea. Operationally, the powers to file a First Information Report (FIR) from the sea, as well as to seize and detain personnel and boats are essential to fulfil the police function of this role. There is also a need to streamline the process to hand over the FIR, personnel, boats and contraband/ material from the IN or CG to the police for further action under the Indian Criminal Procedure Code.After the 26/11 sea-borne terrorist strike, though the IN is designated as the nodal coastal security agency, it is not operationally oriented to take up this task. The IN is primarily oriented and equipped for a war-fighting role. Its professional expertise is to sail the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles and engage hostile vessels either during war or peace. On the other hand, coastal security also requires intensive patrolling from the coastline to 12 nautical miles where the waters are dense with smaller craft which sail in this marine space.It is estimated that around 2.5 lakh small boats and vessels ply these waters for fishing and transport. The state police forces are supposed to patrol these coastal waters to pre-empt illegal activities as well as the movement of terrorists.Unfortunately, the state police is a land-oriented force and unable to cope with the marine environment. The police are dependent on the IN and ICG who have adequate exposure at sea and the capability to cope with eventualities there. The ICG has a charter to concentrate on the sea between 12 to 200 nautical miles and therefore cannot constantly check the large volume of smaller boats that ply between the coastline and 12 nautical miles that have the potential to transport terrorists or contraband.To manage coastal security operations across peninsular India, it is necessary to establish state-level operations rooms with cross-functional teams from all agencies involved which will prove a force multiplier for the ICG. There is also a ne-ed to supplement the existing infrastructure for logistics, technical support and training as well as optimise the use of existing boats and assets. Experience with the IN and ICG can be used to improve procurement of equipment with an indi-genous focus which can be supported in the country. This will help alleviate problems with equipment maintenance and spares those coastal police forces face.It seems logical that boat movement into and out of Indian waters needs to be regulated to ensure coastal security. However, no progress has been made towards tracking fishing boats. This remains a contentious issue and a political hot potato since large fishing fleet owners contribute to party election funds.In itself, this single lacuna nullifies pro-gress made on every other front. It needs to be understood that every fishing boat that is tracked becomes part of the coast-al security system. Every boat logged into the system amounts to a pair of eyes and ears at sea. Conversely, every boat not in the system remains a potential threat.Information sharingThe problems of information sharing and maritime domain awareness can be solved with technologies like Geographic Information Systems and knowledge management systems which would help share operations plots and specialised knowledge currently with each agency.They would also provide common platforms to bring together operational and support agencies, besides creating synergy, to enable free flow of information and enhance transparency. Today, much more needs to be done in the areas of information and plot sharing among various agencies which continue to remain isolated from each other.The technology and capability to do so is available within the country and must be used as far as possible to avoid reliance on foreign vendors. New breakthroughs in technology make fishing boat tracking and communications at the national scale an exciting field. While costs remain a concern, making this field a focus area for startups through provision of tax breaks should help to produce breakthroughs.Over the last eight years, there has been considerable progress on coastal security over intelligence sharing and inter-agency communication at the national level. Today, coastal security remains New Delhi-centric where the cabinet secretary annually chairs a few meetings of the National Committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security.However, the nine coastal state governments and four Union Territories relate to coastal security with varying degrees of seriousness. This is evident from the reports of the audits of Comptroller and Auditor General that highlight unspent budgets. Moreover, the state of boats, equipment and police organisational structure does not inspire confidence that security cannot be breached along the countrys 7,516-km coastline.(Chandel is involved with technology development for coastal security and Chengappa is a Professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies, Christ University, Bengaluru)"
590a30a77be9e033b96ebace,Halting desertification,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581090/halting-desertification.html,2016-11-14,,Deccan Herald,"Sriroop Chaudhuri and Mimi Roy, Nov 15, 2016 23:16 ISTFOOD, CLIMATE, MIGRATION : About 96.4 million hectares land area (29.3% of total landmass) of India is currently under land degradation/desertificatioIn the last couple of decades, land degr-adation/desertification has grown into an appalling menace to sustainable human development, affecting billions around the world including India, leaving the authorities reeling over dire resource depletion/inadequacy. A major reason for it has been a lack of consensus over a precise definition of desertification.As per the United Nations Convention for Combating Desertification (UNCCD), desertification is virtually any form of land degradation in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, resulting from a combination of climatic variations and unplanned human expansion. Desertification, by newer definitions, is no more just about sand dunes and oasis. Today it means the collective damage caused to the worlds dryland ecosystems.In India, combating land degradation/ desertification has emerged as a top environmental priority to the authorities concerned. India is signatory to the UNCCD and intends to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030. On June 17, 2016, on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), and Arid Zone Forest Research Institute (AFRI), jointly released desertification maps of the country. These maps, compiled by the Space Application Centre, Isro along with 19 partner instit-utes, for the 2003-05 and 2011-13 periods, have brought up some disturbing facts.It appears that about 96.4 million hectares (Mha) land area (29.3% of total landmass) of the country is currently under land degradation/desertification, as compared to about 94.5 Mha (28.7%) during 2003-05. By far, Rajasthan appears to be the hot-seat of degradation/ desertification in the country followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Cumulatively, these nine states account for about 23% of the total land area under degradation/desertification in India.But what bakes the cake really is the state-wise land area under degradation/ desertification. In Jharkhand (68.9%), Rajasthan (62.9%), Delhi (60.6%), Gujarat (52.2%) and Goa (52.1%), over half the land area is under intense threat of land degradation/desertification. To add further to the aggravation, in each on these states/UTs, land degradation/desertification has increased between 2003-05 and 2011-13 period with the worst scenario apparent in Delhi, registering about 11% increase.Desertification/degradation is on steep gradients in the Northeast as well. In Tri-pura, land degradation/desertification increased by about 10.4% between 2003-05 and 2011-13, in Nagaland by 8.7% and Mizoram 4.3%. Overall, in 25 states/UTs, desertification appears to be on the rise.But why the heck we care for desertification of the drylands? Here is what the drylands do: they constitute about 34% of worlds total landmass and are major source of food, especially for the poor. One in three crops cultivated today, including oats, barley, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage and saffron, originated from drylands. About half the worlds livestock is concentrated in the drylands.Recent UNCCD reports suggest that about 52% of worlds agricultural land area is moderate to severely degraded. About 12 Mha of productive land are turning barren annually resulting from desertification/drought, toppling cha-nces of about 20 mt of food grains which acutely exacerbates global food crises.As added vice, desertified areas are noted for their long-range adversities on climate. For example, reduction in vegetation (frequently associated with desertification) cover elevates atmospheric aerosol/dust levels which affect cloud formation and rainfall patterns, carbon cycle, and biodiversity.Visibility crises in Beijing, a well-known menace these days, is believed to have been caused by springtime dust storms originating in the Gobi Desert. Yellow Dust from China costs the Korean and Japanese economy a huge revenue each year. It is also taken for US air quality deterioration in recent times. In China itself, desertification, leading to recurrent droughts and massive crop-losses, takes a nice bite of the countrys annual GDP. Studies find that desertification can hugely magnify global warming in days ahead.But putting aside the tangible issues regarding food/water shortage, and climate, there are others that do not meet naked eye. One such is forced migration. Desertification is destabilising large communities globally, turning them into migrants and homeless refugees.Environmental migrationAn estimated mob of 60 million will migrate from desertified areas in sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and/or Europe by 2020. By 2050, about 200 million people will turn up as perman-ently displaced environmental migrants. Governmental reports suggest that such displaced mob and forced migrants often take to radicalisation and extremism, inciting brutal resource-driven conflicts.Environmental migration is largely triggering political instability, terrorist disturbances, and food/water riots across desertified areas, ultimately spilling over to neighbouring lands. So what can we do to halt desertification? Or shall we do anything at all? Monitoring for causes of desertification should be central any action plan. Aberrant climatic shifts is of course the major impaling factor.But other than climate, unleashed human expansion contributes a great deal to desertification:a) Land cover change (due to urban sprawl): deforestation/logging beyond permissible limits; forest fires/encroachment into forest lands; conversion of native croplandsb) Land management protocol: inadequate soil conservation measures (soil erosion); improper crop rotation /shift in cultivation patterns; improper irrigation schemes (water-logging/leaching); indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals (soil salinisation)c) Overexploitation of natural resources (overpopulation/demand): overgrazing; unplanned groundwater extraction; inequitable sharingd) Lack of resources (tools/funds/ trained professionals) to: support innovative dryland agriculture; reclaim water-logged and/or saline soilsThese days, climate change also is a ramified effect of human expansion (urbanisation/carbon emission/freshwater abstraction) only. A disturbing fact about desertification is, it is largely irreversible. So, may be its time we seriously gave in to the UNs recent plea stop deserting the deserts. Other than building up holistic awareness among the common people, a major push should be to establish transnational partnerships to monitor, assess, re-assess and implement stringent actions plans.(The writers are assistant professors and assistant directors, Centre for Environment, O P Jindal Global University, Sonipat, Haryana)"

The company has recently launched TeaPacs, individually packaged tea bags sealed at the source using a natural nitrogen flush that keeps tea fresh.Speaking to DH, Kaushal Dugar, founder and CEO of Teabox said, TeaPacs offers the highest quality loose-leaf teas from Teaboxs premium collection in a more convenient, on-the-go option, without compromising on flavour or freshness. We want to ensure that every cup of tea consumed is the freshest in the world, but we know that not everyone has time to steep loose leaf. So, we have created TeaPacs that anyone can enjoy anywhere and anytime.Dugar pointed out that Teabox is the worlds first company to use a natural nitrogen flush in the beverage market, a technique most commonly used in packaging food items, including potato chips.This innovative approach creates a non-reactive environment that protects the TeaPac tea from oxygen, light, heat and moisture  elements that compromise the integrity of tea, causing deterioration and ultimately, loss of flavour.Sharing the growth of the company, Dugar said, We are seeing multi-fold growth year-on-year. Since the time we started in 2012, Teabox has shipped over 35 million cups worth of teas to customers across 95 countries in a short span of time. We will be shipping to another three countries in the coming period, and will cross the 100-mark before the end of this year.In 2014-15, the company has shipped five million cups of tea. In 2015-16, the number of cups have increased to seven million. During the current fiscal, it has shipped about 14 million cups of tea.The company has raised $7.5 million in funding from Ratan Tata, who invested an undisclosed amount this year.

In October this year, it was 3.39 per cent.Prices of pulses however continued to rule high in the wholesale market at 21.73 per cent last month, as per the Commerce Ministry data.Potatoes recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.Industry chamber Assocham said the fall in WPI is in tandem with the expectation which is reflective of the depressive state in the economy owing to the demonetisation.""Boost to industry is required from both monetary and fiscal policy, i.e. lowering of interest rates by RBI and reduction in tax rates by government in the coming budget to counter the effects of overall slowdown in economy,"" it said.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said however that rising global commodity prices and a waning of the base effect would push up WPI in December."

Be it buying groceries or objects of desire, there is a unique pleasure in visiting shops. For women, shopping gives them relief from the mental tension associated with daily chores. But I beg to differ.Though I often accompany my other half to the supermarket and jewellery shop, I feel out of place once I step in to the shops. At the supermarket, my job is to stand behind her and push the shopping cart while she leisurely picks up packets of foreign cheese and honey marketed by Patanjali.Though we returned from another country a few years ago after spending nearly quarter of a century there, the shopping pattern has not changed much. Extra virgin olive oil made in Spain, Anchor cheese and American apples! If my better half wants to spend more than five minutes in selecting an item, I happily tell her, Take your own time. Give me a missed call when you finish selecting your objects of desire.This is the time for me to roam around the supermarket. I go to the vegetable section and read the price of a kilogramme of potato and onion only to forget it within minutes. After that I go to the organic food section. Till date I have not found more than two customers buying from this counter. Then, I take a glass of payasam offered free of cost by the young girl who is there to promote the item.I say hello to the girl standing outside the perfume shop with a bottle of a new scent that she is desperately trying to sell. After spending more than 30 minutes at various sections in the supermarket without buying anything, I usually get the missed call from my wife. She would be near the cash counter with her shopping cart fully loaded. I once again check my wallet to confirm that there is enough cash.I pay the money to the cashier and push the cart all the way to the car. Accompanying my life partner to the jewellery shop is not pleasant either. When I enter the shop I feel trapped. When you go to a barber shop, there are magazines to read while you wait for your turn. If it is a dental clinic, there are old issues of popular magazines and other promotional materials from pharmaceutical companies.But in jewellery shops, I have never found any reading material for the customers. My problem: How to spend time while my partner shops for a gold chain? When I try to go for a coffee at a nearby shop, she tells: Wait, only ten minutes more. I still accompany my wife for shopping and pay all the bills as I have for many years. Life is like that."

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"

Business at the market has seen a slump. (Express Photo: Amit Mehra) Hundreds of workers have been flocking to Azadpur mandi. Business at the market has seen a slump. (Express Photo: Amit Mehra)Post demonetisation, the slump in businesses across the capital has not just reduced the demand for workers but has also increased supply of cheap labour. This, in turn, has caused wages to plummet.Shabeer, a 57-year-old permanent worker in a steel untensil manufacturing unit in northwest Delhis Wazirpur, was told that November 10 would be his last working day. After paying their salaries in banned currency notes, the owner of the unit sacked 70 workers, including Shabeer, because orders for utensils had come to an absolute halt.Like Shabeer, thousands of workers have been fired or sent on forced leave in Wazirpur industrial area  which houses roughly 1,000 utensil and steel manufacturing units and employs roughly 70,000 workers. While most workers have been making their way back home to villages in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, many decided to stay back in the capital.Watch what else is making news:I decided to look for alternate work. Azadpur mandi usually has work for loaders and off-loaders. If I go back home, I would only burden my family so I decided to give it another shot in the city, he said.When Shabeer went to Azadpur mandi in mid-November looking for work, a few shopkeepers and contractors agreed to hire him. However, while the going rate for off-loading a 10 kg sack of onions was over Rs 20, Shabeer was being offered Rs 13 instead. I agreed because it was better than nothing. I would make Rs 200 a day, he said.Jitender Kumar, another worker at the mandi, said he made on Rs 100 on Sunday. He spend Rs 50 on lunch and saved the rest for dinner. Hundreds like Shabeer and Karan have been flocking to the mandi for work, but business at the market too has seen a slump.Rajender Sharma, president of the Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Traders Associations, said, Not only have prices of vegetables fallen, sales have fallen by 20-30 per cent, most customers are buying on credit. Around 80 per cent of my sales last month has been on credit.Sharma, who sells onions and potatoes at the mandi, said labourers are paid as per a fixed fare chart decided by the government. Other shopkeepers admitted that because business was down, ancillary work has been affected.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Reacting to inflation figures, apex industry body Assocham said the rise in WPI is in line with the industrys expectation as production denoted by index of industrial production (IIP) numbers released recently showed weak and unstable demand within the industry itself.This might have forced the industry to control and manage its over production and over capacity, which is already in existence, through restricting supply or put a cap on production that have resulted in an increase in WPI number. Inflation in manufactured products was 1.17%.Meanwhile, HSBC has said that retail inflation is likely to cross the 6% level over the next two months but will axease thereafter as food prices abate and the base effect normalises."

They come originally from Bihar.Biharis absolutely love litti chokha, as  in truth  do most people who taste it. Put it like this, the first time I went to the Bihars capital, Patna, I had people in my office begging me to bring some back. I said Id do my best, but warned I was unlikely to be allowed any food through airport security checks.Nevertheless, I arrived for the return flight with two big bags full of the stuff. The security officers at Patna airport sniffed suspiciously, but, when I told them what and why, they broke into smiles and waved me right on through.Clearly, they judged it was more important to get a consignment of the states most celebrated street food to hungry fans than enforce a few petty restrictions and regulations.Litti are pastry balls, packed full of a spicy mash made with sattu  roasted chickpea flour. They are roasted in beds of charcoal  or, sadly a rarity these days, dried cow dung  and then dipped in salty melted ghee, clarified butter. A couple of these will be served with a decent dollop of chokha, as well as some yoghurt sauce and a scoop of hot, sour pickle. Yes, I thought that would get your mouth watering.You find litti wherever Biharis go, and since Biharis go almost everywhere in India, that means youve got a chance of tasting this delicious snack almost anywhere in the country. Youve got to keep your eyes peeled, though.Look out for the tell-tale pall of smoke from the charcoal and the queue of wiry, tough-looking men. Wiry men, because one of the few things Bihar is famous for in India  apart from litti  is migration.Historic cityThe state capital was once the greatest centre of learning and culture on the sub-continent. When the Greek ambassador Megasthenes visited in 302 BC  yes, it was a while back  he was stunned by Pataliputra, as Patna was then known. The city stretched for nearly 10 miles along the banks of the Ganges.It had, Megasthenes reported, 64 gates and 570 towers, not to mention gardens, palaces, temples and stables full of war elephants. I have seen the great cities of the east, he wrote, I have seen the Persian palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, but this is the greatest city in the world. No visitor would say that of Patna today.Buddha achieved enlightenment in Bihar, the state was home to worlds first residential university and was the powerbase from which Ashoka built the first pan-Indian empire, famous for its tolerance and pluralism. But sadly the capital has not  how shall I put this?  retained the elegance of the ancient city.Poverty-stricken stateTruth be told, modern Patna is a great sprawling, poverty-stricken megatropolis. Which should be no surprise because Bihar has a population of over 100 million people, larger than any western European country, and is one of the poorest states in India. It recorded an average per capita income of just $682 in 2015, less than half of the $1,627 average income nationally.Last year, I managed to get hold of a copy of a vast health survey carried out by the government with the UN agency for children, Unicef. The report had been due for publication in October 2014 but the government had decided to keep it secret.Flip through page after page of statistics and you can see why. Youll also discover why so many Biharis have decided to go in search of work elsewhere. The report shows that in 2013-14 half of children under the age of five in Bihar were stunted, a third were underweight and three quarters of households practised open defecation.Now comes the good news. A few years ago a new technocratic state government made tackling graft and promoting economic growth its priority, and Bihar  which had become a byword for caste division, crime and corruption  started scoring double-digit growth.Thats good news for the people of Bihar, but not for lovers of litti, like me. Because heres the rub: as a result, migration from the state has fallen dramatically.The fear is that the litti chokha stalls dotted across India that ensure that Bihari migrants still get a taste of the best of home will pack up shop and go home too. Then this wonderful street food snack will be even harder to find."

Industry demanded a cut in policy interest rates by the RBI in its upcoming policy next month, as the demand for manufactured goods was slowing.While the inflation is within the target level of the government and RBI, the focus of the policymakers should now shift to revive GDP and industrial growth, especially the poor performance of manufacturing sector, consumer non-durable goods and capital goods as seen in the recent IIP numbers needs to be looked into immediately, said Sunil Kanoria, president, Assocham.The retail prices continue to benign in the coming months, due to the effect of unseasonal rainfall on the coming rabi season, resulting from western disturbances. But the RBI needs to look at generalised deflationary pressures that the CPI may not adequately capture, he said.Although the Reserve Bank of India has been following the rising consumer prices index to decide the pace at which it cuts interest rates, a sustained fall in wholesale prices may be hard to ignore."

She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta) Parveen Khatoon, 12, along with her niece Noor, 7, begs for alms in trains in the Sealdah line everyday. She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)Parveen Khatoon has the power of invisibility.Inside the 1.30 pm Krishnanagar local from Sealdah, in a train full of dozing college students, domestic helps and suburban housewives out on shopping trips, no one has time for a 12-year-old gaunt girl begging for alms. Her pink panda t-shirt, her tight braid, her flower-printed harem pants, everything blends with the background. All that remains is a voice. Loud, high-pitched and melancholic: Garibon ki suno, woh tumhari sunega, tum ek paisa doge, woh dus lakh dega (If you listen to the pleas of the poor, God will listen to your prayers, you give us one paisa, He will give you 10 lakh rupees). The begging anthem of the country is Parveens fallback song. People look up, coins change hands. It always works, says Parveen, adjusting a sound box around her neck. The box is her only paraphernalia, a radio-like contraption with a speaker. It has about 30 songs in it. I play it for added effect while I sing, says Parveen.Last week, a 13-year-old girl fell off a Dhanbad-Jhargram passenger train in Jamshedpur district, sustaining injuries on her face and hand. While some reports said the girl, who begged for alms by singing in trains, had been thrown off by men who were teasing her, others said she fell while trying to get off the moving train.That girl could have been Parveen. But she dismisses any hint of concern by flexing her non-existent, little-girl muscles. Nothing like this would ever happen to me. I am strong, she says.Her mother, Neelam Begum, 37, however, fears the worst. Everyday, I am worried that I might hear bad news  that she has fallen off a train or that someone did something bad to her. But what can I do? I cant accompany her since I have to go out for work, she says.She is also afraid of Parveen falling into bad company. A lot of these children get into the habit of sniffing Dendrite (an adhesive), says Neelam, who works as a domestic help and earns about Rs 3,000 a month.The family of six  Neelam, her four daughters and a granddaughter  lives in Moulali, a slum in central Kolkata. Her husband deserted them years ago, says Neelam.Platform No. 4 of Dum Dum station is Parveens base for the day. Dum Dum is an arterial station in the citys rail network, connecting Kolkatas suburban trains with its underground rail network.Sprawled on the floor at one end of the platform are Parveens aunt Khaleda, 35, sister Shama, 14, and niece Noor, 7. They are eating their lunch  rice and potato curry  straight out of a tiffin carrier.I wake up at 5.30 in the morning and help my sister cook lunch before I leave for school at 6.30, says Parveen. Her school is a special one run by the Missionaries of Charity at Joragirja, a five-minute walk from her house. We have classes till 10.30, after which I run home to collect my music box and then head to Sealdah station, says Parveen. Her sister, niece and aunt join her soon after.There are about 20 beggar-singers at Dum Dum station alone, says Khaleda, Parveens aunt. They start their day at about noon. We usually dont board trains during the peak office-hour rush. No one has time for beggars then, says Parveen.Its 3 pm now and Dum Dum station wears a deserted look. Parveen is waiting for the 15.05 Habra-Sealdah train. This time, little Noor, all of seven, will accompany her. I started this business when I was seven too. There are six people at home and we all contribute, says Parveen, clutching Noors hand tightly as she starts moving towards the approaching train. During this time of the day, there are mainly college students. They like romantic numbers, she adds, pointing to a young couple engaged in an animated conversation at one end of the train.Parveen announces her presence by breaking into the 1992 Nadeem-Shravan melody from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor: Milne ki tum koshish karna, waada kabhi na karna (Make an effort to meet me, but never make a promise). The young woman looks up and blushes. The man hands Noor a Rs 10 note. Mission accomplished.On good days, we make about Rs 150, on normal days, Rs 100, says Parveen, counting her coins at Sealdah station. Its 3.30 pm and even the ever-buzzing Sealdah station is relatively quiet.Parveen has about 100 songs in her repertoire, from Hindi film classics to Bengali devotional songs. Most of the Bollywood hits are from the 1950s-60s and Nadeem- Shravan melodies from the 1990s.I love the song Tu meri zindagi hai from Aashiqui and also songs from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor, says Parveen. She strategically keeps patriotic numbers such as Ae mere watan ke logon for special occasions such as Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti and Netajis birthday. We also sing patriotic songs when there is an important cricket match, smiles Parveen.At the station, Parveen points to a group of teenagers engaged in an animated discussion. They are Sealdah beggars, we try not to encroach into their territory. We have one route, they have another. But things do get ugly at times, she says, pointing to a scar on her arm.Parveen takes the Sealdah-Dum Dum route about eight times a day. The journey of about 20 minutes each way never really wears her off, she says. What does tire her is the regular harassment by the hawkers association and the occasional threats of the Railway Protection Force.Ticket-checkers never bother us. Even the police just come and shoo us away a few times a year, but hawkers shower us with abuses ever time we walk past them. They say we shouldnt be begging here, that we are creating a nuisance, that we will be run over by a train someday, says Parveen.Sukumar Das, working president of the Dum Dum Station Hawkers Union, says, These children have no idea of the danger they are in. They rush from one platform to the other. They run on tracks. They get into crowded trains. An accident is waiting to happen. They are chased away by the RPF every few months, but they return after a few days, says Das.What else are we supposed to do? asks Parveen as she walks up to another Dum Dum-bound train  for the third time in the day.Its 6 pm and Dum Dum station is abuzz with office crowd. They are the stingiest. Even if they ever give you something, its not more than a rupee, says Parveen.Little Noor and Parveen are about to make the last trip of the day. Back home, there is dinner to be made, tuitions to be attended, homework to be finished and and episode of Sath Nibahana Sathiya to be caught. The 18.07 Bongaon local enters the platform. A surge of humanity rushes towards the train. Parveen grabs Noors hand and disappears into the crowd.Parveen Khatoon is invisible.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

591f42577be9e025a5d4c6eb,A 'hamlet of stars' in Antarctica's biting cold,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/523632/a-hamlet-stars-antarcticas-biting.html,2016-01-17,,Deccan Herald,"Simon Romero, January 18, 2016, International New York Times 0:00 ISTVilla Las Estrellas is a coveted hub for flying into a continent in flux as nations bolster scientific researchChildren at the schoolhouse in Villa Las Estrellas, Antarctica, study under a portrait of Bernardo OHiggins, Chiles independence leader. The bank manager welcomes deposits in Chilean pesos.The cellphone service from the Chilean phone company Entel is so robust that downloading iPhone apps works like a charm.The inhabitants here say it could be any Chilean village. Except that Villa Las Estrellas is in Antarctica.Fewer than 200 people live in this outpost founded in 1984 during the dictatorship of Gen Augusto Pinochet, when Chile was seeking to bolster its territorial claims in Antarctica.Since then, the tiny hamlet has been at the centre of one of Antarcticas most remarkable experiments: exposing entire families to isolation and extreme conditions in an attempt to arrive at a semblance of normal life at the bottom of the planet.It gets a little intense here in winter, said Jos Luis Carilln, 40, who moved to Villa Las Estrellas three years ago with his wife and their two children to take a job as a teacher in the public school. He described challenges like trekking through punishing wind storms to arrive at a schoolhouse concealed by snow drifts, and withstanding long stretches with only a few hours of sunlight each day. But this place is unique, Carilln said. Only a few people on Earth step foot in Antarctica, and fewer still live here for long periods of time.The United States, China, Russia and most other nations with research stations in Antarctica tend to frown on bringing anyone but researchers and support teams to the planets coldest and windiest continent. But Chile and a neighbour in South America, Argentina, have taken a rare route to putting down stakes here, nurturing small Antarctic settlements that include families with children.Argentina founded its Antarctic outpost even earlier, in 1953. The settlement, on Graham Land at the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula, is called the Esperanza Base. It also has a school, a cemetery and even a scout troop claiming to be the southernmost in the world. Esperanza Bases motto sums up what it is like for some who have moved to Antarctica: Permanence, an act of sacrifice.Villa Las Estrellas, in the South Shetland Islands off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, has emerged as a coveted hub for flying into a continent in flux as various nations bolster their scientific research.The Chilean air force transports researchers from various countries on C-130 Hercules military planes that make the three-hour trip to Punta Arenas, a city of nearly 125,000 near the southern tip of Chile, several times a month. A sign at the air base near Villa Las Estrellas poi-nts out that the city of Iquique in northern Chile is only 4,675 kilometers (2,905 miles) away.Most of the students at the villages small school, who generally number less than a dozen, are the children of air force officials who operate the base; some of the parents say the isolating experience strengthens family bonds.That Villa Las Estrellas is so remote  its name can be translated as Hamlet of the Stars, since the lack of artificial light pollution here enhances gazing into the heavens  sits just fine with many who live here.People in the rest of Chile are so afraid of thieves that they build walls around their homes, said Paul Robledo, 40, an electrician from Iquique (pronounced E-key-kay). Not here in Antarctica. This is one of the safest places in the world.What Villa Las Estrellas gains as a sanctuary from crime, though, it loses in some other comforts. Animals like Adlie penguins and elephant seals can be glimpsed around the village, but those used to the companionship of dogs are out of luck. All dogs were banned because they might introduce canine diseases to Antarctic wildlife.Air force families live in small homes here, while researchers stay at the spartan lodging operated by the Chilean Antarctic Institute, sleeping in bunk beds not unlike those found on an aircraft carrier. A Ping-Pong table in the living room offers some diversion. They take their meals together in a cramped canteen.Recently, the menu for lunch was a dish containing mashed potatoes, chicken and ground beef, washed down with Fanta orange soda. For dinner that day: ditto, though the Fanta was replaced by Coca-Cola.After one Chilean scientist suggested that a nutritionist might be needed here, Enrique Nicoman, 59, the cook at Villa Las Estrellas, made it clear that such comments were not welcome. Its not like theres a market nearby with fresh vegetables, said Nicoman, who worked for years as a cook in the Chilean navy before moving here. I mean, were in Antarctica, where everything needs to arrive by plane or sea vessel.Using ones imagination is essential for making the most out of living in a place with a lot of downtime indoors. In his book, Antarctic Impressions, Russian volcanologist Vladimir Kiryanov described how some at Russias research bases playfully carved out their own territorial claims, inventing the Dukedom of Pinsk, the Principality of the Treasure Hunter Yury Kharchuk and the sovereign state of Immortia.A gym allows the Chileans at Villa Las Estrellas to play an occasional game of indoor soccer against visiting researchers from Russian and Chinese bases. A small chapel perched above the settlement offers a quiet place to pray.Hermits syndromeSome say that those who adapt to stretches of relative seclusion in Antarctica can find it hard to re-adapt when they return to mainland Chile. They call this dilemma hermits syndrome, describing the shock of socialising with family and friends after long periods in Antarctica.Technology is supposed to ease communication. Some rely on Skype to talk to loved ones back home; others simply use their mobiles. But new technologies can also reinforce how far Antarctica remains from the rest of the world.The dating app Tinder, for instance, works well enough in Villa Las Estrellas. But some researchers joke that the villages gender imbalance (only about 10 per cent of inhabitants here are women) and small population show that such services may not have been intended with Antarctica in mind.No wonder letting off steam here is serious business. At a recent barbecue to celebrate making it an entire year in Antarctica, Chilean navy personnel in Villa Las Estrellas drank bottles of pisco, a brandy made in Chile, and of Great Wall, a Chinese red wine given to them by guests  researchers from Chinas aptly named Great Wall research station.Despite the challenges, many Chileans still covet a chance to live in Villa Las Estrellas. This is one of the worlds last frontiers, said Macarena Marcotti Mura, 25, a veterinarian who arrived in November to work at the post office.Some are drawn here by a sense of adventure, others by higher salaries than in Chile for comparable jobs. Residents of Villa Las Estrellas seem to have their own reasons for moving to Antarctica.I approach this like a vacation, said Robinson Montejo, 59, the manager, and only employee, of the branch here of the Chilean Banco de Crdito e Inversiones. Inevitably, he spends a lot of time alone, waiting for the occasional customer to come in from the cold. This is the right place for a little peace and quiet."

An agriculture scientist addresses a meeting in Umerkote.Two Bhubaneswar-based institutes of ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) plan to adopt at least two villages in Nabarangpur, an effort to promote the growth of micronutrient-rich crops and help tribals arm themselves against malnutrition.Last week, scientists of Bhubaneswars Central Tuber Crop Research Institute and Central Institute for Women in Agriculture visited Sukhigaon and Biriguda villages in Umerkote and Pondripokhana village in Raighar to assess local requirements.CTCRI director Dr Archana Mukherjee, who heads the six-member team, said the intervention by ICAR institutes was prompted by The Indian Expresss District Zero series on poverty and change in the district. The District Zero series was haunting us. When our director general Trilochan Mohapatra asked us to do something for the hunger hotspots, we thought what could be a better place than Nabarangpur to focus on. Our project was conceived last month. Our aim is to bring freedom from hunger and malnutrition, said Mukherjee.CTCRI focuses on research on sweet potato and aroids catering to the needs of the eastern and northeastern regions. CIWA focuses on agricultural technologies and policies with a womens perspective and undertakes studies to understand drudgery and safety-related issues of women farmers.Dr Rajasekhara Rao Korada, principal scientist at CTCRI and coordinator of the project, said they would focus on making nutrition available between January and June before the arrival of monsoon. Between January and June there is little food in a tribal household. At CTCRI we have varieties of sweet potato that could address the beta carotene deficiency and vitamin deficiency in tribal women and children. The sweet potatoes developed by us need very little water and would be suitable for Nabarangpur, he said.The two institutes will also help grow nutrient-rich colacasia and tapioca. These will reduce dependence on potato available in he market. Every day, they can harvest one or two such tubers till June, said Korada.CTCRI, which has also conducted research on pulses, plans to introducing green gram and horse gram that would mature in 90 days. Our objective is to intervene in their dietary practice and improve upon it to enhance its nutritional value. The tribals of Nabarangpur mostly eat dalma, a recipe of boiled pulses and vegetables. We will give them good saplings of papaya, banana and drumstick, which they can use in preparing dalma, said Dr Mukherjee.As per the BPL census of Odisha, over 73.6 per cent people in Nabarangpur live below the poverty line. According to the women and child development department, 3,400 children in the district suffer from malnutrition, 296 of them severely.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Rana Simranjit Singh) Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal during a tour of Khadoor Sahib constituency shortly after the Congress MLA resigned. (Source: Rana Simranjit Singh)On February 13, Khadoor Sahib will elect an MLA who will serve for hardly a year before Punjab goes to polls. That is the way one section of the Congress would like to view it as it urges the leadership to ignore the bypoll and focus instead on the larger battle. The Aam Aadmi Party has already opted out. The other section in the Congress, however, would rather not give the Shiromani Akali Dal a walkover, especially with the high symbolism involved.The assembly seat is a segment of Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency in the border district of Tarn Taran. Three reasons make the bypoll a prestige battle for the Akalis. Khadoor Sahib is frequently identified with a panthic character. Out of the nine segments of the Lok Sabha constituency, the Congress won only three in the 2012 assembly polls, and Khadoor Sahib was one of them. Third, the Congress MLA has resigned for panthic reasons.Ramanjit Singh Sikki stepped down last October to protest against the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari and the governments inability to bring the guilty to book. Clear that they could not afford to lose the seat now, the Akalis took up the battle immediately. As early as November, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal went on a sangat darshan tour through the constituency and allocated Rs 35 crore for various civic projects there. Apart from identity politics, the Akalis are also worried about a defeat being interpreted as a sign of anti-incumbency.A defeat for the Congress, on the other hand, could reflect poorly on new state party chief Capt Amarinder Singh, considering that it is a seat the Congress holds. But it is Amarinders political strategist, Prashant Kishor, who has suggested that the party ignore the inconsequential bypoll and concentrate on 2017 instead, a source in their camp said. The other camp is worried about opting out being interpreted as running away. The central leadership is yet to decide.Sikki is keen to recontest. Known as a potato king for his cultivation and cold stores, he is an Amarinder loyalist who quit as MLA without consulting then AICC chief Partap Bajwa. Sikki has not been talking in public of late. He will contest if the high command wants him to, said his aide Rana Gurjit. Last time, Sikki won by barely 3,000 votes.The Akali candidate is Ravinder Singh Brahmpura, a choice that could reopen old rivalries. Ravinder is the son of Ranjit Brahmpura, the sitting MP from Khadoor Sahib. In the 2012 assembly elections, Sikki had defeated the father, whom the SAD fielded for the Lok Sabha two years later.Ravinder Brahmpura said he had been looking forward to a contest with the AAP and the Congress. But it seems both parties have chickened out, he said. I will win. People are sick of Sikki, who has not kept in touch with them. He tried to win brownie points by playing the Sikh card and resigning. But it has worked against him.AAP is widely seen as a strong challenger to the Congress and the SAD-BJP in 2017. Its decision to stay out should come as a relief to both sides, but it still leaves other potential spoilers in the fray. Two AAP rebels, Bhai Baldeep Singh and Sumail Singh Sidhu, have announced that they will contest as independents. Yogendra Yadavs splinter group Swaraj Lehar is behind Bhai Baldeep.AAP state convener Sucha Singh Chotepur said they could not afford to spend so much on an election for the sake of being in the assembly for only a few months. Our party has neither the money nor the energy to be wasted on this election. We are prepared for 2017 even if they announce the polls today, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
591f62b47be9e025a5d4dbcc,India set to go  on organic diet,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521019/india-set-go-organic-diet.html,2016-01-03,,Deccan Herald,"Mamta Bhardwaj Jan 04, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTOne of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under organic certification, India has an organic food market estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."
591f89a27be9e025a5d4f686,Optimism will prevail,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/523269/optimism-prevail.html,2016-01-15,,Deccan Herald,"N Janardhan, January 16, 2016 0:09 ISTOptimism will prevail : There are several reasons why stormy ties between the two major countries of the region will not result in a full-scale war.It is worth risking being on the wrong side of pessimism. So, here is an optimistic analysis of the Saudi Arabia-Iran tension that has metamorphosed into a full-scale diplomatic war, exposing the deep cleavages of the Sunni-Shiite conflict in West Asia.The feud will remain at this delicate stage at its worst and not escalate into a military war, as some analysts fear. It is in nobodys interest for the two regional giants to get more aggressive than they already have. There are enough regional proxy wars that Saudi Arabia and Iran are already involved in for them to realise that continued war is not the answer. This conflictual relationship is unsustainable and unsound in the long term.In such a milieu, the answer to their long-lasting ideological battle is dialogue, negotiation, cooperation and peace, which is still possible and may eventually materialise as the dust of this game of brinkmanship settles to an unproductive dead-end.In the latest feud, Sunni Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Shiite Iran on January 3 after an Iranian mob stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran (There has been no Saudi ambassador in Iran for nearly two years). This crisis developed following the Kingdoms execution of several political dissidents, including a prominent Saudi Shiite Muslim cleric, Sheikh Nimr Al-Nimr.Soon after, both countries imposed retaliatory diplomatic and trade curbs. Several Arab countries followed suit by downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran, which has put an already fragile relationship under intense scrutiny. Yet, the optimism for rapprochement stems from the following reasons.First, the Saudi-Iran sectarian-political-hegemonic rivalry has seen tense times in the past too, but never degenerated into a direct war in modern times. The root of Sunni-Shiite divide lies in the succession row following the death of Prophet Mohammed in 632.More recently, tension prevailed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran and the Iran-Iraq war. The death of hundreds of Saudis and Iranians in the 1987 Mecca clashes accentuated the division, followed by Riyadh severing diplomatic ties in 1988.Mohammed Khatamis election as Iranian president in 1997 ushered a period of calm, even resulting in a security pact in 2001. But the US invasion of Iraq and Saddam Husseins ouster empowered the countrys Shiite majority and influenced a shift in its political alignment towards Iran, which hurt Saudi interests.Irans nuclear energy programme deepened Saudi fears that Tehran, under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was pursuing a policy of dominating the Gulf and expanding its influence among Shiite populations of Arab countries  the Shiite Crescent in and encirclement of West Asia.Any tentative steps towards another rapprochement during the late years of the last decade were squashed by the Arab uprising that engaged both countries in proxy wars in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, leading up to the current crisis.The second reason for optimism that they could still make up at some stage is though the two countries are feuding, the third player in the margins is the United States. Riyadh may be indirectly targeting Washington, which spearheaded the nuclear deal with Tehran, thereby strengthening the Shiite countrys regional influence and opening the doors for its return to the global economic and political mainstream. Conversely, it has left Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies searching for fresh answers in several strategic domains.Washingtons dislike for direct military intervention in West Asian conflicts in recent years has also brought Russia to the fore and upset Riyadhs plans in Syria. This has forced Riyadh to stretch beyond its comfort zone in dealing with Tehrans influence in Syria and Yemen. This includes armed involvement against the Al-Houthis in Yemen.By acting tough with Iran, Saudi Arabia could either be indicating to the US that it is capable of fending for itself (along with an Islamic coalition) or pressuring it to recalibrate its rapprochement with Iran (which the US presidential elections could facilitate) or forcing its active intervention to resolve the reigning crises in its favour.Domestic issuesThird, just as Saudi Arabia may be targeting the US more than Iran through this feud, the real target of the Iranian orchestrators of the embassy attack may not be the Kingdom. Instead it could be a domestic political turf war between the hardliners, who are opposed to the Iranian deal with the United States, and the President Hassan Rouhani-led reformist camp.Iran is scheduled to hold elections for the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the Assembly of Experts on February 26. Shiite preacher Sheikh Nimrs execution in Riyadh is a hot potato during election season.The fourth rationale for optimism is the oil price. At less than $35 a barrel, both countries are struggling to manage their economies. Venturing into a war that would definitely drain their resources further, and almost definitely leave their differences unresolved, could make them lean in favour of crisis management and conflict resolution.Fifth, there were reports attributed to the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson in late December 2015 that diplomatic efforts were under way to open direct dialogue between Iran and Saudi Arabia to resolve differences and regional issues. There may still be room to walk amid the tough talk.Sixth, the more these two countries feud, the more the Islamic State gains. This should serve as motivation for Saudi Arabia and Iran to set aside their ideological differences and work towards neutralising the common enemy.The last reason for optimism that cooperation is still possible stems from the US-Iran rapprochement, unimaginable a few years ago. If this was achievable, a Saudi-Iran thaw is not impossible.(The writer is a Dubai-based political analyst, author and Honorary Fellow of the University of Exeter, UK)"
591f8b747be9e025a5d4f7da,Dubious blasphemy laws,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/576908/dubious-blasphemy-laws.html,2016-10-20,,Deccan Herald,"Bhopinder Singh, Oct 21, 2016 23:20 ISTPAKISTAN'S FAULTLINES : Given the current Pakistani background, the will of lawmakers and judiciary to take an unbiased stand in Asia Bibi case is suThe ongoing judicial saga in Pakistan against the execution of Asia Bibi has taken a curious twist with one of the three judges, Justice Iqbal Hamid-ur-Rehman recusing himself from hearing the final appeal. This, ostensibly, since he had heard the linked case involving the former governor of Punjab state Salmaan Taseer.Asia Bibi, belonging to the minority Christian community, has been convicted under the notorious and dubious, blasphemy laws. In 2010, she was sentenced to death by hanging in a district court. This has since pricked the collective conscience of the progressive world and some educated quarters within Pakistan, like Salman Taseer, who stood up for her against the blasphemy laws, and paid the ultimate price of getting executed in cold blood by his own security guard.Blasphemy, like terror is an ambiguous and undecided issue for the Pakistani establishment. It is a political hot-potato that typifies the multitude of contradictions in the Pakistani narrative. Genealogically, Pakistan was born of the concept of two-nation theory that is premised on a separate state for Muslims  yet, a powerful case for secularism was envisaged by the Qaid-e-Azam (father of the nation) Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in his policy speech on August 11, 1947: You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state.This contradictory ambiguity at birth has retained the opportunity for the rulers of Pakistan to twist the interpretation to suit the political expediency and necessities of the times that be. While the Pakistani military (which officially ruled for 35 out of the 70 years of independence) is institutionally inclined towards secularism (but for the reign of General Zia-ul-Haq, who sowed the seeds of overt Islamisation), the civilian politicians have invariably been susceptible to pander to the religious bigotry of the mullahs for electoral gratification and crowd-sourcing.Geographical contiguity to Afghanistan had led to the massive influx of monies to support themujahidin movement of the 1980s. The pumping of support by the western powers (on the last leg of the cold war) and by the generous doles of the Gulf monarchies resulted in debilitating infusion of militancy and puritanical strains of Islam within the Pakistani mainstream. Since then, the proliferation and regressive agenda of the Wahhabi-inspired madrasas in the Pakistani hinterland and frontiers has changed the societal fabric from a secular and inclusive approach, towards an aggressively intolerant framework that is at short fuse with the myriad minorities. The dangerous slide into religious extremism soon morphed into terror groups, which besides impacting the neighbourhood (India and Afghanistan) has earned Pakistan the notoriety as the hub of global terror.The current set of Pakistani blasphemy laws owe their form and content to Zias Islamisation drive that added multiple clauses and penalties (including death, or imprisonment for life to punish blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad  as in the case of Asia Bibi, which if carried out, will be the first person to get executed for blasphemy, though over 50 people have been murdered by the restive populace even before the formal trial got over).A simple accusation of blasphemy is enough to make a case against the vulnerable minorities. Therefore, a disproportionately high number of minorities like the Christians, Hindus and evenAhmediyas (declared non-Muslim, since 1973) are the targets of blasphemy accusations. Basic electoral sensitivities have ensured that the political parties have not made any corrective or protective changes for the targeted minorities.Fundamentalist lobbiesPressure from the powerful fundamentalist lobbies, religious parties and wary citizenry has relegated the support for Asia Bibi to the very limited fringes of the educated classes. International support for her case is seen conspiratorially as yet another example of western interference, compromise of Pakistani sovereignty or as an affront to the Pakistani judicial system. No contrarian view to the blasphemy law is allowed to be expressed or tabled without an implied threat of accompanying violence. Soon after Taseers murder, Shahbaz Bhatti, the Minister for Religious Minorities (a Christian himself), was shot dead in broad daylight for espousing the case Asia Bibi.This case is reflective of the leadership paralysis that has gripped the Pakistani establishment and tests its resolve to effectively counter the implosive tendencies. Already, murmurs of judges getting apprehensive about their personal security is doing the rounds. Earlier, the upholding of the death sentence to Mumtaz Qadri, the guard who killed Salman Taseer, had forced the Supreme Court judges to retreat shamefully from the backdoor in order to escape the public wrath of punishing a man, seen to be supporting the spirit of the blasphemy laws.Given the current Pakistani background, the will of the lawmakers and the judiciary to take an unbiased stand in the Asia Bibi case is suspect. It is only the military establishment which can somehow step in and take an unpopular position of standing up to the blasphemy laws. For all its intrigues, complicities and murk, the Pakistani military is essentially against the mullahs/clergy in the battle for institutional supremacy in Pakistan. However, it is also a past-master in duality of approach (for example, it is firm on Pakistan-facing terror groups while being supportive of the India-facing and Afghanistan-facing terror groups).Often, the faultlines in Pakistan are genealogical and unfixable as they are a means of ensuring relevance to the said institutions. Tension and terror in the neighbourhood is an existential requirement for the Pakistani Army, sectarian violence and religious pandering is a tool of political relevance for the politicos and the retention of poverty and ignorance an invaluable hook for the clergy."

How can we increase our productivity without using science and technology, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said here on Monday. The genetically engineered crops that received field trial approvals are cotton, rice, castor, wheat, maize, groundnut, potato, sorghum, brinjal, mustard, sugarcane and chickpea.Carrying out the field trials, however, depends on receiving a no-objection certificate from the states. Field trials of GM cotton, maize and mustard took place in Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi from which GM mustard, developed by the Delhi University, came close to commercialisation. When the commercialisation proposal for indigenous GM mustard came up before the regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) in February, Javadekar intervened before the regulator could decide.The minister stepped in due to opposition from the anti-GM activists and Left parties. The project was put on the backburner. The mustard proposal is still being studied, he said.The Environment Ministry has not yet released the biosafety data for GM crops as directed by the Central Information Commission. We will respond to the CIC, Javadekar said.The number of approved field trials as stated by the minister is far less than what an anti-GM lobby group estimated two years ago after the GEAC cleared a number of proposals in four meetings within months of the NDA government coming to power."

On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was present to hand over the physical possession of land, as she distributed the land deeds to farmers on September 14.She also spread mustard seeds as a symbolic measure to restart farming on 997 acres, which was stopped in 2006, when the erstwhile Left Front government acquired the land to help set up the Tata plant.Even though local Trinamool Congress MLA and former agriculture minister, Becharam Manna, claimed the state government is returning the land in a cultivable state, agriculture and soil experts express doubts that after lying fallow for a decade, the land is not likely to retain its fertility. While the plant stood on more than 250 acres of the total acquired land, since the area was low-lying, its height was increased by piling tonnes of sand, fly ash and solid waste.While this process itself would have rendered the land infertile, Manna claimed around 400 acres are ready for cultivation.Mamata handed over 23 plots spread over 6.71 acres on Thursday, with plans to hand over 50 to 60 land plots everyday.The government is also installing 50 mini-deep tube-wells for better irrigation, besides distributing free seeds, fertilisers, and providing a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 to each farmer.Farmers like Ganesh Koley, Naba Kumar Ghosh and Jugal Kishore Ghosh, however, did not seem to share the governments confidence over the lands renewed cultivability. Jugal said that the government decided to start with mustard because crops like mustard, sesame and pulses release nitrogen and help land gain fertility.Weve to grow such crops for a few years till the land regains nutrition. It could take as long as four years for the land to be properly cultivable so that we can grow potato or rice, he said."

Urad and Tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and Rs 75 respectively in February 2014, have risen to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month, he added. Rahul further said that when the minimum support price (MSP) for Tur dal was Rs 45, its market value was Rs 75. MSP has now risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulse is 180. There is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government, he said, seeking to know were this over Rs 100 was going. He alleged that the government had waived off Rs 52,000 crore owed by corporates and wondered what it had given farmers and housewives from the Rs 2 lakh crore it had saved due to a slump in crude prices.Watch Video: Whats making newsHitting back, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said such issues are settled through policies and not by setting dates. You are talking about a government (UPA) which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts. This is a matter of statistics and not sloganeering, he said.On Rahuls reference to prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said sarcastically, everybody seems to be going to market everyday. He claimed that the Modi Government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country had seen a negative WPI inflation.The finance minister asserted that the NDA government had brought down prices and expressed the hope that with a good monsoon this year, prices would further reduce. He acknowledged that high prices of pulses remained a matter of concern but pointed out that steps were afoot to reduce the gap between demand and supply. He said India produced the maximum amount of pulses, recorded their highest consumption and imported the maximum amount. While the demand was for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes. He said the production of pulses was expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: isro.gov.in) Space Applications Centre Director Tapan Misra. (Source: isro.gov.in)Stating that there is no paucity of innovation in India, Tapan Misra, the director of Space Applications Centre  an arm of ISRO  said that the countrys space agency has been helping the government in keeping the prices of agri-commodities in check through advanced predictions using satellite imagery.You would be seeing that the prices of potatoes or onions do not rise as much as they once used to. There was a time when their prices used to rise 500 percent and governments used to fall. The reason is that we do predictions based on satellite imaging and give production estimates to the government, said Misra while addressing an award ceremony of Gujarat Innovation Society (GIS) where Ela Bhatt, the founder of SEWA, Ahmedabad was awarded along with 14 other innovators.So if they know that the sugarcane production in UP and Maharashtra is going to be low, the government gets time to book sugar from Brazil. That is the reason why the prices of sugar have been between Rs 20-40 per kilogram during the last 10 years. The prices are lower than the inflation rates, he added.We (ISRO) has given the country so many communication satellites. Through the television programmes aired through these satellites we make the country laugh and also make them cry; fights in family happen and they stop as well. We do not give importance to this, but only when we do something like a Mars mission then ISROs contribution is acknowledged, Misra said while stressing on the innovations done by scientists at this institution.The senior ISRO scientist said that Indians do not respect the fact that a lot of innovations happen in the country with frugal finance. He narrated how SAC was planning to buy a special kind of CNC machine from Germany, but got the same made through a local company in Rajkot. If we had bought from Germany, it would have costed us Rs 12 crore, and we only paid Rs 1.5 crore to the local company. We ended up saving a lot of money, Misra said about a decision that was made a couple of months back.The chief guest of the event Dr C Muralikrishna Kumar from Niti Aayog said the NDA government under the Atal Innovation Mission will begin work on the establishing 500 tinkering labs in schools across the country in the next one month. We will set up a challenge where schools will compete to set up these laboratories that will boost the spirit of innovation among school children.Meanwhile, the GIS awards that were given out during the event included Ela Bhatt, founder of SEWA. She was given the Gujarat Ratna A life for innovation award. Diamond baron, Savji Dholakia, Managing Director of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd., and Mr. Jaysukh O. Patel received the Hercules Award for conducting the highest and biggest loyalty program ever for employees in Surat and for a LED Motion Sensor Light for prevention of electricity wastage in Ahmedabad, respectively.The Achievers Award were bestowed upon Dr. Harish R Gershom for inventing HARISOPHONE, a musical instrument for augmenting the cure of human ailments through sound therapy in Ahmedabad , and Mr. Vijay Kothari who received it for conceptualizing the Waste Out of Wealth (WoW) Program meant for shredding secret records of companies and waste management and pollution prevention in Ahmedabad.The trendsetter awards were given to Nikisha Bhadreshbhai Jariwalas innovation that deals with an exquisite way to transliterate Gujarati text into Braille, a crucial aid for the visually impaired in Surat.

5922dff97be9e01fd59ac29d,A tale of parched Maharashtra village: Each family in Shilatane village spends Rs 100 a day to buy water,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/waterless-maharashtra-pune-water-buy-expensive-parched-each-family-in-shilatane-village-spends-rs-100-a-day-to-buy-water-2814250/,2016-05-23,,Indian Express,"Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day. Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day.AS ONE enters the village Shilatane, around 50 kms from Pune, a prominent sight that meets ones eyes are large-size blue colour barrels placed outside each house. Since past three months, the dwellers of this village have been buying water, spending Rs 50 for each barrel that can store 200 litre of water. On an average, a family buys at least two barrels of water; the number varies if the members in the family are more.Ask Nanda Vilas Chavan, a housewife, whos busy pouring water into a small vessel from one of the barrels, about the water situation in her village, and she responds, Although we have been using water judiciously for last three months, we need at least two barrels of water every day, given that we have five members in the family. A barrel comes for Rs 50 and thus, we end up spending Rs 100 every day. The amount is not easy to shell out as our only source of income is agriculture, which is also badly affected by water shortage.Asha Vijay Bhanusghare, another woman says, Our entire monthly budget has got disturbed. We are spending Rs 3,000 to 4,000 every month only on water. Its a basic necessity for survival and one cannot cut costs here. And so even though we are reducing our expenses in other areas, we are keeping aside this amount every month.The village, which has a population of 2,500 people, is one of the 40 villages that are located around River Indrayani, which is currently completely dry. The river originates in Kurvande village, near Lonavala. The sarpanch of the village Shilatane, Hemant Shivaji Bhanusghare, informs that the rivers water dried in January itself and since then, the water condition has been bad.The villagers, he says, depend on Indrayani for water needed for agriculture and their cattle. It is not the first time that it has happened. This is a struggle we face every year. Hence, all the farmers have shifted to single crops, he says, adding, Theres nothing we can do after January. You can find barren farm lands across this area. The drinking water through water pipeline connected to Pavana Dam is supplied to all villages once in four days. Around 40,000 litre of water cannot last for four days in a village that has 2,500 people. The situation of houses that are situated on the higher side is worse because the water pressure is so low that it cannot reach them. People have no choice but to buy water from the tankers. The villagers are taking their cattle 2 km away from village for water. Even the milk production of cows and buffaloes has reduced due to shortage of fodder and water, he says.Chandrakant Andre, a farmer, shares that in comparison to previous years, when he grew potato, tomato, onion and sugarcane, now he grows just one crop in a year as there is no water for agriculture, which has reduced his annual income. Andre says he is waiting for rains, after which he will sow either jawar or chana.Prafull Kadam, a water activist who works in the area, cites that while Valvan Dam is just six kms from the village, the village gets water from Pavana Dam, which is 16-17 km away. Till 18-20 years ago, the Tata firm that owns the Valvan Dam would leave water in Indrayani river during summers. Later, they shifted focus to hydroelectricity and hence, stopped leaving water. And then began our sufferings. Its sad that people with limited income have to buy water especially when the state water policy GR states that drinking water should be given priority, says Kadam.Kadam says that though people suggest watershed as a possible solution, it doesnt have much scope at this time of the year for various reasons. Landholding capacity is less here; the area has hard rock; space for water structure treatment is not there; and instead of an even ground, the area has slopes. Thus, watershed wont yield any result here, he elaborates.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Twenty five units of firefighters were trying to douse the fire.Flames and smoke were seen billowing out of the factory, six hours after the fire started. The fire service said strong winds had fanned the flames.A five-member probe body headed by Gazipur Executive Magistrate Rehanul Islam has been formed to look into the incident, Gazipur Deputy Commissioner SM Alam said.The factory produced and printed the plastic packaging for food items like potato chips and small household goods including mosquito coils.Low-cost manufacturing is a mainstay of Bangladesh's economy, but a series of industrial disasters in recent years have raised concerns about safety standards.Tighter controls have been introduced, but dozens of workers still die every year. At least 13 people died in a fire at a plastics factory Dhaka last year. In 2012, 112 workers died in a fire at a factory just outside the capital.The country suffered an even greater tragedy in 2013 when the Rana Plaza garment complex collapsed on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing 1,135 people."
592308d07be9e01fceefe47b,Bridge to nowhere shows China's failed efforts to engage North Korea,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/569926/bridge-nowhere-shows-chinas-failed.html,2016-09-12,,Deccan Herald,"Sep 12, 2016, Reuters: 11:17 ISTTowering above the murky waters, the New Yalu River Bridge was supposed to symbolise a new era in relations between China and North Korea, helping bring investment to landmark free trade zones jointly run with the impoverished and isolated state.Costing 2.2 billion yuan ($330 million) and partially completed last year, the dual-carriageway bridge today sits abandoned, the impressive border post on the Chinese side deserted and locked, not a soul to be seen.On the North Korean side the unfinished bridge ends abruptly in a field, with little sign of infrastructure work happening.Launched with great fanfare at a five-star Beijing hotel in 2012, the free trade zones close to the Chinese border city of Dandong were meant to be part of China's efforts to coax its erstwhile diplomatic ally into cautious, export-oriented economic reforms, rather than sabre rattling and nuclear tests.China's anger at North Korea for carrying out its fifth and biggest nuclear test last week means the bridge looks unlikely to open any time soon, especially as Pyongyang is already under wide-ranging UN sanctions China has promised to uphold.The lonely streets of the Dandong New Zone stand testimony to the failure of those engagement efforts. Apartment complexes with fancy names like ""Singapore City"" lie bare or half-finished, and shopping malls empty or at very low capacity.At the Guomen Wanjia Home & Life Square Mall, Sun Lixia sits waiting for customers at a lighting store.""North Korea hasn't opened their end of the bridge and we can't really do anything about it. It's been bad for the local economy here. Who knows when they'll open it?"" Sun said.""Apartments haven't been selling quickly, a lot of people aren't willing to move here,"" she added. ""There isn't even a proper hospital here, it's only been half completed.""It's far cry from what one Dandong official told state media in 2012: that the development would resemble Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong's busiest commercial areas, and the bridge handle 50,000 people and 20,000 vehicles a day to North Korea.""ABUNDANT RESOURCES""The Hwanggumphyong and Wihwa Islands economic zones, along with one at the other end of the border at Rason, had high level support. Late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il inked an agreement for them during a trip to China in 2010.The Rason zone has been more successful, though, with much more development, including a Chinese-built road into town and a new bridge being built at its border crossing.Kim's son, the youthful current leader Kim Jong Un, has yet to visit China, and seems unlikely to be invited any time soon as he pursues an accelerated nuclear weapons and missile testing programme to the increasing alarm of the outside world.A glossy promotional booklet from 2012 shows an artist's rendering of gleaming tower blocks in Hwanggumphyong and wide, tree-line avenues.""North Korea has not only abundant, high-quality human resources, but also rich capital resources and enormous land to develop,"" the bilingual Chinese-English booklet reads, promising legal protection for investors and tax breaks.When Reuters visited this week, only farmland and barbed wire fencing could be seen from the Chinese side.""The government was counting on trade between China and North Korea to drive economic growth here but that hasn't happened,"" said a security guard who gave his family name as Liu, standing in front of an office building on the optimistically named Commercial Street.""To be honest, the main reason the new zone hasn't developed is because the bridge isn't open,"" Liu added.WAR TIESThe new link is meant to supplement Dandong's old ""Friendship Bridge"", with its lone lane for both vehicles and people running parallel to a single-line railway track.About three-quarters of bilateral trade flows through the city, and statistics show how limited that still is.China's trade with the North is dwarfed by that with capitalist South Korea, which was worth 908 billion yuan ($136 billion) between January and July, compared to just 17.7 billion yuan between China and North Korea.Dandong's emotional ties with North Korea run deep, thanks to its front line position during the 1950-53 Korean War when China and North Korea fought against a U.S.-led UN coalition.Shops are packed with often low quality-looking North Korean goods, including ginseng and spirits infused with snakes and medicinal herbs, and North Korean waitresses sing patriotic songs at government-run restaurants for curious tourists.Those relations have been severely strained by North Korea's nuclear and missile tests and periodic shootings and murders blamed on North Korean residents and security forces.""I don't like North Korea. The police on the other side used to shoot farmers who'd go over to sell potatoes, corn, things like that, in the winter,"" said Dandong farmer Zhao Guangfu, 70.Jin Qiangyi, Director of Yanbian University's Centre for North and South Korea Studies, said China found itself in a ""distressing"" position on what to do with North Korea.""We have a choice about whether we can push them to reform and open up, to get them to change,"" Jin said. ""Of course political and military sanctions need to be stepped up, but civilian opening up and exchanges must be strengthened too."""

I'm not afraid of anything,"" she said. ""And when it's time for me to die, it won't happen because of radiation.""BIRD SONGTuesday marks the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine, caused by a botched safety test in the fourth reactor of the atomic plant that sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe.The disaster and the government's handling of it -- the evacuation order only came 36 hours after the accident -- highlighted the shortcomings of the Soviet system with its unaccountable bureaucrats and entrenched culture of secrecy.Mikhail Gorbachev has since said he considered Chernobyl one of the main nails in the coffin of the Soviet Union which eventually collapsed in 1991.The accident killed 31 right away and forced tens of thousands to flee. The final death toll of those killed by radiation-related illnesses such as cancer is subject to debate.A Greenpeace report ahead of the anniversary cites a Belarusian study estimating the total cancer deaths from the disaster at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation's estimate of 9,000.The Greenpeace study also said people living in the area continue to eat and drink foods with dangerously high radiation levels.In particular, ""the 30 km exclusion zone around the Chernobyl reactor remains highly contaminated and unsuitable to live in,"" it said.But that matters little to Lozbin, one of around 160 people estimated to have returned to the zone. ""What's there to be afraid of?"" said Maria's daughter-in-law Oleksandra Lozbin.""I don't want to go to Kiev. Why would I leave such nature? Where could you hear cuckoos? Where could you hear the nightingale?""Oleksandra's husband, who grew up in a village 7 km away, started coming to Chernobyl in short bursts starting in 2008 and the family settled back there permanently in 2010.""My husband had wanted to come back to his homeland all his life,"" she said. ""He came back when it was all closed here, when it was prohibited to come here. He crossed through barbed wire.""Oleksandra said police initially tried to force them to leave, but the family refused.Oleksandra hopes to inspire others to move back. To remind people what life was like before the accident, the family has created a makeshift museum in a house across the street with objects collected from nearby abandoned cottages.There are books, a doll in a cot, a rusty wheel, an abacus, and a black-and-white photo of two people. One day, she hopes, someone might see it and recognize their great-grandparents.""We decided to save the history of Chernobyl,"" she said. ""We hope that people will come back here and will live here, and their children and grandchildren will see what life was like here, in what kind of cots people were raised here, in what kind of boxes people stored their personal belongings and books.""On a bench lies a Soviet newspaper from Jan. 24 1986, four months before the disaster. The front page headline reads: ""No to nuclear testing""."
592325517be9e01fd59accfb,"Punjab: Despite ban, crackdown, burning is on",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-despite-ban-crackdown-burning-is-on-3736431/,2016-11-04,,Indian Express,"HEERA, A migrant labourer, was in a hurry to clear paddy stubble from the field of his owner in Kapur village of Jalandhar late on Thursday afternoon. So, he set the entire field on fire. He was also joined by the field owner, Mahinder Singh (name changed) as both wanted to clear the straw as soon as possible to prepare the field to sow wheat. Wheat sowing, which has already begun in the state, will continue till November 15.Singh owns 10 acres of land on which he sows wheat, paddy and potato every year. We have harvested paddy a couple of days back and now we are left with less than two weeks to complete wheat sowing for which fields are to be prepared and there is no alternative available with us to remove the stubble. To clear the field for sowing the next crop, we have to burn the straw, he insisted.Government is imposing fine on us but not giving any solution on how to manage the straw. We do not want to spoil the environment as we too live in the same polluted environment, which we create by burning straw, but have no option, said another farmer.Ploughing the stubble costs us around Rs 1,500 per acre which is not viable and the government should support us in clearing the field as the machinery required for stubble management is beyond the reach of more than 70-75 per cent farmers of Punjab, said another farmer, adding that machinery required to manage straw is costly and without government support, it is not possible for majority farmers to use it.Despite the ban on straw burning in the state, one could see a large number of burnt fields and fires every 100-200 metres in Kapur village. It was the same at over two dozen villages in Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts that The Indian Express visited on Thursday.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, which measures stubble burning through satellite images, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintained that it has increased this year.According to agriculture department sources, out of over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which Punjab produces annually, nearly half has already been burnt. Around 70-75 per cent (nearly 15 million) of the 20 million straw is burnt to clear land for the next crop.This year, 30.10 lakh hectares are under rice cultivation against 29.75 lakh hectares last year. Now, the burning fields of Punjab have resulted in a dense smog cover over Delhi, for the past couple of days. Incidentally, the National Green Tribunal has summoned Punjab for creating environment pollution not only in the state but up to Delhi thereby resulting in serious health issues in the national capital.PPCB has formed several teams along with officials in every district of the state this year to take action against those burning straw and even booked over 500 farmers. They are being fined Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 for setting on fire two acres, five acres and over five acres, respectively. In Jalandhar alone, around 90 farmers fields have been raided by these teams.Our officials have already raided over 500 farmer units, said PPCB Chairman Manpreet Singh Chatwal.Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, Director of Punjab Agriculture department, said paddy is sown over a huge area in Punjab for which we have to make a large number of machines available to every farmer in the state. Though big farmers can afford to purchase machines on their own, that cannot be expected of the small and marginal farmers. So, the Centre has to help farmers purchase the machines at nominal rates. In Punjab, not more than 10 per cent paddy stubble can be manged with the available machinery. We are also changing the mindset of farmers through Kisan Mela so that they can adopt the new technology, said Bains. Though awareness is increasing, we still have a long way to go, he added.Second generation ethanol production plant in SangrurIndian Oil Corporation, in association with the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab government, is also going to set up an ethanole plant by using surplus crop residue and other biomass as feedstock. Sangrur district has already been identified as one of the potential locations where surplus biomass is available. And this plant will reduce carbon emission produced by traditional burning of crop residue by farmers, informed Chatwal, adding that a 50-acre plot has already been identified to set up this plant, which will help to manage the straw as well as provide additional income to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,,Indian Express,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now.

(PTI Photo) Pietermaritzburg: Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels from Pentrich Railway Station to Pietermaritzburg, South Africa on Saturday. (PTI Photo)The moodily-lit black-and-white profile of the prime minister, splendidly solitary in a retro rail carriage at Pietermaritzburg, caused much merriment last weekend, suggesting that the PMO needs better publicity managers. Ad photography and Photoshoppery was just asking for it, and social media was there to provide it  pictures from another state visit to South Africa, in cheerful colour, showing Manmohan Singh and his wife in the very same carriage, amidst a trainload of happy travellers. Some images of Narendra Modi which appeared in the media were in colour and included South African dignitaries. The solitary exception was this extremely fishy monochrome setup.Actually, to quote the Bard of Avon, the fault lies not in our PMO but in ourselves, that we are underlings. The fact that someone had the brass to try to pull off a Gandhigiri stunt shows that the PMs publicists regard the people as wholly gullible. It is an improbably optimistic project, to present a person whose thought is founded on a careful reading of Golwalkar and the rest of the RSS canon as a true copy of Gandhi, to the extent of appearing in monochrome, like the Father of the Nation. Who, had Father Time given him a break, may have preferred to appear in Technicolor himself. In the interest of truth, if nothing else.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn London, as Theresa May picks up the gauntlet that David Cameron dropped in haste and Boris Johnson regarded nervously as a hot potato, the jokes about post-Brexit Britain continue to flourish. Some of the finest are on the image boards. Like, a picture of a Pret a Manger storefront that now reads Ready to Eat. Why not? Its a British company trying to exoticise itself. Then, theres the picture of an office with a sign reading, Dpartmnt of dcation, with the banned characters E and U deleted. And dependence on Russian oil will be shrugged off as cars begin to run on fluids which emanate from gas station handles which read EPA, Spitfire and Hobgoblin. And freed from EU regulations, British hospitals will begin to administer patients intravenously with strong, dark ale, instead of the foreign bilge that is usually available in NHS hospitals. Which is a bit odd, since both normal saline and Ringers solution, the commonest of those substances, originated in the British Isles.Grexit, the original exit of geographical provenance, did not happen, but the surprise success of Brexit has opened the door to creative speculation about forthcoming exits. Some of the finest: Outstria (Austria), Byeprus or Nicoseeya (Cyprus), Full (Hungary), Ditch (Netherlands) and Fraurevoir and Czech-out (obvious). Of these, Ditch could actually happen. Theres a party working on it in Amsterdam.The totally unexpected has happened in Rajdeep Sardesais life: he has gone and asked Sania Mirza when shes going to settle down and have the mandatory babies. The tennis ace, who has just launched her autobiography, rued the fact that how many Wimbledon titles a woman wins is still unimportant. Shes not really done until shes beset by bawling brats in a room smelling cloyingly of milk and pee. To his credit, Sardesai acknowledged that his question had been inappropriate.Following a blog post, Sardesai has also become embroiled in a warmed over cold war with Arnab Goswami, following the unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Burhan Wani. Some bright spark at the home ministry seems to have been reading old, dog-eared copies of Field and Stream or something similar, and decided that what our immediate ancestors used for murdering snipe and curlews would probably only frighten people. And now theres a shocking number of maimed and blinded people in Kashmir. And far more shocking trigger-happiness on social media. Why just pellets, the rhetoric online seems to say, why not heavy artillery? Why not nuclear weapons? Much more effective than bug spray for cleaning out vermin, isnt it?Such rhetoric has been heard before in other locations with complicated histories  the Balkans, for instance. It finds articulation when the self succeeds in completely dehumanising the other. This is the dark side of nationalism, which can tear nations apart. The trigger-happy lot on Twitter do not have to take responsibility for their actions, but it is disturbing when media houses speak their language. An electronic war broke out in Delhi when Sardesai ticked off the Twitterati and macho nationalist journalists playing patriot games thus: Who is to tell my outraged friends in the Twitter world that journalism in its purest form doesnt wear the tricolour on its sleeve?Arnab Goswami, who seemed to have bounced back from the fiasco of the PMs interview, was cut to the quick, and yelled back at misguided pseudo-liberals with a headline that read: Dont romanticise terror. No one did, actually, when they questioned the use of non-lethal weapons that can maim civilians, including children. To see this through the lens of black-and-white nationalism is absurdly juvenile.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Supreme Court of India.The water-sharing row between Punjab and Haryana is set to take centrestage again. On Monday, a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court began hearings on the presidential reference pertaining to Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004.The legislation, passed by the then Punjab Assembly when Capt Amarinder Singh was the chief minister, had terminated all water-sharing agreements between Punjab and its neighbouring states, thereby jeopardising the construction of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar told the Bench that the Centre stood by the Supreme Court judgements that the canal should go ahead. The next hearing is on March 8.As news of the SGs statement filtered to Punjab, both the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party attacked the Centre and the ruling SAD-BJP combine in the state for betraying Punjab. With the issue a political hot potato, it came up for discussion in the Punjab cabinet meeting held on Tuesday.Amarinder, who counts the legislation as one of his big achievements and is hailed by many as the saviour of Punjabs waters, lashed out at the Centres contention in the Supreme Court. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the now Punjab Congress president said the BJP-led government at the Centre had committed the worst betrayal with Punjab by opposing its stand on water-sharing and supporting Haryana.He also took a swipe at the Akali Dal, saying that he did not rule out Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badals complicity in the matter. Since Akali Dal is part of the government, it shares equal responsibility for betraying and compromising Punjabs interests in the Supreme Court, he said.Amarinder alleged that in 1978 when [Badal] was the Punjab chief minister, [he] accepted Rs 2 crore from his Haryana counterpart Devi Lal for construction of the SYL canal and added that Punjab was still paying the price. Badal accepted the money as he put his friendship with Devi Lal above Punjabs interests, which he seems to have done once again, Amarinder said. Much water has flown down the Satluj since the idea of SYL was conceived and today there is virtually no water left neither in Punjabs rivers nor underground even for its own needs, he added.AAP too joined the issue. The partys Punjab affairs in-charge Sanjay Singh while slamming Modi government for taking a stand against Punjab, said his party will only stand for the interests of Punjab and Punjabis.The ruling SAD and BJP also said they would take up the matter with Centre. After the cabinet meeting, Punjab Irrigation Minister Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said: Punjab BJP is with us on the issue. We will take up the matter with the Centre. The BJP too said it would take up the matter with the Centre. Punjab is already water deficient. We will impress upon the central government that Punjab has no extra water to share with Haryana, said BJP minister Madan Mohan Mittal.His counterpart in the Cabinet, Surjit Kumar Jyani, who was not present at the cabinet meeting, said that that the government should first ensure Punjab gets all the water it needs. If there is extra water, only then the probability to share water with Haryana could be considered, Jyani. saidFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The latter, who were employed with Hotel Mountview, Hotel Parkview and Hotel Shivalikview, have got their retirement benefits withheld.As per an official record, CITCO purchases vegetables worth around Rs 1.50 crore annually for all its units.Similarly, an inquiry probing irregularities in a contract awarded for laundering and drying cleaning of linen in Hotel Parkview had recommended disciplinary action against nine officials in September.The management, however, has initiated action against only eight officials. CITCO Progressive Workers Union has taken up the issue with the management and has demanded action against the remaining employees.There has to be one yardstick. How can they spare a few and punish the others? It seems the management isprotecting the employees against whom no action has not been taken, said Balbir Singh Punni, general secretary of the union.He further said that the union would take up the issue with the home secretary, who is also the chairman of CITCO, if the management failed to take action against the remaining employees.

The KR Market, Nayandahalli, Deepanjalinagar, Vijayanagar and Magadi Main Road wore a deserted look, with just police personnel patrolling the area. People remained indoors due to the curfew and prohibitory orders.There was an uneasy calm in New Timber Yard Layout, off Mysuru Road. There were more police personnel and patrolling vehicles than commuters. Gutted vehicles were left uncleared.Just a km away, there were remains of about 20 lorries, four-wheelers and buses, which were partially or completely gutted . A resident said mobs did not harm anyone in the locality, where Tamils are in a minority.My wife and children are scared to move around. But the situation is returning to normalcy. With large police presence here, we hope there are no untoward incidents, Krishnamurthy of Bapujinagar said.Fruit and vegetable vendors were seen clearing their stocks by selling them cheap. Tomatoes, potatoes and onions were sold at less than Rs 5 a kg. Getting stocks for the next day was a worry as the Yeshwantpur APMC yard and other wholesale markets remained closed.With hotels shut, Good samaritans like Subhash and his friend Suresh from Sanjaynagar were seen distributing packaged water bottles and biscuits to policemen and people.

While, prices of beans and carrots have come down in the last two weeks, cost of tomatoes and cabbage has increased considerably.Tomatoes, that used to cost Rs 55 per kg at Hopcoms and Rs 20 per kg at wholesale markets, are now available at Rs 72 per kg and at Rs 50, respectively.

In May 2008, the Act was handed over to the Cooperation Department from the Revenue Department.Later, in August 2012, the Act was again transferred to Revenue Department and was being handled by Stamps and Registration Department. Around two months ago, Stamps and Registration Department sent a fresh proposal to restore the Act with the Cooperation Department.The proposal stated, Stamps and Registration is third highest revenue generator for the state exchequer. As of now, 249 sub-registrar offices are functioning with a staff strength of 1,226. There are over a lakh societies registered under the Act. As per section 2 (e) of the Act, District Registrars are the registrars of these societies. Officials of the Stamps and Registration Department have no powers to regulate these societies. Several disputes and irregularities are being noticed in these societies which the Stamps and Registration officials cannot control. Hence, the state is not earning much from these societies. It is better to transfer the implementation of the Act to the Cooperation Department.The proposal note states that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Minister for Cooperation Mahadeva Prasad have approved the transfer and directed officials to look into the proposal.A senior official of the Cooperation Department said the transfer will again put the office under a lot of stress.We already have thousands of societies registered under the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act. All house building cooperative societies and credit, agricultural and many such cooperative societies come under the department. As of 2014-15, there are 39,619 registered cooperative societies in the state,'' the official said.Inspector General of Registration, Stamps and Registration Department, Dr N V Prasad said, The proposal was sent some time ago. However, it has not been finalised and as of now, the Karnataka Societies Act 1960 is still with the Stamps and RegistrationDepartment."

Mr Potato, a puppet from Berlin, Germany will sing with its Indian counterpart, who also happens to be a danseuse.This fusion puppet show is the brainchild of Anupama Hoskere, the founder of Dhaatu, an organisation that promotes traditional art forms, and Paul Affeld, a German puppeteer. The show will begin with solo performances by both puppets, followed by a traditional dance performance.This is to represent the interface between the animate and the inanimate. One will also see a blend of German music and traditional Indian dance through the German puppet and its Indian counterpart. It will culminate in a humorous improv act between the German and Indian puppets. The rest is a surprise, laughs Hoskere.She says, We chose to work together because we wanted to present the elements of music and dance. In many ways, we are representing our ancient land and culture and Paul is bringing his influences from Berlin. The show is also a testament to the exquisiteness of the East and the West.Affeld is also a musician and looks to find the common ground between puppetry, theatre, dance and music. He is here for a residency at the Goethe Institut.He says, Puppeteers work differently from actors. One can go into a different body and transform their character in puppetry. In India, puppetry is always linked to a traditional background or mythological stories. Puppeteers weave stories around ancient India, Gods and Goddesses. In Germany, puppetry is treated as a subtext of theatre itself and there are a lot of acting schools which teach the art. There are a lot of people in Germany who are influenced by puppetry and do it there for a living. However, it is difficult for people to accept puppeteers and there is still some prejudice against this art form. Many people still say that puppets are meant for children. Affeld makes his own figurines, starting from the cast to finally adorning them. It is always interesting for me to see how we are always transforming over time. Puppetry helps us bring out our personalities in simple, subtle ways.Hoskere compares puppetry and other traditional art forms to sunlight, a force that is constant and one which sustains life. The fusion puppet show will take place on May 13, 7 pm, at Numa, Church Street."

Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."

He was preparing to fly another. His father Abhay Pawar who motivated his son to take it up as a hobby was quick to add that he has been flying these vehicles since he was six and a half years old. I did not want my children to become couch potatoes nor be addicted to iPad and PlayStation all day long. I picked it up to help them learn, he added.Amphibian aircraftBesides the ones that were out for demonstration, there were many UAVs on display. The amphibian aircraft, that can take off from land and water, was among them.

Last week, one kilogram of tomato was priced at Rs 15, but now it is available at Rs 8 and even Rs 5 in the market.He said the main reason for the low prices was the increase in the arrival of vegetables.Last year, there was a decrease in the crop arrivals and hence the prices had gone up. For consumers, it is a good news this time, but for farmers it is a loss.G M Diwakar from SKR Market Traders Association said it was just the beginning of summer season and there were chances of veggie prices doubling in the next four months.Generally, the prices increase between April and July. Last year, there was no rainfall and hence the prices had increased. It takes three months for crop yield and this time, there has been sufficient rainfall. But when the actual summer sets in, then the prices may increase."

Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait. The aspirati-ons of a billion people also cant.(The writer is a technocrat and a small-scale entrepreneur based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh)"
5923f6b27be9e01fcef0862d,"For want of water, crops on 9,000 acres may wilt",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/572648/for-want-water-crops-9000.html,2016-09-26,,Deccan Herald,"For want of water, crops on 9,000 acres may wiltVijesh Kamath, Hassan, Sep 27, 2016, DHNS 1:12 ISTFarmers in Hassan suffer as advisory not to take up sowing came lateFarmers of Arkalgud and Holenarsipur taluks in the district, who are dependent on the Cauverys tributary Hemavathi, were advised in August not to go in for sowing this season.The Hemavathi Right Bank Canal is the lifeline for agriculture to these taluks. The advisory came from the government as the water level in the Hemavathi reservoir at Gorur was barely sufficient for drinking needs. Such advisories should have been issued by the government to farmers in June itself. By the time the government realised that it can no way provide water for irrigation while allowing releasing Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, it was too late.While some farmers had already begun sowing activities by June-July itself, some ignored the advisory and took up sowing. Water was released into the canal for filling tanks and multi-village drinking water schemes between August 12 and September 16. But the quantum was insufficient for cultivation which requires four months of water supply.The result: Nearly 9,000 acres of standing crops including paddy, maize, ginger and sugarcane among others will be lost in Arkalgud alone.In an interaction with this reporter, Yoga Gowda, a farmer of Byachanahalli in the taluk who owns four acres said he ignored the advisory and went in for sowing paddy as he was badly in need of agricultural income. Today, he stands to lose around Rs 80,000 he spent on sowing and fertilizers. (On an average, an acre yields around 20 quintals of paddy in the Cauvery basin).I took the risk as I have no other source of income. I was hoping that rains would come to my rescue. But, today I have lost everything, Yoga Gowda said. The water level in the Hemavathi reservoir on Monday stood at around seven tmcft of which only 3.303 tmcft can be utilised as the rest is dead storage. The total capacity of the reservoir is 37.103 tmcft.In the neighbouring Holenarsipur taluk, farmers are facing a similar plight. Kumar of Ankanahalli village stands to lose his potato crop on a half-acre-plot. The plants have already dried up and his investment of Rs 15,000 on seeds and fertilizers has been lost.Our crops are wilting in front of us and we are helpless. Water that could have saved at least some portion of our crops has flowed into Tamil Nadu during the last few weeks.It is a good thing that water release to the neighbouring state has been stopped, he said.There are many Yoga Gowdas in the Hemavathi achcut (command) area. The plight of farmers, by and large, is same in all villages, be it Hassan or Mandya. They do not have much hope left for this season because the monsoon has receded."
5923f80b7be9e01fcef087b3,'Alert on water shortage came after sowing began',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573742/alert-water-shortage-came-sowing.html,2016-10-03,,Deccan Herald,"'Alert on water shortage came after sowing began'Vijesh Kamath, October 03, 2016, Tumakuru/Hassan, DHNS 1:38 ISTFarmers in the Cauvery basin, who are staring at losing their standing crops, seem to have lost trust in the administrative machinery and officials.They blame the government for not alerting them on time that they should not go in for sowing this season. They say neither the Water Resources nor the Agriculture department officials visited their villages to guide or advise them.Interaction with a cross-section of farmers in the districts of Tumakuru and Hassan for whom the Cauvery River and its tributaries form the lifeline, reveals that there was gross failure of the communication machinery of the government.Low storage levels in the four reservoirs in the Cauvery basin - Hemavathi, KRS, Harangi and Kabini - prompted the government to stop release of water for agriculture in August. But, by that time majority of the farmers had already commenced sowing.G N Krishnamurthy, a farmer of Gangura in Holenarasipura taluk in Hassan district said he went in for sowing paddy and potato in his two-acre plot in June, something he has been practicing for the last 36 years. His plot falls at the 31st km point of the Hemavathi Right Bank Canal starting from the Hemavathi dam.Noticing water flow in the canal, we stated sowing. Nobody told us that water will not be supplied for agricultural purposes. No official visited us, he says. His neighbour G Ramu agrees with him. We were neither told not to depend on rains. There is no way out for us even for those with borewell acess as groundwater has totally depleted, he says.Subbaraya Gowda, executive engineer, Hemavathi dam, Holenarisipura Zone, says an advisory that water will not be supplied for agricultural purposes was issued on time. Asked the date on which the advisory was issued, Gowda said he will have to check the register. Upstream in Arakalgud taluk, farmers of Byachanahalli point out that water was released in the canals between August 12 and September 17.The Water Resources department had meant that the water was to fill up tanks for drinking water purpose under multi-village scheme. There was no channel of communication with the farmers, who utilised the water for cultivation . The result: the fields in Byachanahalli still look green. But it is deceptive, the crops will wilt within a week.Being at the tail-end of the Hemavathi Left Bank canal, the distributory canals in Gubbi taluk of Tumkuru district remained dry last year. However, rains had come to their rescue. This year with 49% deficit rainfall, farmers who had sowed especially maize and jowar have already lost their crops.Mahalingaiah of Vadaluru village in the taluk said there were no alerts about deficient rainfall nor that they should abstain from agriculture.Majority of the farmers are now unemployed and spending the money they have saved. They are dependent on foodgrains provided under the Anna Bhagya scheme.However, the interaction with farmers brought out an interesting facet - they do not want crop compensation, water is more precious to them. Doddappa, a farmer said there is nothing more miserable than witnessing crops wilt. It is like our children passing away in front of us. Money cant compensate our losses, he says."

The teams will travel to Chitradurga, Ballari, Koppal, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri, Davangere, Ramanagaram, Chamarajnagar, Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya, Tumakuru, Chikkaballapur, Kolar and Bengaluru Rural districts. The teams will have a wrap-up meeting in Bengaluru on Saturday. The panel will later submit a report to the Centre.In a pre-visit presentation before the panel on Wednesday, state government officials pointed out that Karnataka was facing drought for the sixth consecutive year. It was pointed out that buoyed by good rains during June, kharif cultivation was taken up briskly by farmers.The good rainfall received during June and July was offset by deficit rainfall during August and September. The rainfall deficit was 72% in south interior Karnataka and 36% in Malnad during September.The deficient rains resulted in poor inflows into major reservoirs. In the presentation, it was pointed out that major agriculture crops grown during kharif primarily included green gram, black gram, tur dal, groundnut, jowar, soyabean, maize and cotton.Prolonged continuous dry spell in drought-hit taluks resulted in crop loss estimated at Rs 11,051 crore. Horticulture crops such as onion, potato, chilli, perennial and plantation crops like pomegranate, mango, coconut and arecanut were also severely affected due to moisture stress.Horticulture crops on as much as 1.89 lakh hectares have been affected and crop loss is estimated at Rs 1,094 crore."
