The people must be able to procure essential items at reasonable prices and towards this end, trade and business organisations must lend a helping hand by keeping a tight leash on prices, he said.Sonowal asked business organisations and wholesale dealers about the stock and availability of essential commodities and wholesale and retail prices. He said the wholesale dealers must strictly conform to the strictures of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department.""Wholesale dealers have equal responsibility towards the people as that of the government. By maintaining a close rapport with the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, the businessmen have to keep the prices under check,"" he added.He asked the department and the wholesale dealers to ensure that there was no scarcity of essential commodities in view of the flood situation in the state. Minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Rihon Daimari made it clear that businessmen would have to keep prices under check in tune with the guidelines of the department.Daimari apprised Sonowal of the slew of initiatives taken by his department to control prices of essential commodities by holding discussions with trade and business organisations.The meeting was attended, among others, by representatives of Chambers of Commerce, fruits and vegetables, potato and onion and egg wholesale dealers."
58fef9a77be9e0420db2a861,"Rain whips up tomato, potato price",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160709/jsp/jharkhand/story_95578.jsp,2016-07-09,"A vendor sells precious tomatoes in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Friday. Picture by Hardeep Singh This week, Ranchi vegetable customers are moving around markets with long faces and half-empty bags. Reason? Heavy rains of last weekend have damaged a bulk of local potato and tomato crops, hiking their retail prices to Rs 24 and Rs 50 per kilo, respectively. Members of Pandra Bazar Samiti, the wholesale hub in Ranchi, said wholesale prices of potato and tomato are Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kilo. ""Water-logging in farms has destroyed both crops,"" said horticulture scientist of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) K.K. Jha. Explaining why, he said: ""The recent heavy rains led to water-logging in poorly drained farms. So, potatoes rotted underground. Heavy downpour tore tomato skins and lack of sunlight led to their getting fungus."" Bhuidih, Mandar and Itki in Ranchi district, Gumla, Simdega and Hazaribagh are the state's tomato bowls. A bulk of potatoes are brought from Bengal, but the tuber also grows in Ratu, Ormanjhi, Pithoria, Namkum and other places in Ranchi. Imports from Bengal had also reduced drastically since monsoon picked up steam, rued a Ranchi wholesale trader Naresh Sahu, saying compared to last week's two trucks, only one came this week. BAU scientist Jha stressed it was possible to save tomatoes from tearing or fungus. ""Growing tomatoes in polyhouses in a controlled environment will enable them to survive heavy monsoon, but then, only a fraction of Jharkhand's tomatoes are grown that way. More farmers need to adapt to progressive ways,"" he stressed. Raj Kumar, MD of Jharkhand State Agriculture Marketing Board, added another valid point. ""We need cold storage for perishable items so that the produce we get is kept properly. So far, a few private ones have come up at Bero, Ormanjhi and other places, but we can't monitor them. The situation will improve when our 5,000 metric tonne cold storage comes up in Pandra,"" he said. But for now, the scene at Lalpur vegetable market, one of Ranchi's largest retail hubs, is dismal. A vendor had stocked 5kg of tomatoes against the 20kg. ""Due to heavy rain, the local tomato crop is damaged,"" rued Munna Oraon, when asked why there were so few tomatoes. ""I brought 5kg tomatoes from Bero farmers but that too is of poor quality,"" he admitted. Potato vendor Lokesh in Lalpur said he was selling them for Rs 24 a kilo. ""Last week, it was Rs 18 per kilo. But, what to do when supply is so poor? Our margins are thin."" Homemakers are feeling the pinch. ""I'm substituting fresh tomatoes with ketchup and using less potatoes in subzi,"" Lalpur homemaker Anju Saxena said. ""French fries are out of the menu for the time being."" But, scientist Jha had a word of hope. ""New cropping is on at tomato and potato hubs. By September, Ranchi customers can expect the duo at affordable prices,"" he said."
58fefc1f7be9e0420db2ac26,Will the Sylheti paradox be solved?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/opinion/story_102933.jsp,2016-08-18,"There was a time, just a few years ago, when recent events in Bangladesh were a cause for celebration. After decades of famine and war and natural disaster, the country had achieved the longest life expectancy and the lowest fertility rate in South Asia. From 1990 to 2010, the rate of infants who suffered an early death fell by more than half. Over 90 per cent of tuberculosis cases were being cured. Long series in The Lancet and The Economist expressed admiration and wonder at these transformations. The latter compared contemporary Bangladesh to Meiji Japan, which enacted ""the most dramatic period of improvement in human health in history."" This progress remains incomplete. Bangladesh is still one of the most malnourished places in the world. Well over a third of the country's children are ""stunted"", the technical term for being intensely and chronically undernourished. The sundry permanent effects include a lifelong reduced cognitive capacity. Within Bangladesh, child stunting is worst in the northeastern division of Sylhet, where Helen Keller International has reported the rate to be fully 50 per cent. I recently travelled to Sylhet with HKI, one of the foreign NGOs combating malnutrition there. Around 20 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Habiganj, and beyond the outskirts of the town of Nabiganj, I visited three remote villages struggling with extreme malnutrition. Every last child in the area I met had the underdeveloped bodies, and particularly the skinny arms, that are the telltale signs of stunting. In other respects as well, Madhobpur, Manderkandi and Sreemotpur seem to epitomize rural South Asian poverty. The cows are skinny and sickly; medical clinics lack electricity; the local water has as much as 100 times the safe limit of arsenic. So it was a jarring moment when a bunch of children saw my group approach and produced smartphones to photograph their visitors (picture, above). Globalization had brought advanced mobile operating systems, but not adequate protein. This was evidence of the contradictory nature of development in Bangladesh more generally. Sylhet is a relatively rich district with, reportedly, Bangladesh's worst stunting rate; the southwestern district of Khulna, conversely, has one of the highest poverty rates in the country and also one of the lowest stunting rates. ""'The Sylheti paradox' is what we call it in our office,"" said Nicolas Syed, a United Nations official working on rural poverty in Bangladesh. The Sylheti paradox is a measure of the degree to which standard metrics of development and positive social outcomes may be disconnected. On the one hand, the remarkable success of Bangladesh in improving the well-being of its citizens has been strikingly detached not only from nutrition but also from economic growth, which has not been as dramatic as the health statistics suggest. The Economist pointed out that the average Bangladeshi lives four years longer than the average Indian, even while Indians are twice as rich. In explaining many of the most basic improvements in the everyday lives of Bangladeshis, wealth seems curiously tangential. The miserable health of Sylhetis exemplifies exactly what money alone may not bring. An enterprising people once known as sailors, the Sylhetis were reported by The Guardian to make up 95 per cent of the Bangladeshi population in the United Kingdom. In both New York and London, a vast majority of ""Indian"" restaurants are actually run by Bangladeshi Sylhetis. A great deal of the money made by Sylhetis abroad returns to their homeland. Twenty years ago, Habiganj lacked phones and roads; it used to take one or two days of travel by foot or boat just to reach an adjacent upazila, or county. When I stayed in the city a few months ago, my new hotel offered free WiFi, and I experienced no trouble driving from place to place. Yet these advancements have had surprisingly little effect on the health and diet of most Sylhetis. Sylhet is full of haors, floodplains underwater for so long that even well-maintained gardens often don't last over half the year. Many locals live on little hills surrounding the haors, which means they have trouble receiving basic services every year when their home becomes an island. Meanwhile the dense, tropical soil in Sylhet is not well-suited to agriculture, and a lack of crop rotation has led to a dire nitrogen deficiency. Culturally, Sylhet has a long history of religiosity and conservatism. Shah Jalal, the preacher who spread Islam in Bengal in the 13th and 14th centuries, lived in Sylhet, and his tomb is an important site for pilgrims. According to research cited by the Asian Development Bank, 60 per cent of Sylhetis pray daily, as compared to 35 per cent countrywide. In 2004 and 2005, Sylhet faced multiple Islamist terror attacks. Both religious and social conservatism have had a negative effect on the health of Sylhetis. As in other South Asian cultures, women tend to eat at the end of meals, after the men and children have their fill, leaving poor women only meagre leftovers. During my visit to Manderkandi, a leader of HKI's garden program named Chaiti was showing off her chickens. After a few minutes, one of her male in-laws, Shamanandha Vattacharjo, nudged her out of the way to take over the tour. The economist, Binayak Sen, among others, has demonstrated the strong correlation between female empowerment and nutrition in Bangladesh. Khulna, the poorer yet healthier district, also boasts a much higher level of female education than Sylhet. This link between female empowerment or education and family nutrition is evident in villages all over the district of Habiganj. According to local HKI officials, some of whom are from the area, many pregnant women refuse to eat protein out of fear that their babies will grow too big and make for an uncomfortable childbirth. Once born, children frequently do not receive sufficient breastfeeding for the first six months of their lives. The better-educated mothers of Khulna ensure that their children have notably diverse diets; in Sylhet, the lack of adequate breast milk is only one way in which babies and infants are deprived of essential nutrients. Until their teeth are strong enough, for example, children are not fed the small fish that Sylhetis eat whole, bones and all. In Manderkandi, Vattacharjo told me that these fish, caught in a muddy pond nearby, have been the area's only source of protein. Many of the relatively wealthier residents of Habiganj city suffer from similarly skewed diets. I had a glimpse of the city's eating habits at the restaurants Sky Queen Chinese and Mango, which is brand new and maintains an active Facebook page. Neither restaurant served a single dish with a healthy amount of vegetables, and most orders came with only scraps of protein. Across Bangladesh, malnourishment is not only a problem for the lower class: in the wealthiest quintile of society nationally, 21 per cent of children were underweight in 2010, according to The Lancet. If economic development is not solving malnutrition in Sylhet, what can? During my visit, I saw numerous ways in which NGOs improve the health of Sylhetis through modest interventions. (Here I should state an interest: an old friend of mine works for Helen Keller International, and I travelled with her to Sylhet, where HKI set up its project to combat malnutrition last year.) Not everyone in Bangladesh views foreign NGOs in the benevolent way they view themselves. Their strength and size have drawn criticism from those who charge that they disregard the national government as well as local power structures, leading to grassroots resistance, waste and NGOs exaggerating their achievements. The anthropologist, Lamia Karim, has argued that NGOs co-opted Bangladesh's intelligentsia and the allegiance of its poor, defanging overtly political left-wing resistance to the inequalities of the country. More troublingly, many of the recent terror attacks in Bangladesh have specifically targeted foreign citizens, including Japanese aid workers at the Holey Artisan Bakery and an Italian aid worker out for a jog. These killings may already be achieving their desired effect. ""They are leaving,"" Jillian Waid, leader of HKI's local research unit, wrote me of her fellow NGO expats. The United States Agency for International Development and Britain's Department for International Development have both, according to Waid, withdrawn their employees with families. Waid herself, who has worked in Bangladesh for the past seven years, now intends to get out soon. On my trip, I saw examples of the substantial small-scale help that has been provided over the years by foreign groups like HKI, Save the Children, and USAID, all of which are fighting malnutrition in Sylhet. In each village I visited, new gardens were producing nutritious vegetables such as okra and bitter gourd (picture, above). Where white-fleshed sweet potato has been common, HKI was helping to introduce a much healthier orange-fleshed sweet potato in its stead. The organization was also trying to popularize kangkong, a spinach that grows even in the watery soil of the haors. In Madhobpur, HKI had staged a test in which three separate plots showed the results of planting using the village's customary methods alongside two different natural fertilizers introduced by HKI. The difference was stark: large plants had grown in the second two plots, while the first was nearly bare. Popy Rani, a village mother who told me she had initially been sceptical of HKI, said she was persuaded to set up her own new garden after looking at the flourishing plants of a neighbouring village. HKI has led many other initiatives: classes on breast-feeding and preparing children well-rounded meals, for instance (picture, above), and financial help and instruction with poultry farms. The most concrete symbol of the potential of its efforts is the humble ""tippy-tap"". This is a plastic bottle tied to a post at an angle so that, if the top is unscrewed, air pressure causes a stream of water to pour out through a hole at the bottom of the bottle. The rest of the time, when the top is screwed on, the bottle retains its water. The tippy-tap is, in effect, a home-made faucet. In Sreemotpur, nobody used to wash their hands because of all the water wasted by pouring it out from a bucket. Now, a bar of soap and a tippy-tap stand at the centre of the village as basic tools of everyday life. In 1974, Bangladesh was a brand new state facing a famine while its government teetered on the brink of collapse. International aid shot up, and Bangladesh welcomed foreigners who said they wanted to improve the lives of Bangladeshis in ways the shaky government could not. The significance of aid efforts launched from abroad have since been surpassed by domestic groups, especially Grameen Bank and BRAC, which have collectively acquired well over 10 million microfinance borrowers. Grameen has also founded the country's leading telecommunications service, with over 56 million subscribers, while BRAC has established 400 legal aid centres and over 22,000 primary schools. Grameen and BRAC are not going anywhere anytime soon. Still, in places such as Sylhet, neither market forces nor the State and its domestic surrogates have supplied some of the basic necessities of a good life. Foreign NGOs bring expertise, initiative, and funding that are intensely needed. As murderous attacks on aid workers grow more frequent, the continuation of their work is imperiled. Bangladesh is on its way to providing unprecedented good health to a wide array of its citizens - but much more remains to be done. These are the stakes for a country whose violent fringe is beginning to drive the rest of the world away."
58feff7c7be9e0420db2b144,The importance of questioning the message,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160802/jsp/opinion/story_99957.jsp,2016-08-02,"Literacy today does not imply just the ability to read and write. It implies the ability to think critically about all the communications that reach us in different forms including images and sound-bites. As educators today, we are called upon to deal with multiple literacies concerning medical, consumption, computer, financial and so on. But media literacy is what I wish to focus on just now. Media literacy indicates the ability to sift through, analyse and apply critical thinking skills to messages that inform, entertain and sell to us every day, round the clock. Perhaps it would be more accurate to use the term, ""media and information literacy"". The term, ""information"", is especially important in current times, in view of the number of young people being influenced and converted through information over the internet. For some years now, children have had access to all kinds of information and have been the recipients of all kinds of messages. The fall out is that either their minds are invaded or their pockets - rather, their parents' pockets. By the time they reach their teens our children would have spent thousands of hours in front of the television, surfing the net, playing video games, listening to recorded music or engaged in socializing on the internet. It is evident that their understanding of the world around them - which they seem totally oblivious of at times - does not come from other human beings but from the media. Although our children have almost unlimited access to information we tend to agree with the general belief that they are quite ignorant about the real world, that children of the information age watch more and know less but feel as if they know more. One of the reasons why they appear to know less is that since information is so easily available they do not feel the need to process the information deeply enough. This reminds me of an applicant for a teaching job who on being asked a very simple conceptual question replied that she knew the answer when she was preparing for her MA examination but had forgotten it since and would have to look up her notes. Clearly, this person had not assimilated the concept in question. She had merely learned it for an exam and had consequently not been able to retain it in her memory after that. A senior scientist friend had lamented once that these days the purpose of learning had been reduced to doing well in exams. There are several problems with regard to the abundance of information that is accessible to all and the undesirable nature of some of it. While educators are concerned about helping students sift, validate and process the information that is available, parents worry about the dangers of the cyber world, about the impact of sex and violence, and the risks involved in the interactive nature of social networks. But also, there is an urgent need to look out for stereotyping, gender biases, inaccuracies and questionable value judgments that come across ever so often. It is futile to try and control the onslaught of the media or to try and protect our children from them. The media are all-pervasive - the sides of buses and trams, backlit hoardings, television, radio, newspapers, magazines, flyers, banners, slogans on carry-bags and messages on t-shirts - you just cannot avoid the exposure. Nor can you screen them. In these circumstances the best strategy would be to teach children to engage with the media sensibly and intelligently. This way their critical thinking skills would be honed, they would learn to ask pertinent questions and they would develop the qualities of a responsible citizen. They will soon learn to interpret the cryptic messages on their friends' t-shirts and decide what messages they themselves wish to spread. Incidentally, I have often wondered why people wear offensive, rude and sometimes obscene pieces of writing or images across their chests. And worse, why do parents make helpless toddlers sport t-shirts with ridiculous slogans like ""I am cuter than your kid"" or ""My mom is hotter than yours"". By learning to process all information, the chances of young minds being influenced, manipulated or brain-washed would be considerably reduced. The last is vital today in view of the large scale ""radicalization"" that is taking place with chilling consequences. Hate speeches, rhetorical grandstanding, fiery pronouncements and the biased reporting of events are leading to a climate of intense intolerance. No matter what is done to maintain vigilance in the virtual world, it is in the real world that these issues must be tackled. So, the earlier we begin the likelier that peace will have a chance. When media literacy was first introduced in our school a few years ago, it was partly to address an increasingly consumerist society. The recognition of the power of children to influence the buying decisions of the family had led to them being made the chief targets of corporate selling. Children successfully nagged their parents into buying the things they desired. It was also observed that clever advertising lured them into certain behavioural paths such as eating junk food or throwing tantrums to get adults in the family to buy them the latest gizmos or toys. It is children who increasingly decided on the brand of toothpaste, shampoo, cereal or potato chips to be bought, and they even played an important role in selecting the new family car. In the recently released book Nawabs, Nudes, Noodles, the author, Ambi Parameswaran, says that ""as India changes, its advertising will also change and become a force multiplier. That is the power of advertising."" So we thought that if we taught children to ""question the message"" appropriately they would not only become responsible consumers but they would also develop the habit of not accepting any message passively. We were also concerned about the images of masculinity and of the 'perfect' female body, of fair skin and silky hair that were being constantly projected. We wanted our children to know the truth behind these images and to tell them about air-brushing and Photoshopping and to look out for biases and inaccuracies. The set of questions we had in mind were: Who is the message for and who wants to pass on this message and why? Have they left out anything I should know? How have they grabbed my attention? Do pictures always tell the truth? Have I been influenced by marketing strategies and powerful ""hidden persuaders""? Our domestic help, Jamuna, gets really annoyed with marketing gimmicks which she terms chalaki byabsha or ""clever business tricks"". She is not formally educated nor is she media savvy or consumer literate, yet she does not get taken in by the free bowl that is given with the package of detergent powder or by the attractive packaging or by the ploy of enticing the customer to buy three articles for the price of two. She is especially wary of extra-large containers that turn out to be only one-third full and she has learnt to look at the weight and the MRP marked on the packet and is able to compare different branded products by working out the unit price. Impressively, she is also suspicious of the terms, ""new"" and ""improved"". She firmly believes that these words were yet another of those business tricks to deceive the customer - ""What is 'new'?"" she protests, ""they are selling us the same stuff in a dressed-up box."" This reminds me of a ""new"" or ""latest"" edition of a textbook, which, on closer examination, is found to have added just one new poem or rewritten chapter. I find Jamuna far more informed, aware and canny than many educated people when it comes to buying consumables or even responding to news. All parents want their children to be abreast of current affairs. As far as the school is concerned, general awareness is an intrinsic part of education. The old method of reading out newspaper headlines in class does not work anymore as reporting styles have changed drastically and children have to be taught afresh what is meant by news. Some of the questions to ask children pertain to the difference between news and entertainment, the meaning of infotainmentand the meaning of tabloidization. Here too, they must look out for biased reporting and find out the political leanings of the owner of the newspaper, magazine or news channel. Our senior students know that business houses and political parties try to gain control over print and electronic media. They are old enough to understand the question of vested interests and what happens when the advertiser is the main source of revenue. They are well aware that dailies and news channels owned by political parties are likely to be blatantly one-sided in their reporting. Media literacy is not media bashing. Children can be taught to construct their own mass media with themes like ""Save Water"" or ""Do not Honk"". Through such activities they will learn the importance of the media. Media and information literacy is an essential form of literacy for the 21st century. It should not be regarded as an additional subject but must be woven seamlessly in the school curriculum in such a manner that students will apply their critical skills to every message and every bit of information that they are exposed to. It is hoped that through this sort of education they will also question their textbooks as well as their teachers and, most important, they will question the right of others to impose their beliefs on them.

58ff00777be9e0420db2b2be,Message to Cong in Modi salute to Rao,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160629/jsp/nation/story_93856.jsp,2016-06-29,"New Delhi, June 28: Narendra Modi today began his day with a laudatory tweet on P.V. Narasimha Rao. The Prime Minister said: ""Tributes to Shri PV Narasimha Rao on his birth anniversary. He led India at a crucial time and his leadership was both notable and vital."" With that post, Modi stamped his approval on the BJP's ongoing project to appropriate another Congress leader who was not a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family and make its point that the Congress was an alibi for a dynasty and not democracy and, therefore, had no place in India. Historically, the BJP has had a love-hate relationship with Rao, a political enigma of sorts who never clearly revealed his stance on Hindu-Muslim relations. The BJP's co-option of Rao was characterised by symbols and political pragmatism. On March 31 this year, the Modi regime announced its decision to build a memorial ghat for the late Prime Minister at Delhi's Ekta Sthal Samadhi Complex, adjacent to the site housing Jawaharlal Nehru's memorial. The reason given was he was entitled to state honours as a former Prime Minister and the ""harbinger of economic liberalisation"". As Rao and Manmohan Singh, who was his finance minister, unrolled economic reforms to pull the country out of a crisis precipitated by currency over-evaluation, fiscal imbalances and balance of payments' issues, the BJP had initially piped in with the Left to oppose his measures. The BJP's opposition to opening up the economy was encapsulated in a slogan coined by the RSS's swadeshi hardliners - ""Yes to computer chips, no to potato chips"". A way of saying that FDI in technology was acceptable but not in processed food. Economics was not the BJP's only plank to confront Rao. It had moved a no-confidence motion against his government after the demolition of the Babri mosque in December 1992. BJP veteran L.K. Advani, aided by jurist Ram Jethmalani, had accused Rao of accepting a ""one crore rupees bribe"" from stockbroker Harshad Mehta. Jethmalani arraigned him in other cases and nearly got him behind bars in the Lakhubhai Pathak fraud case. The BJP sharpened its talons even more when Rao tried to hit back at its leaders with the hawala case, based on the names of prominent politicians that figured in the diaries maintained by ""hawala brokers"" Jain brothers. These politicians had received payoffs from the Jains. Among the alleged recipients was Advani, who helmed the party at that time and was also an MP. A special court directed the CBI to frame charges against him. The revelation forced Advani to resign from Parliament and vow that he would not contest another election until his exoneration. Although Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been declared the BJP's prime-ministerial candidate before the hawala scam broke, the party's rank and file idolised Advani who had led the Ram rath yatra. Advani was subsequently acquitted but the Rao strike had wounded the BJP deep enough for it to harbour a grouse against him for a long time. Vajpayee charted a different course on Rao. Despite knowing he was pitted against Rao in the 1996 elections, he invited Rao to release his book of poems in the run-up. A photograph depicting the rivals together adorned the wall of Vajpayee's home. He acknowledged then: ""Whatever be our political differences, he is a scholar and he was the first to grasp the most significant of my poems."" It was called Geet naya gaata hoon (I sing a new song). The BJP's voyage of discovery of Rao's ""virtues"" coincided with two developments: the former Prime Minister's ignominious fade-out from the Congress and the rise of Sonia Gandhi and the BJP's embrace of economic liberalisation. The Congress's shoddy treatment of Rao after his death was grist to the BJP's campaign. In 2013, Modi took it on himself to tell the Congress to ""take lessons"" from Rao on how to run the country at a public meeting in Delhi because he claimed like Vajpayee, Rao had ""robust common sense"". More encomiums flowed. In February 2014, Arun Jaitley, then the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader, described Rao's regime as the ""turning point"" for India's economy while releasing a book, ModiNomics by Sameer Kochhar. Rao will shortly get enshrined in the BJP's pantheon of Congress greats that already include Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Madan Mohan Malviya and Lal Bahadur Shastri."

The industry has also tried to convey the need for a comprehensive policy for the sector.In a meeting with Bengal labour minister Moloy Ghatak, ahead of the state budget, members of the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) sought administrative support on stamp duty waiver on land registration and the settlement of dispute regarding land revenue payment.""The meeting with the labour minister was primarily to apprise him of the present situation of the industry, the problems related to raw jute availability and the lack of procurement orders in the mills,""an IJMA member said.""We have also informed the minister that the industry is geared up to meet the requirements of the state for packing rice and potato using jute bags based on good estimates of raw jute in the next crop year. Issues related to wage settlement have also been brought to his notice.""Jute mills in the state have to compete with imports from Bangladesh and Nepal as well as used jute bags.

58ff0b537be9e0420db2bd0a,Potato factory flop cloud on polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160430/jsp/bengal/story_83096.jsp,2016-04-30,"Calcutta, April 29: The Bengal government has recently abandoned its proposed potato wafer processing unit in Hooghly's Sheoraphuli after no private company showed interest in the project, leaving the ruling party in a soup ahead of elections. ""The fate of the proposed unit was never bright but the final decision was taken a few months ago.... The project could have helped us in the elections if it had taken a proper shape, but we could not do it because of lack of proper planning,"" a minister told The Telegraph. Eighteen Assembly segments in Hooghly will vote on April 30. According to sources at Nabanna, the government had floated an expression of interest inviting private partners to set up the unit under a public-private partnership in 2013. As none of the established private companies came forward, the project was abandoned at the end of 2015. Government sources said no private investor showed interest in developing the processing unit for two reasons - lack of a suitable variety of potato and ban on contract farming in the state. The potato processing units prefer the Chipsona potato to make wafers but in Bengal, priority is given to the table variety potatoes such as Jyoti and Pukhraj. ""The processing unit would have overcome the problem had there been a scope for contract farming.... But in Bengal, we did not want contract farming and that's why no major processing unit would invest here,"" said a senior government official. The project had initially drawn attention as the unit could have helped around 8 lakh potato farmers of Hooghly. The Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority had released a sum of Rs 8 crore to start the ground work. Senior government officials said the project had the potential to give mileage to the ruling party in Hooghly for two reasons. First, the state government was trying to focus on agro-based industries in the absence of big-ticket investments in the five years of the Mamata Banerjee-led government. If this unit had come up, it would have been seen as a success for the government. Second, it could have helped lakhs of potato farmers in the district who often face trouble in the years when there is surplus production of the tuber. ""In a district where the Tata Nano small-car factory in Singur was abandoned because of Trinamul resistance, the potato wafer processing unit could have been a game-changer for the ruling party,"" said a senior government official. Although, Trinamul had bagged 16 out of 18 Assembly seats in the district in 2011, insiders said the party was facing questions ahead of this year's elections. ""We cannot reply properly when we face questions on why the fate of potato farmers has not changed in the past five years... This unit was important for us to answer this question,"" said a Trinamul leader. Hooghly produces about 25 per cent of the state's average 100 lakh tonnes of potato every year, sources said. The question of the well-being of farmers in Hooghly is important for the ruling party this year as it wants to win all the seats in the district. ""According to reports that we are getting from other districts where elections have already been held, it is clear that we need to win the maximum number of seats in the last two phases on April 30 and May 5 to retain power.... Hooghly is one of the districts that could decide our fate,"" said the minister. As there is little scope for potato processing in the state, farmers face trouble in getting a fair price for their produce whenever there is a glut. ""The state has an annual consumption requirement of 60 lakh tonnes, but we often produce 120 lakh tonnes.... Such huge surplus production cannot be managed by exporting the crop to other states,"" said an official pointing out the necessity of potato processing units in the district. A senior agriculture marketing department official said: ""The government will try to use the funds in other projects such as setting up packaging units or a cold chain project."""

The chief minister will hand over cheques to many of the farmers who had not accepted compensation to protest land acquisition The dais on Durgapur Expressway. Picture by Pradip Sanyal MEETING VENUE On the Calcutta-Durgapur flank of Durgapur Expressway, in front of the main gate of the abandoned Nano project area. WHY HERE This is the spot where Mamata had set up a stage in August 2008 to protest the land acquisition. THE STAGE A 2km stretch of the Durgapur-bound flank from Calcutta has been taken up to build the two-tier stage for Singur Divas. The median divider has also been taken up to create space for the crowd. More than 1.5 lakh people are expected to be present. TRAFFIC Around the meeting venue, the Calcutta-bound flank of Durgapur Expressway has been divided with iron barricades to allow two-way movement of vehicles. The expressway is used by around 30,000 vehicles daily. TIME Mamata is expected to arrive around 4pm. Senior party leaders will come before that. Around 600 unwilling farmers who have applied for compensation will reach the venue by noon. Police said the rally would begin at 4pm and continue till 6pm. It will take at least an hour for the vehicles that will bring participants to disperse. The stage is unlikely to be dismantled on Wednesday. CROWD MANAGEMENT The police said Trinamul supporters would start arriving from 11am. The crowd will be allowed to sit on the road, covered with tarpaulin. Special invitees will be provided green chairs. DIVERSION The police have decided that till 11am, normal vehicular movement will be allowed, although at a slow pace, near the venue because one flank has been taken up by the stage.  After 11am, goods vehicles from Calcutta will be diverted to Delhi Road, which runs parallel to Durgapur Expressway, from Dankuni, 20km from the rally venue.  The vehicles can return to Durgapur Expressway from the Maheswarpur crossing, 10km from the venue, or continue on Delhi Road.  Calcutta-bound goods vehicles will have to take the diversion to Delhi Road from the Maheswarpur intersection. They can return to the expressway from Dankuni.  Private cars and other modes of transport other than goods vehicles will be allowed to use Durgapur Expressway till it is possible. If the crowd swells, cars from Calcutta will have to switch to Delhi Road from Ratanpur More, 3km ahead of the meeting venue.  Cars from Durgapur will have to take the diversion from the Maheswarpur intersection. Report by Kinsuk Basu Singur, Sept. 13: On a September night a decade ago, Dilip Samanta was inside the Singur BDO's office with Mamata Banerjee and many other land protesters demanding that the 400 fertile acres that were acquired ""forcibly"" from farmers be returned. Police had switched off the lights on the premises and lathicharged the 1,200-odd protesters, Dilip said. He had taken blows and fallen down. His motorbike was allegedly seized and kept in the police station for three days. When Dilip walks up to the Singur Divas stage to receive his compensation cheque from Mamata tomorrow, it will be one of his ""biggest moments of triumph"". Dilip, whose 14 bighas are part of the land that is supposed to be returned to the owners in keeping with a Supreme Court order, said: ""I will carry green abir with me. When Mamata Banerjee hands me the cheque, I will throw it in the air. It will be Holi for me and my family and for several others like me."" Dilip, the eldest of three brothers, has taken several loans from a farmers' cooperative society to cultivate potato and rice on the 8 bighas that had not been acquired. The accrued loan amount that he is yet to return is Rs 1.4 lakh. ""I am not sure of the amount I will receive tomorrow. But it won't be less than Rs 26 lakh. We have calculated,"" said Dilip, whose son is a government employee and daughter is married. ""Before the acquisition, we used to grow our own rice. Now, we have to depend on the Rs 2 a kilo rice the government provides,"" he added. Dilip will have to share the compensation amount with his brothers, Sushanta and Jayanta. The priorities of the Samantas are to repair their crumbling house, arrange for the marriage of Sushanta's eldest daughter Riya, a college student, and ensure that Jayanta's school-going daughters, Titli and Tania, do not face any hurdles to their education. ""If the land is made fit for cultivation, we will be able to make a turnaround. We had to sell ornaments to get my daughter married,"" Dilip said. He said when his name would be called tomorrow, he would run up the stairs to the dais. ""The fight to get back our land has finally yielded results,"" he said."

There is one about a few farmers in a nearby village, who sold their land to a corporate and bought the chaar bangle waali car (referring to the Audi logo). Another one concerns a farmer near the Jamnagar district, who sold his land, bought a bike, and even hired a driver to take him around town.If you were willing to listen, farmers in Dholera will tell you more: of those who sold their land for a good price, refurbished their houses and bought shiny new Altos and Scorpios.So why wouldnt they do so too? Because if you lost your land, you would only end up as someones slave. Those who sold their land to the companies are now doing majoori (manual labour) on other peoples farms, or working in factories. The farmer who was once a malik (owner), is now taking a dabba (lunch box) and going to work every day, says Roop Sang Bhai of Sarasla village in Dholera.Labourers work on Togubha Dilubha Chudasma's land holding where they earn Rs 200 per day. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Money cannot be eaten, residents of Sarasla insist. The cars are standing stationary, the bike chauffeurs have turned unaffordable, and the promised jobs either didnt come, or didnt pay well, they lament. Villages nearby are full of those who have been ruined after selling their land to industries. The khet (fields) has always given us enough to eat. So why should we give it away? asks Roop Sang, echoing the sentiment of the group in the Sarasla cotton field.In the 22 villages of Dholera, the site for the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR), its a question that farmers want to pose to the authority in charge of acquiring land for this project.Like the rest of the country, in the town of Dholera too, land has become the flash point of conflict between its owners and the government. But what makes Dholera different  and a test case for alternative models of acquiring land for industry  is the state governments land pooling policy, as opposed to the contentious one on acquisition.Announced in 2007, the ambitious DSIR project was pitched as a global manufacturing and trading hub, with a smart city and an international airport to boot. It is the first industrial node  there are 24 planned along the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor  that was taken up for development. Touted to be PM Narendra Modis pet project (the CM of Gujarat when it was announced) the DSIR didnt see much activity until last year, when the project received a sanction of Rs 2,784 crore from the central government.Watch | Farmers explain the problem in DholeraThe funds, or the lack thereof, however, seem to be not the only hurdle that the project is up against. In December 2015, the state High Court ordered a status quo on land acquisition in the DSIR, in response to a petition by a group of farmers under the aegis of the NGO Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) and a local organization, Bhal Bachao Samiti, who are contesting the governments land pooling policy on grounds that it limits the powers of the Panchayat.Its a conflict that DSIR Development Authority (DSIRDA) planners were only hoping to avoid. With the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act, 2013, turning into the proverbial political hot potato and the messy processes of acquisition leading to a face-off between the owners and the government (or, the corporate) in several projects across the country, the alternative of pooling held much promise, policy experts and planners argued.A Smart City hoarding in Dholera. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Land pooling -- at least on paper -- offers the new module of partnership between the owner and the developer. Here, the owner does not lose his property, as opposed to land acquisition, where the sale of land implies loss of all rights for the original owner.Typically, after acquisition, a change in land use (from agricultural to commercial) leads to a rise in the price of the land, often creating enough ground for discontent and resentment among the original owners. For instance, in places such as Gurgaon and Faridabad, where the state government acquired land and transferred it to private developers, theres widespread discontent among land owners who lament that while the developers made huge gains off the land, the farmers were left with a compensation that was incommensurate with the market price of the property anyway.In pooling, however, the premise is that the owners are willing partners who give up their land, and accrue the benefits of development. After the industries come in, roads, schools and hospitals are built up, the owner gets a portion of their land, the price of which has gone up now. The owner can either sell it, or build something of his own on it. Gujarat has always had a progressive policy of acquisition, where farmers get a share in the benefits of industrial development, says noted economist Yoginder K Alagh.So what went wrong in Dholera? The answer lies in the Gujarat SIR Act, 2009, under which the state government can take 50% of the farmers land without compensation, and return the other half at a different site after readjustment. The logic here is that after development of the site, the price of the farmers land would increase, and he would be a direct beneficiary of it. We are only taking barren land anyway, and also planning to give compensation for the 50% land that we are deducting, a senior official from the DSIRDA says.Bhagwanbhai has sold his land holdings and distributed the proceeds from the sale among his children. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)But farmers in Dholera are far from convinced. The best quality of wheat in the country, the Bhaliya, grows here; if it rains moderately, theres good cotton too. We also grow gram and cumin here. How can they say its barren? says Bhagwanbhai, 65, a resident of Sarasla village.The draft Environmental Impact Assessment report for the DSIR maintains the authoritys position on the fertility of the land in the region -- about 40% of land in Dholera is classified asagricultural fallow land, and only 7% is crop land, the report states.However, activists such as Sagar Rabari of GKS refute this claim: More than 60% of land in Dholera is fertile. Agricultural yield in the region amounts to 600-700 kg wheat per acre, and 400-500 per acre in cotton. Here, agriculture is still a profitable enterprise, he insists.Sagar Rabari of Khedut Samaj  Gujarat talks about farmer issues in Ahmedabad. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Farmers in the region second his opinion, and add that if the state government resolved the water scarcity issue, they could plan multiple crops on the same land and enhance their yield by two-fold. The fact that there has been a delay in making that a possibility the delay in the completion of the canal network that will deliver the waters of the Narmada to their fields  is also being perceived by the farmers as a ploy by the government to ensure that they would not hold on to their land.Resistance to the project is further complicated by the mess of land records in the region, an issue that plagues several regions in the country. Take the case of Faljibhai Nagjibhai Bauliya , 38, of Haibatpur village, who claims to have 96 acres of land, of which not even one half is finds mention in the computerised land records of the area.On a crisp cotton sheet spread on a wooden cot in his home in the village of Haibatpur, Faljibhai spreads out a stack of sepia-toned documents to substantiate his claim: land that his father received from the state in 1968 is still not in the computerised land records of the village.The talathi (village revenue secretary) wouldnt do it until we paid up, says Faljibhai.The mess of records can be traced to land reforms in the state, where landless families such as those of Faljibhais father received land under several schemes such as the Land Ceiling Act, the state tenancy law and the central governments Santhani scheme (where government wastelands were redistributed to the landless), explains GKS Sagar.However, he explains that the names of the new owners never made it to the records because of illiteracy, fragmentation of landholdings through the years and corrupt officials.Now, with the DSIRDA planning to take their land for the project, farmers such as Faljibhai are only left wondering how the planners would allot them their rightful share of land after deduction.Armed with information on the SIR Act by NGOs such as GKS, those such as Faljibhai argue that the policy doesnt seem to be working in their favour.For instance, Dholeras farmers argue that shifting to a new plot would imply fresh investments be made on farm infrastructure such as tubewells, and brings with it the question of viability of agriculture in a new place. Some villagers from nearby areas have told us that the new plots for us are being craved out of the saline area near the sea. We are not even educated enough to do much else; if agriculture fails, what are we going to do? asks Faljibhai.The fear of being given fallow and saline plots is predominant among the farmers of Dholera, who trace it to the emergence of real estate brokers in the area. These brokers deal in the sale and purchase of land, often a murky process involving the rich and powerful in the region, and beyond.Faljibhai shows documents of his land which are not acknowledged in the computer records of the authorities. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)It is in this trade and its underlying skewed power equations that farmers such as Faljibhai feel they might lose out. Playing in real estate is not for farmers like us; its for the dalaals (middlemen), he says.Land pooling as a scheme rests on the logic that owners can become entrepreneurs in their own right, but residents of Dholera point to the clause in the SIR Act stating that aside of the development charge that they would have to pay on the new plot, they would need permission from the authority to build something. The new plots that would be given to the farmers would be in specific zones such as IT, entertainment, recreation sports, and if the farmer wanted to build a structure that didnt fall in the zone of his new plot, he would need permission from the development authority.The official from the DSIRDA told HT that in light of the resistance to the project, the authority is willing to negotiate with the farmers and even pay compensation in the lieu of the land deducted to address their concerns: This project will increase job opportunities for the locals, and ensure that they benefit from the development of the region.But in the cotton fields of Sarasla, farmers say that for them, development implied better irrigation facilities for a robust yield.  We dont want the industries at the cost of our livelihood. We will resist this acquisition of our land. Jaan de denge par zameen nahi (we will give up our lives, but not the land), says Roop Sang, as the group standing in his cotton field nods in agreement.But Bhagwanbhai, who is landless now and depends on the trade in cattle feed procured from the fields, stops to correct them: Jaan bhi mat do, aur zameen bhi mat do (Dont give your lives, or your land), he tells them."
58ff1d987be9e0420db2cdc4,Anandi misses list,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/nation/story_103098.jsp,2016-08-18,"New Delhi, Aug. 17: Anandiben Patel today remained a former chief minister. The anticipated ""recompense"" in the form of a Raj Bhavan posting did not come. The former Gujarat chief minister, who demitted office early this month, did not figure among the quartet appointed as governors today, with BJP sources hinting at several reasons for her absence from the list. The four who made it are Najma Heptullah, a former Union minister who has been assigned Manipur; V.P. Singh Badnore, a former Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan who goes to Punjab; Banwarilal Purohit, a former BJP MP from Nagpur and owner of the multi-edition newspaper The Hitavada, who moves to Assam; and Jagdish Mukhi, a Delhi BJP leader who will take charge in Andaman and Nicobar as lieutenant governor. Mukhi, a former professor, had aspired to be projected as the BJP's chief minister candidate in the last Delhi elections but was beaten to it by Kiran Bedi, who has since moved to Puducherry as the Union territory's lieutenant governor. After Anandiben left office as Gujarat's chief minister, BJP circles had expected her to be ""recompensed"" with a gubernatorial post. Sources said there were three reasons why she was not on the list. One, Anandiben had ""refused"" to leave Gujarat that votes in December 2017. She had publicly said so just before resigning as chief minister. A Gujarat BJP source, who made it clear that he was not aligned either with Anandiben or her adversary, party president Amit Shah, claimed the former chief minister was ""lobbying"" for her daughter Anar's induction into the party ""in lieu"" of her forfeiting her post. Anar, who describes herself as a ""social worker"" and an ""entrepreneur"", is alleged to have used the clout she derived from her mother's position to help her business associates set up a company on land near the Gir lion sanctuary, purportedly in contravention of established rules. The case, highlighted in sections of the media, became a hot potato for the BJP after the Congress gunned for Anandiben. It was believed to have precipitated her exit. ""In these circumstances, there is no way that Shah or the Prime Minister will facilitate Anar's entry into the BJP,"" the source said. Although Anandiben is considered a close political associate of Narendra Modi, sources said the Prime Minister had apparently taken a ""grim"" view of the Anar controversy. Since her departure, Anandiben, not exactly known to court publicity, has reportedly kept herself in the news. On August 15, she hoisted the flag at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's headquarters. Tomorrow, on ""Rakshabandhan"", she is scheduled to host a get-together at a school in her Assembly constituency, Ghatlodiya, in Ahmedabad. Two, Anandiben would have to resign as an MLA if she becomes a governor. A by-election will have to be held in her constituency within six months. Sources said the BJP fears that if it loses Ghatlodiya or even retains it by a margin lower than what Anandiben had secured in 2012, it could scale down the morale of party cadres in the run-up to the state polls. Three, the governors of two large states, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, are due to retire by end-August. Both K. Rosaiah (Tamil Nadu) and Ram Naresh Yadav (Madhya Pradesh) were appointed in 2011 by the then UPA government. Sources said it was ""possible"" Anandiben might be sent to one of these states, after BJP leaders take into account the political factors, especially the by-election and the fear that her seat might go to the Opposition."

Tragedy leaves no room for apology or amends. But history is different, as some would like to think, though in the face of some scepticism. Georgetown University in the United States of America has recently apologized to the descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold to pay off the university's debts less than three centuries ago. Being a Catholic institution, it would atone for its sins not only by acknowledgement and apology but also by a series of measures. These would include naming a building after one of the men who were sold and giving preferential treatment for admissions to descendants of those who were enslaved. This is unprecedented in academia. More than a dozen American universities, including Harvard and Brown, have publicly recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. It is no secret that the Codrington Library of All Souls College in Oxford was built with the endowment of a fellow who wanted his plantations in the West Indies to be kept ""intire"" with ""at least three hundred negroes to work the land"". If not slavery, then colonialism and apartheid are inextricable from the history of Cecil Rhodes, on whose munificence a great deal of the glories of Oxford stands, generously partaken of by postcolonial - including Indian - Rhodes Scholars to this day. The historically pragmatic approach to the problem of apologies and amends is to ask in a commonsensical tone, ""So, where does one draw the line?"" Once the whole of the white world begins to return to the rest of the planet the booty of imperialism, what would be left of the lands and riches of Western civilization? Think not only of the United Kingdom, but also of modern America and the nations Down Under. Germany is paying to this day for the sins of its 20th-century atrocities, for who can say that behind Angela Merkel's controversial hospitality towards migrants from the East there isn't working the guilt of the Holocaust taken on from her ancestors? And this crime, in turn, puts a nation like Israel in a difficult spot with millions of killed and displaced Palestinians. Perhaps this is why most of such apologies made in the modern world remain - unlike the one offered by Georgetown University - rhetorical or symbolic gestures, confined to formal public utterances: Tony Blair to Ireland for the Potato Famine of the 1840s, Japan to the Koreans for its wartime ""comfort women"", or Canada to the descendants of the Sikhs aboard the Komagata Maru. Perhaps Elizabeth II, with her characteristically Windsor hard-headedness, did it right at Jallianwala Bagh, 50 years after Independence. She wore a saffron dress, took off her shoes at the memorial, laid a wreath of marigolds, stood silently for 30 seconds, stepped back and bowed her head briefly. She called it a ""difficult episode""; ""but history cannot be rewritten,"" she continued at the state banquet, ""however much we might sometimes wish otherwise."""

Soumen Chatterjee, a resident of Burdwan town, was around 15 minutes away from his sister's house in Jamalpur when his bike hit the truck. The 44-year-old tutor and his son Abhigyan were killed on the spot while the rear tyres of the truck ran over the legs of Soumen's wife. All three were wearing helmets but they came off in the impact of the crash. The accident happened around 9.30am when Soumen was riding down the approach road to the Karalaghat bridge across the Damodar river. The truck, laden with potato seeds, was coming from the opposite direction. Farmer Sheikh Kalam, who was working in a nearby field, said: ""The truck had accelerated as it was moving up the slope of the road. It looked like the driver lost control and the vehicle collided with the bike."" A police officer said: ""The riders were thrown off the motorcycle. Soumen and his son suffered head injuries after hitting the road while the rear tyres of the truck ran over Soumen's wife Mahua's legs."" Alerted by Mahua's screams for help, local people rushed her to Jamalpur block hospital. She was referred to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. The driver and the cleaner of the truck fled the spot, leaving behind the vehicle. Soumen's sister Rekha Chakraborty, a homemaker in her fifties, wouldn't stop crying. ""I was waiting for my brother to come and take Bhai Phonta from me. But I can't believe that I, being the elder sister, could not protect him on Bhai Phonta,"" she sobbed.

58ff220a7be9e0420db2d3e9,Singur topsoil search,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161019/jsp/bengal/story_114326.jsp,2016-10-19,"Calcutta, Oct. 18: The Mamata Banerjee government has launched a search for topsoil - the uppermost fertile layer on arable land - to fill up excavated areas of the abandoned Tata factory in Singur. Work in progress at the abandoned Tata plant site in Singur to return land to farmers ""The district magistrate of Hooghly has been asked to find out if the excavated areas can be filled up with topsoil from somewhere else so that the farmers can start cultivation as soon as the plots are handed over to them. The DM will see if such soil can be made available from nearby areas. If not, he can seek the help of other DMs,"" a government official said. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by the chief minister at Nabanna yesterday, sources said. Government officials had said that 35 per cent of the total 997.11 acres had suffered topsoil loss because it was dug up to make a drainage system, water bodies and to lay roads. According to analysts who had tested samples of the factory soil, cultivation is possible in areas where there has been no construction. The chief minister had yesterday announced that the government would hand over possession of the land to farmers from Thursday. ""Till now, 80 per cent of the land is cultivable.... The government is working to make the other portion arable too,"" she had said. Officials said arranging for topsoil from other areas could prove to be difficult because no farmer would allow the most fertile layer of his plot to be taken away. The top eight inches on any plot is called the topsoil. This part contains organic matter and micro-organisms. ""Taking away the topsoil damages the productivity of any land. As Hooghly is rich in agriculture, the DM might find it difficult to find farmers who would agree to give away the topsoil of the plot,"" an official said. Scientists in the agriculture department said it would better if the government tells the farmers, who own plots where construction has been done, to wait for a few years before starting cultivation. ""These farmers could be given compensation until their plots acquire the fertility,"" a scientist said. A minister told this paper that the government could look for topsoil in coastal areas. But scientists pointed out that as the soil in coastal areas was saline, it would facilitate the growth of only specific crops such as coconuts and cashewnuts. ""Farmers in Singur would look to cultivate paddy and potato that they have been growing traditionally. But soil brought from coastal areas would not be good for such crops,"" a scientist said."

Her husband Devjibhai is too traumatised to put together the story of what happened.Their 22-year-old son was fairly educated and worked as an insurance agent. But he had dared to enter a temple nine years ago, breaking the rules of Ghada. And paid for it. They ran a tractor over him out of revenge. The police were also from their community and did not heed our pleas to consider it murder, alleges Devjibhai.Bhurabhai Parmar, the leader of this Dalit group, says, We protested outside the mamlatdars office for five years. Finally, the mamlatdar and other government officials came to escort us here two years ago, but have not yet built us homes.Babarsinh Vaghela, sarpanch of Ghada at the time the Dalit families left, denies allegations of discrimination and describes Rameshs death as an accident.There was an accident in which the boy died. We tried hard to strike a compromise between the Dalits and the upper castes but they just did not listen. Finally, after the 12th-day ceremony of Rameshs death, they left the village, he says.There is no untouchability in our village, says Vaghela, who was the sarpanch till 2010.But the Dalits allege that discrimination hit them every minute back in Ghada. We could not go with uncovered heads before upper castes, could not wear pants, footwear or any gold. There were two buses to Deesa, at 9 am and 12 noon, from our village. If we got a seat and a darbar got on board in the packed bus, we had to vacate, says Bhurabhai.They had to send separate vessels for their children to have midday meals. Our children were made to sit separately in the anganwadi, too, he says.The worst was when an upper-caste death occurred. We would have to carry the body, collect the firewood and do all the rituals for 12 days for free. Ramesh opposed all these discriminatory practices. His murder was the last straw that provoked us to leave, says Bhurabhai.The few Ghada children who go to school in Sodapur are happier. Ashwin, who studies at the Bhakotar primary school in Class VIII, says everyone eats and studies together.The Ghada Dalits are also grateful to the sarpanch of Sodapur, Amarsinh Dansinh Rajput, who got a resolution passed in the gram panchayat to let them stay.But only I know what I went through to get this done, says Rajput, from the only Rajput family in Sodapur which has a large population of Brahmins, Patels and other OBCs.I needed five signatures in the sabha of nine members. I cajoled and convinced them to endorse it. But later, I got booked in two criminal cases and went to jail for 10 days. In one case, a Patel accused me of loot and I paid Rs 2.65 lakh for a compromise, claims Rajput.He continues to stand by the Dalits, who now total 35 families in this village. There was a police inspector here who was a friend and he asked me if I could give some land to the Ghada Dalits and I agreed. I allotted them two bighas, says Rajput.All of the Sodapur resettlers have EPIC cards and all of them are registered under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA) since 2014, but they say none of them have got any work or wages under it. It is all on paper. We work as labourers  masons or farmers, says Bhurabhai.They are upset with the government for not building them homes, and point to half-built houses on one side of the land assigned to them. They gave us only Rs 45,000 per home of which we spent Rs 10,000 on the landfill itself, says Kaliben, one of the Dalits who moved to Sodapur.Banaskantha collector Jenu Devan says, They were given homes under the Dr Ambedkar Awas Yojana covering two installments, one of which was given. They will get the rest of the installment only after completion of their homes. This is as per the guidelines of the scheme.According to Devan, since the exodus was the result of an accident to Ramesh, it was not considered as migration. Migration is declared by the state government when conditions in the native place are not conducive to return and there is no scope of compromise with the upper castes.While Devan says that one of the Dalit families returned to Ghada, sarpanch Vaghela claims that five families have come back from Sodapur.Kaliben, meanwhile, settles down with three other women to mourn the drowning of her infant grandson in a water tank, a month ago. Their wails, and the mooing of the buffalo, rise over the everyday sounds in the basti.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: August 10, 2016 3:24 am"

58ff30437be9e0420db2e30f,Evolution of Singur,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161021/jsp/bengal/story_114701.jsp,2016-10-21,"(Top) Mamata scatters mustard seeds to symbolise the return of farming in Singur on Thursday. (Above) On November 26, 2006, she had planted potato seeds in the same area to protest the acquisition of land for the Tata car plant. (Pradip Sanyal) Singur, Oct. 20: Mamata Banerjee today scattered mustard seeds to symbolise the return of farming in Singur, a day before her scheduled meeting in New Town with industrialists. Mamata delivered an address of triumph as farming was set to resume on a swathe of land acquired for a Tata car plant 10 years ago. Tomorrow, Mamata will meet businessmen at Eco Park in New Town for a Vijaya Sammilani that is an annual affair, a sequence that underscores the chief minister's compulsions to strike a balance between her pet themes and the demands of governance. At Gopalnagar in Singur today, Mamata said: ""It gives me great joy that Singur is smiling again.... The movement will become an international model for land rights."" In all, 2,216 farmers got documents for 103 acres. Sources in the administration said Gopalnagar was chosen for the first lot for land return because most of the plots that were acquired in this area were untouched in the intervening 10 years and returning land from here was easier. Trinamul leaders such as Haripal MLA Becharam Manna, however, said Gopalnagar was chosen as it was the first site of acquisition for the factory in 2006. Mamata said the government had already made 931 acres out of the total 997.11 acres arable and 10,436 farmers would get their land by November 10, 33 days before the Supreme Court set deadline of November 23. ""Singur teaches us that we should never run from a fight and that rights are not served to you on a platter. You have to snatch them,"" Mamata said, before scattering the mustard seeds on their plots. Mustard, according to agriculture minister Purnendu Bose, was chosen because it is a dry season now. Mustard cultivation, he said, does not require major irrigation as slightly moist land is enough. CPM central committee member Mohammad Salim questioned the reason for such celebration. ""What was she celebrating? The decimation of the hope of Bengal's reindustrialisation? She is sending out all the wrong signals to industry, which she shouldn't if she is serious about drawing industry to the state,"" Salim said. Mamata, who has visited Singapore, England and Germany to court investment and is slated to visit Thailand next month for a business meet, has been sending out bureaucratic delegations to various countries in Asia and Europe to boost participation at the Bengal Global Business Summit. A senior functionary in a city-based trade chamber said that although many industrialists now understand the importance of Singur and Nandigram to Mamata, she can no longer afford to make mistakes on industry in her second term as chief minister. 'Impostors' The chief minister said many of the people yet to receive the record of rights for the return of land were impostors who had taken compensation cheques 10 years ago. When the government tried to locate these ""willing"" farmers, they were nowhere to be found. ""These were impostors who posed as willing farmers to take the compensation. A lot of these malpractices took place back then. We are looking into these things,"" she said. Unlike in her September 14 address, she did not say FIRs would be lodged against such people."
58ff383f7be9e0420db2e9a7,Indians to set record in Congressional polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161104/jsp/foreign/story_117353.jsp,2016-11-04,"California's attorney general Kamala Harris (left) and Washington state Senator Pramila Jayapal Washington, Nov. 3: Next week's legislative elections in America concurrent with choosing a new US President will set a new record which few people are talking about: yet it is very important for India and for Americans of Indian origin. The new US Congress will have a record representation by men and women of Indian origin. Women in America are openly exulting that next Tuesday's voting could take female representation in both chambers of Congress to more than 20 per cent for the first time. Also, depending on whether you are a rich American, not-so-rich or a poor citizen, the millionaire class which will proliferate the next Senate has become a hot potato or a matter of pride in the ongoing election campaign. But the record about to be set in legislative representation is a landmark in the history of Indian immigration to the US. Although Indian American presence on Capitol Hill will go up by record numbers, it will still not be as high as in Canada where Punjabi is the fourth most spoken language in its House of Commons. Not yet. If all goes well for Kamala Harris in Tuesday's voting in California, she will become the first American with Indian roots to become a member of the US Senate. Harris is California's incumbent attorney general. In nearby Washington state, Pramila Jayapal is equally on the way to making history for the Indian American community if she is elected - a virtual certainty going by opinion polls - to the US House of Representatives on Tuesday. The US Congress has never had an Indian American woman in its ranks. Jayapal is an incumbent state Senator in Washington. She will replace a retiring Congressman who has a stellar record of helping India and promoting Indo-US friendship although he is racially white. Jim McDermott, one of the founding members of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, represented Seattle and neighbouring areas in the House for just under 28 years. In a part of Silicon Valley which is home to technology firms Apple, Intel, Yahoo! and eBay, Ro Khanna, a former Stanford University lecturer who is only 40, is likely to replace incumbent fellow Democrat Mike Honda. California's curious election law allows the two top contenders from the same party to contest against each other in the poll. Another near certain win next week contributing to the new record is Raja Krishnamoorthi who is contesting in Illinois for a seat being vacated by incumbent Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a fellow Democrat. When Louisiana's Bobby Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, Indian Americans were over the moon. Since Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, no Indian American had gone to Capitol Hill as an elected representative in the lower chamber of Congress. When Jindal was elected Louisiana's governor five years later Indian Americans once again became unrepresented in the US national legislature although their disappointment was tempered in due course by having him - and later in 2011 - Nikki Haley, South Carolina's incumbent governor in two significant gubernatorial positions in America. Ami Bera filled that gap in 2012 when he was elected to the House from California. He and Tulsi Gabbard - who is not Indian, but Hindu - have since become emblematic of Indian causes on Capitol Hill. Bera faces a tough contest this year and Indian Americans fear he may not be re-elected. Although she has only been in a state-level contest the cynosure of this election season for people with Indian roots in this country has been Kesha Ram, who unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primaries for Vermont's Lieutenant Governor. She continues to be a member of Vermont's General Assembly. Her popularity among Indian Americans is owed to her success eight years ago in being elected to the state legislature at the age of 22, the youngest member of the community to win any public office in the US. Meanwhile, widespread expectations of a Hillary Clinton victory in the presidential election have prompted Indian Americans to lobby with her campaign for positions in the next US administration, especially in a Clinton cabinet. Among the Indian American front-runners is Neera Tanden, president of a Democratic-leaning think tank, the Centre for American Progress. Speculation is rife that Tanden could be in the next cabinet as the secretary for health and human services. Clinton has promised that if elected, 50 per cent of her cabinet will be made up of women. Since her victory, if it comes through, is significantly owed to African Americans, Hispanics and Asians, Clinton will go out of her way to ensure ethnic diversity in her administration. Tanden's strength is that she worked for the drafting and adoption of Obamacare formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama's signature health care reform which Clinton has pledged to uphold. Circles close to John Kerry, the secretary of state who succeeded Clinton when she quit to enter the presidential campaign, indicated that Richard Verma, the incumbent US ambassador to India, could be the next Permanent Representative to the UN, a position with cabinet rank in the American system. Ajay Banga, who headed the US-India Business Council for several years, the president and CEO of Mastercard, is being talked about for a senior economic position in the Clinton administration as is Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general. Other Indian American names doing the rounds are Vivek Murthy, the current US surgeon general, and Raj Shah, whom Obama appointed as head of the US Agency for International Development."

58ff38767be9e0420db2e9ea,Call to workers to fight Samajwadi 'goons',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161028/jsp/nation/story_116068.jsp,2016-10-28,"Amit Shah Lucknow, Oct. 27: BJP national chief Amit Shah today said central forces would stop ""Samajwadi Party goons from capturing booths"" when Uttar Pradesh votes early next year and promised a ""Kalyan Singh-like government"" if his party came to power in the heartland state. Shah, who addressed a public rally in Etawah, Samajwadi boss Mulayam Singh Yadav's home district, also called on young BJP supporters to take a ""pledge"" to stop the ruling party's thugs from venturing out of home during elections. ""I know very well where I am standing, and still saying that central forces must be here to prevent the goons (from capturing booths). But I also appeal to the youths of the BJP to stop the goons from venturing out of their homes during elections,"" the BJP leader said. With 10 to 25 per cent Yadav voters, the 11 Assembly constituencies in Etawah and its adjoining districts - Mainpuri, Auraiya, Farrukhabad, Kannauj and Etah - have for long been strongholds of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP). Mulayam's native village Saifai is in Etawah, around 250km from Lucknow. ""You take a pledge today that you will not let the goons of the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party take over the election this time. Enough is enough. Now UP has to take the path to development and strengthen (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi,"" Shah said. Shah asked the people whether they needed parties like the Samajwadi and former chief minister Mayawati's BSP, which, he said, have ""promoted criminals during their rules"" or a leader like Modi ""who has been giving jobs to youths"". The BJP has not projected a chief ministerial face and the decision so far is to let Modi lead the campaign. Shah said the BJP would once again give the state a ""Kalyan Singh-like government"" if it won the Assembly elections. The BJP claims that Kalyan, a two-time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and now governor of Rajasthan, had given the heartland state clean governance when he ruled. It was during Kalyan's first term as chief minister that the Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992. The Supreme Court had later held Kalyan responsible for the incident and punished him by asking him to stand in the courtroom till the court rose for the day. Shah also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi, who recently completed a kisan yatra in the state. The BJP leader claimed that the Congress vice-president was not aware of the fact that ""potatoes are not manufactured in a factory"". ""Rahul is a big leader. He was recently on a kisan yatra in Uttar Pradesh and said in Agra that he would open new factories to increase the production of potatoes. He doesn't know that potato is not produced in a factory; it is grown in fields. But we will certainly open factories in the state to produce potato chips if the BJP comes to power,"" Shah said. Rahul's critics had spread an unsubstantiated rumour last month that he had said he would open factories to increase potato production. BSP boss Mayawati said Shah's promise of a government like that of Kalyan Singh amounted to insulting Uttar Pradesh residents, adding that the former chief minister had been ""punished"" by the Supreme Court. ""Shah has insulted the 22 crore people of UP by promising a Kalyan Singh-like government,"" she said."

Government officials dubbed the move ""routine"", saying bureaucrats holding key posts were transferred every two to three years. Agarwal, considered close to Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, had been the JDA commissioner for two years. But many in the administration said Agarwal had been ""shunted"". Sixty other officials were also transferred today. Agarwal and Diya Kumari, who had joined the BJP at Raje's insistence, had on August 24 argued in public over a government takeover of 12.5 bighas of land around her family's Rajmahal Palace in the heart of Jaipur. Civic officials had come armed with a bulldozer to take possession of the land, said to be valued at over Rs 1,200 crore, surrounding the palace, a heritage property inherited by Diya Kumari's son and now run as a hotel by a business group. The JDA had said it acquired the land legally in 1993 and was only taking over what was the government's land. Diya Kumari, who had rushed to the spot with a court decree, claiming the family's right over the land, had a public spat with commissioner Agarwal. She accused Agarwal of ignoring the court papers. The spat had sparked a street protest on September 1, led by Diya Kumari's 73-year-old mother Rajmata Padmini Devi and son Padmanabh Singh, 18, the family's heir. Several thousand people, including those from Diya Kumari's constituency Sawai Madhopur, traders and Rajput communities from across the state, had lent support to the 6km rally in a show of Rajput solidarity. Sources said the issue had become a political hot potato as the Rajput community and several BJP leaders and royal families had got sucked into the controversy. The JDA had sealed four gates of the palace, including the main entrance to the hotel. Raje's silence on the issue had fuelled suggestions that the JDA's move had the support of the chief minister. Earlier, Agarwal had come under fire for the demolition of temples for a Metro project. Some of the temples were rebuilt following protests by people."

It has come as a blow to farmers, who are already under financial crisis, due to drought and related issues, he said.Sheshegowda alleged that the board had failed to abide by the guidelines of the government. He said, only a few tobacco growers possess licence and they too have not taken up tobacco cultivation.The number of unauthorised tobacco growers is more, compared to license holders. They can sell their produce only with the cooperation of licence holders. If they have to sell their produce directly, it is inevitable for them to pay a fine to the board. The Tobacco Board has set such regulations, causing inconvenience to the growers, he alleged.CompensationThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had directed the manufacturers of tobacco products to display large visual warnings that cover 85 per cent of the pack surface. But, the Centre has rejected it and decided to use warnings that cover 40 per cent. With the government mulling to control tobacco cultivation, it would affect the farmers, he added.Agents meetingCriticising the meeting held at the Deputy Commissioners office to discuss about seed potatoes on May 12, he said, not a single farmer was invited for the meeting. It was purely a meeting of middlemen, he alleged.The potato growers have been facing loss for the past nine years. Instead of supporting farmers, the district administration is giving importance to traders. There is no proper information on the quantity of certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar and the expenses incurred. The district adminstration is extorting innocent farmers, he alleged."

This has indirectly helped the traders, who are said to be fleecing the farmers by selling the seeds at a higher price.Potato is a major commercial crop of the district and about 50,000 farmers are involved in its cultivation.Not a single farmer was present at a meeting convened by the district administration on Thursday here, which many farmers felt showed the negligence of the authorities concerned in lending an ear to the problems of farmers.Speaking to Deccan Herald, farmers explained that potato growers usually attend the meeting every year. But, this year, upset over the authorities attitude, no farmer attended the meeting. The failure in fixing the price for the seeds is beneficial for traders, who sell seed potatoes on credit and fleece the farmers, they complained.The traders do not give any receipt for the seeds sold. The farmers too are forced to buy the seeds, accepting the price quoted by the traders under fear that the stocks may exhaust. As there are no receipts, the farmers are eligible for a financial assistance of Rs 5,000 issued by the Agriculture department  Rs 450 for manure, Rs 3,090 for pesticides and Rs 1,540 for other expenses.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner V Anbukumar had intervened and held meetings with the farmers, inspected godowns and fixed a suitable price. This was helpful to the farmers. But after his transfer, the district administration has not shown much interest in the issue. Elected representatives too have turned a blind eye to the problem, the farmers complained.Certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar, Punjab, are just 2,065 tonnes. This is sufficient for about 500 farmers. According to reports, 56,000 farmers had sown potatoes last year. Hence, 55,500 farmers will get only ordinary seed potatoes, they added.The farmers said they fear blight disease attack and loss of crop if they do not get certified seeds."

However, the two important announcements for the district are  a fodder manufacturing unit in Arkalgud at a cost of Rs 20 crore and upgradation of Hemavathy Right Bank Canal.The people of the district, who had anticipated compensation for potato growers, overbridge near the new bus stand and others, were disappointed.But, the announcement of financial aid to the rain-dependent small and micro farmers through National Seed Corporation or Farmer Manufacturing Societies, may help a section of the farmers.AdmissionThe chief minister has assured to increase the number of seats in the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences from 100 to 150. This may not be beneficial for the students of the district alone. Moreover, it has to get the approval of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). If there are no sufficient facilities as per the guidelines, the IMA will not approve it.Siddaramaiah has declared that a committee would be constituted for Yettinahole and Bhadra projects, even as the projects are being opposed by a section of the people of the district.PackageJD(S) spokesperson Hongere Raghu opined that the chief minister had meted out injustice to Hassan district as there were no new projects and no package was announced for potato growers.However, the chief ministers announcement of constituting a committee for implementation of Yettinahole project has invited flak from the organisations opposing the project.Speaking to Deccan Herald, Kishore, president of Malenadu Janapara Horata Samiti, said, A scientific survey has not been conducted and no efforts have been made to take public or expert opinion on the project. The issue is with the National Green Tribunal. Once, the verdict is out, the future course of action would be decided."

Legal action will be taken against those traders selling substandard quality of seeds in the district, warned Deputy Commissioner Deepti Kanade.She was speaking at a preliminary meeting to discuss about potato cultivation organised by the Horticulture department here on Tuesday. The meeting was attended by the traders, farmer leaders and the representatives of the Horticulture department.Farmers should not go for low-quality seeds which are available at a cheaper rate and thereby compromise with the quality. This would only lead to low quality production and thereby bring in only loss for the cultivators. Only quality seeds can ensure quality yield and the traders should also sell only quality seeds. Usually there will be variation in the weight of a 50 kg bag of seeds. Slight variation up to one or one-and-a-half kg is not a matter of concern. However, a larger variation in weight should be brought to the notice of the trader, she said.District unit president of the Raitha Sangha Bhaktarahalli Bhairegowda said, For the last three years, the farmers from the district had been facing potato crop loss. It is better to take all the precautionary measures. The traders who sell seeds should also provide bills for the goods sold. Measures should be taken to halt the private traders who are engaged in the sale of low quality seeds.Not sufficientThe traders informed the meeting that only a couple of companies sold certified seeds. However, this was not sufficient to meet the demand for certified seeds that is required in the district.Senior Assistant Director of the Horticulture department, Munegowda said the traders from the district often purchased potato seeds belonging to a general variety from the farmers of Jalandhar. However, there are a number of seed selling centres which have been certified by the National Seeds Coporation in Punjab, which sell certified seeds. Our farmers can purchase from these centres also, he informed.The deputy commissioner said that a list of certified sellers will be handed over the Horticulture department. The traders can purchase seeds from these sellers.For the first time in Hassan district, certified seeds were distributed by the Horticulture department directly to the farmers houses, on an experimental basis. The certified potato seeds were sold at a subsidised rate and the department has supplied 2,800 tonnes of seeds. And there have been reports of good yield too from the district.

Youth should develop interest in such aspects of the country.Guha said the uniqueness of India lies in the adoption of universal adult franchise especially in a young nation ridden with poverty and illiteracy. Comparing the evolution of democratic models of different countries such as England and France, where the model of one language, one religion and one enemy united the nation, Guha pronounced that Indiaa relatively young republic was a successful democracy. This audacious gamble not only worked but was hugely successful as well.Drawing parallels across diverse countries such as Great Britain and Sri Lanka, he opined the plurality of languages and religion was the strength of India. The credit goes to farsighted vision of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Ambedkar and others.Unity in diversity is the essence of India that makes it a confederation of more than 30 states and Union Territories with different cultures, languages, music, dance, drama, art and architecture.He warned against the concept of Hindi, Hindu, Hindustani or one language, one religion, one nation theory citing examples of countries, which have ruined themselves having gone that route.Today, different states of India follow different languages but follow single rulebook called Constitution of India, which has given equal rights to all citizen irrespective of their caste, creed, region or religion. He elaborated the importance of celebration of multiple languages and history tells that imposition of one language and one culture will have dire consequences. He cited the examples of separation of East and West Pakistan and civil war in Sri Lanka.While bringing up the virtues of work life balance, he highlighted the importance of music, literature, art, architecture and being with nature. Work life balance does not mean, sitting at home as couch potato and watching IPL, but exploring other dimensions of life, so that one would have a better understanding about oneself and the society in which one lives, he said.DH News Service"
