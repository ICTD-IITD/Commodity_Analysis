Commercial Taxes Minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, however, justified the hike. ""Taxes have been increased only on high cost items used by citizens having good financial strength,"" he said.""Only by mobilising some additional resource from richer sections of the society, the state government can undertake welfare works for the poor,"" he added.JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar echoed the views. ""Those who can afford should make some sacrifice to help the state government take up programmes for betterment of the poor,"" he said.The state cabinet has decided to impose 13.5 per cent tax on luxury items, including sweets priced more than Rs 500 a kg, to raise additional revenue for development work."

The board issued a detailed set of guidelines to replace junk foods with healthy snacks and food varieties, as its previous advisories in this regard had been cold shouldered by a large number of private schools.It also asked the schools to make parents and children aware of the ill effects of junk food.Schools are required to ensure that there are no high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods like chips, fried foods, carbonated beverages, ready-to-eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, potato fries and confectionery items, chocolates, candies, samosas and bread pakoras in the school canteens, the CBSE said in a circular.It also advised the schools to conduct inspection of lunch boxes of their students to rule out consumption of unhealthy foods, saying consumption of HFSS food has been found to be associated with many diseases, including type-2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation and hyperinsulinemia with a risk of cardiovascular diseases in later life.These diseases and childhood obesity have been reportedly found to affect the cognitive and physical development of children adversely, causing an irreparable loss to the society, it added, highlighting significance of promoting healthy food eating habits among children.In its circular, the board gave the web link of a recent report of a working group, set up by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and asked the schools to refer the recommendations for implementation.The recommendations made by the panel comprehensively covers the issue and provides invaluable insights on how to control the endemic problem of consumption of junk food available in and around schools, it addedThe boards directive comes months after the Delhi High Court, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) in March last year, accepted the draft guidelines formulated by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, to restrict sale of HFSS food items in and around schools."

The things that cannot be achieved directly by technology can be outsourced for a price tag.So, we have people taking care of our daily chores. Then there are people answering attendance and writing examinations for students who want their services. We have stories of senior pourakarmikas who kindly allow their poorer cousins to do the job for them for a pittance. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, builders and other professionals off shoulder their responsibilities to their juniors in the name of teaching them the tricks of the trade.Then, there are always those few people in every family who are specially identified to attend functions and events on others behalf. There are goons who can bump off the guy you dont like. If you have not yet grasped the general drift of all this dribbling, let me spell it out for you. The mantra goes this way: Every activity that can be done by a substitute is almost always substituted.That explains all the lifestyle diseases. Apparently, all of it stems from our couch-potato mode, preferably with a bag of potato chips by our side. If only we could squarely shift the blame on all those innovations and the underprivileged populace who have geared up to enslave us, make us obese and redundant and get them suitably punished for making us look silly slobs. When this kind of collective murmur became a clamour it was heard by the world of technology.Lo and behold, they came up with an application called Pokemon Go. The tech savvy and the body watchers geared up to catch virtual monsters and burn those unwanted calories. Just around the time when the world thought things were falling into place, a news brief updated us about how lazy gamers can avail the services of a firm called Poke Walk. The ones who want to boast of a high score without sweating it out can hire the service of people who will walk their phone and catch creatures for a fee! Wonder what they will come up with next?I am waiting for the day when the brilliant brains of this world will come up with a technology for satiating our senses or even breathing on our behalf. However, I will not be overly surprised if some enterprising lot gives us the option to outsource the function for a fee!"
59041d9c7be9e02646bdc0ec,Caring for health and artisans,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/535606/caring-health-artisans.html,2016-03-19,"Sunil Raghu in Ahmedabad, March 20, 2016 0:18 ISTThe MORAL and FIBRE route to clothe the world : Shailini's endeavour was to use more of natural materialsA few years ago, on a hot, humid monsoon day Shailini Amin, who had been living in the UK for over two decades, was visiting her hometown Ahmedabad. Out all day, when she returned home to change in to fresh clothes, she was aghast to see her body turn blue!No. She did not suffer any heat stroke. Nor did she have any allergies to hot or humid climes back home. As a matter of fact, it was the colour of her peacock blue bandhani top that had run all over her and despite taking what she calls a hot soapy shower, she could not get rid of her blues completely.Next, she had a nasty, red rash. She first thought that it must have been due to prickly heat but it was not. A doctor friend told her that the dye of her top had something in it and had affected her skin. He told her that these dyes could be poisonous. So much so that these dyes also affect the dyers in the villages where it is made, with many artisans having their hands and fingers damaged. This shocked Shailini, who claims that now she was turning red and blue. Not because of dye but with anger!The incident made Shailini, the niece of Indumati Chamanlal, a freedom fighter and Gujarats first textile minister, think. Ironically, it was Chamanlal who had set up Khadi Mandir, Indias first khadi store, in Ahmedabad in the 1950s, where Shailini had spent most of her formative years working in the outlet. She thought about the clothes we buy and wear, their manufacturing process, the people involved and what their characteristics are.A trained career architect, travelling between India and England, Shailini was closely involved with various aspects of green, energy efficient and sustainable built environment projects. Her passion was about conservation and heritage support of buildings, people and places. Having committed equal time for paid and community-based voluntary work all through her career, she had been involved with research and work on initiating action programs for village level groups, artisans and international communities.My experience of turning blue and red had remained with me. When I returned from England to Ahmedabad a decade ago, my first project was to build a house for my family and myself. That experience of finding our roots again and experimenting at grounding took me closer to my personal heritage. It took me beyond architecture and I became very passionate about handcrafted fabrics, Shailini says.The other strength Shailini had was that having lived in England and in India, she had been exposed to both sides of international textiles change - from the producer side and from the buyer/consumer side. Influenced profoundly by her aunt Indumatiben Chamanlal and close family association with Mahatma Gandhi and Indias Freedom Struggle, Shailini was influenced by the ethical, moral and social values the freedom movement had generated.Polluting industryWhen she began her tryst with the textile industry, she knew that this industry is the second biggest employer in the world but had become one of the most polluting and exploitative industries. Many times the buying houses, distributors and mills show very high profit margins for their shareholders but the people lower down the supply chain are overlooked. The workers are exploited by very low wages and they work in questionable health and safety conditions. The farmers become victims of buying agents and get paid very little. Many times greed and apathy play a larger role, she says.So in 2007, she began her journey by setting up MORALFIBRE - the fabric made using almost no electricity and no harmful chemicals. One that is almost Carbon Neutral and allergy-free.Generally the manufacturerer of the cloth use about 600 to 800 chemicals; many of them harmful to the body.Her endeavour was to be able to source and sell a fabric that uses more of natural materials that are not harmful to the body and the environment, reducing the chances of allergies and illnesses caused by skin contact and fumes of the harmful substances from the fabric. This also protects the health of the artisans too.Today, the MORALFIBRE cloth is made of biodegradable materials, using finite energy and resources so that it makes less negative impact on the environment. Unlike other industrially manufactured woven and knitted ones, these hand crafted fabrics making involve hand spinning and hand weaving using people energy instead and has far-reaching economic and social benefits to the artisans living in remote villages.The primary source of raw material too remains certified organic cotton and non-certified cotton sourced from local farmers from the Saurashtra region and within 450 km radius of Ahmedabad. Natural alternatives such as natural spinning oils that biodegrade easily are used to facilitate spinning; potato starch is used for sizing. A good boiling wash removes the cotton wax. Fabrics are natural, greige (unfinished woven or knitted fabric that hasn't been bleached or dyed. It can be used for upholstery, window treatments, clothes and more) and white, yarn dyed and fabric dyed with azo free dyes.The weaving is single yarn, double yarns, plain or twisted. The prints are mainly hand block printed by local artisans in Indo- Western and contemporary styles. All this is done by over 3,000 artisans from various cooperatives in the region.For marketing, MORALFIBRE acts more as a web-based social enterprise, using the world-wide optic fibre network to connect producers to the buyers. On one hand it works locally with co-operatives by creating work opportunities in fabric production, processing, dying, printing and tailoring. On the other, they approach buyers and potential buyers through networks, mainly in a B2B wholesale marketplace spread internationally across the UK, the US, Australia and many EU countries, over the internet.Though the venture has been making a few ripples in the world fashion industry, the big bang break came last year when the fabrics were used by Warner Brothers in their Hollywood production and Hugh Jackman-starrer Pan. Currently into clothing, Shailini now plans to soon launch a range of garments that too will be sold only online."

No wonder, James Joseph is called the jack man of Kerala. A series of incidents transformed an engineer into an entrepreneur with a social cause and its impact is interesting.James worked in the corporate sector for about 2 decades, held key positions, specifically marketing roles, in leading companies, and worked from cities in three different continents. But, no matter where he was and how sophisticated the life was, his passion for hometown was alive in him. When he was appointed as a director (executive engagement) of Microsoft in India, he decided to connect his passion and profession. He wanted to explore the possibilities of working for a corporate company from his native in Aluva in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Both the company and the family supported him to try out the idea.In May 2009, James started his new journey. For over three years, his work and life were in perfect sync and he could achieve better while working from his village. I worked for different companies in three continents, but achieved my career-best professional performance, at the global software giant Microsoft, from my village, says James.When he realised that people can return to their villages without sacrificing their career and even perform better while experiencing the peaceful environs of rural India, he decided to spread the message and launched a pioneering initiative, Professional Bharati.Through this startup, he has been encouraging professionals who grew up in villages and are working in cities to return to their roots. He points out to advantages from avoiding the traffic to stress-free life and a healthy environment. Also, they can facilitate the transformation of villages and work for social causes. To advocate the cause, he started the Come Home campaign on October 2, 2012.He has shared his experiences on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Youtube, Twitter and Facebook, he has also been writing for publications. He has been posting information about his activities in his blog ProfessionalBharati.com.After successfully working from the village for 3 years, which he considers the most peaceful and productive years of his career, James decided to write a book to spread the word. He took a break from his work for the purpose and as he was in the process of writing, the turn of events compelled him to work for the cause of the most neglected crop of the state  jackfruit.Though I cherished jackfruit in all its forms, specifically jackfruit meal  a unique tradition of Kerala, I never thought that I would be so much associated with the fruit, James said. While I was working on the book, unknowingly I was observing the jackfruit tree in the backyard, different stages of the fruit from tender to ripe and slowly realised that most of the fruits go waste not only in Kerala, but also in the entire country.Soon curiosity gave way to planning and action. Jackfruit, though known for its utility value, has been given the tag of a poor mans food. James decided to take it to larger cross-section of society and experiment with different dishes--both traditional and exotic. After research he realised that in certain areas the crop is popular as a vegetable and in most places it is used as a fruit. The arduous task of cutting the fruit kept it away from consumers. Thus he wanted to try it out in different recipes both as a vegetable and as a fruit.Whenever I had food with potato as base, I felt that jackfruit would be a better substitute for mashed potato both taste and health-wise, says James. His idea was to make jackfruit a universal vegetable and ensure that it replaces potato at least in places where it is grown.For the purpose, he contacted leading chefs with whom he had a good network. But convincing them took some time as they were reluctant to use it for three reasons--seasonal, messy to prepare and the strong aroma. Though it proved to be a task, he succeeded and the result was amazing. Chefs were fascinated to see the range of dishes that could be prepared using a jackfruit. This led to experimenting hundreds of dishes from jackfruits, both traditional and contemporary.He also launched jackfruit365 to sell freeze-dried ripe jackfruit and raw jackfruit. The venture solved two problems attached to jackfruit--seasonal and messy. The venture evoked overwhelming response. Soon he became the flagbearer for jackfruit in Kerala, also networking similar efforts.As the jackfruit initiative became popular more and more people expressed keenness to know more about the Come Home campaign too. All credit to the jackfruit campaign, a reputed publishing house like the Penguin Books India came forward to publish my first book  Gods Own Office. The book, which was released on October 2, 2014, narrates Jamess fascinating journey from the backwaters of Kerala to become an achiever in the corporate world and then treading the unique path of working for the corporate world out of his village.Here is a response from a professional - Reading God's Own Office gave me the courage to chuck up a full-time corporate role and return to Kozhikode. I've co-founded a boutique BPO, voice call centre and tax and financial advisory in Kozhikode.By the time he completed writing the book, James decided not to go back to corporate life and continue the jackfruit campaign and founded another start-up called Gods Own Food Solutions for the purpose. James had observed that the jackfruit meal of Kerala, where unripe jackfruit displaces rice and wheat, had resulted in hypoglycaemic incidents when taken with insulin.He also found that in many instances, where jackfruit when used instead of rice or wheat, has reversed the diabetes condition. He took this clue forward, worked with doctors, scientists, chefs and consumers. The recent study by Sydney Universitys Glycaemic Index Research Service has mentioned that the glycaemic load and carbohydrate content is the lowest in unripe jackfruit compared to rice and wheat and its high fibre content leads to low absorption of sugar."

They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."

For onion, it was (-)64.19 per cent.The rate of inflation in sugar was at 35.36 per cent and that for fruits rose by 13.91 per cent during the month.""The pick-up in wholesale inflation was broadly in line with our expectation, with an adverse base effect outweighing the cooling effect of lower food inflation,"" ICRA Senior Economist Aditi Nayar said.Assocham said prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, has been rising at industry level but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should address using supply side responses.""Government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least 6 months,"" Assocham said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65 per cent and minerals (-)3.44 per cent.The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.42 per cent in August, up from 1.82 per cent in July.ICRA further said core-WPI inflation is expected to inch up further in the coming months and remain in a range of 0.5-2 per cent in the remainder of this fiscal.The WPI inflation for June has been revised upwards at 2.12 per cent, against provisional estimate of 1.62 per cent.""Wholesale inflation has undergone a sizable upward revision of 40-50 basis points for the last four months, which is a source of some concern,"" Nayar said.WPI inflation is expected to print between 4-4.5 per cent in the remainder of 2016, whereas CPI inflation would range within 4-5 per cent in the same months, ICRA said.The rise in WPI inflation in August is in contrast to the retail inflation which eased to a five-month low of 5.05 per cent in the month.The cooling of retail inflation and 2.4 per cent contraction of factory output in July has revived hopes for a rate cut by RBI in its next policy meet on October 4 to boost growth.In its monetary policy review last month, the RBI had maintained status quo on key rates citing upside risks to 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017.Moving towards the new regime, the government had in July notified 4 per cent inflation target for the next five years, based on which the monetary policy committee (MPC) would take its decisions going forward.It also provides for a margin of plus or minus 2 per cent in this target, thus fixing the upper tolerance level at 6 per cent till 2021.The MPC will set interest rates by majority, with a casting vote for the central bank governor in the event of a tie.Out of six members of MPC, three will be from RBI - the Governor, who will be the ex-officio Chairperson, a deputy governor and an executive director.The other three members will be appointed by the central government, on the recommendations of a search-cum-selection committee, headed by the Cabinet Secretary.It remains to be seen whether the October 4 policy could be decided by the MPC."

In manufactured items, WPI for sugar rose by over 35% . The increase in WPI comes on the back of an easing consumer price inflation (CPI) in August. The official data showed CPI eased to 5.05% in August, compared with 6.07% in July.Two indicesThe divergence in the WPI and CPI is because of the weightage given to items such as food in the two indices. Food prices form a large part of CPI. The August CPI fell on the back of a decline in food prices.But, inflation in both the indices is above the inflation target set by the Monetary Policy Framework. The Monetary Policy Framework, signed by the RBI and the government, retained inflation target at 4%, plus-or-minus, two percentage points.Policy responseIndia Inc, which apprehended that inflation will spike in the coming months, urged the government to take a concerted policy response.Assocham said that prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, have been rising at an industry level, but a recent concern is sugar, which has begun to rise at a much higher rate, and that which policymakers should address using supply-side responses.The government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least six months, it said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65% and minerals (-)3.44%.

This is the time when night shift workers and party hoppers pack up and go home to have a good days sleep. Once in Bangkok while briskly walking on the footpath, I heard loud music blaring from a parked vehicle and saw empty liquor bottles indicating a pavement party. Some partying sex workers who were there accosted me and would not allow me to move forward. With great difficulty, I could sneak out. In Cape Town, a bunch of drunk goons were about to rob me and thanks to a police patrol car, I could get away to safety.Pre-dawn, is also the time to see and smell freshly arrived vegetables, fruits and flowers. Any passerby in front of K R Market in Mysuru will be exhilarated by the smell of Jasmine and sight of brinjals. Early birds in coastal towns can see freshly caught fish being sorted out and, if lucky, buy the best catch at reasonable price. Seeing the faces of satisfied fisherfolks coming back home with a substantial catch is elevating.Early mornings are also peoples fitness time. One can come across people walking, jogging, doing yoga, clapping their hands. In Hanoi, I saw a group of elderly women convert a footpath into a gym and perform Chinese dance.This is also the time to see different breeds of dogs. I was amused to see walkers in New York carrying plastic bags and scoops to take away their pet dogs poop. I was surprised that people in Antwerp allow their dogs to spoil pavements despite seeing warning signs of hefty fines.Mornings are the times to know the local breakfast habits. It is the time when roadside vendors do roaring business. In Saigon, one can see footpath vendors serving pho, a soup with rice noodles, to customers sitting on low plastic stools. In Ghana, it is burgers and sandwiches, whereas in Sri Lanka it is string hoppers with curry. While walking in the Little India area in Singapore the smell of fresh Idlis linger and while in Belgium, it is the smell of waffles and potato chips. The smell of filter coffee in Tamil Nadu makes one stop and savour a tumbler. It is a sight to see busy office goers grab a plateful of breakfast on the streets and rush to their offices.Dawns are also the time when the smell of printing ink wafts through. Road corners are full of newspaper vendors. As a media man once, I would learn which newspaper sells most in that town by talking to the vendors, apart from quickly glancing at all headlines. As the sun slowly rises, the air smells of petrol and diesel, the chirps of the birds recede and the city comes to life with a lot of noise. Mornings, wherever in the world, are a mirror to the lifestyle of the people of that place."
590473f87be9e04154df7160,Holiday’s over for the prince who’d rather not be King Cong,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/politically-incorrect/holidays-over-for-the-prince-whod-rather-not-be-king-cong/,2016-06-05,"Wont you come into my parlour, said the spider to the fly. How can one forget the slightly sinister undertones embedded in the familiar nursery rhyme? Thats the thing about nursery rhymes and fairy tales  behind the innocuous words, there is always a deadly message. Children get it automatically. It takes adults much longer. Decoding nursery rhymes/fairy tales is a pretty specialized art. I am guessing there are still a few brains and self-professed intellectuals left in the Congress party to inform their soon-to-be-anointed emperor about the weight of that crown, and the discomfort of the throne he will occupy. Poor man  from a reluctant prince of India to the king of the Congress party, it has been a long and troubled journey.The timing couldnt have been worse  for the Congress. It resembles a tattered army, fatigued and demoralized after several convincing defeats on the battlefield. For all practical purposes, the troops have deserted the camp, after being headless for years. Not a single general has stepped forward to lead from the front. The king-to-be looks lost and adrift. The dowager queen is unwilling to let go of control. Her courtiers are scattered and no longer in a position to call the shots. She remains inaccessible and unapproachable, except to her trusted advisers. Palace intrigue suggests there could be more problems ahead, with foot soldiers moving away to the enemy camp. The dowager queen is in no mood to abdicate. This is a do-or-die moment for her personally. The future of the kingdom she believed was hers as a birthright, is now in other hands. And there is further trouble brewing in the royal familys inner circle.In this fascinating fairy tale, there is also a fair princess the one who is considered the rightful heir to the throne. The princess royal is well-loved by her subjects. Even the courtiers agree it is she who should wear the crown and rule for the next 40 years. By then, the princesss son will be old enough to take over, and the kingdom will carry on as planned.Unfortunately, there is a large fly in the ointment. It is the princesss consort, and he is being seen as the main hurdle preventing the accomplished princess from playing the role she is vastly cut out for. Since the consort does not come from a royal lineage (even if he does behave like the king of kings), the princesss elevation is unlikely to take place. Especially now that the consorts personal palace in a foreign land has been discovered. Surprisingly, the existence of the said palace has never been a secret! But since the news broke, the dowager queen is faced with a fresh scandal. She is an expert on keeping a lid on the royal familys many scandals. But this one seems like the hot potato even she is finding hard to digest.Meanwhile, the king-in-the-wings is wondering what on earth to do with his new position. Its an elevation he was clearly not keen on. For years, he has succeeded in keeping the dowager queen off his back in the hope that she would leave him alone and find some other candidate for this thankless and hopeless job. But he also realizes it is a borrowed crown he wears. So long as his formidable mother is right there, to undertake the plotting and scheming that is a part of the royal duties, he will have enough time to take frequent breaks and enjoy spa sessions when the heat in the kingdom gets to him.In this fairy tale, there are several wicked witches, not just one. These witches are capable of brewing magic spells that can make monkeys out of men  very powerful men. Dealing with them wont be easy. There is also an ogre with a gigantic ego who is out to finish off this dynasty once and for all. He has a well-trained army of Lilliputians, who are so obedient, all they need is a raised hand, and off they go to attack and demolish the giants enemies. The dowager queen realizes this is the last pitched battle to save herself, her family. The not-yet-king has a monumental job ahead of him. People keep reminding him that the kingdom is changing and good days are here. He laughs. He sometimes forgets he is the king-in-waiting now and not the court jester."

590474607be9e04154df71ee,Mr Modi goes to Washington,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/strategic-insights/mr-modi-goes-to-washington/,2016-06-06,"Mr Modi, beware. You are heading to D.C. to bond with a lame duck president. That is a wasteful exercise, and I will tell you why.The New York Times has carried an article today portraying you and President Obama as an odd couple; how great he is and how tarnished you are. But ignoring your alleged record in Gujarat for a second, let us understand what Obamas record is.The New York Times portrays Obama as a fervent protector of minorities, code words for blacks. But blacks continue to be slaughtered by Americas mostly white police, which often gets away scot-free. America is more racially polarized today than when Obama came into office. His own polarizing lecturing is the principal reason why so many whites are plumping for Donald Trump.Obama continues to take civilian lives, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. He has droned Pakistan and Afghanistan to death, way more than George W. Bush ever did. Now W. was a real friend of India. I met him just before he became president, and he promised me that he would treat India at the same level as China. In one year after entering office, he had ushered in a landmark nuclear deal with Manmohan Singh. He then personally coerced China to agree to the deal.Obama says that he will enable Indias entry into the nuclear suppliers group, but it is an empty offer, because he knows that China will block the deal, and everyone knows that he will not be able to budge China. His foreign policy is in shambles. The minute he discovered oil in the U.S., he signed an agreement with the Iranians, spurning and scaring the hell out of Americas long-standing allies, the Israelis and the Arabs. If Trump comes into office, quite possibly the first thing he will do is to rescind the deal with Iran.Obama left Iraq because the Iraqi government would not let him have his version of AFSPA. He thus enabled the creation of ISIS. He abandoned Muammar Gaddafi, who had become Americas and W.s friend by destroying all his weapons of mass destruction. North Korea and Iran got a valuable lesson: never stop creating nukes and toxins. Today, Libya is a playground for ISIS. In Syria, Obama promised to bomb Assad if he used chemical weapons. He did, and he didnt. Nobody believed the word of the US president anymore.In Afghanistan, he carelessly set an artificial deadline for the withdrawal of his troops, thereby emboldening the Taliban and Pakistan to wait him out. He first told India to keep her hands off Afghanistan, and then when the Pakistanis started troubling him, asked India to get involved in Afghanistan. Then when the Pakistanis started playing ball with him, he cut India out of the post-US negotiations in Afghanistan.This is a man whose senior advisers didnt know where Tunisia and Egypt were on the map when the Arab Spring broke out. Despite his horrendous human rights record, W. bonded easily with Manmohan Singh, Karzai of Afghanistan, Mubarak of Egypt, Blair of England. Obama by contrast is a loner. He has few friends in D.C. He can hardly call any world leader a firm friend. Would you ever tell him that the people of India dearly love him, as Manmohan told W. Yes, many in India mocked Manmohan then, but W. gave us the nuclear deal. What has Obama given us?Mr Modi, you are better off spending your time in D.C. bonding with Trump and Hillary. If they are out of town, go and meet them there. Obama will not get you a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. He well knows that China will block that as well, so his promises are just empty rhetoric.Today, India is flooded with American goods, from cars to potato chips to everything. America has become our number one arms supplier, whereas anyone with institutional memory of the army will tell you that the Americans will be the first ones to cut off spare parts if India gets into war. What good are arms without spares, especially in wartime? Russia and France have never betrayed us like that.Mr Modi, please honor your publicly-pledged Rafale deal with France. In many cases, Russian and French arms are superior to Americas. When the Chinese came out with their stealth fighter, the American media scoffed at it until they discovered that it was better in many ways than their own stealth fighter.A big problem has arisen in India today. Many of your senior bureaucrats, politicians, and military personnel have offspring settled in the US. They visit the country often and are completely enamored by it. I overheard a conversation between a former cabinet secretary and his friend at the Delhi Golf Club. The friend obviously lived in the States, and invited the retired bureaucrat to visit him there. The bureaucrat said that he was going to the US anyway to meet his family. The friend said, come spend a week with me and completely relax yourself. I laughed. As if the retired bureaucrat was working ever so hard in India.Mr Modi, these are the people who are misleading you into a strategic partnership with the US. There is nothing strategic nor partnership about it. This is all empty rhetoric with no substance. If the US can abandon Israel for Iran, when Jewish people have so much influence in America, then what are we.American media seems oblivious to the poor human rights record of its own leaders. The millions of Muslim civilians that W. and his cohorts have killed and displaced in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tens of thousands of civilian deaths that Obama has caused in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. And then American media portrays Third World leaders as killers and kings of corruption. The white man loves to feel good about himself by painting the dark man black.So Mr Modi, play your cards right. Even your detractors have been stunned by the awards and the warmth that you have received in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Obviously spending most of your time overseas has taught you something about the world. Obama hasnt learned a whit about the world in eight years in office. Jettison him, as well as Indian bureaucrats, et al who are trying to mislead you to frame foreign policy so that they can keep visiting their families in the US. Russia, France, and Israel are our time-tested friends. In comparison to the US, hardly any Indians live in these countries. But that doesnt make them any less than the US."

5904953c7be9e04154df8dd7,Decline in area under GM crops is more of an aberration than a trend reversal,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/decline-in-area-under-gm-crops-is-more-of-an-aberration-than-a-trend-reversal/,2016-09-15,"The world of GM crops witnessed a starling development in 2015. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a forum for disseminating and sharing technologies for agriculture sustainability and development, the acreage under GM crops declined for the first time after the commercialisation of GM crops in 1996.The acreage under GM crops, also known as genetically modified or transgenic crops, which had steadily grown to touch peak levels of 181.1 million acres in 2014, dropped by one percent to touch 179.7 million hectares in 2015. This was mainly on account of the fall in acreage under important GM crops like Maize and cotton. This is a major setback because acreage under GM crops had shot up almost 100 fold from the meagre 1.7 million hectares in the last 19 years, making it the fastest adopted agriculture technology in recent times.Latest estimates show that GM crops were raised on 28 countries which is home from 4 billion people of which 8 were developed countries and the rest from the developing world. However the bulk of the 180 million hectares under GM crops were concentrated in five countries which accounted for 90% of the acreage and included the United States (39%), Brazil (25%), Argentina (14%) and India and Canada with 6% each. However, in China the most populated nation which stood 6th in the hierarchy, the share of GM crops was a mere 2% of the global total. But what is exceptional is the acreage under GM crops in developing countries has exceeded that of developed countries for the fourth consecutive year which raises hopes of increasing its acceptability in poor countries.In the United States the vast majority of the GM acreage was under three crops namely maize, soybean and cotton where the high technology variety covered more than 90% of the sown area each. The scenario was similar in Brazil and Argentina too where the three were the most popular GM crops. In Canada the largest GM crop was Canola followed by maize and soybean while that in India was mainly cotton. In China too cotton reigned supreme followed by papaya.The United States not only had the largest acreage under GM but also had the most diversified one. The number of GM crops including, apart from Maize, soybean and cotton, also canola, sugar beat, alfalfa, papaya, squash and potato. And 2015 was also a notable year for GM crops in the United States as it commercialised a new strain of potato and a new version of canola and secured approval for two varieties of apple.The year was also important for United States as salmon secured approval to become the first GM animal for commercial production. It also secured approval for a new GM chicken. The GM community also was able to foil efforts to introduce labelling for GM crops in four states. However, despite all this it was the fall in acreage of 2.2 million hectares under maize, cotton and Canola, due to the falling prices that cause the global acreage to fall for the first time.A country attempting a significant push to GM crops among developing countries is Bangladesh. Though the commercial acreage is still low the area under bt-brinjal has been doubled to 25 hectares and efforts are on to exponentially increase the quantity of bt seeds to meet growing needs. The country has also stepped up efforts to initiate field trials of blight resistant potato in the next year and also initiated measures to evaluate crop like bt cotton and golden rice in field trials. All this indicate that the fall under acreage of bt crops is an aberration and would be reversed in the coming years."
5904ed3c7be9e04154dfdddd,"Phuchkanomics workforce bigger than TCS, SBI, Infosys",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/phuchkanomics-workforce-bigger-than-tcs-sbi-infosys/,2016-02-07,"Everybody knows Bengalis love fish. It was left to Radhaproshad Gupta, raconteur, connoisseur of fine things and writer of delightful essays on Bengals social history, to dig up this long-forgotten proverb: When they hear of fish/ Even trees spy a tasty dish.Bengalis also love their phuchkas  panipuri or golgappa to you  but little has been written about it. This neglect is surprising, because Bengal has a vast culinary literature: everything from shukto to sandesh has been chewed over and digested.Phuchka shares the same basic characteristics as a panipuri or golgappa, but there the similarity ends. It is futile to debate, as some do, which variant is best. Kolkatass phuchka beats others, well, hollow. But as Romans used to say, de gustibus non est disputandum: dont dispute other folks tastes.I am a phuchka addict. Luckily, in the south Kolkata neighbourhood where I grew up and where my mother lives, Im spoilt for choice. Each vendor has a wicker stand, nearly keeling over with the weight of a steel handi full of spiced tamarind water, pots of spices, boiled chana, and the red-cloth-wrapped container full of paper-thin, deep-fried balls. These are filled with spicy potato paste and tamarind water and served apace.For the last four years or so, my local vendor, a youngish man, used to work alone. But recently he has employed a helper, a chhotu, who peels potatoes, mixes ingredients and serves lesser snacks like churmur and aloo-kabli to customers.If a relatively small phuchka vendor needs at least one helper, how many people are employed in the trade across Kolkata? The best person to bounce this off was, naturally, my childhood friend Somen Gaine: government babu and peripatetic encyclopaedia on everything Bengal eats.We needed to first reckon how many phuchkawalas plied their trade in the vastness of Calcutta. To estimate that, we selected a 40,000sqm (200m x 200m) area of the city we know backwards. Fairly fast, we counted the number of phuchka vendors in this area.We then extrapolated this number on the roughly 201 sq km area of the metropolis, defined by the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. With some qualifications  areas like New Alipore, say, had fewer vendors than places like central, north or south Kolkata  we realized that the total number of standalone phuchkawallas was around 200,000.Since the smallest, and most ubiquitous ones, could employ one person and larger ones anything from three to five helpers, we assumed a fairly modest 1.5 helpers per phuchkawala. That gave us 500,000, or half a million, people employed selling phuchkas on the pavements of metropolitan Kolkata.The vendors do not make those delicate shells, boil potatoes or prepare the delicious chana. These are made, from early morning onwards, by women working tirelessly with aloo, chana, dough and woks in sprawling shantytowns. The colonies are located in areas like Beleghata in north Kolkata, Narkeldanga in the east and Chetla south of that. This is labour-intensive work. We reckoned it probably takes at least three women to produce enough shells, boiled aloo and spiced chana for each vendor daily. Three women plus 1.5 chhotus working with each of 200,000 phuchka vendors: that should give us the total Phuchkanomics workforce.This number is a staggering 1.1 million folks. If you stretch the geographical boundaries of the trade to areas now included in Greater Kolkata, Phuchkanomics could employ even more people.Surprisingly, the ubiquitous phuchka is a relatively recent addition to Kolkatas streetfood. My father snacked on the traditional telebhaja (assorted vegetables crisp-fried in batter) or shingara (samosa) as a teenager around 1940. My mother gorged on phuchkas 15 years later.So, this all-conquering snack probably came to Kolkata sometime between 1940 and 1950. The people who brought it came from eastern UP and Bihar. In the following 75 years, Phuchkanomics grew to employ more than a million people in Kolkata alone.To see the scale, here are some numbers, based on a recent Economic Times report on top employers in 2014-15. That year TCS had three lakh employees, State Bank of India 2.2 lakh, Infosys 1.6 lakh, IBM India 1.5 lakh and Wipro 1.34 lakh. The Phuchkanomics workforce is larger than all put together.In February 2015, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said it was silly to harp only on big business as sources of livelihood: One can set up a tea stall or a telebhaja or sweet shop and have a decent income. Guffaws followed. Didi might have said this to score debating points, but factually shes not off the mark. If Phuchkanomics alone can sustain a million souls, many more are nourished by the manufacture and trade of ready-to-eat streetfood: telebhaja, sweets, kebabs, kathi rolls and momos.Bengal might be starved of big investments, but the gargantuan Bengali appetite, literally, feeds its engine of growth."
5904f8b27be9e04154dfe8d1,Bread-Poha or things like that,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sweet-n-sour/bread-poha-or-things-like-that/,2016-02-05,"Youve had a heavy lunch or a late one and if youre fitness (or thinness) freak you might forego dinner but if youre like me, who need their three-squares (and some intermediates), bread-poha is our salvation. Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

With the quirky and cocky messages, those badges were like the status updates of that time. And my brother had this particular badge that I found really clever because it said- Take my advice. I am not using it anyway.I only found its true meaning once I got pregnant. Starting from close friends to stranger aunties in the market, everybody had free advice to dole out to me. I was not only stomped down to the nave dumb first time mother figure but also my belly seemed to have become public property which everybody thought was okay to caress while dishing out their favourite pregnancy or parenting tip!And we all know that was just the beginning. All through motherhood we are surrounded by advice. Some from well-wishers and some for the heck of it. However close you might be to your advice-giver, there are times when it gets to you.

Sometimes you get some really good handy tips which can make your motherhood journey smoother. There is nothing like experience in the job called motherhood after all.Now once you have heard the advice, what do you do about it?Over the years I feel that advices can be split into three categories- usable, customizable and throw-able. Know which advice falls in which category and give it only that much heed.Usable advices are those that can be directly incorporated into your life. For instance, eggs make a delightful snack for your one-year- old baby. Since egg allergies are rare, its an advice you can just copy paste into your life. All new moms are looking for healthy snacks for their babies. And first time moms benefit with snacks ideas.So this kind of easy and good advices fall in the usable category. Dont think twice before using them.Second type of advices are customized advice. These are advices that you should try only after customizing it to suit your baby and other circumstances. And thats where your maternal instincts come in. For instance, if somebody advised you to try jeere wale aalo (an Indian potato dish) for your fussy eater call in your instincts to customize the dish your toddler is most likely to happily consume. If I need to feed my daughter potatoes, I know she will have plain boiled and salted potatoes instead of any other preparation.So customized advices require not only heed but some thought from your side as well. But the end results are usually very beneficial. Hence, its a good investment of your time.A large percentage of advices fall into this third category- throwable. Just thank the advice-giver politely and move on. These dont require any of your time and energy. For instance; Oh! My child was potty trained at 8 months! You better start training your kid too. He is almost a year old! Such statements can exit your head as soon as they reach it. You already know that each child is different and some things are just taught when you feel right. There is no hard and fast rule about them.So throwable advices should reach your mental recycle bin ASAP. They dont deserve your time or energy.But the underlying rule of being at the butt end of receiving advice is to remember that the person (usually) means it in the best of intentions. So no matter which category the advice falls in, first thank the advice giver and then do a mental categorization of the advice and give it the apt amount of time and energy required.There is no need to get huffed and puffed about getting too much advice. I know it can be overwhelming sometimes. But it doesnt mean that you dont know your job as a mother. It just means that a lot of people are out there to help you out.Dont misconstrue any advice to be a statement at your personality or capability.Its just advice. Take it or leave it!"

As he rattles off names like aiyla, mathi, kari meen, ney meen, aiykoora, my eyes glaze over. It all sounds very fishy to me!And it is. I am in Kerala on a holiday and spoilt for choice for a seafood preparation at one of the most exotic hotels in Kochi, Bruntons Boatyard. Steeped in Raj influences and mid-century elegance, the hotel is famous for its History Restaurant, which boasts a menu that is simple but innovative: each dish reflects the culinary history of the community it is culled from. And with about 30 different communities living in Kochi, the menu at the History restaurant tells its own special story.The First Class Railway Mutton Curry speaks of a time gone by when the British traversed the country building the Indian railways. Fish Cutlets tell tales of an Anglo-Indian heritage. Fish lovers savoring the flavour of Samak Bil Harder Asful are transported to Arabia. Then theres the fish Moilee which is a throwback to the citys Syrian-Christian roots. The Vindaloo transports you to the time of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese influence in the community. And not to be left behind, the Dutch Pudding with a lingering trace of cinnamon, harks back to the days when the Dutch East India Company made Kochi one of their settlements.At the History Restaurant, these cuisines have been given a new lease of life, recreated faithfully each evening by chefs who did their research in the best place possible  with the old families of Kochi. The staff is friendly and well-informed and I get to hear interesting nuggets of information as we wait for our meal. Niju, our waiter for the evening, tells us that the Portuguese taught the local people how to use coconut milk in the dishes and the Jews introduced the famous appam, pancakes made with fermented rice batter and coconut milk. While the Dutch didnt share much, preferring not to go dutch with the locals, the Dutch bread called Brooder is sold on the streets of Cochin even today.I want to sample the two signature fish dishes of this delightful old-world restaurant: Chuttulli Meen and Vypeen Moilee. The chuttulli meen recipe is one of the oldest recipes on the menu and the recipe for the marinade of the fish was handed over to chefs by one of the local Jewish families when the hotel first opened. The fish (mullet or Indian salmon) is filleted, covered with roasted shallot paste and grilled. It is then broiled in a salamander (not to be confused with the amphibian; this is a high-end broiler for kitchens!). The cooked fillet and a thick layer of potato slice is then draped over a liberal helping of saffron sauce and served with a side helping of roasted aubergine and okra.Even as I am cleaning out my plate with relish, my next dish, Vypeen Moilee, makes its grand appearance. Named after Vypeen or the island opposite Bruntons Boatyard, moilee is a take on the original Portuguese stew, with milk being replaced by coconut milk and local spices added to suit the local palate. Served with appams, moilee is a mlange of fish, squid and prawn, flavored with turmeric and tempered with fenugreek seeds.As I tuck into my aromatic stew, I glance around the room. Except for the gentle clink of cutlery and the discreet movements of the attending staff, everyone is concentrating on their dishes.Conversation is hushed, suitably reverent to the surroundings. The Foodie son is busy opening his three-storey Tiffin Meal, containing appam, vegetable khichdi and Kerala chicken cutlets. The H, has played it safe and gone with the more traditional meal of Malabari parathas, Kerala kela koftas and coconut rice.I turn back to my moilee and as I take another mouthful, I let out a little sigh of pleasure. The fare has been simple, but has left me fishing for more food in Kerala."

(Source: AP) Israelis are finding new advice hard to swallow: in the name of proper nutrition, their health minister has gone on the warpath against the beloved Hanukkah tradition of gorging on sugar-laden, deep-fried, jam-filled doughnuts. (Source: AP)Israelis are finding a new campaign by their crusading health minister hard to swallow: in the name of proper nutrition, he has gone on the warpath against the nations beloved Hanukkah tradition of gorging on sugar-laden, deep-fried, jam-filled doughnuts. As head of a powerful ultra-Orthodox political party, the bearded and black-coated Yaakov Litzman considers himself a guardian of Jewish traditions. But in his other hat, hes a health-conscious official on a mission to stamp out junk food and child obesity.Watch What Else Is Making NewsLitzmans two roles have come into conflict with his high-profile call to avoid the lure of the high-calorie sufgania doughnut.I call on the public to avoid eating sufganiyot, which are rich in fats, Litzman told a conference last week promoting healthy eating. You can find alternatives for everything nowadays and there is no need for us to fatten our children.As part of his health food drive, Litzman has campaigned to have sugary drinks removed from schools and taken on fast food giant McDonalds  earning public praise for promoting proper nutrition.McDonalds out. Not in our country, he said, in a refrain that went viral.But going after doughnuts during Hanukkah is something else entirely.For most Israelis, eating the sufgania is as essential to celebrating Hanukkah as lighting the menorah and spinning the dreidel.Along with the latke  a fried potato pancake  it is the delicacy most associated with the eight-day holiday that commemorates ancient miracles and a triumph over oppression. Taking a page from the playbook of the ancient Maccabees who inspired the holiday, many are resisting Litzmans campaign.You have to eat it, but in proportion. Its yummy, its good, its the season, said Gideon Haba, a doughnut seller in the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem. I dont believe he (Litzman) meant it. Its like not lighting the candles. He just wanted to send a message.Yosef Lipsman, a customer buying his first doughnut of the year, said the tradition was harmless as long as you dont go overboard.White flour is not great for you, but its all a matter of how much, he said. You can enjoy it once in a while.Litzman declined a request for comment.Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, commemorates the Jewish uprising in the second century B.C. against the Greek-Syrian kingdom, which tried to force its culture on Jews and desecrated the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem.The holiday lasts eight days because  according to tradition  when the Jews rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem, one vial of oil, enough for one day, burned for eight days instead.Hence the tradition of eating oily foods.A sufgania is essentially a ball of dough deep fried in oil, packed with strawberry jelly and sprinkled with sugar. Other versions are alternatively filled with chocolate spread, cappuccino or dulce de leche.In recent years, it has become trendy for bakeries to offer embellished versions that are topped with marshmallows, crumbled cookies, pralines, popping candy and whipped cream. Some include a syringe that can inject toffee, pistachio cream and even vodka into the doughnut for an additional kick.The upgrades have created a 100 gram (3.5 ounces) doughnut that can contain as much as 500 calories.Burger King recently jumped on the bandwagon by introducing its SufganiKing  a standard Whopper stuffed between two doughnuts.At a Roladin bakery in Jerusalem, dozens of elaborate versions were laid out on display.Maybe they are fat  but they are good. Thats the reason why theyre good, said Haim Newman, a customer. My family came from a long, long tradition of baking and my father always says what his grandfather told him before: If you want something good, it has to be fat.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e1a17be9e033b96e928d,Cuba’s Fidel Castro made revolutionary mark on history,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/cubas-fidel-castro-made-revolutionary-mark-on-history-4396115/,2016-11-26,"In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File) In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File)The son of a wealthy landowner, Fidel Castro turned his back on a life of privilege to lead a left-wing revolution in Cuba that endured for decades and was shaped by his political cunning, keen sense of destiny and boundless ego. Castro, who has died at the age of 90, was at once idealistic and pragmatic, sharply intelligent and reckless, charismatic and intolerant.Critics saw in him a stubborn bully who violated human rights, jailed his critics, banned opposition parties and wrecked Cubas economy. Admirers saw a visionary who stood up to US domination of Latin America, brought healthcare and education to the poor, and inspired socialist movements across the world.Even before leading the 1959 revolution that propelled Cuba toward communism and onto the Cold War stage, Castro saw greatness in himself. From an early age, he admired historys boldest figures, particularly Alexander the Great, and believed he and his rebels were part of that tradition. Men do not shape destiny. Destiny produces the man for the moment, he said in 1959.Castro toppled the unpopular US -backed dictator Fulgencio Batista by uniting a disparate opposition and outsmarting a bigger, better-equipped Cuban military. His alliance with the Soviet Union put him at the center of the Cold War, most notably when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took the world to the brink of nuclear war.He was a global celebrity, his beard, military fatigues and big Cuban cigars making him instantly recognizable. He owed his prominence in part to geography. Looking to bolster an ally just 90 miles (140 km) from Florida, Moscow helped him build socialism by giving him billions of dollars worth of aid and favorable trade, from oil to tractor parts.But Castro also mined Cuban nationalism and Latin American pride, stirring resentment of US power and influence. He managed to preserve his revolution despite constant US hostility even when Cuba reeled from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, showing the vigor of a man who intended to die in office.Instead, almost killed by a serious intestinal illness, he was forced to step aside in 2006 and he formally handed over to his younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2008.In his final years, Castro wrote opinion columns for Cubas state media but was rarely seen. His famously long speeches gave way to silence, at least in public, and comfortable track suits replaced the stiff black boots and crisp military attire.On Dec. 17, 2014, Raul Castro cut a deal to restore diplomatic ties with the United States. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro offered only lukewarm support, raising questions about whether he approved of ending hostilities with his longtime enemy.PERMANENT STRUGGLEKnown by the militaristic title of El Comandante, in some ways Castro was always replaying the exhilaration of revolt, exhorting Cubans to fight one battle after another, from confronting US hostility to boosting potato production.FILE  In this March 14, 1957 file photo, Fidel Castro, the young anti-Batista guerrilla leader, center, is seen with his brother Raul Castro, left, and Camilo Cienfuegos, right, while operating in the Mountains of Eastern Cuba.

(AP Photo/Andrew St. George, File)He survived numerous assassination attempts and outlasted nine US presidents in power, seizing control of Cuba while Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House and stepping down during George W Bushs second term.Throughout, Castro lectured Cubans.A magnificent orator who instinctively altered his cadence to fit the moment, he re-trod history and delved deep into detail about Cuban independence heroes, plans to perfect the revolution and the declared evils of US imperialism.Tall and physically commanding, fastidious in his attire, he often built to a crescendo of indignation, gesturing firmly with long-fingered, well-manicured hands.We shall endeavor to be brief, he told the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, then set a record for UN speeches by talking for nearly 4-1/2 hours.Castro never allowed statues of him to be erected or streets to be named after him, saying he did not want a cult of personality. Nevertheless, the cult was everywhere. His image and words were posted on billboards and his name was invoked at every public event.Most Cubans, whether for or against him, refer to him simply as Fidel.He was a night owl. He would keep foreign guests waiting until late at night and then summon them for talks. Even his critics would sometimes find themselves oddly charmed by such encounters.Tad Szulc, a biographer, called him Cubas great master of political seduction.EARLY YEARSBorn on Aug. 13, 1926, Castro grew up as a privileged son on his fathers plantation in the eastern village of Biran, where his playmates were children of impoverished workers living in thatched huts with dirt floors. He said the economic injustice he witnessed there inspired a life-long sympathy for the poor.FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File) FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File)He attended the Jesuit-run Belen School in the capital and then studied law at the University of Havana, plunging into the violent politics of the time and starting his drift leftward.Long-winded, intolerant and  unusually for a Cuban  awkward on the dance floor, he was not embraced by his fellow students at first but eventually emerged as a leader.He took part in an aborted 1947 plan to overthrow Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and was at a youth conference in Colombia when riots broke out and some 2,000 people died.After law school, he decided to run for Congress in 1952. When Batista staged a coup and halted the elections, Castro began plotting armed rebellion.In 1953, he led a raid on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. Dozens of followers died and he, Raul Castro and others were captured and imprisoned.History will absolve me, he declared at his trial.Pardoned in 1955, he went into exile in Mexico where he met Argentine revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara. Together with Raul, they trained a rebel band that in 1956 returned to Cuba aboard an overcrowded yacht called Granma.Ambushed at landing by government troops, only 12 of the 82 rebels on board made it to the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains.Castro denied Batistas claims that he was a communist but decades later he told Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in a book 100 hours with Fidel that by 1952, I was already a convinced Marxist-Leninist.Whatever the evolution of his views on communism, he was determined to throw off American influence in Cuba. When US-supplied aircraft bombed his rebels in 1958, he vowed revenge.I have sworn that the Americans will pay very dearly for what they are doing, he said in a letter to close friend and aide Celia Sanchez. When this war has ended, a much bigger and greater war will start for me, a war I shall launch against them. I realize that this will be my true destiny.US ENEMYWashington viewed him as a potential enemy even before his rebel army forced Batista to flee Cuba on New Years Day, 1959.It took just two years for the relationship to unravel as Castro nationalized swathes of the economy and introduced a broad agrarian reform. Thousands escaped the island, starting what became a bitter bulwark of opposition in Florida.In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File) In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File)In April 1961, when his military crushed a CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, he declared Cuba socialist and allied himself with the Soviet Union.Moscow put nuclear missiles on the island in 1962, touching off a 13-day superpower showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis.In an Oct. 26 cable to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Castro seemed convinced the Americans would invade Cuba and suggested the Soviets eliminate this danger with an act of legitimate self defense.Khrushchev felt Castro was advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike and rejected it, telling him he was satisfied with US President John F. Kennedys pledge not to invade.The Soviets withdrew the missiles and Washington secretly agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, ending the crisis.The United States imposed its trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 and the CIA admitted trying to kill Castro in the early years of his rule.Plots or plot ideas included trying to get Castro to smoke a poisoned cigar and taking advantage of his love of diving with an exploding seashell, or poisoning a diving suit.Castro reveled in his status as an elusive target.Im really happy to reach 80. I never expected it, not least having a neighbor  the greatest power in the world  trying to kill me every day, he said at a 2006 summit in Argentina, where crowds greeted him like a rock star.While the embargo was economically devastating, it allowed Castro to shift blame for chronic economic problems away from the system he built and onto the United States.He cast the fight as a David and Goliath story.Philip Bonsal, US ambassador to Cuba in 1959, later described Castro as a phenomenally gifted, erratic and unscrupulous autocrat who freed his country from American imperialism only to reduce it to a satellite of Moscow.REVOLUTIONIn a country that was prosperous by Latin American standards but riven by inequality and illiteracy and with an unsavory reputation as a brothel and gambling-rich playground for Americans, Castro sought to build a socialist society.His government trained thousands of doctors and provided free schooling, changes that have endured well into the 21st century, even as the states role in the economy was reduced in recent years.Those gains came at considerable cost to personal freedoms. Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the states long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibias independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.COMMUNIST OUTPOSTAfter the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castros communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the special period for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cubas economy.Little was known about Castros personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leaders only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a caudillo, or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term. I am a kind of spiritual leader, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(AP Photo/File) Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions carry an effigy of South Korean President Park Geun-hye as they march during a rally calling for Park to step down in Seoul, South Korea. (AP Photo/File)As hundreds of thousands of South Koreans poured into the streets every weekend for two months to call for President Park Geun-hye to resign, the oppositions leading contender to replace her appeared reluctant to seize the moment. That is changing as Moon Jae-in, a 63-year-old human rights lawyer who lost the 2012 election to Park by more than a million votes, has in recent days taken a higher public profile as he seeks to lead the liberal Democratic Party into the next election and end eight years of conservative rule.Watch what else is making news:Like many on the left, he calls for sweeping reform of the chaebol  the big conglomerates that dominate the economy and have been at the heart of the current political crisis  calling them a source of unfairness in South Korea. He promises to move the presidential office into a multi-purpose government building and turn the palace-like Blue House, where Park remains while a court decides her fate after she was impeached by parliament, into a public museum.He has also said that, if elected, he would visit rival North Korea before making a trip to South Koreas main ally, the United States. Just two North-South summits have been held since the 1950-53 Korean war that divided the peninsula. The people who are angry in Korea want regime change, and the most realistic option and most probable person to do that is Moon Jae-in, Yang Jung-chul, a close aide to Moon, told Reuters.Moon had led opinion polls in recent weeks, although a survey released on Thursday by Realmeter showed he had fallen just behind United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, by 23.1 percent to 22.2 percent. Ban has yet to declare his candidacy or party affiliation, but has been expected to join a conservative grouping.Moons popularity among liberals stems from his time as chief of staff to South Koreas last liberal president, Roh Moo-hyun, a figure revered by the left for his experimental and anti-establishment politics that sought chaebol reform.Moon is a symbol of that experiment, said Yang.But Roh, derided by conservatives for his pursuit of engagement with North Korea that they say failed to change Pyongyangs behaviour, could also be Moons undoing, especially among South Koreas elderly. The majority of people aged over 60, most of whom are conservative, have turned out to vote in the last three presidential elections, according to National Election Commission data. In 2012, 85.9 percent of over-60s voted.By contrast, the least-avid voting group is people in their 20s or 30s, many of whom took to the streets for the first time during recent candle-lit protests in Seoul. At the last election their turnout levels were below 65 percent. That was high, by recent standards, for the demographic, but Moon will need to convince an even bigger share of them to turn out and vote for him in the upcoming election, which is no sure thing.He has a tendency to make ambiguous comments and be overly-cautious of crossing lines, said Moon Ji-hyun, a student activist at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. He wasnt in the frontlines at the early stages of the protests.The Constitutional Court must decide whether to uphold parliaments Dec. 9 motion to impeach Park, which could take up to 180 days and, if successful, trigger an election two months later.Sweet PotatoMoons parents fled North Korea during the Korean War and resettled in Busan, at the south of the peninsula, where Moon grew up in a shanty town. He was jailed in 1975 for protesting against the dictatorship of Park Chung Hee, President Parks father, whose rule lasted 18 years. After leaving mandatory military service, where he served in the special forces, Moon became a lawyer.As leader of the opposition last year, Moon adopted a more centrist stance to win over sceptics. But just 8 percent of those polled at the time said they thought Moons party was best on economic issues, compared with 44 percent for the ruling Saenuri Party.To win undecided voters, Moon needs to address security, diplomacy and unification, where many are distrustful of him, said Lee Chung-hee, a politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. Moon came under fire earlier this year for revelations in a former foreign ministers memoir that he had backed a motion to abstain from a United Nations vote against North Koreas human rights record.While Moon leads the race to represent his party in the election, new stars have risen. One is Lee Jae-myung, the mayor of Seongnam, just south of Seoul, who has gone from rank outsider to third place in polls, riding the crisis with populist speeches.By contrast, Moons caution and deliberate speaking style has earned him the nickname sweet potato  slow to cook, slow to eat, and a little difficult to swallow. Lee, meanwhile, has been dubbed soda for his refreshing new take on politics. In a recent radio interview, Moon said the Seongnam mayor was indeed like soda  refreshing but, unlike his own nickname, lacking substance.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e68b7be9e033b96e94b3,Irrigation Projects: Cabinet revises policy for cost escalations,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/cabinet-revises-policy-for-cost-escalations-4365174/,2016-11-09,"Girish Mahajan (File Photo) Girish Mahajan (File Photo)The Maharashtra cabinet has revised the policy for approvals to cost escalation for major irrigation projects. Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan said revised administration approvals (RAA) wont be required now for projects where the variation in cost over the approved cost was below 15 per cent. The government has further ruled that increase in costs for acquisition of land and rehabilitation of the project affected, and expenditure incurred for acquisition of forest lands wont be factored in while computing the escalated costs for irrigation projects.Watch what else is in the newsSources said this relaxation by itself would regularise escalated project costs for a majority of the projects stuck for the want of a revised administrative approval. As many as 200 projects are presently stalled for want of revised approvals. At least 150 out of these wont need RAA under the revised policy, said I S Chahal, Principal Secretary, Water Resources.Ever since the previous Congress-NCP regime was stung due to approvals for arbitrary cost escalations in irrigation projects, the revised administrative approval issue has been a political hot potato in the state. Mahajan too admitted that authorities responsible for issuing such approvals are wary of facing the heat for irregularities which were committed in the past. He said this had impacted the pace of projects.He claimed that the government had now specifically defined parameters that could be considered for ruling that the projects scope had been modified, and required a revised approval. The projects scope would be considered altered in cases where technical changes in the dam or canal design or water use and allocation resulted in an over 10 per cent difference in the projects irrigation potential, or where the projects construction cost, as previously mentioned, has increased by over 15 per cent. A revised approval will be needed for a project where the live storage potential of dams has increased by over 1 per cent.In August this year, the government had cancelled 94 tenders of 14 scam-tainted irrigation projects worth Rs 9,196 crore, which had been allocated during the previous regime. While Mahajan said fresh tenders would soon be issued for these projects, he admitted that the new policy for cost escalations would also be applied to some other irrigation projects where the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had raised audit objections for irregular expenditure. The previous regime had allocated contracts for many of these without mandatory environment and forest clearances. Some were taken up without even acquiring the land required for the project.Meanwhile, for projects where the cost escalation are still considered arbitrary, the governments new policy has laid down a separate screening procedure, which include technical audits, ratification by a state-level expert panel, and project-wise reviews at the cabinet level.While the BJP has taken action against officials and contractors in scam-tainted irrigation projects in Konkan and Vidharbha after winning office, the government has drawn flak from certain quarters over its inability to turn tables on the slow pace of irrigation projects.On Tuesday, in another major decision aimed at revival of the irrigation sector, the government ring-fenced funds required for the maintenance of completed projects. Of 3,600 completed irrigation projects, maintenance of over 2,000 projects has been hit due to paucity of funds. This has adversely impacted the states water scarcity management plan, said Mahajan.The cabinet Tuesday cleared a proposal permitting non-deposition of revenues realised by water reservoirs through various means to the state governments consolidated fund. These would now be used only for irrigation purposes. The government has divested powers for irrigation management to the five statutory irrigation development corporations. These corporations will now be permitted to utilise up to 40 per cent of the revenues raised from dam projects in their respective areas for repairs, restoration, and maintenance works for completed irrigation projects. The remaining 60 per cent amount raised by each corporation would be deposited in a centralised irrigation management account, and are proposed to be utilised for special repairs and expansion of projects, dam security and safety works, strengthening and modernisation of water projects, revival of lift irrigation schemes, canal works, strengthening of water use committee, and training of personnel in irrigation management, among others.In another decision, the cabinet also divested its powers for decisions regarding water allocation from a dam. While reserving 75 per cent water in a dam for irrigation purposes, 15 per cent for drinking purposes, and 10 per cent for industrial uses, the cabinet has now allocated powers to a cabinet sub-panel to take such decision. The previous regime had courted criticism for large-scale diversion of dam waters for non-irrigation purposes.State protests sedition charges against Marathi youth in BelgaumThe state government has said it would be writing to the Karnataka government, protesting against the slapping of sedition charges and cases slapped against Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum.The move comes after the Shiv Sena raised the issue during the states cabinet meeting Tuesday. At the meeting, Shiv Sena minister Diwakar Roate even sought adopting a resolution demanding imposition of the Presidents Rule in Belgaum.While no such resolution was moved, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reportedly informed his cabinet colleagues that an official letter would be issued to the Karnataka government, conveying strong dissent over the action against Marathi speaking youth since November 1, 2016.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8e77be9e033b96e95d4,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

For those involved in agriculture in West Bengal  estimated to be two-thirds of the states 91 million population  the question and its potential answers have dire consequences.While the average area owned by each household in Bengal is 0.174 hectares  the smallest in any state of India  officials said the sheer fertility of land in the Bengal delta meant that many, particularly marginal landowners, cultivated their land to supplement their income. Take for instance the case of Dharani Kanta Bhowmik (55), a schoolmaster who died on Tuesday in Cooch Behar after standing in queue for three consecutive days. Bhowmik owned less than 0.1 hectares and like many others in Cooch Behar, cultivated paddy. He had been trying to withdraw money to pay labourers who worked on his land.WATCH VIDEO: Heres Why RBI Restricted Withdrawal Limits On Jan Dhan Accounts To Rs 10,000On Thursday, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das announced that farmers would be allowed to withdraw up to Rs 25,000 per week against crop loans, subjected to limits. This would also apply to those who hold Kisan credit cards. Bank accounts needed to be in the name of the concerned farmers.On the other hand, traders with Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, would be able to draw of Rs 50,000 per week to pay wages and other sundry expenses.Almost 1,500 km away, at Boinchi in Hooghly, small-time trader Bibhash Sen who also grows potatoes on his land, is confused. I have three katha of land (0.1 hectares) on which I grow paddy. But I dont have a kisan credit card. Does that mean I would not be able to avail this relaxation? I went to the cooperative bank, but no one knew. I will go again on Monday. I desperately need money to buy seeds and begin planting.As of June 2016, only 31 per cent of the 17 lakh targetted Kisan credit card accounts had been opened, said State Level Bankers Committee records.Moreover, as per government records, Bengal only has 2,918 APMC markets and agriculture  in spite of the state being food surplus  remains largely informal. But unlike other food surplus states, small and marginal farmers contribute almost 86 per cent of the total output in Bengal. But the inherent informality of the agricultural system implies that these small and marginal farmers continue to be deeply in debt, with an estimated 88.7 per cent of all indebted ones owning land less than 1 hectare.WATCH VIDEO: Income Tax Law To Be Changed To Increase Penalty On Unexplained Deposits: All You Need To KnowOn the ground, farmers  many of whom are already in debt  are now finding that the traditional network of moneylenders do not exist anymore, following the governments decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.Prabir Sengupta, a small-time farmer in Howrahs Andul area, said: The demonetisation move has spelt disaster for me. As a BJP supporter, I had initially welcomed the move. But it is obvious that the government didnt think this through and take into account how agricultural practices are in different across the country.Claiming that wholesalers had refused to buy his potato crop citing inability to pay in cash, he added: I have a debt of almost Rs 7 lakh and will have to take more loans to pay for labour and fertiliser.

There has been months of speculation that 65-year-old Tsang, who tops popularity polls, would step down and enter the race to become the financial hubs chief executive. Hong Kongs unpopular incumbent chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, announced last Friday that he would not stand for a second five-year term.Watch what else is making news:The city government said Leung had already submitted Tsangs resignation to Chinas central government and the secretary for financial services and the treasury, Chan Ka-keung, would be acting financial secretary.Cable News reported earlier on Monday that Tsang may not make an announcement on standing for the top job immediately. Tsang was not immediately available for comment.Tsang, known as Uncle Pringles for a moustache similar to one worn by a character on a potato crisp brands packaging, is a U.S.-educated fencing and martial arts enthusiast who has been the former British colonys finance minister since July 2007. Candidates running for chief executive have to be vetted by a 1,200-strong Election Committee, which was selected on Sunday.The same committee will decide who will lead the city of 7.2 million people in late March. Tens of thousands of protesters clogged city streets for weeks in 2014 to demand a one-man-one-vote election for chief executive but they failed to win any concessions from Beijing.Hong Kongs next leader faces a host of challenges with concern growing over the influence of Beijing in city affairs as well as a fledging independence movement that has alarmed Chinas Communist Party leadership.Hong Kongs economy generally grew at a stable pace under Tsang and the government recorded surpluses every year. Last years surplus was HK$14.4 billion (US$1.86 billion).But critics say Tsang has failed to use the governments HK$842.9 billion (US$110 billion) in reserves to fund long-term social welfare policies, instead announcing one-off sweeteners in his annual budget addresses.Compared with Leung, who is generally seen as a dour, hardliner, Tsang has tried to present a more gentle persona, more in touch with the public. Tsang is also less closely identified with Beijings Communist Party leadership than Leung.Retired judge Woo Kwok-hing became the first person to enter the race and announced his campaign in October. Hong Kongs chief secretary, Carrie Lam, and a legislator and former security chief, Regina Ip, have also expressed an interest in running.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes.The currency crunch resulted by the Centres demonetisation move is set to hit farmers, agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and farm produce transporters ahead of a bright Rabi season, forcing the government to plan measures to tackle the impending crisis.An urgent meeting was held at Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swawalamban Mission, a government organisation, at Amravati Monday to discuss the problem. We are expecting both bumper crop of soyabean and cotton in the Kharif season in Vidarbha and a very bright Rabi prospect across the state due to the last heavy spell of rains and visible positive impact of Jalayukta Shivar scheme. But with currency crunch, both procurement at APMCs and the ability of farmers to purchase seeds have been badly affected. Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes. The farmers are also facing problem in buying seeds for the forthcoming Rabi season which is likely to go up manifold in Vidarbha and Marathwada. We have thought of some measures to address these issues, Kishor Tiwari, director of the mission, told The Indian Express.Watch What Else Is making NewsHe said they had requested the state government to approach the Centre with request to allow use of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 for purchase of seeds at government and registered private centres. We also want the banks to make enough new currency notes available to APMCs to tide over the payment problem. If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named. We are planning to provide transporters of at least onion, potato and tomato with some cash to enable them to continue plying. It will require expenditure of a few crore rupees, which is not a big deal, added the official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Representational)Centres demonetisation decision is taking toll on the mental health of many cash strapped businessmen in rural areas of West Bengal whose entire sales are in cash. Within a couple of days of the announcement, a potato wholeseller started having panic attacks since he has about Rs 50 to Rs 60 lakh of the perishable agriculture produce lying in a cold storage.He buys potato on credit in bulk and sells it in cash to smaller traders but now, as a result of cash crunch, there are no buyers. The wholeseller fears that his entire stock will go waste, incurring him a huge loss. He was suffering from panic and anxiety attacks and thought he will die, Senior consultant psychiatrist Sanjay Garg told PTI.According to psychiatrists, they have been getting a significant number of patients suffering from mental stress after the centres move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes. Garg said that most of such patients are from middle and upper-middle class families belonging from rural Bengal where the reach of plastic money is limited.Another psychiatrist Santasree Gupta said, One of her patient is a 50-year-old widow who inherited Rs 30 lakh in cash savings from her deceased husband. She had plans to buy a flat and spend the rest of the amount in her sons marriage. And now she is feeling very insecure. She had to put her on short-term medication to help her control the stress, Gupta said. Asis Ray, who owns a hotel in beach towns of Puri and Digha, was brought to a psychiatrists clinic by his family as he started drinking heavily and snapping at kids.Besides panic attacks, people are also suffering from irritable behaviour syndrome, Garg said. There was a sudden drop in his business as tourist inflow dried up. Even those staying in his hotels are having a tough time paying bills. This brought him psychological distress leading to behavioural change, he said.Scrapping of notes has brought problems for the existing patients too and others who were undergoing treatment are now finding it difficult to keep their appointments as they have little cash to meet doctors fees and travel costs. If they miss their appointments their situation will aggravate, the doctor said.Besides medication for immediate relief, the psychaitric patients are being prescribed relaxation therapy and distraction techniques.

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes.

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a05287be9e033fa42eca5,Watch out for these four crops!,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-agricultural-producuction-wholesale-market-4404175/,2016-12-01,"There are four major crops currently being planted or in the early stages of growth  wheat, onion, potato and chana (chickpea)  whose status needs close monitoring in the coming weeks, to ensure least production disruptions from demonetisation-imposed cash crunch.In three of the four commodities, tight supplies have already led to price rise. Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Vishal Srivastav Amit Shah offers prayers at a temple in Lucknow, on his way to Shahjahanpur, on Saturday. Vishal SrivastavBJP PRESIDENT Amit Shah on Saturday hit out at the Opposition for opposing demonetisation, accusing them of stalling the Winter Session of the Parliament just to sidestep discussion on funding of political parties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured discussion and change in fund raising process of political parties during the all-party meeting at the beginning of Winter Session and said all elections from panchayat to Parliament should be held on the same day, Shah said at his partys Parivartan rally in Shahjahanpur.Watch What Else is Making NewsHe added: But the Opposition did not allow a discussion in the entire Winter Session. They do not have any intention of wiping out blackmoney from politics. Modiji has put forward a view, and I want to appeal to leaders of all Opposition parties that and we should accept discussion on it to bring probity in politics.Continuing his attack on parties opposing demonetisation, Shah said only those whose billions have been reduced to trash are feeling the pain. Have you seen the faces of Mamata (Banerjee) and Mayawati their faces have lost glow, they have started looking 10 years older in a day, he said. In one stroke of the PM, drug dealers, fake currency racketeers, naxalites and terrorists have been set right, he added.Shah went on to list BJPs achievements at the Centre, including power to villages, LPG connections to women and reducing cost of fertilizers.Speaking on tripal talaq, Shah said: For the Modi government, religion comes after womens security and triple talaq should be banned.After the Centre clearly stated its views in the Supreme Court against it, the SP, BSP and Congress have all gone silent, Shah said while appealing to women voters to question these parties on what they are doing for womens rights and whether they agree on triple talaq when they come seeking votes.Should Mulsim women get their rights or not? Modi has worked towards securing the rights of women in the country, Shah asserted.Attacking the ruling SP and Congress possible alliance for the 2017 state polls, Shah said: Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has been saying for a month that SP will get majority in alliance with Congress This indicates that Akhilesh is feeling defeated. He is dreaming of winning with Rahul baba, who will set up potato factory in western UP.Even if all parties come together, the people of UP have decided to vote BJP to power, he added.Stressing that development of UP is possible only when BJP is voted to power with a two-thirds majority, Shah termed SP and BSP as family and caste-based parties, which cannot work for development of the entire society. It has been either chacha-bhatija or bua-bhatija who have been harming the states development in the past 15 years, he said, referring to UP SP chief Shivpal Yadav, Akhilesh and BSP supremo Mayawati.Akhilesh was not allowing the benefits of the central schemes to reach the people as it would increase the popularity of central government, Shah claimed. The benefits of Fasal Bima Yojana could not reach the beneficiaries as there was a tiff for commission between the chahcha and bhatija, he claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a06c17be9e033b96ea3d9,Deepak Gola ki shaadi: weddings must now factor in ‘black money’,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/weddings-must-now-factor-in-black-money-4397129/,2016-11-27,"Across Chandni Chowk, the one-stop shop for all things matrimonial, The Sunday Express joins a 22-year-old as he sets off with a little band, a little baaja and a little baraat. Photographs: Tashi TobgyalMy name is Love, but I dont believe in love; ours is an arranged marriage, says Deepak aka Love Gola. At 5 pm, with only five hours to go for his wedding, Deepak is sitting slumped on the floor, dressed in a pair of checked boxers and a half-sleeved vest and leaning heavily on his mother Amita. The 22-year-old gym instructor and his extended family have congregated at Jattumal Dharamshala, at the far end of Sitaram Gali in Old Delhis Chandni Chowk, from where the baraat will set off this evening. I had big plans for my wedding. I wanted to go to the parlour to get dressed but all I could afford was a hair cut, says Deepak, running his fingers through his hair thats streaked blond.The baraat sets off The baraat sets offDeepak, the youngest of four siblings, had got engaged to Priya Prajapati, a 22-year-old from Nand Nagri in East Delhi, in April, six months before the Central governments sudden decision to scrap notes of Rs 500 and 1,000. The decision scuttled his dreams of a grand wedding and what followed was an endless spiral of cost cuts. Demonetisation ne sab pe paani pher diya (Demonetisation played the spoiler), he complains.Deepaks 53-year-old mother Amita, her face taut, is concentrating on the mehndi her niece is drawing on her outstretched palms. Deepaks sister Bhavna, 32, is lying on one of the three mattresses spread out on the floor, trying to put her three-year-old son to sleep. The few others in the dharamshala, a few cousins and friends of the Golas, are idly waiting for the ceremonies to begin.Since November 8, we have only been queuing up outside banks  I, my son, daughter, niece Sirf dimag mein tension hi tension hai (I have been very tense), says Amita, whose husband Roopchand, a property dealer, died four years ago. Amita gets nostalgic as she talks about their wedding in 1978, incidentally the year of the last demonetisation exercise. Of course, then I didnt know any better. Or at least I dont remember going through such trouble, she says.His nephew has woken up in time for the wedding His nephew has woken up in time for the weddingWe had saved up Rs 2 lakh for the wedding. We queued up to exchange some money but the first three days, by the time our turn came, the money at the bank would get over. We finally managed to deposit all the money after 10 days, and then began queuing up to withdraw it, says Deepak, stretching out his mehndi-painted feet. The family could eventually only withdraw Rs 58,000, the budget hence for Deepaks November 23 wedding.The government has set a withdrawal limit of Rs 2.5 lakh for weddings, with stringent conditions  claimants have to produce wedding cards and copies of advance payments made. Besides, withdrawals are allowed only from balance available before November 8. We didnt even try. We werent sure if we were eligible and there was no time anyway, says Deepak.Indu, 24, the third of Amitas four children, says, If this (the demonetisation) hadnt happened, bhaiyya ki baraat would have set off from a banquet hall, not from a dharamshala. The siblings exchange a quick smile. They had hired a banquet hall but cancelled it for the dharamshala close to their home.A few paces from the dharamshala, the forced austerity at the Gola household finds its echoes in the markets of Chandni Chowk, the Capitals hub for all things matrimonial.Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UP Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UPAt the office of Jea Band, one of the oldest wedding organisers in Old Delhi, Anil Thadani, 45, is busy handling the mood swings of his clients. All our clients are panicking Most of them come to us with old notes, phir gussa dikhatein hain, koi emotional ho jata hai (Some clients get angry, some turn emotional). But we have no option, we have strictly stopped accepting old notes, says Thadani. The company, which featured in the 2001 movie Monsoon Wedding, organises venues, tents, bands and decorations for weddings.There are 150 auspicious wedding days in a year and business is usually brisk then. But this year, 25 per cent of our bookings have been cancelled, many have been postponed, and 15 per cent is on credit. We have been forced to lay off some of our staff, says Thadani, stopping to admonish someone on the phone: Pooja shuru hone waali hai, ghodi nahi pahunchi (The puja is about to begin, where is the horse)!A lot of families are also opting for day weddings to cut lighting costs, he says, though adding that while the move has hit the industry, in the long run, it will make the sector more organised.***At the dharamshala, Amita is still disgruntled. Unmindful of the caked mehndi on her palms, she angrily pulls out a cloth bag full of Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes and says, This is all the money we have! We cancelled the reception and the sangeet. All the other ceremonies  haldi, mehndi and the wedding  are being done in one day. Ladki waalon ne kuch dahej bhi nahin diya. Unka cash bhi humne hi line mein lag kar exchange karwaya (The girls family didnt give dowry either; it was we who got even their old notes exchanged), she says. We didnt buy new clothes for ourselves or gifts for our guests. I am wearing a sari my mother gifted me. The only thing we bought was a suit for Love, she says, pointing to a beige-and-maroon sherwani hanging from a nail on one of the pillars.Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relatives Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relativesAt Chhabra Store, one of the most popular bridal wear shops in Chandni Chowk, Manoj Kumar, 44, a salesman, says many families have, like the Golas, cut down on their trousseau budget in the wake of the new policy. Lehenga sales have been hit. No one is buying lehengas for more than Rs 15,000-20,000, says Kumar. Bride toh lehenga kharidegi hi, par relatives ke liye ab koi kapde nahin khareed raha (The bride will of course buy the lehenga, but no one is buying clothes for relatives), he says, folding a bright red sari.Kunal Singh Chhabra, 18, the store owners son who is overseeing operations at the shop today, says sales have gone down by 80 per cent. The first three days after November 8 saw zero business. Even now, the ones who come to us insist on giving us old notes. So we take the money from them and send our boys to queue up outside banks, says Chhabra, who is an undergraduate student in Mumbai and is in the Capital on a break.However, he backs the demonetisation move. I want to become a politician when I grow up. So I think it is brilliant.All along Katra Asharfi, the lane in Chandni Chowk that has over 200 bridal-wear shops, including Chhabra Store, most are empty, with desperate salesmen calling out to people on the road. Across the street, there are lines but outside banks and ATMs.Chhabra, however, is hopeful. Have you seen the movie Band Baaja Baaraat? The actors in the movie say no matter what, weddings will happen. That is absolutely true. Just give it some time, says the budding businessman.A little more than a kilometre away is Dariba Kalan, the Mughal-era bazaar for silver jewellery. There have been no customers since morning. We have lost 70 per cent of our business. The artisans are suffering, they are not accepting cheques, complains Vineet Seth, 48, who owns Durgadas Seth Jewellers and Silversmiths. He is also anxious about the rumours that have been doing the rounds. People are very scared. Look around, most shops are shut. We have been receiving messages on WhatsApp about possible raids by the Income Tax Department, says Seth, who is also the general secretary of the Dariba Jewellers Association.Apart from the silver stock thats piling up in his shop  jewellery, bowls and cups  Seth is worried about his top-selling gift item, silver boxes with framed notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. No one wants them now. I have to get these notes replaced. Now, people are only buying silver coins worth Rs 250, he says.Seth is not completely convinced about the demonetisation, rattling off a few idioms to express his state of mind: We have entered a tunnel, lets see if there is light at the end of it Dekhein oont kis karwat baithta hai (Lets see how it goes), he says.A kilometre away is Kinari Bazar, the one-stop shop for wedding bling  shimmery laces, envelopes, turbans for grooms and chooda-kaleere (bangles) for the bride. Modi ji ne bahut accha kiya, sabko barbaad kar diya (PM Modi did a very good thing, he killed our business)! says Piyush Gupta, 30, who owns a shop in the market. Business has gone down by 50 per cent. People are opting for court marriages, no one wants turbans and bangles anymore. We sell items worth Rs 10, 20 and 50. But the few people who come to us come with Rs 2,000 and we turn them away, he says.***Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vessels Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vesselsShaadi ka mazaa hi nahin hain (the wedding fervour is missing), says Deepaks sister Bhavna. Around her, everything is moving at an unhurried pace, with little to suggest that Deepak will take his wedding vows in a few hours from now. There is no decoration  no marigold flowers or electrical streamers  no trays of food going around, no piled-up gifts.The family had got the wedding invitations printed before the notes were scrapped, but not everyone who received the invitation is here. Though I sent invitations to my four sisters, eventually, I asked only two of them to come. The other two have big families. Where would they have stayed? Now they wont invite me for their childrens weddings, worries Amita, hurriedly collecting her belongings to get dressed at a neighbours home. Beauty parlour bhi nahi gaye, khud hi taiyaar ho rahe hain (We are not going to the salon either), says Bhavna.Ram Veer, 23, a mehndi artiste from Aligarh who visits Delhi during the wedding season every year, says its been an exceptionally bad season for him too. We charge Rs 50 for designs per hand, but that hardly gets us any money. We usually make all our money from bridal mehndi  Rs 1,500 for both hands and feet. Earlier, we would be booked for the entire season, but this year, there are no customers, only cancellations, says Ram Veer, sitting on a stool outside a beauty salon at Sitaram Gali.Unlike the Golas, many families have also cancelled their orders for wedding cards. We have stacks and stacks of printed invitations but customers havent been collecting them. All the customers just disappeared. Sab thap ho gaya hai (Business has shut completely), says C P Singh, 42, owner of Maharaja Papers and Cards in Chawri Bazar, the Capitals biggest market for invitation cards. I have been sitting here for hours People say demonetisation is a good move, but I dont know, it all seems uncertain now, he says, looking out at the empty street.As the sun begins to set, there is some sign of activity at the Jattumal Dharamshala. Two workers from Radhe Radhe Snacks and Caterers, an 80-year-old shop in Chandni Chowks Sitaram Gali, have arrived. The menu is basic: samosa and chai. For its owner Pradeep Sharma, 45, that is a severe downgrade. Usually, there are 250-odd items on the menu during the wedding season. Kashmiri aloo, shahi paneer, kadai paneer, tawa sabzi they are all off the menu now. Clients are only asking for potato dishes. Four of my orders have been cancelled. At the Gola wedding too, we are only making snacks, he says.Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they say Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they sayThough the sudden note ban forced the Golas to trim their wedding expenses, Deepak had booked the band, dhol and photographers in advance. We had already given them some advance payment and they said if we cancelled, we wouldnt get the amount back. We still have to pay them some money. Right now, its all on credit, says Deepak, now slipping into his sherwani in the courtyard. His sister Bhavna and elder brother Sonu, 30, help him with the accessories. Indu has gone to a friends house to get her hair done.Outside, members of Rahul Band are getting impatient. Panch baje se aaye hain, pata nahin kab baraat niklegi (We have been here since 5 pm, dont know when the procession will leave), says band master Moolchand, dressed in a blue velvet outfit with yellow trimmings.Moolchand and his team of 11, all from Mahua village in Uttar Pradesh, come to the Capital only during the wedding season, and play bass drums, trombones, French horns, bugles, and sousaphones, set to tunes of old Bollywood songs. This time, however, Moolchand says, their trip has been wasted. This is our fifth wedding of the season, but we havent earned much. Some tell us to take cheques, but what will we do with that? says Moolchand, who has signed up for the Gola wedding for Rs 12,000. He has got no money so far.The dholwallahs, who have spread out in the courtyard now, are worried too. They are from Solapur in Maharashtra and, like members of the Rahul Band, make trips to Delhi during the wedding season. We are supposed to get Rs 6,000 for this wedding, lets see. Hopefully, they will enjoy the music and gives us good shagun (money), says Raja Chouhan, 23. We will stay back till March. If the income isnt good, we will return to Solapur.Dressed in a blue shirt, trousers, a red jacket and a red hat, Chouhan is keeping an eye on Rahul Band. We will have to make sure we lead the baraat. If we go first, before the bandwallahs, we will get to pick the money the guests throw, he says.***In the courtyard, Bhavna is giving final touches to the groom. A dupatta is tied around Deepaks waist, a turban placed on his head and a garland of Rs 10 notes put on him. Deepak turns emotional. Wiping away tears and hugging his siblings, he begins to head out. His mother and sister Indu still havent arrived.His best friend, also called Love (Anand), arrives with another garland of Rs 10 notes, interspersed with a few Rs 100 notes. Dost ke liye itna toh karna tha (I had to do this for my friend). It cost me Rs 1,500, he says, patting his friend on the back and posing for a photograph with the garland.Its dark now and the videographers flashbulb lights up the courtyard. For a little while, at least, the tension dissipates and Deepak tries to enjoy his big day. The revelry picks pace as the band begins playing the song Ye desh hai veer jawanon ka, and Deepak and his friends and relatives break into a dance. A few in the crowd pout for selfies and pose for photographer Vikas Kumar.Kumar and videographer Dharam Singh, from SR Studio, are happy to oblige everyone, though they admit being worried about their payments. They booked us for Rs 35,000 for three days. But now, that it is just a one-day function, I dont know Let them have a good time today, we will discuss money later, smiles Kumar, rushing to take the grooms photograph with his sister Indu, who has arrived in a dazzling green sari, matching eye-shadow, and crimped hair.After a few rituals, the group heads to the street outside, where Ajay Giri, 24, has been waiting with Rani, the mare which Deepak will soon mount. Rani is dressed for the occasion  a jasmine garland around her ears and a red, velvet cloth on her back. Giri and Rani have been booked for Rs 10,000, but all that money goes to his owner. The only money Giri makes is the shagun, usually in notes of Rs 100 and 500, or even 1,000 if he gets lucky. These days, he barely gets Rs 200 in all for a wedding. Earlier, Rani would do three weddings in one night; now one and some days, none. Here too, I am sure Rani will get gud (jaggery) and I will get nothing, he says.He is right. Bhavna feeds Rani some jaggery and Deepak climbs on to the mare with some help from his friends. Giri is forgotten.Finally, Deepak Golas baraat begins to take shape. The air is filled with beats of the band and dhol and the wedding procession dances with abandon. Neighbours look out, bodies bent over window sills and parapets of roofs. One of Deepaks uncles takes out a bundle of Rs 10 notes and flings it on the groom. As the band and dholwallahs rush to grab the notes, the uncle quickly collects the notes and stuffs them in his jacket. Disappointed, the band and dholwallahs return to their spots and switch to a new track, Aaj mere yaar ki shadi hai. Happy with the new song, another relative tosses some money in the air and this time, band master Moolchand alerts his team members in time. Two of them rush and get the money.The procession begins, making its way past homes and shops, many of which have signboards of Yahan udhaar mana hai (No credit here) placed outside. The procession holds up traffic on the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk.A few metres away from New Delhi Railway Station, the band, dhol and ghodi are relieved and members of the baraat accommodate themselves into a few cars, some of their friends and relatives, the others hired. They are off to Nand Nagri in East Delhi, where Deepaks bride is waiting for them.Ladki waalon ne sirf pachas logon ka khana rakhwaya hai. Kya kar sakte hain, choti shadi hi hogi (The girls side has arranged for food for 50 people only. What can we do, it will be a small wedding), smiles Amita, squeezed into the rear seat of a car.Wedding budget: Rs 58,000Deepak with his bride Priya.

Tomato farmers are throwing their produce in the fields or feeding it to animals because they are not getting even the cost incurred on transporting the produce to the market.The same problem is being faced by potato growers, said Doshi, adding, we want to convey this message to the nation how Gujarati farmers are suffering due to the demonetisation policy of the BJP government at the Centre.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed farmers in Deesa, around 100 km from Mehsana.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

I think political life of India has to accept that right under our nose, people are changing as far as their habits are concerned,"" he said.Giving out details of digital outlets in the country, the Finance Minister said there are 14 lakh POS machines which are there at retail level and this figure has to be expanded manifold.These machines are not manufactured in India, they are imported, he added.""Additionally, with regard to banks' existing customers, debit cards and prepaid cards, e-wallets as well as mobile apps, are going to be utilised by them. They are ready with their infrastructure,"" he said.Noting that one startling figure that came out in the course of meeting today is that there are already 80 crore cards in circulation, of which 40 crore are being actively used by people, he said this is a change which is already happening and therefore this has to be used as a great opportunity to further catalyse this change.""One of the principle single agenda for the meeting was to expand digital banking itself...objective of this meeting was to appeal to the banking system and prepare them in mission mode for expediting this entire exercise,"" he said.Defending the demonetisation drive, the Finance Minister said one of the principal objectives of the reform that has been undertaken by the government is that physical currency must shrink.The economy, he added however, has to expand and the trade has to expand and therefore what shrinks has to be substituted and further expanded by the digital mode.In order to promote digital banking a task force is being set-up under Anil Kumar Khachi, Additional Secretary in Department of Financial Services, which is going to oversee this entire exercise, especially with regard to POS machines, Jaitley said.Observing that there has been expansion in debit cards, e-wallets and other modes of transactions in the last few years, he said there has also been a series of mobile apps that have come up which facilitate payment.""When we look at the figure we see that the change is already taking place and the present exercise gives us great opportunity to catalyse that change at a greater speed,"" he said.So, the Finance Ministry has emphasised to the banks that this is a great business opportunity for them because a lot more transactions are going to come into the banking system, he said, adding therefore, they have to take it up with their existing customers and others on a mission mode.In this direction, most banks have already begun a promotional exercise by waiving-up to end December MDR charges on debit cards, he said.Banks will now be focusing on significantly stepping-up transactions in mission mode through alternate banking channels such as NEFT, mobile wallets, pre-paid cards, QR (Quick Response) codes, pay-roll cards, debit and credit cards and Unified Payments Interface (UPI).Besides, Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has been asked to promote digital transaction through advertising campaign including demonstration videos on how to use cards and other modes for cash less transactions.During the video conferencing with heads of the banks, the Finance Minister exhorted lenders to restart normal lending activities and in particular Mudra loans as the rush at bank branches is now reducing.These would help meet restocking requirements of enterprises by way of working capital delivered through Mudra cards, he added.With regard to rural lending, Jaitley said, sowing season for Rabi and crops like potato is currently underway in many States.""Necessary resources for the purpose have been provided by NABARD and daily releases to DCCBs (District Co-operative Banks) are a focus area of monitoring,"" he said."

IMD to issue ‘customised’ weather advisories to help farmers",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/rain-sunshine-or-drought-imd-to-issue-customised-weather-advisories-to-help-farmers-4409240/,2016-12-04,"Better access to satellite data and improved forecasting models will help the IMD issue more accurate advisories Better access to satellite data and improved forecasting models will help the IMD issue more accurate advisoriesThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) will soon be able to deliver custom-made, weather-based crop advisories, in association with grass-root level organisations that will act as a bridge between the department and the farmers.Watch what else is in the newsDr Nabansu Chattopadhyay, deputy director-general, AgriMet department, IMD, said the move will help them customise their advisories for the benefit of farmers, rather than issuing district or block-level weather advisories.Since 2008, the AgriMet department has been issuing district-level weather forecasts for farmers. These advisories, which include information on temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, cloudiness and wind speed, are issued for a span of five days.Based on these parameters, the AgriMet field units issue specific crop-based advisories for the district, intended to help farmers plan their agricultural activities.However, the district-level forecast is not always sufficient to meet the requirements of individual farmers, given the wide variation in the above five parameters a single district can experience, said Chattopadhyay.For example, while areas like Maval and Mulshi may experience excess rainfall, Baramati and Shirur often have to face drought-like situation. Small and marginal land holders, who comprise about 80 per cent of the cultivators in the country, were the worst hit by the vagaries of nature.A recent study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has shown that proper advisories can increase production by 25 per cent, said the IMD official. Better access to satellite data as well as newer and improved forecasting models would now enable IMD to customise their advisories, said Chattopadhyay.In order to understand the specific needs of farmers, we intend to tie up with grass-root level organisations. These organisations will help us build bridges with the local community and help us receive feedback from farmers, he said.The advisories will not only include five climatic parameters, they would also include details on how to improve productivity by fighting diseases or pest attacks. Citing an example from West Bengal, Chattopadhyay said farmers from the state had asked for prior information to fight diseases and pests which tend to attack the potato crop.This project is part of a global initiative which would be funded by agencies like the UNDP, World Bank etc. While the accuracy of district-level forecasts seem to have increased in the last few years, a recent study by IMD scientists pointed to certain shortcomings. The model had failed to determine the temperature in hilly areas accurately and the accuracy of the prediction was lesser for northeastern regions.While the weather predictions were 60-80 per cent accurate for states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, they had varied between 40-50 per cent for Haryana. The study had shown that weather predictions for states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh required improvement in accuracy levels.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a186e7be9e033fa42f633,Pro-democracy groups make record gains in Hong Kong polls,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/586213/pro-democracy-groups-make-record.html,2016-12-12,"Pro-democracy groups make record gains in Hong Kong pollsBeijing/Hong Kong, Dec 12, 2016 (PTI) 19:03 ISTChina faced a grim scenario in Hong Kong as pro-democracy groups have made record gains in polls for Election Committee, which will elect the former British territory's next Chief Executive who unlike his predecessor may have to toe a balanced line to address growing anti-Beijing resentment.Amid a high turnout the pro-democracy group have won 362 of the 733 seats, although pro-Beijing groups will still have a big majority, official poll results said.Critics say the results show the undemocratic nature of the system as people in different sectors voted for representatives in the Committee instead of a direct election system.The Committee elects the Chief Executive who would be the chief administrator.Candidates running for chief executive have to be nominated by the 1,200-strong Election Committee - and need a majority of votes from the committee to win. The committee's members are made up of delegates from special interest groups.Analysts say despite the gains by pro-democracy groups, the pro-Beijing majority ensures the battle will be between figures favourable to the mainland government, BBC reported.The main contenders for the post are Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang who is regarded as a more moderate alternative to the outgoing leader Leung Chun-ying, who was accused of focussing more on protecting Chinas interests fuelling discontent specially among the youth.Known as ""Uncle Pringles"" for a moustache similar to one worn by a character on a potato crisp brand's packaging, Tsang is a US-educated fencing and martial arts enthusiast who has been the finance minister since July 2007.The big wins by pan-democrats was seen as reflection of dissatisfaction with the current government, and the slow pace of democratic reforms.Lit Ming-wai, of Health Professionals For Democracy 30, said it was a big surprise for the pro-democracy group to win all 30 seats in the subsector.Only nine pan-democrats or allies won in the 2011 polls. ""It reflects that the Election Committee poll is more than just an election, but is a fight to safeguard our core values,"" she told Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.""If chief executive aspirants want to take our votes, they must incorporate our calls for democratic political reform in their manifesto,"" she said.Camille Lam Tsz-kwan, of the group CoVision16, said victory by pan-democrats in the architectural subsector reflected its strong support for democracy. ""The sector was not hotly contested before and the pro-establishment camp used to take the seats. But now we know there are actually a lot of pro-democracy voters in the field.""In 2014, tens of thousands of people demonstrated for weeks to demand a one-man, one-vote election for chief executive, but they failed to win any concessions from Beijing."
