But for members of Mar Thoma Church, the true spirit of Christmas is all about caring for the environment. From the last nine consecutive years, the members have been making the churchs Christmas tree from trash.This year the 25-foot-tall tree has been made using waste cardboard boxes and the wreaths have been made using potato and onion sacks. The tree was officially inaugurated with lighting and Christmas carol service on Sunday at Mar Thoma Church on Primrose Road, near Hosmat Hospital.Daniel Thomas, a church member, told DH that 20 school and college students collected over 400 cardboard boxes and 35 sacks. Some members brought a few items from their homes and neighbourhood while some were purchased from those selling recycled items. The boxes were then painted and put up using a pulley and ladder. The tree was made in three weeks. he said.Recycling itemsThomas said the idea is to spread the message that before things go to dump, they have one more life. By creating Bengalurus tallest Christmas tree out of recycled items, the church wants to tell people that not everything needs to be thrown away, some can be used again."

(AP Photos/Massoud Hossaini) The family, along with another 242 cave-dwelling households dotted around the capital of Bamiyan province, also called Bamiyan, could be forced to move soon. (AP Photos/Massoud Hossaini)Marzia and her husband Qadeer thought themselves lucky when they moved into a 1, 700-year-old Buddhist cave hand-carved into the side of a mountain in Afghanistans central highlands. It was clean and dry, warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and there was plenty of work on the local farms. But now, even this bare-bones way of life is threatened.The family, along with another 242 cave-dwelling households dotted around the capital of Bamiyan province, also called Bamiyan, could be forced to move soon.Watch What Else Is making NewsThey are whats left of around 10,000 families who have been relocated over the past decade as part of the local governments program to protect the unique man-made grottoes that it hopes will transform Bamiyan into a global tourist destination once Afghanistans war with the insurgent Taliban, now in its 16th year, is finally over.The couple moved here from neighbouring Maidan-Wardak province because they believed it was a stepping stone to a better future.We had no money and my husband couldnt get a job, Marzia said as she breastfed her baby. We left because we were poor.But 12 years later they are still living in the cave, along with their five children aged from 10 months to 8 years, including 6-year-old Freshta who hasnt been the same since a land mine exploded close by her four years ago. Her mental development stopped and she spends most of her time lolling on the thin mat that covers the caves floor.Any original features, such as the brightly-coloured geometric murals that were painted by the monks who created these caves, are long gone. Theyve been destroyed by time, the elements and the wear-and-tear of hundreds of years of habitation, including the fires that residents build for cooking and heat.The provincial government is working with UNESCO to restore the valleys eight significant sites, including the Ghulghulah fortress, believed to be Bamiyans original staging post on the old Silk Road that linked China to India. The fortress was razed by Genghis Khans hoards in the early 13th Century and never regained its glory.Life here is difficult, Marzia, 30, said. Water must be fetched from a nearby stream, and a 9-volt battery charges a solar panel that provides light after dark. Cooking is done on a stove fuelled by a gas bottle. They have installed a door and a step up into the one room that all seven members of the family share. Smaller caves outside are used for storage.On the rural outskirts of the city, amid the rutted fields where the provinces main potato crop is grown, the cave-dwellers do what they can with their meagre resources, determined that the next generation will have a better life.As Shiite Muslims of the Hazara minority they have suffered historic persecution, but they have also benefited from immense largesse from international charities and governments.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
590a2b237be9e033b96eb739,Thorny issue of who will pay for climate damage simmers at UN talks,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/thorny-issue-of-who-will-pay-for-climate-damage-simmers-at-un-talks-4370035/,2016-11-11,"At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. (source: AP) At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. (source: AP)Bangladesh is set to make a splash at the UN climate talks in Morocco when experts and officials present a proposal for a national body to deal with the losses and damage the low-lying South Asian nation expects to suffer from climate change. The body, if established, would be a first among developing countries vulnerable to worsening droughts, floods, storms and rising seas  all threats to development in Bangladesh, where about a third of people live beneath the poverty line.Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development  who chaired an expert group on developing a National Mechanism on Loss and Damage  said the proposal had been given to the Bangladeshi prime minister, who is due in Marrakesh early next week.Watch what else is making news:I am pleased to see that the government of Bangladesh is taking such a pro-active position at the national level on this important topic, Huq said.Loss and damage from climate change has been a controversial topic at the UN talks over the past decade, mainly because it asks a tough question: Who should pay to repair the harm done by planet-warming emissions? Aid agencies say loss and damage occurs when stresses made worse by climate change  such as creeping deserts or rising seas  are too severe for people to overcome. That can mean losing your home as shores and river banks crumble, no longer being able to farm a degraded plot of land, or even the disappearance of culture after communities are scattered by repeated weather disasters.Following push-back from industrialised countries worried about being forced to pay for the cost of climate damage, governments agreed in 2013 to create the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM).At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. But for that happen, they had to accept a stipulation that the loss and damage provision in the agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation  a demand from the United States backed by other rich nations.At the November 7-18 climate change talks in Marrakesh, negotiators are sparring over when and how to conduct a planned review of the WIM, which has had little more than a year to get going on its key tasks. They include setting up a clearing house for information on climate risk insurance and a task force on climate-linked displacement.HOT POTATOBut it is the financing of measures to address loss and damage that remains the key sticking point.Who should pay for it? The hot potato of responsibility is being moved around, said Olivia Serdeczny, a research analyst with Climate Analytics and an advisor to vulnerable countries on loss and damage. The sources of finance is an issue that remains untouched. Most of the discussions around finance for loss and damage have focused on providing insurance against disasters  a popular measure with rich nations.In June 2015, for example, G7 states announced an effort to increase by up to 400 million the number of people in low and middle-income countries with access to insurance coverage against climate-related hazards, by 2020. But aid experts argue insurance cannot be the only financial tool to help people faced with loss and damage.Harjeet Singh of the global charity ActionAid said insurance does not work well for longer-term shifts such as sea-level rise and melting glaciers. But there is a reluctance to move beyond insurance on the part of developed states in the UN loss and damage discussions, he noted.CARE International says the WIM should develop instruments that can generate $50 billion in new cash annually by 2020. Sven Harmeling, climate change advocacy coordinator for the development agency, said there was a growing awareness that other types of funding would be needed, beyond insurance.At this stage, no one denies there is a problem, he said. There is a bit of a progress in terms of willingness to discuss what process might work, but not in terms of We will pay for the damage.ADAPTATION LIMITSThat is a key reason for this weeks hiccup in Marrakesh over the review of the WIM, which was due to be completed at these talks. Developing countries want the review to happen over the next year and cover the future of the mechanism, while developed countries fear that could trigger new demands over finance. Either way, it is clear the thorny problem wont just disappear, and needs more work.In a recent paper, Austrian researchers Reinhard Mechler and Thomas Schinko at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis said major scientific challenges remain, in particular to better understand the physical and social limits of adaptation  in other words, where loss and damage starts. Making more accurate projections of rising climate risks and the associated costs of measures to prevent and respond to loss and damage could help move the discussion forward, they added.In the meantime, Bangladesh is not waiting around. A 2010 World Bank study estimated the country would lose some $121 billion, or 5 percent of national GDP, between 2005 and 2050 due to climatic variability, including impacts such as a fall in rice production. Singh said the proposal to set up a national mechanism for loss and damage was a way of trying to speed solutions.It is saying we need to make progress faster at the international level, and we are ready to act at the national level, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
590a2e5f7be9e033b96eb8e9,Concerns and challenges,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/583127/concerns-challenges.html,2016-11-25,"Commander (rtd) Chaitanya Chandel and Bidanda Chengappa Nov 26, 2016, 0:09 ISTAfter the 26/11 strike, though Navy is designated as nodal coastal security agency, it is not operationally oriented to take up this task.Today, coastal security remains as vulnerable to sea-borne threats as when Ajmal Kasab and his cohorts landed ashore and threatened Mumbai eight years ago on November 26, 2008.While the Indian Navy (IN), the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and the state police forces handle operations at sea, a multiplicity of agencies like the Department of Fisheries, mercantile marine departments of the coastal states, Director General Lighthouses, Ministry of Shipping and the Department of Ports among a host of others are stakeholders. Therefore, coastal security is a shared responsibility not limited solely to the IN, ICG and state police.Coastal security straddles both the military and police roles and therefore needs a force that can operate both like the navy as well as the police. Globally, the coast guard is the force of choice that carries out this role being inferior to the navy in war-fighting capabilities but superior to the police in training and firepower, besides airborne and marine platforms.However, today, both the ICG and IN lack the legal powers to arrest and hold boats and personnel at sea. Operationally, the powers to file a First Information Report (FIR) from the sea, as well as to seize and detain personnel and boats are essential to fulfil the police function of this role. There is also a need to streamline the process to hand over the FIR, personnel, boats and contraband/ material from the IN or CG to the police for further action under the Indian Criminal Procedure Code.After the 26/11 sea-borne terrorist strike, though the IN is designated as the nodal coastal security agency, it is not operationally oriented to take up this task. The IN is primarily oriented and equipped for a war-fighting role. Its professional expertise is to sail the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles and engage hostile vessels either during war or peace. On the other hand, coastal security also requires intensive patrolling from the coastline to 12 nautical miles where the waters are dense with smaller craft which sail in this marine space.It is estimated that around 2.5 lakh small boats and vessels ply these waters for fishing and transport. The state police forces are supposed to patrol these coastal waters to pre-empt illegal activities as well as the movement of terrorists.Unfortunately, the state police is a land-oriented force and unable to cope with the marine environment. The police are dependent on the IN and ICG who have adequate exposure at sea and the capability to cope with eventualities there. The ICG has a charter to concentrate on the sea between 12 to 200 nautical miles and therefore cannot constantly check the large volume of smaller boats that ply between the coastline and 12 nautical miles that have the potential to transport terrorists or contraband.To manage coastal security operations across peninsular India, it is necessary to establish state-level operations rooms with cross-functional teams from all agencies involved which will prove a force multiplier for the ICG. There is also a ne-ed to supplement the existing infrastructure for logistics, technical support and training as well as optimise the use of existing boats and assets. Experience with the IN and ICG can be used to improve procurement of equipment with an indi-genous focus which can be supported in the country. This will help alleviate problems with equipment maintenance and spares those coastal police forces face.It seems logical that boat movement into and out of Indian waters needs to be regulated to ensure coastal security. However, no progress has been made towards tracking fishing boats. This remains a contentious issue and a political hot potato since large fishing fleet owners contribute to party election funds.In itself, this single lacuna nullifies pro-gress made on every other front. It needs to be understood that every fishing boat that is tracked becomes part of the coast-al security system. Every boat logged into the system amounts to a pair of eyes and ears at sea. Conversely, every boat not in the system remains a potential threat.Information sharingThe problems of information sharing and maritime domain awareness can be solved with technologies like Geographic Information Systems and knowledge management systems which would help share operations plots and specialised knowledge currently with each agency.They would also provide common platforms to bring together operational and support agencies, besides creating synergy, to enable free flow of information and enhance transparency. Today, much more needs to be done in the areas of information and plot sharing among various agencies which continue to remain isolated from each other.The technology and capability to do so is available within the country and must be used as far as possible to avoid reliance on foreign vendors. New breakthroughs in technology make fishing boat tracking and communications at the national scale an exciting field. While costs remain a concern, making this field a focus area for startups through provision of tax breaks should help to produce breakthroughs.Over the last eight years, there has been considerable progress on coastal security over intelligence sharing and inter-agency communication at the national level. Today, coastal security remains New Delhi-centric where the cabinet secretary annually chairs a few meetings of the National Committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security.However, the nine coastal state governments and four Union Territories relate to coastal security with varying degrees of seriousness. This is evident from the reports of the audits of Comptroller and Auditor General that highlight unspent budgets. Moreover, the state of boats, equipment and police organisational structure does not inspire confidence that security cannot be breached along the countrys 7,516-km coastline.(Chandel is involved with technology development for coastal security and Chengappa is a Professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies, Christ University, Bengaluru)"
590a30e57be9e033fa4304d9,Teabox to triple production capacity by March,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584656/teabox-triple-production-capacity-march.html,2016-12-03,"Teabox to triple production capacity by MarchNarayan Kulkarni, Dec 04, 2016, Bengaluru, DHNS 22:44 ISTTeabox, a global direct-to-consumer tea company, is looking at tripling its production capacity to 12,000 tea bags per day by March 2017, from the current capacity of 4,000 tea bags per day. The company has recently launched TeaPacs, individually packaged tea bags sealed at the source using a natural nitrogen flush that keeps tea fresh.Speaking to DH, Kaushal Dugar, founder and CEO of Teabox said, TeaPacs offers the highest quality loose-leaf teas from Teaboxs premium collection in a more convenient, on-the-go option, without compromising on flavour or freshness. We want to ensure that every cup of tea consumed is the freshest in the world, but we know that not everyone has time to steep loose leaf. So, we have created TeaPacs that anyone can enjoy anywhere and anytime.Dugar pointed out that Teabox is the worlds first company to use a natural nitrogen flush in the beverage market, a technique most commonly used in packaging food items, including potato chips.This innovative approach creates a non-reactive environment that protects the TeaPac tea from oxygen, light, heat and moisture  elements that compromise the integrity of tea, causing deterioration and ultimately, loss of flavour.Sharing the growth of the company, Dugar said, We are seeing multi-fold growth year-on-year. Since the time we started in 2012, Teabox has shipped over 35 million cups worth of teas to customers across 95 countries in a short span of time. We will be shipping to another three countries in the coming period, and will cross the 100-mark before the end of this year.In 2014-15, the company has shipped five million cups of tea. In 2015-16, the number of cups have increased to seven million. During the current fiscal, it has shipped about 14 million cups of tea.The company has raised $7.5 million in funding from Ratan Tata, who invested an undisclosed amount this year. Besides,Teabox is backed by Singapore-based JAFCO Asia, Accel Partners, Keystone Group LP and Dragoneer Investment Group.Looking at the growth of the company and demand for our products, we will continue to raise funds mid next year, Dugar added.We source premium loose-leaf teas from over 150 tea estates in Darjeeling, Nepal, Nilgiri, Assam and Kangra regions in India, he added.About the future plans, he said, I hope to give a Silicon Valley makeover to our tradition-bound tea industry. I want to introduce newer varieties of teas that are fresh and delicious that people can have anywhere in the world."

Be it buying groceries or objects of desire, there is a unique pleasure in visiting shops. For women, shopping gives them relief from the mental tension associated with daily chores. But I beg to differ.Though I often accompany my other half to the supermarket and jewellery shop, I feel out of place once I step in to the shops. At the supermarket, my job is to stand behind her and push the shopping cart while she leisurely picks up packets of foreign cheese and honey marketed by Patanjali.Though we returned from another country a few years ago after spending nearly quarter of a century there, the shopping pattern has not changed much. Extra virgin olive oil made in Spain, Anchor cheese and American apples! If my better half wants to spend more than five minutes in selecting an item, I happily tell her, Take your own time. Give me a missed call when you finish selecting your objects of desire.This is the time for me to roam around the supermarket. I go to the vegetable section and read the price of a kilogramme of potato and onion only to forget it within minutes. After that I go to the organic food section. Till date I have not found more than two customers buying from this counter. Then, I take a glass of payasam offered free of cost by the young girl who is there to promote the item.I say hello to the girl standing outside the perfume shop with a bottle of a new scent that she is desperately trying to sell. After spending more than 30 minutes at various sections in the supermarket without buying anything, I usually get the missed call from my wife. She would be near the cash counter with her shopping cart fully loaded. I once again check my wallet to confirm that there is enough cash.I pay the money to the cashier and push the cart all the way to the car. Accompanying my life partner to the jewellery shop is not pleasant either. When I enter the shop I feel trapped. When you go to a barber shop, there are magazines to read while you wait for your turn. If it is a dental clinic, there are old issues of popular magazines and other promotional materials from pharmaceutical companies.But in jewellery shops, I have never found any reading material for the customers. My problem: How to spend time while my partner shops for a gold chain? When I try to go for a coffee at a nearby shop, she tells: Wait, only ten minutes more. I still accompany my wife for shopping and pay all the bills as I have for many years. Life is like that."

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"
591f0b537be9e025a5d49fe8,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migration",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560567/bihar-state-litti-chokha-migration.html,2016-07-27,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migrationJustin Rowlatt, Jul 28, 2016, INYT: 23:29 ISTLitti are char-grilled flavour bombs, especially when freighted with chokha, the spicy stew of grilled aubergine, tomato and potato that traditionally accompanies one of my absolute favourite Indian street foods. They come originally from Bihar.Biharis absolutely love litti chokha, as  in truth  do most people who taste it. Put it like this, the first time I went to the Bihars capital, Patna, I had people in my office begging me to bring some back. I said Id do my best, but warned I was unlikely to be allowed any food through airport security checks.Nevertheless, I arrived for the return flight with two big bags full of the stuff. The security officers at Patna airport sniffed suspiciously, but, when I told them what and why, they broke into smiles and waved me right on through.Clearly, they judged it was more important to get a consignment of the states most celebrated street food to hungry fans than enforce a few petty restrictions and regulations.Litti are pastry balls, packed full of a spicy mash made with sattu  roasted chickpea flour. They are roasted in beds of charcoal  or, sadly a rarity these days, dried cow dung  and then dipped in salty melted ghee, clarified butter. A couple of these will be served with a decent dollop of chokha, as well as some yoghurt sauce and a scoop of hot, sour pickle. Yes, I thought that would get your mouth watering.You find litti wherever Biharis go, and since Biharis go almost everywhere in India, that means youve got a chance of tasting this delicious snack almost anywhere in the country. Youve got to keep your eyes peeled, though.Look out for the tell-tale pall of smoke from the charcoal and the queue of wiry, tough-looking men. Wiry men, because one of the few things Bihar is famous for in India  apart from litti  is migration.Historic cityThe state capital was once the greatest centre of learning and culture on the sub-continent. When the Greek ambassador Megasthenes visited in 302 BC  yes, it was a while back  he was stunned by Pataliputra, as Patna was then known. The city stretched for nearly 10 miles along the banks of the Ganges.It had, Megasthenes reported, 64 gates and 570 towers, not to mention gardens, palaces, temples and stables full of war elephants. I have seen the great cities of the east, he wrote, I have seen the Persian palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, but this is the greatest city in the world. No visitor would say that of Patna today.Buddha achieved enlightenment in Bihar, the state was home to worlds first residential university and was the powerbase from which Ashoka built the first pan-Indian empire, famous for its tolerance and pluralism. But sadly the capital has not  how shall I put this?  retained the elegance of the ancient city.Poverty-stricken stateTruth be told, modern Patna is a great sprawling, poverty-stricken megatropolis. Which should be no surprise because Bihar has a population of over 100 million people, larger than any western European country, and is one of the poorest states in India. It recorded an average per capita income of just $682 in 2015, less than half of the $1,627 average income nationally.Last year, I managed to get hold of a copy of a vast health survey carried out by the government with the UN agency for children, Unicef. The report had been due for publication in October 2014 but the government had decided to keep it secret.Flip through page after page of statistics and you can see why. Youll also discover why so many Biharis have decided to go in search of work elsewhere. The report shows that in 2013-14 half of children under the age of five in Bihar were stunted, a third were underweight and three quarters of households practised open defecation.Now comes the good news. A few years ago a new technocratic state government made tackling graft and promoting economic growth its priority, and Bihar  which had become a byword for caste division, crime and corruption  started scoring double-digit growth.Thats good news for the people of Bihar, but not for lovers of litti, like me. Because heres the rub: as a result, migration from the state has fallen dramatically.The fear is that the litti chokha stalls dotted across India that ensure that Bihari migrants still get a taste of the best of home will pack up shop and go home too. Then this wonderful street food snack will be even harder to find."

She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta) Parveen Khatoon, 12, along with her niece Noor, 7, begs for alms in trains in the Sealdah line everyday. She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)Parveen Khatoon has the power of invisibility.Inside the 1.30 pm Krishnanagar local from Sealdah, in a train full of dozing college students, domestic helps and suburban housewives out on shopping trips, no one has time for a 12-year-old gaunt girl begging for alms. Her pink panda t-shirt, her tight braid, her flower-printed harem pants, everything blends with the background. All that remains is a voice. Loud, high-pitched and melancholic: Garibon ki suno, woh tumhari sunega, tum ek paisa doge, woh dus lakh dega (If you listen to the pleas of the poor, God will listen to your prayers, you give us one paisa, He will give you 10 lakh rupees). The begging anthem of the country is Parveens fallback song. People look up, coins change hands. It always works, says Parveen, adjusting a sound box around her neck. The box is her only paraphernalia, a radio-like contraption with a speaker. It has about 30 songs in it. I play it for added effect while I sing, says Parveen.Last week, a 13-year-old girl fell off a Dhanbad-Jhargram passenger train in Jamshedpur district, sustaining injuries on her face and hand. While some reports said the girl, who begged for alms by singing in trains, had been thrown off by men who were teasing her, others said she fell while trying to get off the moving train.That girl could have been Parveen. But she dismisses any hint of concern by flexing her non-existent, little-girl muscles. Nothing like this would ever happen to me. I am strong, she says.Her mother, Neelam Begum, 37, however, fears the worst. Everyday, I am worried that I might hear bad news  that she has fallen off a train or that someone did something bad to her. But what can I do? I cant accompany her since I have to go out for work, she says.She is also afraid of Parveen falling into bad company. A lot of these children get into the habit of sniffing Dendrite (an adhesive), says Neelam, who works as a domestic help and earns about Rs 3,000 a month.The family of six  Neelam, her four daughters and a granddaughter  lives in Moulali, a slum in central Kolkata. Her husband deserted them years ago, says Neelam.Platform No. 4 of Dum Dum station is Parveens base for the day. Dum Dum is an arterial station in the citys rail network, connecting Kolkatas suburban trains with its underground rail network.Sprawled on the floor at one end of the platform are Parveens aunt Khaleda, 35, sister Shama, 14, and niece Noor, 7. They are eating their lunch  rice and potato curry  straight out of a tiffin carrier.I wake up at 5.30 in the morning and help my sister cook lunch before I leave for school at 6.30, says Parveen. Her school is a special one run by the Missionaries of Charity at Joragirja, a five-minute walk from her house. We have classes till 10.30, after which I run home to collect my music box and then head to Sealdah station, says Parveen. Her sister, niece and aunt join her soon after.There are about 20 beggar-singers at Dum Dum station alone, says Khaleda, Parveens aunt. They start their day at about noon. We usually dont board trains during the peak office-hour rush. No one has time for beggars then, says Parveen.Its 3 pm now and Dum Dum station wears a deserted look. Parveen is waiting for the 15.05 Habra-Sealdah train. This time, little Noor, all of seven, will accompany her. I started this business when I was seven too. There are six people at home and we all contribute, says Parveen, clutching Noors hand tightly as she starts moving towards the approaching train. During this time of the day, there are mainly college students. They like romantic numbers, she adds, pointing to a young couple engaged in an animated conversation at one end of the train.Parveen announces her presence by breaking into the 1992 Nadeem-Shravan melody from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor: Milne ki tum koshish karna, waada kabhi na karna (Make an effort to meet me, but never make a promise). The young woman looks up and blushes. The man hands Noor a Rs 10 note. Mission accomplished.On good days, we make about Rs 150, on normal days, Rs 100, says Parveen, counting her coins at Sealdah station. Its 3.30 pm and even the ever-buzzing Sealdah station is relatively quiet.Parveen has about 100 songs in her repertoire, from Hindi film classics to Bengali devotional songs. Most of the Bollywood hits are from the 1950s-60s and Nadeem- Shravan melodies from the 1990s.I love the song Tu meri zindagi hai from Aashiqui and also songs from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor, says Parveen. She strategically keeps patriotic numbers such as Ae mere watan ke logon for special occasions such as Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti and Netajis birthday. We also sing patriotic songs when there is an important cricket match, smiles Parveen.At the station, Parveen points to a group of teenagers engaged in an animated discussion. They are Sealdah beggars, we try not to encroach into their territory. We have one route, they have another. But things do get ugly at times, she says, pointing to a scar on her arm.Parveen takes the Sealdah-Dum Dum route about eight times a day. The journey of about 20 minutes each way never really wears her off, she says. What does tire her is the regular harassment by the hawkers association and the occasional threats of the Railway Protection Force.Ticket-checkers never bother us. Even the police just come and shoo us away a few times a year, but hawkers shower us with abuses ever time we walk past them. They say we shouldnt be begging here, that we are creating a nuisance, that we will be run over by a train someday, says Parveen.Sukumar Das, working president of the Dum Dum Station Hawkers Union, says, These children have no idea of the danger they are in. They rush from one platform to the other. They run on tracks. They get into crowded trains. An accident is waiting to happen. They are chased away by the RPF every few months, but they return after a few days, says Das.What else are we supposed to do? asks Parveen as she walks up to another Dum Dum-bound train  for the third time in the day.Its 6 pm and Dum Dum station is abuzz with office crowd. They are the stingiest. Even if they ever give you something, its not more than a rupee, says Parveen.Little Noor and Parveen are about to make the last trip of the day. Back home, there is dinner to be made, tuitions to be attended, homework to be finished and and episode of Sath Nibahana Sathiya to be caught. The 18.07 Bongaon local enters the platform. A surge of humanity rushes towards the train. Parveen grabs Noors hand and disappears into the crowd.Parveen Khatoon is invisible.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

An agriculture scientist addresses a meeting in Umerkote.Two Bhubaneswar-based institutes of ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) plan to adopt at least two villages in Nabarangpur, an effort to promote the growth of micronutrient-rich crops and help tribals arm themselves against malnutrition.Last week, scientists of Bhubaneswars Central Tuber Crop Research Institute and Central Institute for Women in Agriculture visited Sukhigaon and Biriguda villages in Umerkote and Pondripokhana village in Raighar to assess local requirements.CTCRI director Dr Archana Mukherjee, who heads the six-member team, said the intervention by ICAR institutes was prompted by The Indian Expresss District Zero series on poverty and change in the district. The District Zero series was haunting us. When our director general Trilochan Mohapatra asked us to do something for the hunger hotspots, we thought what could be a better place than Nabarangpur to focus on. Our project was conceived last month. Our aim is to bring freedom from hunger and malnutrition, said Mukherjee.CTCRI focuses on research on sweet potato and aroids catering to the needs of the eastern and northeastern regions. CIWA focuses on agricultural technologies and policies with a womens perspective and undertakes studies to understand drudgery and safety-related issues of women farmers.Dr Rajasekhara Rao Korada, principal scientist at CTCRI and coordinator of the project, said they would focus on making nutrition available between January and June before the arrival of monsoon. Between January and June there is little food in a tribal household. At CTCRI we have varieties of sweet potato that could address the beta carotene deficiency and vitamin deficiency in tribal women and children. The sweet potatoes developed by us need very little water and would be suitable for Nabarangpur, he said.The two institutes will also help grow nutrient-rich colacasia and tapioca. These will reduce dependence on potato available in he market. Every day, they can harvest one or two such tubers till June, said Korada.CTCRI, which has also conducted research on pulses, plans to introducing green gram and horse gram that would mature in 90 days. Our objective is to intervene in their dietary practice and improve upon it to enhance its nutritional value. The tribals of Nabarangpur mostly eat dalma, a recipe of boiled pulses and vegetables. We will give them good saplings of papaya, banana and drumstick, which they can use in preparing dalma, said Dr Mukherjee.As per the BPL census of Odisha, over 73.6 per cent people in Nabarangpur live below the poverty line. According to the women and child development department, 3,400 children in the district suffer from malnutrition, 296 of them severely.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Rana Simranjit Singh) Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal during a tour of Khadoor Sahib constituency shortly after the Congress MLA resigned. (Source: Rana Simranjit Singh)On February 13, Khadoor Sahib will elect an MLA who will serve for hardly a year before Punjab goes to polls. That is the way one section of the Congress would like to view it as it urges the leadership to ignore the bypoll and focus instead on the larger battle. The Aam Aadmi Party has already opted out. The other section in the Congress, however, would rather not give the Shiromani Akali Dal a walkover, especially with the high symbolism involved.The assembly seat is a segment of Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency in the border district of Tarn Taran. Three reasons make the bypoll a prestige battle for the Akalis. Khadoor Sahib is frequently identified with a panthic character. Out of the nine segments of the Lok Sabha constituency, the Congress won only three in the 2012 assembly polls, and Khadoor Sahib was one of them. Third, the Congress MLA has resigned for panthic reasons.Ramanjit Singh Sikki stepped down last October to protest against the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari and the governments inability to bring the guilty to book. Clear that they could not afford to lose the seat now, the Akalis took up the battle immediately. As early as November, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal went on a sangat darshan tour through the constituency and allocated Rs 35 crore for various civic projects there. Apart from identity politics, the Akalis are also worried about a defeat being interpreted as a sign of anti-incumbency.A defeat for the Congress, on the other hand, could reflect poorly on new state party chief Capt Amarinder Singh, considering that it is a seat the Congress holds. But it is Amarinders political strategist, Prashant Kishor, who has suggested that the party ignore the inconsequential bypoll and concentrate on 2017 instead, a source in their camp said. The other camp is worried about opting out being interpreted as running away. The central leadership is yet to decide.Sikki is keen to recontest. Known as a potato king for his cultivation and cold stores, he is an Amarinder loyalist who quit as MLA without consulting then AICC chief Partap Bajwa. Sikki has not been talking in public of late. He will contest if the high command wants him to, said his aide Rana Gurjit. Last time, Sikki won by barely 3,000 votes.The Akali candidate is Ravinder Singh Brahmpura, a choice that could reopen old rivalries. Ravinder is the son of Ranjit Brahmpura, the sitting MP from Khadoor Sahib. In the 2012 assembly elections, Sikki had defeated the father, whom the SAD fielded for the Lok Sabha two years later.Ravinder Brahmpura said he had been looking forward to a contest with the AAP and the Congress. But it seems both parties have chickened out, he said. I will win. People are sick of Sikki, who has not kept in touch with them. He tried to win brownie points by playing the Sikh card and resigning. But it has worked against him.AAP is widely seen as a strong challenger to the Congress and the SAD-BJP in 2017. Its decision to stay out should come as a relief to both sides, but it still leaves other potential spoilers in the fray. Two AAP rebels, Bhai Baldeep Singh and Sumail Singh Sidhu, have announced that they will contest as independents. Yogendra Yadavs splinter group Swaraj Lehar is behind Bhai Baldeep.AAP state convener Sucha Singh Chotepur said they could not afford to spend so much on an election for the sake of being in the assembly for only a few months. Our party has neither the money nor the energy to be wasted on this election. We are prepared for 2017 even if they announce the polls today, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
591f89a27be9e025a5d4f686,Optimism will prevail,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/523269/optimism-prevail.html,2016-01-15,"N Janardhan, January 16, 2016 0:09 ISTOptimism will prevail : There are several reasons why stormy ties between the two major countries of the region will not result in a full-scale war.It is worth risking being on the wrong side of pessimism. So, here is an optimistic analysis of the Saudi Arabia-Iran tension that has metamorphosed into a full-scale diplomatic war, exposing the deep cleavages of the Sunni-Shiite conflict in West Asia.The feud will remain at this delicate stage at its worst and not escalate into a military war, as some analysts fear. It is in nobodys interest for the two regional giants to get more aggressive than they already have. There are enough regional proxy wars that Saudi Arabia and Iran are already involved in for them to realise that continued war is not the answer. This conflictual relationship is unsustainable and unsound in the long term.In such a milieu, the answer to their long-lasting ideological battle is dialogue, negotiation, cooperation and peace, which is still possible and may eventually materialise as the dust of this game of brinkmanship settles to an unproductive dead-end.In the latest feud, Sunni Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Shiite Iran on January 3 after an Iranian mob stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran (There has been no Saudi ambassador in Iran for nearly two years). This crisis developed following the Kingdoms execution of several political dissidents, including a prominent Saudi Shiite Muslim cleric, Sheikh Nimr Al-Nimr.Soon after, both countries imposed retaliatory diplomatic and trade curbs. Several Arab countries followed suit by downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran, which has put an already fragile relationship under intense scrutiny. Yet, the optimism for rapprochement stems from the following reasons.First, the Saudi-Iran sectarian-political-hegemonic rivalry has seen tense times in the past too, but never degenerated into a direct war in modern times. The root of Sunni-Shiite divide lies in the succession row following the death of Prophet Mohammed in 632.More recently, tension prevailed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran and the Iran-Iraq war. The death of hundreds of Saudis and Iranians in the 1987 Mecca clashes accentuated the division, followed by Riyadh severing diplomatic ties in 1988.Mohammed Khatamis election as Iranian president in 1997 ushered a period of calm, even resulting in a security pact in 2001. But the US invasion of Iraq and Saddam Husseins ouster empowered the countrys Shiite majority and influenced a shift in its political alignment towards Iran, which hurt Saudi interests.Irans nuclear energy programme deepened Saudi fears that Tehran, under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was pursuing a policy of dominating the Gulf and expanding its influence among Shiite populations of Arab countries  the Shiite Crescent in and encirclement of West Asia.Any tentative steps towards another rapprochement during the late years of the last decade were squashed by the Arab uprising that engaged both countries in proxy wars in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, leading up to the current crisis.The second reason for optimism that they could still make up at some stage is though the two countries are feuding, the third player in the margins is the United States. Riyadh may be indirectly targeting Washington, which spearheaded the nuclear deal with Tehran, thereby strengthening the Shiite countrys regional influence and opening the doors for its return to the global economic and political mainstream. Conversely, it has left Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies searching for fresh answers in several strategic domains.Washingtons dislike for direct military intervention in West Asian conflicts in recent years has also brought Russia to the fore and upset Riyadhs plans in Syria. This has forced Riyadh to stretch beyond its comfort zone in dealing with Tehrans influence in Syria and Yemen. This includes armed involvement against the Al-Houthis in Yemen.By acting tough with Iran, Saudi Arabia could either be indicating to the US that it is capable of fending for itself (along with an Islamic coalition) or pressuring it to recalibrate its rapprochement with Iran (which the US presidential elections could facilitate) or forcing its active intervention to resolve the reigning crises in its favour.Domestic issuesThird, just as Saudi Arabia may be targeting the US more than Iran through this feud, the real target of the Iranian orchestrators of the embassy attack may not be the Kingdom. Instead it could be a domestic political turf war between the hardliners, who are opposed to the Iranian deal with the United States, and the President Hassan Rouhani-led reformist camp.Iran is scheduled to hold elections for the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the Assembly of Experts on February 26. Shiite preacher Sheikh Nimrs execution in Riyadh is a hot potato during election season.The fourth rationale for optimism is the oil price. At less than $35 a barrel, both countries are struggling to manage their economies. Venturing into a war that would definitely drain their resources further, and almost definitely leave their differences unresolved, could make them lean in favour of crisis management and conflict resolution.Fifth, there were reports attributed to the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson in late December 2015 that diplomatic efforts were under way to open direct dialogue between Iran and Saudi Arabia to resolve differences and regional issues. There may still be room to walk amid the tough talk.Sixth, the more these two countries feud, the more the Islamic State gains. This should serve as motivation for Saudi Arabia and Iran to set aside their ideological differences and work towards neutralising the common enemy.The last reason for optimism that cooperation is still possible stems from the US-Iran rapprochement, unimaginable a few years ago. If this was achievable, a Saudi-Iran thaw is not impossible.(The writer is a Dubai-based political analyst, author and Honorary Fellow of the University of Exeter, UK)"

5920810f7be9e04a516a8bdd,Singur needs 4 more yrs to grow crops,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/576934/singur-needs-4-more-yrs.html,2016-10-20,"Drimi Chaudhuri, Singur, Oct 21, 2016, dhns: 1:16 ISTDespite claims by the West Bengal government that the land at Singur, where the Tata Motors factory previously stood, is cultivable again, farmers believe it will take at least two years to grow crops like potato on the land.The agricultural hamlet in Hooghly district has been traditionally known for its bumper potato harvest.A large section of farmers, who owe the repossession of their land to a Supreme Court verdict, believe the soil will need a lot of churning and tilling to regain its earlier fertility.True to their instincts, developed over years of farming, the land acquired to set up the proposed Nano factory can now grow only crops like mustard, sesame and pulses.Before the factory was set up, a large percentage of land at Singur produced as many as five crops, including potato, rice, cauliflower, jute and variety of pulses.While growing mustard and sesame was an afterthought for most farmers, the current state of the land forced them to grow these crops. On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was present to hand over the physical possession of land, as she distributed the land deeds to farmers on September 14.She also spread mustard seeds as a symbolic measure to restart farming on 997 acres, which was stopped in 2006, when the erstwhile Left Front government acquired the land to help set up the Tata plant.Even though local Trinamool Congress MLA and former agriculture minister, Becharam Manna, claimed the state government is returning the land in a cultivable state, agriculture and soil experts express doubts that after lying fallow for a decade, the land is not likely to retain its fertility. While the plant stood on more than 250 acres of the total acquired land, since the area was low-lying, its height was increased by piling tonnes of sand, fly ash and solid waste.While this process itself would have rendered the land infertile, Manna claimed around 400 acres are ready for cultivation.Mamata handed over 23 plots spread over 6.71 acres on Thursday, with plans to hand over 50 to 60 land plots everyday.The government is also installing 50 mini-deep tube-wells for better irrigation, besides distributing free seeds, fertilisers, and providing a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 to each farmer.Farmers like Ganesh Koley, Naba Kumar Ghosh and Jugal Kishore Ghosh, however, did not seem to share the governments confidence over the lands renewed cultivability. Jugal said that the government decided to start with mustard because crops like mustard, sesame and pulses release nitrogen and help land gain fertility.Weve to grow such crops for a few years till the land regains nutrition. It could take as long as four years for the land to be properly cultivable so that we can grow potato or rice, he said."
