Twenty five units of firefighters were trying to douse the fire.Flames and smoke were seen billowing out of the factory, six hours after the fire started. The fire service said strong winds had fanned the flames.A five-member probe body headed by Gazipur Executive Magistrate Rehanul Islam has been formed to look into the incident, Gazipur Deputy Commissioner SM Alam said.The factory produced and printed the plastic packaging for food items like potato chips and small household goods including mosquito coils.Low-cost manufacturing is a mainstay of Bangladesh's economy, but a series of industrial disasters in recent years have raised concerns about safety standards.Tighter controls have been introduced, but dozens of workers still die every year. At least 13 people died in a fire at a plastics factory Dhaka last year. In 2012, 112 workers died in a fire at a factory just outside the capital.The country suffered an even greater tragedy in 2013 when the Rana Plaza garment complex collapsed on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing 1,135 people."

So, he set the entire field on fire. He was also joined by the field owner, Mahinder Singh (name changed) as both wanted to clear the straw as soon as possible to prepare the field to sow wheat. Wheat sowing, which has already begun in the state, will continue till November 15.Singh owns 10 acres of land on which he sows wheat, paddy and potato every year. We have harvested paddy a couple of days back and now we are left with less than two weeks to complete wheat sowing for which fields are to be prepared and there is no alternative available with us to remove the stubble. To clear the field for sowing the next crop, we have to burn the straw, he insisted.Government is imposing fine on us but not giving any solution on how to manage the straw. We do not want to spoil the environment as we too live in the same polluted environment, which we create by burning straw, but have no option, said another farmer.Ploughing the stubble costs us around Rs 1,500 per acre which is not viable and the government should support us in clearing the field as the machinery required for stubble management is beyond the reach of more than 70-75 per cent farmers of Punjab, said another farmer, adding that machinery required to manage straw is costly and without government support, it is not possible for majority farmers to use it.Despite the ban on straw burning in the state, one could see a large number of burnt fields and fires every 100-200 metres in Kapur village. It was the same at over two dozen villages in Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts that The Indian Express visited on Thursday.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, which measures stubble burning through satellite images, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintained that it has increased this year.According to agriculture department sources, out of over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which Punjab produces annually, nearly half has already been burnt. Around 70-75 per cent (nearly 15 million) of the 20 million straw is burnt to clear land for the next crop.This year, 30.10 lakh hectares are under rice cultivation against 29.75 lakh hectares last year. Now, the burning fields of Punjab have resulted in a dense smog cover over Delhi, for the past couple of days. Incidentally, the National Green Tribunal has summoned Punjab for creating environment pollution not only in the state but up to Delhi thereby resulting in serious health issues in the national capital.PPCB has formed several teams along with officials in every district of the state this year to take action against those burning straw and even booked over 500 farmers. They are being fined Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 for setting on fire two acres, five acres and over five acres, respectively. In Jalandhar alone, around 90 farmers fields have been raided by these teams.Our officials have already raided over 500 farmer units, said PPCB Chairman Manpreet Singh Chatwal.Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, Director of Punjab Agriculture department, said paddy is sown over a huge area in Punjab for which we have to make a large number of machines available to every farmer in the state. Though big farmers can afford to purchase machines on their own, that cannot be expected of the small and marginal farmers. So, the Centre has to help farmers purchase the machines at nominal rates. In Punjab, not more than 10 per cent paddy stubble can be manged with the available machinery. We are also changing the mindset of farmers through Kisan Mela so that they can adopt the new technology, said Bains. Though awareness is increasing, we still have a long way to go, he added.Second generation ethanol production plant in SangrurIndian Oil Corporation, in association with the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab government, is also going to set up an ethanole plant by using surplus crop residue and other biomass as feedstock. Sangrur district has already been identified as one of the potential locations where surplus biomass is available. And this plant will reduce carbon emission produced by traditional burning of crop residue by farmers, informed Chatwal, adding that a 50-acre plot has already been identified to set up this plant, which will help to manage the straw as well as provide additional income to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59235f937be9e01fcef0202a,Farming with waste water a health hazard,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/543694/farming-waste-water-health-hazard.html,2016-04-30,"Farming with waste water a health hazardNivedita Jain, Bengaluru, May 1, 2016, DHNS 1:48 ISTPolluted air and water might be Bengalurus bane, but vegetables grown on farms irrigated with contaminated water have given it a hazardous twist. Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."
5923659d7be9e01fcef02498,Your favourite vegetables are cheaper this season,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/535031/your-favourite-vegetables-cheaper-season.html,2016-03-16,"Your favourite vegetables are cheaper this seasonBengaluru, Mar 16, 2016, DHNS: 2:03 ISTTomato priced at just Rs 6-8 per kilo, capsicum Rs 15, potato Rs 20Last year, as the summer peaked, the prices of vegetables too soared. But surprisingly this time, veggie prices have fallen owing to increased production and arrivals in the markets.A kilogram of tomato is now priced at Rs 6 to Rs 8 in wholesale markets, while carrots, beans and brinjals cost about Rs 20-25. Capsicum and potatoes are priced at Rs 15 and Rs 20, respectively. Exactly a year ago, their prices during the same period had spiked, with tomato priced at Rs 20 and beans Rs 40 per kilo.Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Association president R V Gopi said carrots were priced at Rs 40 in March last year and the cost of other veggies too had increased by 10-20 per cent.This time, however, the prices have fallen, especially in the past week. Last week, one kilogram of tomato was priced at Rs 15, but now it is available at Rs 8 and even Rs 5 in the market.He said the main reason for the low prices was the increase in the arrival of vegetables.Last year, there was a decrease in the crop arrivals and hence the prices had gone up. For consumers, it is a good news this time, but for farmers it is a loss.G M Diwakar from SKR Market Traders Association said it was just the beginning of summer season and there were chances of veggie prices doubling in the next four months.Generally, the prices increase between April and July. Last year, there was no rainfall and hence the prices had increased. It takes three months for crop yield and this time, there has been sufficient rainfall. But when the actual summer sets in, then the prices may increase."
5923bb327be9e01fcef057b4,RBI should go for low interest rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/537652/rbi-should-go-low-interest.html,2016-03-30,"Upendra Goel Mar 31, 2016, 0:01 ISTOnly growth has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and boost Make In India programme too.Growth can waitseems to be the favourite refrain of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait. The aspirati-ons of a billion people also cant.(The writer is a technocrat and a small-scale entrepreneur based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh)"

The advisory came from the government as the water level in the Hemavathi reservoir at Gorur was barely sufficient for drinking needs. Such advisories should have been issued by the government to farmers in June itself. By the time the government realised that it can no way provide water for irrigation while allowing releasing Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, it was too late.While some farmers had already begun sowing activities by June-July itself, some ignored the advisory and took up sowing. Water was released into the canal for filling tanks and multi-village drinking water schemes between August 12 and September 16. But the quantum was insufficient for cultivation which requires four months of water supply.The result: Nearly 9,000 acres of standing crops including paddy, maize, ginger and sugarcane among others will be lost in Arkalgud alone.In an interaction with this reporter, Yoga Gowda, a farmer of Byachanahalli in the taluk who owns four acres said he ignored the advisory and went in for sowing paddy as he was badly in need of agricultural income. Today, he stands to lose around Rs 80,000 he spent on sowing and fertilizers. (On an average, an acre yields around 20 quintals of paddy in the Cauvery basin).I took the risk as I have no other source of income. I was hoping that rains would come to my rescue. But, today I have lost everything, Yoga Gowda said. The water level in the Hemavathi reservoir on Monday stood at around seven tmcft of which only 3.303 tmcft can be utilised as the rest is dead storage. The total capacity of the reservoir is 37.103 tmcft.In the neighbouring Holenarsipur taluk, farmers are facing a similar plight. Kumar of Ankanahalli village stands to lose his potato crop on a half-acre-plot. The plants have already dried up and his investment of Rs 15,000 on seeds and fertilizers has been lost.Our crops are wilting in front of us and we are helpless. Water that could have saved at least some portion of our crops has flowed into Tamil Nadu during the last few weeks.It is a good thing that water release to the neighbouring state has been stopped, he said.There are many Yoga Gowdas in the Hemavathi achcut (command) area. The plight of farmers, by and large, is same in all villages, be it Hassan or Mandya. They do not have much hope left for this season because the monsoon has receded."
5923f80b7be9e01fcef087b3,'Alert on water shortage came after sowing began',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573742/alert-water-shortage-came-sowing.html,2016-10-03,"'Alert on water shortage came after sowing began'Vijesh Kamath, October 03, 2016, Tumakuru/Hassan, DHNS 1:38 ISTFarmers in the Cauvery basin, who are staring at losing their standing crops, seem to have lost trust in the administrative machinery and officials.They blame the government for not alerting them on time that they should not go in for sowing this season. They say neither the Water Resources nor the Agriculture department officials visited their villages to guide or advise them.Interaction with a cross-section of farmers in the districts of Tumakuru and Hassan for whom the Cauvery River and its tributaries form the lifeline, reveals that there was gross failure of the communication machinery of the government.Low storage levels in the four reservoirs in the Cauvery basin - Hemavathi, KRS, Harangi and Kabini - prompted the government to stop release of water for agriculture in August. But, by that time majority of the farmers had already commenced sowing.G N Krishnamurthy, a farmer of Gangura in Holenarasipura taluk in Hassan district said he went in for sowing paddy and potato in his two-acre plot in June, something he has been practicing for the last 36 years. His plot falls at the 31st km point of the Hemavathi Right Bank Canal starting from the Hemavathi dam.Noticing water flow in the canal, we stated sowing. Nobody told us that water will not be supplied for agricultural purposes. No official visited us, he says. His neighbour G Ramu agrees with him. We were neither told not to depend on rains. There is no way out for us even for those with borewell acess as groundwater has totally depleted, he says.Subbaraya Gowda, executive engineer, Hemavathi dam, Holenarisipura Zone, says an advisory that water will not be supplied for agricultural purposes was issued on time. Asked the date on which the advisory was issued, Gowda said he will have to check the register. Upstream in Arakalgud taluk, farmers of Byachanahalli point out that water was released in the canals between August 12 and September 17.The Water Resources department had meant that the water was to fill up tanks for drinking water purpose under multi-village scheme. There was no channel of communication with the farmers, who utilised the water for cultivation . The result: the fields in Byachanahalli still look green. But it is deceptive, the crops will wilt within a week.Being at the tail-end of the Hemavathi Left Bank canal, the distributory canals in Gubbi taluk of Tumkuru district remained dry last year. However, rains had come to their rescue. This year with 49% deficit rainfall, farmers who had sowed especially maize and jowar have already lost their crops.Mahalingaiah of Vadaluru village in the taluk said there were no alerts about deficient rainfall nor that they should abstain from agriculture.Majority of the farmers are now unemployed and spending the money they have saved. They are dependent on foodgrains provided under the Anna Bhagya scheme.However, the interaction with farmers brought out an interesting facet - they do not want crop compensation, water is more precious to them. Doddappa, a farmer said there is nothing more miserable than witnessing crops wilt. It is like our children passing away in front of us. Money cant compensate our losses, he says."
