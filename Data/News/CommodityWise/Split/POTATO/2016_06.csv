Tobacco, jowar, potato, ginger and paddy crops have been washed away. Soil, gravel and sand has accumulated on the fields, making it difficult for the farmers to take up cultivation immediately.Water has entered the low-lying areas and the farmers fear it may destroy coconut, arecanut, banana and betel leaves.Doddakere measures about 80 acres and irrigates around 300 acres of land. The lake was filled with water from the Hemavathy right bank canal a few days ago.It may be mentioned that desiltation of the lake was taken up at a cost of Rs 70 lakh, two months ago. Substandard works have caused the breach of the bund of the lake, complained the villagers.BJP district unit president H Yogaramesh warned of intensified protests, if repair works are not completed within 15 days and suitable compensation is not awarded to the affected farmers. Cauvery Neeravari Nigam engineers, who visited the spot, assured to take up the repair works at the earliest.Showers lash Mangaluru cityAfter a gap of two weeks, Mangaluru and the surrounding areas received good rains on Thursday.

His one inmate is used to -2 degrees Celsius, the other to 40-degree temperatures; the biggest weighs in at 2,500 kg, the smallest is lighter than 15 gm; one calls for wheelbarrow khichdi meals, the other for kheer. 176 acres, 1,500-plus creatures, 200 workers, and mercury grazing 50. If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

Naresh is not a permanent employee as yet.Outside, Kalpana and her cubs are playing in a 50-m-long pool designed for the summer. After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."

Monday was Day One of the strike called to protest against the recent changes in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act, 1970.MP Raju Shetti said they would be seeking the permission of the state government to directly sell fruits and vegetables on open grounds, school grounds and other outlets too.The state government recently delisted fruits and vegetables from APMC and also changed the way commission was being charged. Till recently, traders and commission agents used to charge commission from the farmers and that would be deducted from the latters final bill. The present amendment has mandated that the commission be charged from the end buyer. Commission is the fee levied by traders for selling the produce of the farmer and is normally fixed by the market committees. Farmer organisations have long protested against this practice and had called for its abolition.Also Read | Pune: Traders on strike, fruits and vegetable supply goes dryShetti said after the traders called the strike, the Sanghatana members were asked to go to the marketyards and sell their wares directly.

I carefully checked every paper I came across in this house, said Corina. The most precious things in the collection are a couple ledgers of the FJM company and a mould of the bricks.Among other things in the mini-museum are differently-shaped storing and cooking vessels, a compact mirror, black veils worn to church, a potato masher, bullets of an old air gun, ladles , flasks, a potato mincer, a ghumat (musical instrument made from clay and lizard skin used in weddings) and a phorma (a big vessel used to bake cakes and cook piglet delicacies).The Misquittas have also preserved a wooden bed, cabinet and a collection of their grandmothers crockery in their Burma teak house which roofed four generations of the family.Corina is grateful to her husband who convinced her to store the items instead of scrapping them.I was shocked to see such fascinating things in the house, so I wanted to keep things in remembrance of my wifes ancestors, said Chandrashekhar, a manufacturer and supplier of firefighting and safety equipment. He added, What you see is only 25 per cent of what we found. We threw away a lot of stuff too, she said.She reminisced, My grandparents used to own 38,000 square feet of plot.

Maharashtra Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Vinod Tawde.Maharashtra Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Vinod Tawde, who is mulling the idea of making yoga part of the school curriculum Wednesday tweeted that students practising yoga every day will be awarded marks like in sports. Tawde tweeted this after attending a yoga session in Mumbai with Baba Ramdev.Tawde late on Wednesday night tweeted: Urged students to benefit from yoga, students practising yoga everyday will be awarded marks like in sports.Last year in June during a yoga session at a municipal school in Vile Parle on International Yoga Day, Tawde had openly asked students and teachers whether they would like to have yoga as a subject or part of their physical education class.Tawde said, Why cant marks be awarded to students for yoga. This will encourage more and more students to practice yoga from the early age.According to Tawde, instead of spending free time surfing internet and becoming a couch potato by continuously watching TV, students can practice yoga and enjoy its benefit. Learning Yoga from an early age is very beneficial as it would not only help students maintain their health, but also help them concentrate on academics, he added.Even earlier on several occasions Tawde had hinted that the state government was seriously thinking of incorporating yoga in the school curriculum.We are currently discussing the idea with yoga experts, academicians, school managements and officials of the school education department on how we can go about it.

5935a17a7be9e061bdcfebaa,Unauthorised fodder business thrives in drought-hit areas in Maharashtra,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/eknath-khadse-unauthorised-fodder-business-thrives-in-drought-hit-areas-in-maharashtra/,2016-02-18,,Indian Express,"Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Eknath KhadseMaharashtra Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse Wednesday admitted that the government has found a number of unauthorised fodder camps set up in the drought-hit districts of Beed, Osmanabad and Latur, all in Marathwada.Just as Maharashtra is already footing a Rs 4-crore bill daily to provide fodder and water for cattle in drought-hit areas, Khadse conceded that demands to regularise even the illegally running fodder camps are being made.Our appeal to those running such camps is to either apply for permissions from the government or transfer animals they shelter to units with valid permissions, Khadse said.The thriving fodder lobby enjoys considerable political clout, claiming that they had even succeeding in getting the government to reverse a decision that was taken to ensure the state is not hit by a fodder scam.Following report that adequate fodder for animals was available in Beed, Osmanabad, and Latur that could last till May, Khadses department had asked collectors to close down government-aided camps at all places where the fodder was available in surplus. Khadse, who also heads the Maharashtra cabinets sub-committee on drought mitigation measures, said about 10.75 lakh tonne fodder was available in these three districts.But on Wednesday, Khadse was forced to retract the decision as it was becoming politically a hot potato for the BJP. Besides the Opposition, even politicians from the BJP and the Sena were up in arms against it. Two senior ministers  Pankaja Munde (BJP) and Deepak Sawant (Shiv Sena)  spoke against the move.While Khadse was reportedly upset over the demand to reverse the decision and insisted it was being taken only as a step to prevent malpractices, Munde and Sawant had the backing of other senior ministers, who reportedly said it would be politically unwise for the government to go against popular opinion. Even the Chief Minister had asked Khadse to reconsider the decision in light of the sentiments of elected representatives.Though Khadse ceded ground, he also sounded a caution. Previous experiences regarding fodder camps have not been good. We have seen scams worth several hundred crores. The administration was only taking steps to ensure no repeat.Despite failing to secure the backing of fellow cabinet ministers for his previous decision, Khadse put up a brave face on Wednesday. There is no question of prestige or politics. The decision was not etched in stone and has been retracted, he said.About 2.08 lakh animals are sheltered in 237 legally permitted fodder camps in the state. The Beed and Osmanabad districts account for most of these. The minister also fired a barb, saying the decision had been taken after reports revealed that about 1,200 animals had been brought back home, indicating sufficient fodder was available.The elected representatives, however, pointed out that water scarcity still prevails and insisted the camps be continued, Khadse said. Amid all the heated argument in the cabinet, it was decided that all ministers and some Ministers of State would tour Marathwada before the budget session on March 9 to review drought mitigation measures.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Twitter/@BJP4India) BJP President Amit Shah. (Source: Twitter/@BJP4India)The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes in PoK, BJP president Amit Shah said today lashing out at Rahul Gandhi over his dalali barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yesterday, wrapping up his UP kisan yatra in the capital, Gandhi had accused Modi of hiding behind the blood of soldiers and added: Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are cashing in on their sacrifice). This morning, Gandhi tweeted: I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocallybut I will not support using the Indian Army in political posters and propaganda all across the country.By his khoon ki dalali comment, Rahul has insulted the Army, the martyrs and 125 crore Indians, Shah said.Dalali is what Congress did from Bofors to Embraer, from 2G to coal. Dalali involves some goods, what does he think this is about? Can one put a price to the blood of jawans?The morale of the very Army that risked their lives to destroy terror camps has been broken by him. I do not know what he was trying to achieve but the government, BJP and the people are standing firmly behind the Indian Army, Shah said accusing both Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of politicising the Army.The question is why you (Congress) are not happy, enthusiastic and proud of this, Shah said. It shows there is some fundamental flaw in youInstead of joining people in their happiness, the Congress party is with Pakistan in its despair.The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes, Shah said in reply to a question whether the strikes would feature in the BJP campaign in next years Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Zaroor jayenge, he said. I said at the very beginning that if some tehsil president had put up some posters (a reference to posters celebrating the strikes) that should not be taken into account. But we will go to the public because Army morale needs to be boosted and this achievement of the Army needs to be lauded. It was the achievement of the Army and the political will of Narendra Modi. Government was careful from the first day not to politicisethat is why the briefing was done by the DGMO and not by a political functionary, Shah said.Rahul Gandhis clarification in the morning did not cut much ice, Shah said claiming that BJP had kept all its poll promises  from securing the countrys borders and not allowing anybody to get away with beheading our jawans to one rank, one pension.Suggesting that those casting doubts on the authenticity of the strikes are anti-India leaders, Shah said, The whole country, BJP and its government are standing firmly behind the Army. We do not trust the anti-India rhetoric of leaders, we trust the bullets of our Army men.Gandhi, he said, should concentrate on potato factory, a swipe at this comments to farmers that they want potato factories. Shah also appeared to dismiss demands for releasing video evidence, saying who is seeking them.Shah brushed aside Pakistans denial. Then what was the special Pak Parliament session all about, he asked, and why is the Pak Prime Minister who comes to Islamabad only 3-4 times a month camping in Islamabad.As for Kejriwals remarks that India should counter Paks denial propaganda, he said that there is no doubt who is benefiting from his comments because Pakistanis are making him trend on twitter. The reference was to the hashtag PakStandsWithKejriwal that began trending on Thursday.Shah said Congress and Rahul Gandhi dislike Modi and recalled expressions like maut ke saudagar, (merchant of death) and zeher ki kheti (sowing poison) used by his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against Modi. The BJP won a two-thirds majority in Gujarat after maut ke saudagar and a majority after zeher ki kheti comments, Shah said, wondering how the latest statement will play out.He lauded the media for what he called its support of the government on its stand on Pakistan.Investigative journalists have dug out the truth from across the border, he said. On October 4, The Indian Express had reported eyewitness accounts of the surgical strikes from across the border.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Express Photo by Javed Raja No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed RajaAbout 100 km from the India-Pakistan border, in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha district, Charda village witnessed a revolution of sorts over six years ago. A Brahmins buffalo had died and he called the Dalits to clear it. They refused. Since then, Dalits here havent skinned or cleared a single carcass.There was a fight and we decided not to do it anymore. The buffalo lay there for two days, till the owner buried it himself, says Mulabhai Mansinh Bochiya, a Dalit who was in his second term as sarpanch at the time in 2009-10.I was made the sarpanch for the first time on a savarna (general) seat in 2000, when the incumbent sarpanch, from the darbar (OBC) caste, was booked in a murder case within six months of his appointment. Rajputs and darbars are the dominant community, but the village voted for me again, says Bochiya.At a time when attacks on Dalits have led to a widespread outrage, particularly after the public flogging of seven Dalit youths in Gujarats Una for skinning dead cattle, Charda is on the cusp of change, although there is still some way to go.Bochiyas wife, Sattuben, assures that there has been no untouchability in the village since the buffalo incident. But 15-year-old Bhavna Desai, a member of the cattle-rearing Rabari (OBC) community, who spends most of her time at the Bochiya home, says it does exist subtly in the privacy of homes.For instance, they (Dalits) cannot come into our temple, and they do not come anyway. At community get-togethers, they sit with their community members, not with us, she says.A student of Class VIII, Bhavna says that in school, however, everyone sits together and dines together, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.Sattuben and Mulabhai have six sons and two daughters all of whom are married. Unable to accommodate everyone in one home, the family moved to a plot where they used to store fodder, on the outskirts of the village and have one bigha of land in which they only grow cattle feed for their buffaloes, says Sattuben.All the sons are labourers and do canal-work, she says. The Narmada canal which connected this taluka has come as a blessing to the village. We laid a pipeline spending Rs four lakh to connect to the fields, says Sattuben.But if they (government) evicts us we will have to leave, because this land is not ours, says Sattuben.Her daughter-in-law Jasaben says their staple food is bajra and mung and potato. Rice is made only on occasions, unlike the Desais and the Rajputs in the village, who also eat wheat and vegetables like brinjal, and tomatoes, she says.Bhavnas father Nagjibhai Desai lived in Shilaj on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, taking care of a cow pound till about ten years ago. Then came the Ring Road (Sardar Patel Ring Road), and Ahmedabad became a mega city, and here we are back home to farming, says Desai.He raises cattle and sells milk to the Banaskantha dairy co-operative. Untouchability, he says, does not exist at all in Charda, adding that everyone clears carcasses.Pointing to the children gathered around his home, he says, Look, all of them are Dalits. Can you tell the difference between them and us? If you cut any of us our blood will be red. They all eat together play together. Those who believe in discrimination, may practise it (untouchability). We dont.Shankarbhai Prajapati, an OBC who has been Chardas sarpanch for the last five years, insists that the village has changed. Only last week, my buffalo died, it was worth Rs one lakh. I called a tractor, tied and dragged it, loaded it and buried it with some salt for faster decomposition, he says.Govindbhai Rajput, a farmer, blames politics, for the discriminatory practices. People working on the directions of the Congress and the BJP practise untouchability, because they have political interests. We have no enemies. There is no issue at all. In our weddings, they (the Dalits) play the drums and get Rs 25,000-30,000 for it. Brotherhood is what we believe in, he says.Nanjibhai Adhial, who works in Tharad for Dalit rights as part of the Ahmedabad-based NGO Human Development and Research Centre, says that much has changed since awareness came in.But the awakening has come with its own set of issues, he says. Today, if a Dalit is asked to shut up in a panchayat meet, he will object, and then the oppression begins. Earlier, he would sit quiet, he says.Banaskantha District Collector Jenu Devan says the district administration tries to get communities together at gram sabhas to overcome discriminatory practices. In schools, we have successfully managed to finish it. We have ensured that children sit together and dine together. Our teachers mostly come from towns where untouchability is less and they are partners in this effort, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Photo) Students at the Gandaman primary school in Chhapra, where 23 children died of food poisoning on July 16, 2013. (Source: Express Photo)A Chhapra court on Monday sentenced principal Meena Devi of the government primary school in Dharmashati Gandaman village to 10 years and seven years of imprisonment in connection with the 2013 midday meal tragedy, in which 23 children had died of food poisoning after eating a midday meal. The court treated it as rarest of the rare case and awarded maximum punishment to the school principal Meena Devi for culpable homicide, not amounting to murder and criminal negligence.The court of additional district judge II found Gandaman school principal Meena Devi guilty on 24 August. The court, however, acquitted her of murder charges, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy even though the Special Investigation Team had claimed there was a strong case against her. The court acquitted Meena Devis husband Arjun Yadav alias Arjun Rai of all charges.On July 16, 2013, children aged between four and twelve ate the midday meal that consisted of rice, pulses and soya beans. About half an hour later, the children complained of stomach pain, had diarrhoea, and started vomiting. Some of the sick children were sent home, while 16 children, between classes I to V, died on the spot, four were declared dead upon arrival at the hospital, and the others died while in the hospital.While officials said 23 children had died from eating the contaminated lunch, parents and locals said the number was at least 27.While eating the lunch, the children had complained that the food tasted odd, and the schools cook had earlier informed the headmistress that the new cooking oil she was using was discoloured and smelled odd. The principal, Meena Devi, however, had said that the oil had been bought from a local grocery store and was safe.Initial reports showed that the food was contaminated by an organophosphate, which is a class of chemicals commonly found in insecticides. Bihars state education minister at the time, PK Sahi, had said that a preliminary investigation suggested that the food served to the children contained an organophosphate used as an insecticide on rice and wheat crops. He said it was believed the rice had not been washed before it was served to the children. Patna Medical College hospital superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar had said that the post-mortem reports of the children who died confirmed that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil.Local villagers, however, said the problem appeared to be with a side dish of soya and potatoes, and not the rice. Children who did not eat the side dish were fine, even though they had eaten the rice and pulses.The day after the incident, officials had said that they believed the cooking oil had been stored in a container formerly used to store insecticides. State officials said that the oil had been purchased from a shop owned by the headmistresss husband.Days after the incident, Meena Devi was suspended and an FIR was lodged against her. Protests had erupted following the deaths, with villagers demanding strict action against the officials responsible for the incident. The school building was shifted to another village where Gandaman children refused to eat their meals for months. The school was later reopened at its designated building near the site of the tragedy in 2015. Though villagers later agreed to allow their children to eat lunch at school, the service remained erratic.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

That day, Pawan had gone to Sindwari for tuition and was returning when the trouble broke out, beginning with the arrest of MLA Nirmala Devi from Chirudih  ahead of Sindwari on the road from Sonbarsa  and culminating in the firing at Dadi Kala that was on Pawans way home.Some people have told me that Pawan tried to hide in a corner. But a bullet hit him, said Savitri Devi, his mother.Makhiran said he has never met any official of the National Thermal Power Corporation nor any political over regarding land or compensation. The clash had risen out of a protest against land acquisition for an NTPC project. If the land of entire village goes,s o will mine. If they give something, I will get it too, said Makhiran, who has very little to show by way of land. This courtyard is all I have, he said, pointing outside a house that he has managed to turn into a pucca one over the years.Pawans grandfather Aklu Ram is angry. They have not given any compensation or provided for rehabilitation. And this is how they behave.

But ever since the death of my brother, nobody visited.Aftab has few hopes from the project and compensation for land, if acquired. They never came to us. Some people gave their land.

Sugar has a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices.Inflation worries have clearly receded in most food items  barring sugar, potatoes and chana. Even for the last two, the current high prices may be a temporary phenomenon, as the improved soil and sub-soil moisture conditions from a good monsoon is likely to spur plantings in the ensuing rabi season.That leaves only sugar, where there is a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices. This is unlike in wheat, for which the governments own precarious stocks position is more than offset by low global prices. At about $205 per tonne, the landed cost of imported wheat in India works out to Rs 1,365 a quintal  below even the minimum support price of Rs 1,525/quintal that was payable to farmers for last years crop.In sugar, on the other hand, the 2016-17 season (October-September) has started with estimated carryover stocks of 75 lakh tonnes (lt). With output projections for the new season ranging from 220 lt to 235 lt, and expected consumption of 260 lt, the closing stocks for September 2017 would be anywhere between 35 lt and 50 lt  not very comfortable.Moreover, white sugar if imported today will cost well above Rs 40 per kg. That is more than the Rs 35-36 per kg that mills are currently realising. A clear picture  of the actual sugarcane available for mills to crush, especially in the wake of successive droughts in Maharashtra and Karnataka  will emerge by January.Either way, sugar is the commodity to watch in the New Year, when we also have the countrys largest cane producer Uttar Pradesh going for Assembly polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Twenty kg of rice, 10 kg of wheat and 2 kg of pulses. Sugar, oil, potatoes, tomatoes and onions, and candles. A visit by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat (on Tuesday) and announcement of Rs 10 lakh in compensation. That was an official at the office of the District Magistrate in Bageshwar, listing what Sohan Rams family  his father, wife and two children  is getting as compensation.On October 5, Dalit labourer Ram was killed, allegedly by a government school teacher from the upper-caste Thakur community, who hurled casteist slurs before cutting his throat with a sickle, for entering and defiling a flour mill in Kadaria village.The accused, Lalit Karnatak, was arrested the next day but his brother and father, who have been accused of threatening Rams family against filing a complaint, are absconding. It took two more days for the promised rations to reach Rams family, after the case was reported by local media. But on Monday, with the brutal killing triggering protests in Dehradun and Bageshwar, and the assembly elections scheduled next year, the state government has sprung into action.All efforts are on to nab the other accused, said Bageshwar SP, Sukhbeer Singh, even as district officials and police officers spent most of Monday preparing for Rawats visit. An empty field was being prepared as a helipad, with about 200 police personnel asked to report to the village on Tuesday.The sudden rush for damage-control also led to a bizarre situation. After the Chief Ministers visit was confirmed on Monday, officials at the DMs office inquired about the financial status of Rams widow to facilitate the cash compensation  only to realise that she didnt have a bank account.The Bahujan Samaj Party, meanwhile, has called for a Jan Akrosh rally on Wednesday to protest the killing. We will not let this issue die. Cases of caste-based discrimination are growing and have become a problem in Bageshwar. Karnataks father and brother, who threatened Rams family, are still absconding. We are expecting 2,500 people at the rally, said Sundar Kumar Syunewal, district head, BSP.According to the 2001 census, Bageshwar district has the highest proportion of Scheduled Castes  25.9 per cent  in Uttarakhand. According to local leaders and officials, a few cases of caste discrimination and violence have been reported from the area but such brutality is not common.The National Crime Records Bureau report for 2015 says that crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes grew by 59 per cent in Uttarakhand between 2014 and 2015. While 62 cases were reported in 2014, this number grew to 93 in 2015.This year, conflict over caste-based discrimination in Uttarakhand flared up four months ago, when Dalit leader Daulat Kunwar and BJP MP Tarun Vijay raised the issue of entry of Dalits in temples in the state.

Source: Sahil Walia A farmer tilling his fields after burning paddy straw at Charuni village in Kurukshetra. Source: Sahil WaliaPlumes of smoke are rising from the fields on National Highway 1. By the end of October or sooner, the smoke will be a thick blanket in the air over Haryana, extending all the way to the national capital. Its the season for paddy stubble burning.In this district of Kurukshetra, harvested paddy fields are now black with ash. In between the wheat-paddy cycle, some farmers grow potatoes or mustard. The sowing of these crops has already started at some places.Karambir, a farmer at Charuni Jattan village, follows the wheat-paddy cycle every year. Having harvested paddy from half of his six acres of land, Karambir did what a majority of other farmers in his village are doing. He set the paddy stubble on fire.The farmers have no option but to burn the stubble. Earlier when we were harvesting with our hands, the crop was cut in such a way that we could make bundles of stubble to be utilised as fodder or send to cardboard-making factories. Now, when we use combines for harvesting, the stubble that remains is of no use. Rather, it creates problems as it does not mix in the soil. The only option is to burn the fields and then turn the soil before sowing the next crop, said Karambir.Most farmers The Indian Express spoke to here share Karambirs opinion. They say while they know burning fields robs the soil of its nutrients, they have no alternative.At a little distance from Karambirs fields are four acres owned by another farmer, Shakti. Standing on his burnt field, Shakti says labour for cutting the crops manually is not easily available. Further, the labourers charge Rs 4,000 per acre for harvesting and take around three to four hours. On the other hand, those giving combines on rent charge Rs 1,200 per acre. With the use of combines, an acre can be harvested in half an hour, says Shakti, adding for the farmers this is more economical.During the 2015 harvest, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board did a survey in 10 paddy growing districts in the state with the help of Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC), an agency of Department of Science and Technology. The districts surveyed were Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa Sonipat and Yamunanagar.The survey showed a decline of around 21 per cent in crop burning practice in the past three years. In the year 2015, stubble burning took place in 163 thousand hectares, which was 14.4 per cent of the total rice cropped area. A year earlier, in 2014, stubble burning was witnessed in 168.9 thousand hectares or 15.7 percent of the rice cropped area. The figure was 208.3 thousand hectares or 20.3 per cent of the rice cropped area in 2013.The survey said the total paddy stubble burning area in the 10 districts had come down by 3.5 percentage points as compared to 2014 and 21.8 percentage points as compared to 2013.In eight districts, there was a marked reduction in stubble burning. In Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar alone, there was an increase. The decline appears to have not made a significant impact on the air quality in those two years. The report also indicated that early rice stubble burning in major area takes place during second to fourth week of October in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Panipat. While late burning in major areas takes place during first week to third week of November in rest of the districts.A farmer at Chanarthal village in Kurukshetra, who also burnt the stubble in his fields, said he wanted to plant mustard in a day or two, but it would be impossible if it were not for the burning. The officials take decisions without knowing ground realities. If the government wants us to stop burning the stubble, they should provide some alternatives. What do we do with the stubble, he said, not willing to be named.President of Bharatiya Kisan Union in the state, Sewa Singh Arya, says, The stubble that is left after harvesting using combines is not usable as fodder. Using a tractor shreds it to pieces. If the stubble is not set on fire, then the next crop cannot be sown. There is a need for the government to provide some incentives to the farmers.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board has prepared a strategy to tackle the problem. All Deputy Commissioners have been advised to issue necessary directions to all the revenue field officials like BDPOs, tehsildars and patwaris to instruct the sarpanchs and panchs in the villages for persuading and educating the farmers on the ban and on the harmful effects of such acts.All DCs have also been advised to direct the gram sachivs and patwaris to bring all the incidents of burning of wheat stubble or paddy straw and other agricultural waste in the open fields to his notice within 30 minutes of the occurrence of such incidents. In case they fail to do so, it shall be treated as dereliction of duty and disciplinary action would be initiated against them.Apart from HARSAC being asked to monitor stubble burning in the 10 districts, Central Pollution Control Board has also been requested to share the satellite imagery reports / data obtained from ISRO on a daily basis.The government has decided to launch a pilot project for paddy straw based biomass power project.

The agriculture department will support the setting up of bio-fertilizer plants using biomass and would devise a scheme to provide subsidy and to buy the fertilizer from such plants.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said awareness is being created among the farmers. He added once a biomass power project is set up, the farmers will have an incentive not to burn the stubble.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source :USA Today Sports) Danny Willett was greeted by a jeering gallery when he stepped on the tee with Kaymer. (Source :USA Today Sports)American fans made Danny Willett pay for his brothers midweek rant when they booed the Masters champion on to the first tee on his Ryder Cup debut on Friday, paving the way for a stream of taunts later on.The Englishman and his fourballs partner Martin Kaymer also had to contend with an inspired performance from their opponents as big-hitting rookie Brooks Koepka and hot-putting Brandt Snedeker charged to a 5 and 4 victory.Willett was forced to apologise after his journalist sibling Pete hit out at the Hazeltine National crowd, saying Europe needed to silence the pudgy, basement-dwelling, irritants, stuffed on cookie dough and pissy beer.The player was greeted by a jeering gallery when he stepped on the tee with Kaymer but the opening hole was halved when Willett stroked home a curling left-to-right birdie putt from 25 feet.The verbal abuse was not too bad early on but as the players made their way round the course, especially when they were close to the refreshment tents, it grew in volume.Need more cookie dough?, was one of the regular refrains, as was hot dog and mashed potato.When Willett missed a putt on the fourth green, one fan shouted at the top of his voice why dont you get your brother to play it for you?.American vice-captain Bubba Watson leapt to the players defence, shaking his head and barking out, come on, we dont wanna go there.The crowd were also vocal when the 28-year-old Willett saw a birdie effort lip out at the fifth.MONSTER DRIVEThere were more shouts at the sixth when Koepka split the fairway with a monster drive while the Englishman hooked his tee shot into a bunker, one fan crying: Wonder what your brother would make of that one?.When the match eventually ended on the 14th green, Willett told reporters: It was anticipatedcoming to America is a tough one.They gave me a little bit more and I think it was exactly what we thought it was going to be.Asked by Reuters if the American pair felt slightly uncomfortable with all the yelling, Snedeker replied: Maybe a little bit but you get that pretty much every week on tour at the weekend.You get it in the last couple of groups, people dont want you to win or whatever it may be. I didnt think it crossed the line by any stretch of the imagination today.Davis Love was out there for quite a few holes trying to quash it if it got out of control, Snedeker said of his captain.

People  holding aluminum buckets and pots or anything that can store water  anxiously wait for their turn at the tubewell that would soon begin to draw water in the form of mud.If you are late, all you get is muddy water, said Sukumar Mahto, speaking about the only tubewell in this part of Purulia, which, the 29-year-old pointed out, is a dry area. This lone tubewell supports not just Kororia but neighbouring villages, too.We are used to harsh summers, but this year has been particularly bad. Children have acquired allergies and illnesses because there is no water. There are no vegetables either, only potatoes, and thats what we have been sustaining on, Mahto said.The ponds around the village began drying up two months ago. Most of them now sit mudcaked, a reminder that they used to be a water body a while ago. A few still have some water left but their levels have fallen drastically. It is these that men, women, children and cattle use for all things necessary  bathing, washing, cooking, and drinking.Similar to Birbhum, but unlike other districts in West Bengal, Purulia is largely a monocrop region, planting and harvesting paddy.Before this long stretch of rainless dry heat set in, Purulia had received a good spell of rainfall in August last year, prompting farmers to try their luck at a second crop  many planted vegetables. But these failed.Purulia, officially, is a semi-drought-hit region. But the situation right now is similar to drought. There is no source of water in the district. The surface water has dried up and the groundwater has reduced at an alarming rate. This started in November last year, so we began giving out crop insurance and extended the Rs 2-per kg rice scheme  meant for the lower income groups  to cover the entire district, District Magistrate Tanmoy Chakraborty said.He added that 1,000 tubewells have been installed where groundwater is still available. Dry wells have been added to low lying areas so they fill up when the groundwater rises.For extra measures, the administration has asked owners of factories and small industries to install taps outside their industrial structures to make drinking water available to the common people.But these industrial owners have their own story to tell.Prashant Jalan (27), who runs a brick kiln with his father, said no work has taken place for the last three months. There is no water to manufacture brick, he said. Work on developmental projects, government sources said, have similarly slowed down because of the scarcity of water.There is literally no water here any more. Factory owners have been asked to install taps outside their buildings so that people could come and drink water from these. We will be installing ours in a couple of days, Jalan said.These taps, however, will receive water only for two hours each in the morning and evening every day.Purulia is a region where the plateau meets the plains so it is a dry area in any case. The people here are accustomed to harsh climate. What we need is a good spell of rain and the monsoons to come, the DM said.The monsoon, unluckily for Purulia and several other parched regions in the country, will be delayed by a week, according to the Met Departments forecast. It will arrive in Kerala some time at the end of the first week in June. Until then, residents of Kororia village and those nearby will have to keep pace with the rising sun.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Subham Dutta Abdul Mannan (left) with Sujan Chakraborty outside the Assembly on Friday. Subham DuttaA DAY after BJP national general secretary and Bengal party in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya said his party could offer issue-based support to other Opposition parties, the Congress-Left alliance rejected the proposal on Friday, alleging that the saffron party had a tacit understanding with the ruling Trinamool Congress.Addressing a joint press conference outside the state Assembly with CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty, Congress legislator Abdul Mannan said: While their national leaders are coming to Bengal and praising the Trinamool government, state BJP leaders are trying to save their skin by saying such things. They should condemn the central BJP leaders actions and ask the Centre to step up investigations into the Saradha multi-crore scam.When we had urged all parties to unite against the Saradha scam, all parties had responded, except Trinamool and BJP. How can we rely on them? Mannan asked.Vijayvargiyas statement had come days after a similar view was expressed by state unit chief Dilip Ghosh. Tacit understanding and opposition cannot go hand in hand. We all know about the tacit understanding between BJP and Trinamool. So these talks of opposing Trinamool in the Assembly is nothing but a farce to fool the masses, Chakraborty said.Speaking about Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees first first administrative meeting on Friday, Mannan said: We were expecting that the chief minister would spare some words for the victims of post poll violence. At least, she would send out a stern message against the prevailing violence but she did not. She had said a lot in the Assembly yesterday but not today.While she spoke about people getting rice at Rs 2 per kg, thanks to the central government subsidy, she kept quiet about the escalating price of potatoes, which has reached Rs 26 per kg, he added.Claiming that the chief minister did not say anything against the Centre as she did not want to offend her friends in Delhi, Chakraborty said: What is of utmost priority at the moment is maintaining peace and arresting the escalating price of essential commodities. She did not say anything about any of these.Mannan said the two parties were ready to reach out to victims of poll violence. By June 16, they intend to visit at least six places that have seen such violence. Didibhai (Mamata Banerjee) and Modi bhais (Narendra Modi) understanding is clear, given the fact that Mamata did not say anything about the central government not passing on the benefit of lowered crude oil price to the people. We demand a tax rebate on prices of petrol and diesel, he added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Rs 152 crore has been set aside for the food processing and horticulture department, Rs 495 crore for the animal resources development department. Rs 250 crore for the fisheries department, Rs 2,277 crore for the irrigation and waterways, and a whopping Rs 10,653 crore for the panchayat and rural development department. This takes the total budgetary allocation for the rural Bengal to Rs 15,841 crore  the maximum for the Trinamool Congress government since its first came to power in 2011.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn his Budget speech, Mitra had said that in the agriculture and agri-allied sector, a seven-fold increase has been recorded from 2010-11 to 2015-16, with the earnings recording Rs 21,224.61 crore last year.According to the state figures, in agriculture and allied activities, the state claims to have achieved record agricultural production of 174 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of produce in 2015-16. Procurement of food grains has increased and warehousing facilities enhanced from 62,000 MT in 2010-2011 to 5.62 lakh MT in 2015-16  a nine-fold increase. In 2015, 30 lakh flood-affected farmers were provided assistance of Rs 1,025 crore in three months, the minister had said Friday.More than 10,000 kms of rural roads and 10,663 kms of highways were upgraded and constructed. The state has claimed that 100 per cent rural electrification is almost complete under Sabar Ghare Alo scheme.But agrarian activists want the state government to look at the other important issue  suicides of farmers.CPM has claimed in the past that at least 200 farmers in the state have committed suicide in the past three years. Of these, 116 suicides took place in Bardhaman alone.Activists allege that like the Left Front government before it, the TMC government too has refused to accept the states agrarian crisis. The worst affected, they say, have been the rice and potato farmers.Neither government made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give subsidy to farmers for crop cutting, which was cancelled by the Mamata Banerjee government. The production cost of crops has increased with the increase in prices of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, electricity. There is no water available for the crops either. We hope the outlay announced by the state government (in the Budget) should alleviate the situation to some extent. We are cautiously optimistic, an activist who has been working for the Right to Food said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Let us fully cooperate with them. When the world is moving ahead, Bengal cannot afford to sit back. Collective interest is bigger than individual interest, Mamata said after laying the foundation stone of an integrated consumer goods manufacturing unit at Panchla in Howrah and an IT Park at Rajarhat near Kolkata. Mamata also pre-commissioned another consumer goods manufacturing facility at Uluberia, also at Howrah.Assuring ITC Chairman Y C Deveshwar that her government would provide any cooperation necessary for more such projects in the future, the Chief Minister said West Bengal had over one lakh acres in terms of land bank which could be made available for industrial development.All we need is the demand. If you ask us for land for your projects, you will have it, Mamata claimed.We will have to do this for the good of the stateOnce a big industry comes, many ancillary units also come up creating jobs for the youth, she said, adding that that government was happy to collaborate wit an agro-based industry.Share This Article Related Article Bengal Global Business Summit: This meet is more than just a ritual, says Mukesh AmbaniBengal Global Business Summit: This meet is more than just a ritual, says Mukesh Ambani Day 1: Investment pledge worth Rs 93,600 croreDay 1: Investment pledge worth Rs 93,600 crore Mamata draws India Inc. crowd,promisesMamata draws India Inc. crowd,promises Mamata hardsells Bengal to India Inc.Mamata hardsells Bengal to India Inc. Mamata Banerjee: Land acquisition not to be a problem for projects in hand in West BengalMamata pitches for investment as she plays host to industry captainsPointing to the growing per capita income of the state, Mamata said, Bengal is an agriculture-driven state. Setting up food processing units is naturally the next step for us. Once these units come up, ancillary industries will also follow. Bengal is witnessing a growth of 10.5 per cent which is far higher than the national growth of 7.5 per cent. The per capita income has doubled and we have recorded an infrastructure growth of 600 per cent and development growth of 300 per cent.While agreeing that the growing per capita income should attract industry to Bengal, the ITC Chairman also admitted that the state government was unable to provide the group with contiguous plots. We had asked for 60 acres, but we got 40 acres at one place and another 18 acres at another. If we want to expand and increase production, it is more beneficial to get contiguous plots. For instance, we want to set up a cold chain and start manufacturing frozen foods. Right now we simply dont have the land for that, said Deveshwar, adding that if its gets better opportunities elsewhere, the group would expand outside the state.While Mamata thanked ITC for not shifting its headquarters from Kolkata, Deveshwar said, The ITC Group had its headquarters in Kolkata since 1910. But only three of our present 12 Bengal units existed in the state till five years ago. The rest have come up in Mamata Banerjees tenure and we are extremely grateful to the CM and her government for facilitating this.ITC would engage more with the farmers of the state, Deveshwar said, adding that it was experimenting with the manufacture of a special variety of seeds, which will not absorb moisture. The company is also developing a special kind of potato seeds as well.The integrated consumer goods manufacturing facility at Panchla is spread over 800,000 feet and will manufacture packaged food, including noodles and potato chips, and is expected to be commissioned by January next year.The facility at Uluberia is being built over 400,000 square feet and is likely to be completed by May 2016.The IT park at Rajarhat will come up in phases over 27 lakh square feet of built up space. The project to be completed by 2018, will create direct employment for 5,000 people.The ITC is further developing a Royal Bengal hotel next to the Shonar Bangla hotel in Kolkata.

This has precipitated a water crisis. There is scarcity of drinking water. The situation is still not alarming. But we are taking preemptive steps to ensure that people do not face major hardships. The problem is more acute in the West Medinipur and Purulia districts, though there are very few areas where there is no water, said Public Health Engineering Minister Subrata Mukherjee here.He added that as many as 20-28 lakh people are affected by the lack of rainfall, which is likely to hit crops production in West Bengal.After a meeting with various concerned officials, Mukherjee said that his department, along with zilla parishads and other offices, were working together to tackle the situation. He added that he had urged district magistrates to ensure that people do not panic. We are taking both short-term and long-term measures, the minister said.These measures taken by the Trinamool government under the Vision 2020 plan, Mukherjee said, include piped water supply schemes such a partially commissioned one at Barasukhjhora in West Medinipur and 1000 solar pump-based piped water supply system in various districts.Meanwhile, distressed farmers of the state have written to the state government expressing their worry on the prevailing crisis and demanded restructuring of loans. Kashi Patra, a peasant leader in Dhanikhali said the near-drought-like situation was compounded by the fact that the many ponds and rivers had also dried up in the heat.Water reservoirs at the Damodar Valley Corporation are a major source of irrigation in Dhaniakhali from December onwards. After the monsoon, water replenished in the reservoirs is used for cultivation of potato, paddy, jute and vegetables between January and May.

Now, after lying low for the past several years, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal.After lying low for the past several years after the Saradha scandal unfolded, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal, this time under the garb of agricultural schemes.The consumer affairs department has started a campaign against these chit funds which are operating on a small scale in various parts of Bengal.For more than a year we have been receiving several complaints, especially from rural Bengal about investors not getting returns or the capital siphoned off in various agricultural schemes, Consumer Affairs Minister Sadhan Pande told PTI.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe minister said that some chit funds promised huge returns on investment on potato purchase scheme and some others promised huge returns on tree plantation and poultry farming.These ponzi schemes are not big like Saradha or other major chit funds companies which are presently under the scanner of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, according to the minister.After the Saradha bubble burst in April, 2013, several Ponzi schemes and chit fund companies had to wind up their operations as central and state agencies cracked the whip amid protests by lakhs of defrauded investors.According to the consumer affairs department, these chit funds are operating at such a small level that at times it becomes tough even for the local administration to locate them.These operators are taking the advantage of lack of proper banking facilities, poverty and illiteracy of the investors. In most cases the promise of huge return lure the investors into the trap. In most cases the investors and the frauds are known to each other, a senior official said.The official said that in many cases these potato and other agricultural schemes offered investors guaranteed return of 20-100 per cent on their investment within a fixed period of time.A chit fund company, which is being investigated by the CBI, had started a scheme called potato flexi scheme promising huge returns on investment in potato business.On steps the consumer affairs department is taking to deal with such cases, a senior official of the department sounded helpless, saying, If you buy a fridge and you are facing a problem then we can solve the matter. But in these cases of local chit funds we have nothing much to do.Whenever we receive such complains, we direct the complainant to lodge an FIR and then direct these cases to the state finance ministry. Earlier when the Shyamal Sen Commission was there we used to send these complaints to the commission but now we send it to the state finance ministry, the official explained.Pande said that his department was conducting a campaign to make the poor and gullible rural people aware of the pitfalls of investment into these schemes.We are telling them that apart from bank, post office or government entities, they should not invest in any scheme or financial company which are not approved by the SEBI, RBI or other central financial agencies, Pande said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

When we talk about our demographic advantage, the young people in this country find the education system not fully aligned to the market. Also, when they get out of the university, they cant get jobs. And remember there are about 12 million people who move out of the university into the job market every year. The maximum job creation was in 2009, with 1.2 million jobs as opposed to the 12 million required, and there has been a constant decline after that. So I wonder what those 12 million will do. Whatever you do in life, if its disengaged, its a perilous journey not just for them individually but for the nation. I think political parties must get together because remember, there is no quick fix to this.It must start from the education system; from the schools. But the education system cannot be tweaked unless you have teachers. Teachers dont come from the air unless you have institutions to teach. Having done that, you move up the school ladder and go to the universities. What is the kind of teaching you must have in your university? What kind of a market interface must you have with the educational system? Where are the jobs being created? Where in future will jobs be created? Then align the education system to that opportunity within the economy, and you will have a purposive India. I dont see that happening; I dont see political parties discussing this.WATCH: Idea Exchange With Kapil SibalI only see angst, a sense of destruction through verbal abuse, allegations without proof, (talk of) a Congress-mukt Bharat, as if that will save this country from the impediments ahead. Thats my greatest worry, and unless you fix this, there is nothing else that will be fixed.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Modi government has completed two years and we all saw what happened at India Gate. So the impression that one got was that we are growing as a nation.I would love the nation to grow; I have no problem with that. I just have a problem with the statistics that he (PM Modi) has churned up. One of the statistics that he gave was of new ration cards  three crore. It is only 66 lakh. Then he said my Jan-Dhan (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana), in the first 100 days, saw 21 crore accounts. The fact is 8.6 crore. He said we have given new LPG cylinders to crores of people, but actually its only 45 lakh. So if the Prime Minister of India, at India Gate, talks of statistics which are incorrect, then how do you trust our leaders?The Central Statistical Organisation is also giving out data which economists are now questioning. So you may tom-tom about yourself but the fact of the matter is what is on the ground, and we all see that.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The aam aadmi seems to be buying these statistics.If dal is Rs 200 (a kilogram), then how is he buying these statistics? His income has not increased. If vegetables are as expensive as they are now, and if one tonne of potato sells for one rupee, then what statistics are we talking about? And whats the feel-good factor on the ground? What worries me is that you may have a wonderful advertising campaign but the fact of the matter is that when the voter thinks about himself, hell ask the question to himself at the right time  Has my life improved?. For the last 17 months, exports have been on the decline; imports are on the decline. So whats on the up? Modi. Nothing else is on the up.MANEESH CHHIBBER: So how does the Congress party plan to expose the government?I think we must take this message to the people. I think the media also needs to investigate this at the same time. When he (PM Modi) gives a statistic for example he said in America that India is a $9 trillion economy, when were just about near 2 trillion. Now the press did not pick it up. So how do we deal with this? They repeat the same statistics. He goes to Kerala and compares us with Somalia. Of course he got some flak for that, but I think every time he makes a statement, for him its an election rally speech You dont act like the Prime Minister of India; you act as if youre an RSS pracharak. You spew venom and you give statistics thinking that its the next election. And then suddenly, one of them goes and has food at a Dalits house when hes not even a Dalit. You should remember Modis tweet on a previous occasion about this.COOMI KAPOOR: Why has the Congress not been able to capitalise on the failures of the Modi government? And the Congresss own position has come down in the last two years. It has lost its stronghold in Kerala, in Bengal, in AssamSince when did a government in Kerala win a second term? Thats the pattern. As far as Assam is concerned, were deeply disappointed about that, but how many chief ministers have got a fourth term in the history of this country? Hardly any. Our vote percentage in Assam is 31 per cent. I think where we might have gone wrong is with the alliances. In West Bengal, we have emerged actually as an alternative to the TMC, because in our alliance we have gained much more and were now leading the Opposition there. The DMK, I think, was a great disappointment because there the pattern also is the AIADMK and DMK. We could have won. I think again, if we had made some alliances, we might well have succeeded. But if you look at it overall, the BJP fought 696 (Assembly) seats (in all) and got 64, and we fought 335 and got 135.AMBREEN KHAN: Sonia Gandhi said the Prime Minister behaves like a Shahenshah. What does that imply?I think Arun Shourie put it very well in the course of his interview  narcissism, megalomania, trying to control the government, a statue at Madame Tussauds. They give you an indication of the persona of the Prime Minister. Giving out statistics without regard to the truth and basically concentrating everything in the PMO, not allowing his ministers the kind of freedom that was allowed during the UPA government these are personal traits of character wearing a name-printed striped suite and then auctioning it off. These are all very significant characteristics of a man who basically is in love with himself, which is not a bad thing, but in politics it may not sometimes succeed for a long period of time.LIZ MATHEW: Regional parties have been successful in keeping out the BJP to an extent. But why has the BJP managed to defeat the Congress so easily?If you go back to analyse the decline of the Congress party, I think we go back several years, to the compromises that we made with regional parties by sharing seats What happens in politics is that the moment you compromise for sharing of seats, then your entire cadre shifts from one party to the other, and thats the genesis of the decline of our regional presence.We did it in Uttar Pradesh, and see the consequences of it. We have not done it in Odisha but there the Congress has been a weak force for a long time. Luckily, we are now the alternative in West Bengal. I dont think we made a mistake because, had we gone with the TMC, we would have landed in a much worse position.SHALINI NAIR: The Prime Minister often raises the point that governance under the NDA, unlike the Congress regime, has been corruption-free.What are the charges of corruption against the Congress party during the UPA regime? It started in 2010-11 with the telecom issue. What was the corruption there? We did not sell the spectrum because the policy was not to sell. It may be right, it may be wrong, the Supreme Court ultimately said it was wrong, so you auction it. What is the result of that auction? That the very telecom sector which bought 5 Megahertz of spectrum at an administered price of Rs1,680 crore buys it for Rs 45,000 crore and that goes to the consolidated fund of India. Now, you will not call this a scam, because all this money has gone to the Government of India, which should have gone to the sector, so the result is that, by calling it a scam, and by reversing the policy, you have, in fact, destroyed the sector. The same with coal, nobody wants a coal mine anymore.RITIKA CHOPRA: In a recent interview, Smriti Irani said that during her predecessors regime, education had become a political akhada, states wouldnt see eye to eye, whereas she has achieved consensus.I dont want to react to what Smriti Irani says. I think the people of this country know how the education department is being run. Did we appoint RSS people or Congress-minded people as vice-chancellors of universities? Did we appoint people of a particular ideology as directors of IIT? Was there a controversy about the Prime Ministers degree? What about the corruption in Madhya Pradesh, the Vyapam scam? Is that not the BJP?AMITABH SINHA: As a former HRD minister, what is your opinion on Smriti Iranis tenure so far?Im not worried about individuals, Im worried about the change of textbooks, Im worried about the effacing of history, Im worried about a Vedic board being created. See, these are real worries. You tell Ramdev that you can have a private Vedic board in India so that our children get aligned to that ideology as they grow up. Im worried about that. Im not worried about Smriti Irani, Im worried about what she symbolises.LIZ MATHEW: After the rout in the recent state elections, some in the Congress have talked about surgery and changes in the party. What do you think is the way forward?Surgery of a political party will not change the future of India. We need to do a lot of things within the Congress party, but thats not enough. We are here for the nation, we are not here for the Congress. We are presenting an alternative, right? That may be an unacceptable alternative, to that extent we need to change, to provide a wholly acceptable alternative, and people who have voted against us, we must bring them back to our fold, to say that this is the only party that recognises the needs, the aspirations, and the pain of every Indian.SHEELA BHATT: Sonia Gandhi called the charges against Robert Vadra a conspiracy. But why make it political?Who says dont investigate? But you leak the email to the media, then you have the media play it up, that is what Mrs Gandhi is talking about. Your intentions are not to investigate in a fair manner, your intention is to besmirch the name, to have another way of saying you want to have a Congress-mukt Bharat. Who is stopping your investigation? Did we say dont investigate? Why dont they agree to an SIT under the Supreme Court? In all these allegations, have you found a single case where a Congress person has been convicted? This is all media stuff. You get something, you leak something, then you give a spin to it, then the Finance Minister writes a blog, then his people go up on television, then you create an atmosphere, and then you say he is corrupt. And when it comes to you, that piece of paper that names family members of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and the money trail, then thats irrelevant.COOMI KAPOOR: Some people see similarities between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. What is your opinion?Let Donald Trump fight the election then I will give you my opinion. But you have my opinion of Modi anyway.MANEESH CHHIBBER: Why is the Congress party always defending Robert Vadra and his alleged wrongdoings?The point is that he happens to be associated with a person who is part of the family of the Congress leadership. So when you make an allegation against him, in a sense you are making an allegation against the Congress party. If the Congress party does not respond, then you would say that the Congress party has accepted it. Fact of the matter is, if you make a false allegation, the person is entitled to say it is false.AFRAZ ALAM: This whole wave of admiration for Modis work has only increased in the last two years. Even if the people start rethinking about their decision to choose Modi, what is the alternative?You must know that there is an army out there, which is funded by a particular political party, which has enormous presence in the social media to serve a particular purpose. That army whenever I say something will attack me within two minutes, then they will praise Modi. It is a self-serving army which is part of the narcissism that I talked about. There is a lot of trolling against Modi today I bet that in the next two years, you will have an alternative. An alternative that will be far more compassionate, far more acceptable, far more inclusive and far less obsessed with himself or herself.ANANT GOENKA: Do you agree then there is a need for an internal organisational change in the Congress?There is no dispute that reform is needed. You ask us about the big idea, but Modi did not come with any big idea. It was lies, lies and damn lies. He was selling a dream and a person who looks forward to the next day for survival will buy a dream. So people of this country bought a dream.AMBREEN KHAN : So who will be able to sell the big dream in Uttar Pradesh?We should go back to the people of this country and say, We will not tell you lies, we will try and tell you what the reality is, believe us and give us a chance. All these guys have fooled you by telling lies, we will not do that. I think it is time for us to tell this to the people of our country.MANEESH CHHIBBER: We saw what happened in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. What is your partys take on it?I think we need an amendment in the defection law. We should have a new law which says two things: first, that you are free to defect, but if you defect, you will not get a public position for the next five years. Even if you succeed in an election, you will not get a public position or ministerial post in the next five years. If you defect in the middle of your term, you will not be entitled to stand for elections in the middle of that term. If you do that, then this buying of people, horse-trading and all these shenanigans will stop. We should take off our political hat and think of the future of India. You cannot have a future that is bright when you have a party in power at the Centre destroying constitutionally elected governments in this completely amoral fashion. The other grave concern I have is (regarding) the investigating agencies, whether it is the NIA, CBI or Enforcement Directorate. These have by and large become tools in the hands of the dispensation which is in power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The collapse of the Kolkata flyover, which killed 27 people, was described by its builders as an act of God, an expression that has a specific legal meaning.Twenty-three days after a section of Vivekananda Flyover in Girish Park area of north Kolkata caved in, killing 27 people, leaving 80 others injured and turning into a political hot potato for the ruling Trinamool Congress, the last of the debris was cleared on Saturday.The West Bengal government had been eager to clear the debris not just to clear a traffic bottleneck on a busy commercial street in a congested part of the city but also to remove from sight what was being used by the Opposition parties as an election issue.After the state chief secretary put in a request with the Railway Board chairman, the Indian Railways, on April 7, had accepted what looked like an engineering challenge. The PSU Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) was given the job, even though no railway arm had any experience in taking on an assignment like this before.The intended 2.2-km under-construction flyover, which collapsed after a 490-foot steel span fell during construction, thew up a unique challenge. Its girders were woefully close to decades-old buildings on both sides of the road. The structure, officials said, had to be cut into large pieces and moved without damaging the buildings and creating civilian distress.RVNL pressed into service several huge diamond cutters to cut the flyovers remains into pieces and deployed a 180-ton crane to move the material. Satish Agnihotri, CMD, RVNL, said: Since the buildings were so close to the flyover, we could not risk any structure falling on them while work was going on. So we joined the two flanks of the bridge by welding (them) so that it doesnt collapse on the road.After about 10 days of work, the accumulated debris several truckloads  were handed over to the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, which owns the bridge and had awarded the work contract to the Hyderabad-based firm IVRCL.Under fire, the Trinamool Congress had maintained that work contract of the flyover was awarded by the erstwhile Left Front government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo) Canal filling work has stopped in Chunni, Punjab. (Express Photo)Ranjit Singh, of Sirsa Nangal village in Ropar district, is busy making plans for the crop that he would be sowing once land is ready. The eight-and-a-half acres that he is hoping to cultivate is the land the Punjab government acquired from him for construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal, and now wants to give back to him.A driver by profession, Ranjits land was acquired in 1978 for Rs 8,000 per acre. The canal runs through the middle of his land dividing it in two halves. He hopes to fill the canal and start agriculture on the entire stretch. The huge mounds of mud are evidence that he has already set out to do this.A total of 820 acres was acquired in Ropar, a Shiromani Akali Dal stronghold. Around 100 acres of this is in Sirsa Nangal village.Read  Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal issue: Field of dreamsThe windfall opportunity presented by Punjab Sutlej-Yamuna Link Land (Return of Property Rights) Bill 2016, may never become a reality but everyone along the canal already has a plan, fuelled by the prevailing high prices of land.Along both sides of the alignment, land prices range from Rs 10 lakh per acre to even Rs 1 crore per acre, depending on how close it is to the highway. Despite the order of the Supreme Court freezing all landfilling activity and maintain status quo at the canal, the people who stand to benefit hope that politics will trump legalities.We are in possession of the land now, we are prepared to fight for it. If they want it back, they have to pay us the new rates, is the refrain everywhere.Paramjit Singh Makkar, the president of Ropar MC, says people are of the view that they own the land now that the Bill has been passed by the Assembly. The general sentiment is that even if the SC passes an order, the land has already been reclaimed. The order will be on SYL and not their land is how people see it, says Makkar, who has been touring villages in Ropar. He says there was jubilation among the people when the Bill was passed and now they are satisfied that they are owners of this land.For Swaran Singh of Bada Pind of Ropar, whose family has had to relocate no less than three times due to land acquisition for various projects, last weeks Bill in the Punjab Assembly has opened up new possibilities.We had around 40 acres of land in the area. Some was acquired by the Railways for laying a track. Then it was acquired for Bhakra Canal and a few years later for SYL. I have three other brothers. Together we have 10 children. The landholding kept shrinking. We would now be getting around 7 acres land back. We have many plans. Either we could start a fish farm or start cultivating the land. The land has opened many new options he saidRanjit Singh said he took over the land only after being asked by SAD leaders to do so. The land was acquired by the government from my father. We were paid a pittance then. A case was filed in the High Court seeking enhancement in compensation. We spent more money fighting court cases than what we received. No enhancement was given, he said. JCBs leveled his field last week, and he supervised the work.A few metres from Ranjit Singhs plot, Lakhbir Singh. who has also taken back his land, said with Hola Mohalla approaching, he would make available his four acres to devotees who come to the village gurdwara as a parking area, and then he would start cultivating it. I want to grow wheat and paddy here. It is a fertile land The land was acquired before I was born. I do not know the exact amount my grandfather was paid. At present, the cost of the land is around Rs 15 lakh per acre. I am thrilled, he said.After the real estate boom, land prices have skyrocketed.My family lost 17 acres to SYL. That was in the late 1970s. We were given compensation of Rs 40,000 per acre then. Today, every acre in our village is worth Rs 2 crore. Even if I sell it off at half the market price of Rs 1 crore each, it could fetch me Rs 17 crore, said Gursewak Singh, a farmer of Bhatrias village in Patiala district, with a spark in his eyes.Left with 16 acres after the acquisition of 17 acres, he has been growing potatoes, peas and other vegetables on the land, sinking tubewells for irrigation.The land should be given back to us. Badal sahib is right when he wants to give it back to the farmers, he added.Ajeet Singh Jeeti of Fatehpur Garhi village in Patiala said an impossible dream would come true. He was growing vegetables on eight acres of land. Four acres was acquired for the SYL. But working over two days with JCBs, a team of Youth Akali Dal led by the outfits Malwa II president, Harpal Juneja, turned the clock back for him. It is a plain field now. I can grow anything. It feels good to see the field that I was told about by my father.He said he had planned to sow fodder crop, but would now wait to see how it played out in the Supreme Court.Those who did not level the canal on Day 1 after the Bill was passed, are wishing they had done so before the Supreme Courts status quo order. The JCBs have been sent back. But I am hopeful. When a legislature passes a bill, it does hold sanctity, said Gagandeep Singh, a farmer in Fatehpur Garhi village.The people are confident that the government will find a way out of the legal imbroglio. Our land is nearer to the highway and would cost anything between Rs 35 to Rs 50 lakh an acre. The government has given us our land back and we have full faith, said landowner Amrik Singh of Bada Pind in Ropar that our interests would be protected.Amrik Singh said the youth are unemployed. They have no other option but to return to agriculture. The canal was and is a waste, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Shubhangi Khapre) Students at the residential tribal school in Permili. (Express Photo by Shubhangi Khapre)Meenakshi Gorantra Penda, 14, will appear for her class-X board exams from the Government Primary and Secondary Tribal School in Permili village of Gadchiroli, where she is a resident student. She is worried that the school has not begun even the first chapter in science with barely three months to go.Vijay Namdeo, preparing for his XII board exams, is struggling with mathematics, as is every other student who has chosen that subject. The school has no teacher for mathematics in class-XII.The ashram shala, or tribal school, in this Naxal-hit district houses some 175 students from classes I to XII. The Maharashtra tribal welfare department has set aside a budget of Rs 1,200 crore for ashram shalas, which are a prominent feature of an integrated tribal policy that the government is working on. Officials said they are providing every possible facility from a central kitchen to uniform and books.There will be no shortage of funds when it comes to providing the best facilities to tribal students, said Minister for Tribal Welfare Vishnu Sawara.However, a senior secretary conceded, mismanagement in tribal residential schools is a fact despite huge funds having been set aside for their functioning. And the reason they are so short of teachers is apparently that qualified teachers are rarely willing to stay in these schools for very long.School authorities at Permili were not willing to come on record. We have good basic infrastructure, said a senior official involved in the management of the school. But the biggest problem is to get teachers who would come regularly and take lessons. The standard of teachers and continuity in covering all subjects has always been a problem here.The Permili school is one of 529 ashram shalas across Maharashtra, aimed at bringing tribal children to mainstream education.Permili is a little village dotted with bamboo and grass huts. The school stands out as a sprawling concrete cement structure. Students come from the interiors of the Naxal belt  Sironcha, Allapalli, Gadchiroli.At the centre of the residential school is a playground. Kanchan Pilvatre of class-VI said food is not a problem. Lunch comprises rice, roti and curry; evening tea includes puffed rice cooked with onions and potatoes along with cooked gram, and dinner is again roti, curry and rice. But what we want is regular lessons, said one girl.Subhash Nana Atram of class-XII said, We have only two teachers, who come and teach Marathi and biology. We have lodged complaints as science students find it difficult to handle physics, chemistry and mathematics. How are we going to perform in the board exams when not a single chapter has been taught in these subjects?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Lakhs of people have taken shelter in relief camps which suffer from shortage of food and drinking water. Cattle are the worst affected and the district administration is making all efforts to arrange feed for them.The ghats of the temple city have been submerged and the cremation at two places has slowed down.

5941a38c7be9e0192d33ae4c,Agriculture Reform: Breaking the trader cartel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agriculture-reform-breaking-the-trader-cartel-2855435/,2016-06-16,,Indian Express,"The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
