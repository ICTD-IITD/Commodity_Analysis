His one inmate is used to -2 degrees Celsius, the other to 40-degree temperatures; the biggest weighs in at 2,500 kg, the smallest is lighter than 15 gm; one calls for wheelbarrow khichdi meals, the other for kheer. 176 acres, 1,500-plus creatures, 200 workers, and mercury grazing 50. If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

Naresh is not a permanent employee as yet.Outside, Kalpana and her cubs are playing in a 50-m-long pool designed for the summer. After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."

Monday was Day One of the strike called to protest against the recent changes in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act, 1970.MP Raju Shetti said they would be seeking the permission of the state government to directly sell fruits and vegetables on open grounds, school grounds and other outlets too.The state government recently delisted fruits and vegetables from APMC and also changed the way commission was being charged. Till recently, traders and commission agents used to charge commission from the farmers and that would be deducted from the latters final bill. The present amendment has mandated that the commission be charged from the end buyer. Commission is the fee levied by traders for selling the produce of the farmer and is normally fixed by the market committees.

I carefully checked every paper I came across in this house, said Corina. The most precious things in the collection are a couple ledgers of the FJM company and a mould of the bricks.Among other things in the mini-museum are differently-shaped storing and cooking vessels, a compact mirror, black veils worn to church, a potato masher, bullets of an old air gun, ladles , flasks, a potato mincer, a ghumat (musical instrument made from clay and lizard skin used in weddings) and a phorma (a big vessel used to bake cakes and cook piglet delicacies).The Misquittas have also preserved a wooden bed, cabinet and a collection of their grandmothers crockery in their Burma teak house which roofed four generations of the family.Corina is grateful to her husband who convinced her to store the items instead of scrapping them.I was shocked to see such fascinating things in the house, so I wanted to keep things in remembrance of my wifes ancestors, said Chandrashekhar, a manufacturer and supplier of firefighting and safety equipment. He added, What you see is only 25 per cent of what we found. We threw away a lot of stuff too, she said.She reminisced, My grandparents used to own 38,000 square feet of plot.

And, it is likely to increase further in coming weeks, said an official adding that tur dal price per kilogramme on Friday was around Rs 140.However, price in the retail market was more than Rs 200 per kilogramme, admitted the official, adding that shortage of pulses has led to a rise in prices.

Maharashtra Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Vinod Tawde.Maharashtra Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Vinod Tawde, who is mulling the idea of making yoga part of the school curriculum Wednesday tweeted that students practising yoga every day will be awarded marks like in sports. Tawde tweeted this after attending a yoga session in Mumbai with Baba Ramdev.Tawde late on Wednesday night tweeted: Urged students to benefit from yoga, students practising yoga everyday will be awarded marks like in sports.Last year in June during a yoga session at a municipal school in Vile Parle on International Yoga Day, Tawde had openly asked students and teachers whether they would like to have yoga as a subject or part of their physical education class.Tawde said, Why cant marks be awarded to students for yoga. This will encourage more and more students to practice yoga from the early age.According to Tawde, instead of spending free time surfing internet and becoming a couch potato by continuously watching TV, students can practice yoga and enjoy its benefit. Learning Yoga from an early age is very beneficial as it would not only help students maintain their health, but also help them concentrate on academics, he added.Even earlier on several occasions Tawde had hinted that the state government was seriously thinking of incorporating yoga in the school curriculum.We are currently discussing the idea with yoga experts, academicians, school managements and officials of the school education department on how we can go about it.

5935a17a7be9e061bdcfebaa,Unauthorised fodder business thrives in drought-hit areas inÂ Maharashtra,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/eknath-khadse-unauthorised-fodder-business-thrives-in-drought-hit-areas-in-maharashtra/,2016-02-18,"Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Eknath KhadseMaharashtra Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse Wednesday admitted that the government has found a number of unauthorised fodder camps set up in the drought-hit districts of Beed, Osmanabad and Latur, all in Marathwada.Just as Maharashtra is already footing a Rs 4-crore bill daily to provide fodder and water for cattle in drought-hit areas, Khadse conceded that demands to regularise even the illegally running fodder camps are being made.Our appeal to those running such camps is to either apply for permissions from the government or transfer animals they shelter to units with valid permissions, Khadse said.The thriving fodder lobby enjoys considerable political clout, claiming that they had even succeeding in getting the government to reverse a decision that was taken to ensure the state is not hit by a fodder scam.Following report that adequate fodder for animals was available in Beed, Osmanabad, and Latur that could last till May, Khadses department had asked collectors to close down government-aided camps at all places where the fodder was available in surplus. Khadse, who also heads the Maharashtra cabinets sub-committee on drought mitigation measures, said about 10.75 lakh tonne fodder was available in these three districts.But on Wednesday, Khadse was forced to retract the decision as it was becoming politically a hot potato for the BJP. Besides the Opposition, even politicians from the BJP and the Sena were up in arms against it. Two senior ministers  Pankaja Munde (BJP) and Deepak Sawant (Shiv Sena)  spoke against the move.While Khadse was reportedly upset over the demand to reverse the decision and insisted it was being taken only as a step to prevent malpractices, Munde and Sawant had the backing of other senior ministers, who reportedly said it would be politically unwise for the government to go against popular opinion. Even the Chief Minister had asked Khadse to reconsider the decision in light of the sentiments of elected representatives.Though Khadse ceded ground, he also sounded a caution. Previous experiences regarding fodder camps have not been good. We have seen scams worth several hundred crores. The administration was only taking steps to ensure no repeat.Despite failing to secure the backing of fellow cabinet ministers for his previous decision, Khadse put up a brave face on Wednesday. There is no question of prestige or politics. The decision was not etched in stone and has been retracted, he said.About 2.08 lakh animals are sheltered in 237 legally permitted fodder camps in the state. The Beed and Osmanabad districts account for most of these. The minister also fired a barb, saying the decision had been taken after reports revealed that about 1,200 animals had been brought back home, indicating sufficient fodder was available.The elected representatives, however, pointed out that water scarcity still prevails and insisted the camps be continued, Khadse said. Amid all the heated argument in the cabinet, it was decided that all ministers and some Ministers of State would tour Marathwada before the budget session on March 9 to review drought mitigation measures.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

I do not know what he was trying to achieve but the government, BJP and the people are standing firmly behind the Indian Army, Shah said accusing both Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of politicising the Army.The question is why you (Congress) are not happy, enthusiastic and proud of this, Shah said. It shows there is some fundamental flaw in youInstead of joining people in their happiness, the Congress party is with Pakistan in its despair.The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes, Shah said in reply to a question whether the strikes would feature in the BJP campaign in next years Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Zaroor jayenge, he said. I said at the very beginning that if some tehsil president had put up some posters (a reference to posters celebrating the strikes) that should not be taken into account. But we will go to the public because Army morale needs to be boosted and this achievement of the Army needs to be lauded. It was the achievement of the Army and the political will of Narendra Modi. Government was careful from the first day not to politicisethat is why the briefing was done by the DGMO and not by a political functionary, Shah said.Rahul Gandhis clarification in the morning did not cut much ice, Shah said claiming that BJP had kept all its poll promises  from securing the countrys borders and not allowing anybody to get away with beheading our jawans to one rank, one pension.Suggesting that those casting doubts on the authenticity of the strikes are anti-India leaders, Shah said, The whole country, BJP and its government are standing firmly behind the Army. We do not trust the anti-India rhetoric of leaders, we trust the bullets of our Army men.Gandhi, he said, should concentrate on potato factory, a swipe at this comments to farmers that they want potato factories. Shah also appeared to dismiss demands for releasing video evidence, saying who is seeking them.Shah brushed aside Pakistans denial. Then what was the special Pak Parliament session all about, he asked, and why is the Pak Prime Minister who comes to Islamabad only 3-4 times a month camping in Islamabad.As for Kejriwals remarks that India should counter Paks denial propaganda, he said that there is no doubt who is benefiting from his comments because Pakistanis are making him trend on twitter. The reference was to the hashtag PakStandsWithKejriwal that began trending on Thursday.Shah said Congress and Rahul Gandhi dislike Modi and recalled expressions like maut ke saudagar, (merchant of death) and zeher ki kheti (sowing poison) used by his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against Modi. The BJP won a two-thirds majority in Gujarat after maut ke saudagar and a majority after zeher ki kheti comments, Shah said, wondering how the latest statement will play out.He lauded the media for what he called its support of the government on its stand on Pakistan.Investigative journalists have dug out the truth from across the border, he said. On October 4, The Indian Express had reported eyewitness accounts of the surgical strikes from across the border.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Source: PTI)Bihar BJP appeared to be divided over the condition of flood relief camps set up by the Nitish Kumar government with party MP Shatrughan Sinha hailing them and senior leader Sushil Kumar Modi alleging that anarchy prevailed in them.Bollywood actor and Patna Sahib MP Sinha, after a visit to the camps in Bhakhtiyarpur area of Patna district on September 4, had lauded their functioning and praised his friend Nitish.He had told reporters that relief operations were being carried out well by the administration and lauded the Chief Minister saying he had done an excellent work for the marooned people.But, Modi differed sharply.He (Sinha) might have seen good conditions at the camps he visited but I have been going to the camps in different areas for the past 9-10 days and I have found that anarchy prevailed in them, he told reporters.The state government had promised to provide five kg rice, two kg potato and one kg pulse to the flood victims but none of that was visible in the majority of the camps, Modi, who is the Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Council, alleged, adding that there was gross non-availability of fodder for the animals in the inundated areas.On the other hand, Sinha told PTI that he narrated what he saw and experienced at the relief camps.I do not believe in mixing politics at times of human tragedies and natural calamitiesEverybody must follow the path of consensus in this hour of grief instead of confrontation, Sinha, popularly known as Bihari Babu, said without naming Modi.Sinha has been singing a different tune than that of the BJP ever since the Bihar Assembly polls last year in which he was ignored by the party.His praise of the state government and the Chief Minister provided ammunition to the ruling JD(U) in the state to fire salvo at the saffron party and its state leaders.JD(U) chief spokesman Sanjay Singh lauded Sinha for speaking the truth unlike Sushil Modi who always sees politics even in a human tragedy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Rs 152 crore has been set aside for the food processing and horticulture department, Rs 495 crore for the animal resources development department. Rs 250 crore for the fisheries department, Rs 2,277 crore for the irrigation and waterways, and a whopping Rs 10,653 crore for the panchayat and rural development department. This takes the total budgetary allocation for the rural Bengal to Rs 15,841 crore  the maximum for the Trinamool Congress government since its first came to power in 2011.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn his Budget speech, Mitra had said that in the agriculture and agri-allied sector, a seven-fold increase has been recorded from 2010-11 to 2015-16, with the earnings recording Rs 21,224.61 crore last year.According to the state figures, in agriculture and allied activities, the state claims to have achieved record agricultural production of 174 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of produce in 2015-16. Procurement of food grains has increased and warehousing facilities enhanced from 62,000 MT in 2010-2011 to 5.62 lakh MT in 2015-16  a nine-fold increase. In 2015, 30 lakh flood-affected farmers were provided assistance of Rs 1,025 crore in three months, the minister had said Friday.More than 10,000 kms of rural roads and 10,663 kms of highways were upgraded and constructed. The state has claimed that 100 per cent rural electrification is almost complete under Sabar Ghare Alo scheme.But agrarian activists want the state government to look at the other important issue  suicides of farmers.CPM has claimed in the past that at least 200 farmers in the state have committed suicide in the past three years. Of these, 116 suicides took place in Bardhaman alone.Activists allege that like the Left Front government before it, the TMC government too has refused to accept the states agrarian crisis. The worst affected, they say, have been the rice and potato farmers.Neither government made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give subsidy to farmers for crop cutting, which was cancelled by the Mamata Banerjee government. The production cost of crops has increased with the increase in prices of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, electricity. There is no water available for the crops either. We hope the outlay announced by the state government (in the Budget) should alleviate the situation to some extent. We are cautiously optimistic, an activist who has been working for the Right to Food said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Subham Dutta)THE ITC Wednesday unveiled three projects in West Bengal involving an investment of Rs 3,000 crore as Chief Minister Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stressed on the need to cooperate with the industry to take the state on progress path.Let us not disturb the industry. Let us fully cooperate with them. When the world is moving ahead, Bengal cannot afford to sit back. Collective interest is bigger than individual interest, Mamata said after laying the foundation stone of an integrated consumer goods manufacturing unit at Panchla in Howrah and an IT Park at Rajarhat near Kolkata. Mamata also pre-commissioned another consumer goods manufacturing facility at Uluberia, also at Howrah.Assuring ITC Chairman Y C Deveshwar that her government would provide any cooperation necessary for more such projects in the future, the Chief Minister said West Bengal had over one lakh acres in terms of land bank which could be made available for industrial development.All we need is the demand. If you ask us for land for your projects, you will have it, Mamata claimed.We will have to do this for the good of the stateOnce a big industry comes, many ancillary units also come up creating jobs for the youth, she said, adding that that government was happy to collaborate wit an agro-based industry.Share This Article Related Article Bengal Global Business Summit: This meet is more than just a ritual, says Mukesh AmbaniBengal Global Business Summit: This meet is more than just a ritual, says Mukesh Ambani Day 1: Investment pledge worth Rs 93,600 croreDay 1: Investment pledge worth Rs 93,600 crore Mamata draws India Inc. crowd,promisesMamata draws India Inc. crowd,promises Mamata hardsells Bengal to India Inc.Mamata hardsells Bengal to India Inc. Mamata Banerjee: Land acquisition not to be a problem for projects in hand in West BengalMamata pitches for investment as she plays host to industry captainsPointing to the growing per capita income of the state, Mamata said, Bengal is an agriculture-driven state. Setting up food processing units is naturally the next step for us. Once these units come up, ancillary industries will also follow. Bengal is witnessing a growth of 10.5 per cent which is far higher than the national growth of 7.5 per cent. The per capita income has doubled and we have recorded an infrastructure growth of 600 per cent and development growth of 300 per cent.While agreeing that the growing per capita income should attract industry to Bengal, the ITC Chairman also admitted that the state government was unable to provide the group with contiguous plots. We had asked for 60 acres, but we got 40 acres at one place and another 18 acres at another. If we want to expand and increase production, it is more beneficial to get contiguous plots. For instance, we want to set up a cold chain and start manufacturing frozen foods. Right now we simply dont have the land for that, said Deveshwar, adding that if its gets better opportunities elsewhere, the group would expand outside the state.While Mamata thanked ITC for not shifting its headquarters from Kolkata, Deveshwar said, The ITC Group had its headquarters in Kolkata since 1910. But only three of our present 12 Bengal units existed in the state till five years ago. The rest have come up in Mamata Banerjees tenure and we are extremely grateful to the CM and her government for facilitating this.ITC would engage more with the farmers of the state, Deveshwar said, adding that it was experimenting with the manufacture of a special variety of seeds, which will not absorb moisture. The company is also developing a special kind of potato seeds as well.The integrated consumer goods manufacturing facility at Panchla is spread over 800,000 feet and will manufacture packaged food, including noodles and potato chips, and is expected to be commissioned by January next year.The facility at Uluberia is being built over 400,000 square feet and is likely to be completed by May 2016.The IT park at Rajarhat will come up in phases over 27 lakh square feet of built up space. The project to be completed by 2018, will create direct employment for 5,000 people.The ITC is further developing a Royal Bengal hotel next to the Shonar Bangla hotel in Kolkata. With an investment of Rs 1000 crores, the new hotel is set to be ready by the end of next year.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Now, after lying low for the past several years, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal. Left party supporters take part in a rally in Kolkata to protest against West Bengal Government over Saradha chit fund scam in 2013. Now, after lying low for the past several years, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal.After lying low for the past several years after the Saradha scandal unfolded, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal, this time under the garb of agricultural schemes.The consumer affairs department has started a campaign against these chit funds which are operating on a small scale in various parts of Bengal.For more than a year we have been receiving several complaints, especially from rural Bengal about investors not getting returns or the capital siphoned off in various agricultural schemes, Consumer Affairs Minister Sadhan Pande told PTI.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe minister said that some chit funds promised huge returns on investment on potato purchase scheme and some others promised huge returns on tree plantation and poultry farming.These ponzi schemes are not big like Saradha or other major chit funds companies which are presently under the scanner of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, according to the minister.After the Saradha bubble burst in April, 2013, several Ponzi schemes and chit fund companies had to wind up their operations as central and state agencies cracked the whip amid protests by lakhs of defrauded investors.According to the consumer affairs department, these chit funds are operating at such a small level that at times it becomes tough even for the local administration to locate them.These operators are taking the advantage of lack of proper banking facilities, poverty and illiteracy of the investors. In most cases the promise of huge return lure the investors into the trap. In most cases the investors and the frauds are known to each other, a senior official said.The official said that in many cases these potato and other agricultural schemes offered investors guaranteed return of 20-100 per cent on their investment within a fixed period of time.A chit fund company, which is being investigated by the CBI, had started a scheme called potato flexi scheme promising huge returns on investment in potato business.On steps the consumer affairs department is taking to deal with such cases, a senior official of the department sounded helpless, saying, If you buy a fridge and you are facing a problem then we can solve the matter. But in these cases of local chit funds we have nothing much to do.Whenever we receive such complains, we direct the complainant to lodge an FIR and then direct these cases to the state finance ministry. Earlier when the Shyamal Sen Commission was there we used to send these complaints to the commission but now we send it to the state finance ministry, the official explained.Pande said that his department was conducting a campaign to make the poor and gullible rural people aware of the pitfalls of investment into these schemes.We are telling them that apart from bank, post office or government entities, they should not invest in any scheme or financial company which are not approved by the SEBI, RBI or other central financial agencies, Pande said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi) Former Union HRD minister Kapil Sibal (right) with Chief of Bureau Maneesh Chhibber at The Indian Express office in Delhi. (Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)Why Kapil Sibal?Kapil Sibal held the important portfolios of HRD and Telecom in the UPA government. The changes in education system brought in under him are now being examined by the Smriti Irani-led ministry. He remains one of the leading lights of the Congress and was recently nominated by the party, that is looking for strong voices in Parliament, for a Rajya Sabha ticket. A legal eagle, Sibal has returned to a successful practice and is leading the Gandhi familys defence in the National Herald caseKAPIL SIBAL: My biggest worry for the country is that an aspirational India finds itself in great difficulty. When we talk about our demographic advantage, the young people in this country find the education system not fully aligned to the market. Also, when they get out of the university, they cant get jobs. And remember there are about 12 million people who move out of the university into the job market every year. The maximum job creation was in 2009, with 1.2 million jobs as opposed to the 12 million required, and there has been a constant decline after that. So I wonder what those 12 million will do. Whatever you do in life, if its disengaged, its a perilous journey not just for them individually but for the nation. I think political parties must get together because remember, there is no quick fix to this.It must start from the education system; from the schools. But the education system cannot be tweaked unless you have teachers. Teachers dont come from the air unless you have institutions to teach. Having done that, you move up the school ladder and go to the universities. What is the kind of teaching you must have in your university? What kind of a market interface must you have with the educational system? Where are the jobs being created? Where in future will jobs be created? Then align the education system to that opportunity within the economy, and you will have a purposive India. I dont see that happening; I dont see political parties discussing this.WATCH: Idea Exchange With Kapil SibalI only see angst, a sense of destruction through verbal abuse, allegations without proof, (talk of) a Congress-mukt Bharat, as if that will save this country from the impediments ahead. Thats my greatest worry, and unless you fix this, there is nothing else that will be fixed.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Modi government has completed two years and we all saw what happened at India Gate. So the impression that one got was that we are growing as a nation.I would love the nation to grow; I have no problem with that. I just have a problem with the statistics that he (PM Modi) has churned up. One of the statistics that he gave was of new ration cards  three crore. It is only 66 lakh. Then he said my Jan-Dhan (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana), in the first 100 days, saw 21 crore accounts. The fact is 8.6 crore. He said we have given new LPG cylinders to crores of people, but actually its only 45 lakh. So if the Prime Minister of India, at India Gate, talks of statistics which are incorrect, then how do you trust our leaders?The Central Statistical Organisation is also giving out data which economists are now questioning. So you may tom-tom about yourself but the fact of the matter is what is on the ground, and we all see that.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The aam aadmi seems to be buying these statistics.If dal is Rs 200 (a kilogram), then how is he buying these statistics? His income has not increased. If vegetables are as expensive as they are now, and if one tonne of potato sells for one rupee, then what statistics are we talking about? And whats the feel-good factor on the ground? What worries me is that you may have a wonderful advertising campaign but the fact of the matter is that when the voter thinks about himself, hell ask the question to himself at the right time  Has my life improved?. For the last 17 months, exports have been on the decline; imports are on the decline. So whats on the up? Modi. Nothing else is on the up.MANEESH CHHIBBER: So how does the Congress party plan to expose the government?I think we must take this message to the people. I think the media also needs to investigate this at the same time. When he (PM Modi) gives a statistic for example he said in America that India is a $9 trillion economy, when were just about near 2 trillion. Now the press did not pick it up. So how do we deal with this? They repeat the same statistics. He goes to Kerala and compares us with Somalia. Of course he got some flak for that, but I think every time he makes a statement, for him its an election rally speech You dont act like the Prime Minister of India; you act as if youre an RSS pracharak. You spew venom and you give statistics thinking that its the next election. And then suddenly, one of them goes and has food at a Dalits house when hes not even a Dalit. You should remember Modis tweet on a previous occasion about this.COOMI KAPOOR: Why has the Congress not been able to capitalise on the failures of the Modi government? And the Congresss own position has come down in the last two years. It has lost its stronghold in Kerala, in Bengal, in AssamSince when did a government in Kerala win a second term? Thats the pattern. As far as Assam is concerned, were deeply disappointed about that, but how many chief ministers have got a fourth term in the history of this country? Hardly any. Our vote percentage in Assam is 31 per cent. I think where we might have gone wrong is with the alliances. In West Bengal, we have emerged actually as an alternative to the TMC, because in our alliance we have gained much more and were now leading the Opposition there. The DMK, I think, was a great disappointment because there the pattern also is the AIADMK and DMK. We could have won. I think again, if we had made some alliances, we might well have succeeded. But if you look at it overall, the BJP fought 696 (Assembly) seats (in all) and got 64, and we fought 335 and got 135.AMBREEN KHAN: Sonia Gandhi said the Prime Minister behaves like a Shahenshah. What does that imply?I think Arun Shourie put it very well in the course of his interview  narcissism, megalomania, trying to control the government, a statue at Madame Tussauds. They give you an indication of the persona of the Prime Minister. Giving out statistics without regard to the truth and basically concentrating everything in the PMO, not allowing his ministers the kind of freedom that was allowed during the UPA government these are personal traits of character wearing a name-printed striped suite and then auctioning it off. These are all very significant characteristics of a man who basically is in love with himself, which is not a bad thing, but in politics it may not sometimes succeed for a long period of time.LIZ MATHEW: Regional parties have been successful in keeping out the BJP to an extent. But why has the BJP managed to defeat the Congress so easily?If you go back to analyse the decline of the Congress party, I think we go back several years, to the compromises that we made with regional parties by sharing seats What happens in politics is that the moment you compromise for sharing of seats, then your entire cadre shifts from one party to the other, and thats the genesis of the decline of our regional presence.We did it in Uttar Pradesh, and see the consequences of it. We have not done it in Odisha but there the Congress has been a weak force for a long time. Luckily, we are now the alternative in West Bengal. I dont think we made a mistake because, had we gone with the TMC, we would have landed in a much worse position.SHALINI NAIR: The Prime Minister often raises the point that governance under the NDA, unlike the Congress regime, has been corruption-free.What are the charges of corruption against the Congress party during the UPA regime? It started in 2010-11 with the telecom issue. What was the corruption there? We did not sell the spectrum because the policy was not to sell. It may be right, it may be wrong, the Supreme Court ultimately said it was wrong, so you auction it. What is the result of that auction? That the very telecom sector which bought 5 Megahertz of spectrum at an administered price of Rs1,680 crore buys it for Rs 45,000 crore and that goes to the consolidated fund of India. Now, you will not call this a scam, because all this money has gone to the Government of India, which should have gone to the sector, so the result is that, by calling it a scam, and by reversing the policy, you have, in fact, destroyed the sector. The same with coal, nobody wants a coal mine anymore.RITIKA CHOPRA: In a recent interview, Smriti Irani said that during her predecessors regime, education had become a political akhada, states wouldnt see eye to eye, whereas she has achieved consensus.I dont want to react to what Smriti Irani says. I think the people of this country know how the education department is being run. Did we appoint RSS people or Congress-minded people as vice-chancellors of universities? Did we appoint people of a particular ideology as directors of IIT? Was there a controversy about the Prime Ministers degree? What about the corruption in Madhya Pradesh, the Vyapam scam? Is that not the BJP?AMITABH SINHA: As a former HRD minister, what is your opinion on Smriti Iranis tenure so far?Im not worried about individuals, Im worried about the change of textbooks, Im worried about the effacing of history, Im worried about a Vedic board being created. See, these are real worries. You tell Ramdev that you can have a private Vedic board in India so that our children get aligned to that ideology as they grow up. Im worried about that. Im not worried about Smriti Irani, Im worried about what she symbolises.LIZ MATHEW: After the rout in the recent state elections, some in the Congress have talked about surgery and changes in the party. What do you think is the way forward?Surgery of a political party will not change the future of India. We need to do a lot of things within the Congress party, but thats not enough. We are here for the nation, we are not here for the Congress. We are presenting an alternative, right? That may be an unacceptable alternative, to that extent we need to change, to provide a wholly acceptable alternative, and people who have voted against us, we must bring them back to our fold, to say that this is the only party that recognises the needs, the aspirations, and the pain of every Indian.SHEELA BHATT: Sonia Gandhi called the charges against Robert Vadra a conspiracy. But why make it political?Who says dont investigate? But you leak the email to the media, then you have the media play it up, that is what Mrs Gandhi is talking about. Your intentions are not to investigate in a fair manner, your intention is to besmirch the name, to have another way of saying you want to have a Congress-mukt Bharat. Who is stopping your investigation? Did we say dont investigate? Why dont they agree to an SIT under the Supreme Court? In all these allegations, have you found a single case where a Congress person has been convicted? This is all media stuff. You get something, you leak something, then you give a spin to it, then the Finance Minister writes a blog, then his people go up on television, then you create an atmosphere, and then you say he is corrupt. And when it comes to you, that piece of paper that names family members of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and the money trail, then thats irrelevant.COOMI KAPOOR: Some people see similarities between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. What is your opinion?Let Donald Trump fight the election then I will give you my opinion. But you have my opinion of Modi anyway.MANEESH CHHIBBER: Why is the Congress party always defending Robert Vadra and his alleged wrongdoings?The point is that he happens to be associated with a person who is part of the family of the Congress leadership. So when you make an allegation against him, in a sense you are making an allegation against the Congress party. If the Congress party does not respond, then you would say that the Congress party has accepted it. Fact of the matter is, if you make a false allegation, the person is entitled to say it is false.AFRAZ ALAM: This whole wave of admiration for Modis work has only increased in the last two years. Even if the people start rethinking about their decision to choose Modi, what is the alternative?You must know that there is an army out there, which is funded by a particular political party, which has enormous presence in the social media to serve a particular purpose. That army whenever I say something will attack me within two minutes, then they will praise Modi. It is a self-serving army which is part of the narcissism that I talked about. There is a lot of trolling against Modi today I bet that in the next two years, you will have an alternative. An alternative that will be far more compassionate, far more acceptable, far more inclusive and far less obsessed with himself or herself.ANANT GOENKA: Do you agree then there is a need for an internal organisational change in the Congress?There is no dispute that reform is needed. You ask us about the big idea, but Modi did not come with any big idea. It was lies, lies and damn lies. He was selling a dream and a person who looks forward to the next day for survival will buy a dream. So people of this country bought a dream.AMBREEN KHAN : So who will be able to sell the big dream in Uttar Pradesh?We should go back to the people of this country and say, We will not tell you lies, we will try and tell you what the reality is, believe us and give us a chance. All these guys have fooled you by telling lies, we will not do that. I think it is time for us to tell this to the people of our country.MANEESH CHHIBBER: We saw what happened in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. What is your partys take on it?I think we need an amendment in the defection law. We should have a new law which says two things: first, that you are free to defect, but if you defect, you will not get a public position for the next five years. Even if you succeed in an election, you will not get a public position or ministerial post in the next five years. If you defect in the middle of your term, you will not be entitled to stand for elections in the middle of that term. If you do that, then this buying of people, horse-trading and all these shenanigans will stop. We should take off our political hat and think of the future of India. You cannot have a future that is bright when you have a party in power at the Centre destroying constitutionally elected governments in this completely amoral fashion. The other grave concern I have is (regarding) the investigating agencies, whether it is the NIA, CBI or Enforcement Directorate. These have by and large become tools in the hands of the dispensation which is in power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The collapse of the Kolkata flyover, which killed 27 people, was described by its builders as an act of God, an expression that has a specific legal meaning.Twenty-three days after a section of Vivekananda Flyover in Girish Park area of north Kolkata caved in, killing 27 people, leaving 80 others injured and turning into a political hot potato for the ruling Trinamool Congress, the last of the debris was cleared on Saturday.The West Bengal government had been eager to clear the debris not just to clear a traffic bottleneck on a busy commercial street in a congested part of the city but also to remove from sight what was being used by the Opposition parties as an election issue.After the state chief secretary put in a request with the Railway Board chairman, the Indian Railways, on April 7, had accepted what looked like an engineering challenge. The PSU Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) was given the job, even though no railway arm had any experience in taking on an assignment like this before.The intended 2.2-km under-construction flyover, which collapsed after a 490-foot steel span fell during construction, thew up a unique challenge. Its girders were woefully close to decades-old buildings on both sides of the road. The structure, officials said, had to be cut into large pieces and moved without damaging the buildings and creating civilian distress.RVNL pressed into service several huge diamond cutters to cut the flyovers remains into pieces and deployed a 180-ton crane to move the material. Satish Agnihotri, CMD, RVNL, said: Since the buildings were so close to the flyover, we could not risk any structure falling on them while work was going on. So we joined the two flanks of the bridge by welding (them) so that it doesnt collapse on the road.After about 10 days of work, the accumulated debris several truckloads  were handed over to the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, which owns the bridge and had awarded the work contract to the Hyderabad-based firm IVRCL.Under fire, the Trinamool Congress had maintained that work contract of the flyover was awarded by the erstwhile Left Front government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
