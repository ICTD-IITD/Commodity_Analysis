His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

In October, it was 3.39%.Food prices went up 1.54% from a year earlier, following a 4.34 percent rise in the preceding month. Among food prices, potatoes recorded the highest rise (37%), followed by pulses (21.7%). In contrast, prices declined for onion (-51.5%) and vegetables (-24%).Cost of manufactured products increased by 3.2%, compared to a 2.7% rise in the previous month.The WPI inflation for September has also been revised upwards at 3.8% against the provisional estimate of 3.57%.Wholesale rates, measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), indicates the annual rate of price rise in bulk buys for traders reflecting the.Retail inflation, announced on Tuesday, too dropped to a two year low of 3.63% reflecting lower consumer demand.Industry body Assocham said that the fall in WPI numbers was in tandem with the expectations and was due to the depressive state in the Indian economy owing to the demonetisation announcement."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read |After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less. People are poor and earn very little, there is not even one ATM here, there is electricity for only a few hours in a day, and infrastructure is in shambles, said Aashiq Hussain, a government employee. And do you think we can do e-transactions when the mobile internet network is so weak in the village? he added.Consequently, the local grocer, chemist, tailor and gas cylinder seller are all using cash in their daily transactions.Khokh, PunjabNek Singh, who sells seeds and saplings  from potatoes to tomatoes, chillies and onions has not had a change of heart.Few weeks ago, the owner of the sprawling nursery had been critical of note-bandi. Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat. Business is picking up once again, though one manufacturer said sales were still down. As against the normal sale of 1,000 kg a month, I now sell 500 kg, he said.Though the papad maker has survived, two of his staff were not as lucky. They were laid off and are currently unemployed.Bastar, ChhattisgarhThough dirt poor, the tribals of the region dreaded the demonetisation effect. Everyone in the region expected a fresh wave of extortion by Maoists seeking to replenish their coffers depleted by the banning of high-value currency.The fear still persists though the extortion hasnt begun yet. They know very well there is no money with the common villagers just now because villagers are not getting enough cash from selling their paddy crop. Hence they are waiting for tendupatta (tendu leaves) season, pointed out Sunil Baghel.Read | Demonetisation could take away 400,000 jobs;e-com to be worst hitIn tendupatta season, the villagers will get cash from the contractors and then I believe they (Maoists) will ask for Rs 100 per villager.

The blockade of NH2 and NH37  the two lifelines of the state  by the United Naga Council (UNC) in protest against the creation of several new districts is still in place. The supplies brought in by the trucks are likely to ease the situation for a few days, but there is widespread fear that Manipur will slide back into hard times again.Read | Medical emergency in Manipur: 57-day blockade cripples health servicesScarcity of essentials has become a way of life, said a resident of Manipur, witnesses to protracted blockades enforced by different outfits even in the past.Manipur relies on other states for supply of most of its essential needs. But due to the blockade, no trucks had reached the state since December 12.I was stranded at Jiribam over seven days. There was nothing to do and we were uncertain what to do because of the blockade, said Tapas Nath, who brought a truckload of potatoes from West Bengal.Usually it takes just three days for him to cover the distance from Dhupguri in West Bengal to Manipurs capital. This time it took him 10 days. He hopes to return back safely soon, with police escort.The blockade by the UNC against the creation of new districts which it alleges benefits other communities at the cost of Nagas has seen residents scurrying for essentials such as petrol and vegetables. Prices of most items in short supply have skyrocketed.Petrol pumps across the capital have been closed for weeks. The scarcity has spawned a thriving backmarket. The going rate of one litre of petrol, which had reached nearly Rs 300 few days back, is Rs 140 these days.Taking advantage of the gap between the demand and supply of fuel, people have started selling petrol and diesel in black.We received our last supply of fuel several weeks ago. There was such a huge rush of customers that we ran out of petrol and diesel in a couple of hours, said Bikash Thapa of United Brothers filling station at Chinmeirong West.To fill the demand and supply gap ,theres jugaad. Women with plastic drinking water bottles filled with petrol and diesel can be seen doing brisk business on the streets.Most of the petrol available in black market is adulterated. One needs to have good contacts to get pure petrol or diesel, but the price could be a bit higher that the market rates, said Norendra Singh, a taxi driver.Some residents say due to the ongoing scarcity, petrol and diesel are also being smuggled in from Myanmar through the Moreh border, located 110 km away from Imphal.The petrol and diesel coming from Myanmar has a lighter tinge than the ones we usually get in petrol pumps here. We buy whatever we get as theres no choice, said L. Bikram, an auto-rickshaw owner.While petrol and diesel can be purchased at premium, the bigger problem many households are facing is due to the non-availability of LPG cylinders to run kitchens.One LPG cylinder can cost Rs 2000 and more on the black market. It has become difficult to manage day to day affairs at home because of the blockade, complained Sarojini Devi, a housewife at Chinmeirong East.Prices of vegetables like potatoes and onions and cereals and pulses have more than doubled since the blockade began, forcing many households to cut down on their expenses.Travelling both inside and outside the state have also turned into an ordeal. Passenger buses from Imphal to other important towns in Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland have stopped operating from November 29 due to the blockade.Nearly 20 buses carrying passengers to other states used to leave Imphal daily, prior to the blockade. Our business has been the worst hit, said Romeo Singh, an Imphal agent of Guwahati-based Network Travels.The situation is expected to ease for the next few days with the arrival of the trucks filled with goods. But with UNC not in a mood to lift the blockade soon, it seems like a temporary respite for residents."
5b2e22589855b7245313e7f9,How to Be a Good Bahu,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-be-a-good-bahu-meet-aparna-yadav-mulayam-s-younger-daughter-in-law/story-QcRZtgbPjdqFO3QcU6qTdJ.html,2016-11-27,,Hindustan Times,"Being a Yadav bahu can be a tall order. A daughter-in-law of Uttar Pradeshs first family of politics must drape her sari in the perfect manner. She must be disciplined, speak only when spoken to, and, of course, keep her political ambitions in check.But what if you are Aparna Yadav? People say I am very ambitious; some say over-ambitious. But would they say so if a man was entering politics? asks Aparna, the younger daughter-in-law of Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav.Aparna, who will be contesting elections from the Lucknow Cantonment seat, is making her maiden venture into politics in the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, slated to be held early next year.We are at the official residence of Mulayam Singh, in one of its spacious halls, tastefully decorated with ornate chandeliers, crystal-studded cushions in pastel green and porcelain showpieces. The hall leads into the house where Aparna, 26, lives with Prateek Yadav, 28, and their three-year-old daughter, Prathama. Mulayams elder son and UP chief minister, Akhilesh, his wife Dimple, and their children have recently moved into a house next door.Outside the heavily guarded Yadav residences, the city is abuzz with talk of the power struggle within the family  the recent conflict between the crown prince Akhilesh and his uncle, Shivpal Yadav. In this messy political matrix of the family, the younger daughter-in-law is being seen as crucial: those in the know insist that the roots of the crisis between the uncle and his nephew lie in the political aspirations and ambitions of Mulayams second wife, Sadhana Gupta, Aparnas mother-in-law.Read:Akhilesh and Shivpal will work together under my guidance: MulayamEver since Aparnas candidature was announced by Mulayams younger brother Shivpal Yadav earlier this year in March, mediapersons in the city have been busy speculating over how Sadhana has been wanting a share of the political pie for her son Prateek. Prateek, a fitness enthusiast, runs a high-end gym in the city, and in one of his few interviews, has categorically denied any interest in politics.But journalists and political junkies in the city have not tired of discussing the political aspirations of Aparna, as opposed to her more sober sister-in-law, Dimple .On the campaign trail with Aparna Yadav, Mulayams younger daughter-in-law. Aparna says hectic campaigning makes it hard for her to spend enough time with her three-year-old daughter. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT Photo)Inside the hall, however, Aparna, dressed elegantly, her hair tied in a casual bun, is careful with her words. She speaks favourably of Akhilesh bhaiyya, the development work that his government has done, and foregrounds the need for attending to civic issues both in the city, and in her constituency.Look at Lucknow now. We have cafs; soon we are going to have the Metro, just like Delhi. Lucknow has become a yo-type of city, she says.Destined for politicsSomewhere in the 2000s, Mrs Primrose Pepper, the tall, sharply-dressed teacher at Lucknows Loreto Convent, had a discussion with her students on the subject of reservation, an issue that had taken over the country in 1990. Back then, the government headed by V P Singh had accepted the Mandal Commission reports recommendation of giving 27 per cent reservations to OBCs, and set off widespread protests in colleges across the country.At the discussion, Aparna Bisht, then in class 11, had opposed the decision, arguing that caste-based reservations would only aggravate existing hierarchies, and quotas should instead be based on economic need. I have always been vocal about issues I feel strongly about, she says, recalling this as one of those moments that shaped her political consciousness.Aparna grew up in interesting times  she recalls observing the emergence of new political parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, and her own proximity to these political events owing to her journalist father. I would see all these dharnas, the foreign correspondents who would come to cover these events. I would often ask my father why all this was happening, she says.His answers about the social and political upheaval in UP, it seems, had some impact on her. For her Bachelors degree, Aparna chose to study Political Science, Modern History and English, and pursued International Relations for her Masters at the University of Manchester. England had fascinated me since childhood. And at that time, I really wanted to become a diplomat, travel the world, she says.Read:Yadav family feud: Aman Mani Tripathis arrest a victory for CM Akhilesh YadavBut destiny had other plans. The boy Aparna had been friends with for a few years was the then CMs son [Mulayams son Prateek]. Aparna says she knew she wanted to be with him for life. It was him or no one else, she says. Predictably then, marriage happened. You can tell that life as a young bride would not have been easy  in a candid moment, Aparna says that as a 21-year-old who wore boots and jeans, she couldnt even tie a sari, or cook aloo-mattha (a dish made of potatoes and buttermilk).In time, however, Aparna mastered both, and also carved her own niche in the family. I dont think they had had anyone like me in the family before. But with my feminine energy, I think I have won peoples hearts. The family has opened up to me, she says.Outside of the family too, Aparna worked to brand herself as a champion for womens rights. She is the brand ambassador of a city-based NGOs campaign for womens rights, and has been active in public speaking on related issues. So even as the family patriarch, Mulayam Singh, made headlines with his sexist statements  last year, he said that it was not possible for four men to rape a girl; in 2014, he said boys will be boys..they make mistakes  Aparna has been vocal about her cause. The discourse on violence against women has changed since 2012. Women need to stop thinking that its their fault. We need to question the boys and not the girls, says Aparna. They shouldnt have let the juvenile [one of the accused in the December 16 Delhi gangrape case] go. I support capital punishment in such cases, she says, getting visibly agitated.Learning the ropesAll this while though, Aparna says she was never averse to politics. Politics and social work are two different sides of the same coin; its only Chanakya and Machiavelli who have spoilt it, she insists, adding that this was the right time to enter politics.Those in the know insist that the time was right because Aparna had often broken ranks  the selfie with PM Narendra Modi in 2015; her tweets against cow slaughter and beef-eating; being the only member from the family to attend a function where the PM was speaking earlier this year, and opposing Aamir Khan for his comments about intolerance (after Mulayam supported the actor).The proclivity towards the BJP and the PM, many say, was her way to arm-twist the family into giving her a ticket.Aparnas outspoken behaviour has pitched her in opposition to the elder daughter-in-law Dimple, popular among party workers and often described as graceful, dignified and disciplined.Aparna Yadav says she has always been vocal about issues that she feels strongly about. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT Photo)But Aparna is unfazed by her detractors. I have my own voice, my own opinion, and that will always remain so. But I can also convince people with my feminine energy.You dont have to be like Mayawati to survive in UP politics, she says.Now is a busy time for Aparna  hectic campaigning for the elections is already on. We are on way to a function to inaugurate a road in her constituency.For the event, Aparna has changed into a pale green sari  I can now tie one in like five minutes  and is quite at ease with the somewhat frenzied crowd of young supporters mouthing syrupy statements and slogans about Aparna didi.Read:Yadav family puts up united front at Agra-Lucknow Expressway inaugurationIn her speech, she focusses on the areas civic issues, and also manages to take a dig at her opponent. Darr ke bhaag gayi (she got scared by me and ran away), she says about Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the sitting MLA, and a member of the Congress party who recently switched to the BJP.The war of words has been on for some time  Aparna says Joshi said some disrespectful things about her, and so, she had to respond too  so Rita aunty became thuka hua kartoos (used bullet).

Shah asked and put the Congress leaders remarks in the same league as maut ka saudagar, an old comment from the party referring to Modi.The army raids were being touted as revenge for Uri and could become a talking point for next years assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.Posters hailing Modi for the raids have surfaced in UP, prompting the Congress and BSP chief Mayawati to allege that the BJP was trying to gain political mileage out of the military action.I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocally, but I will not support using the Indian army in political posters and propaganda all across the country, Gandhi tweeted,standing by his dalali remarks.The political slugfest came on a day home minister Rajnath Singh announced sealing the entire the India-Pakistan border, while the finance minister said in Washington that every major terrorist incident in the world has a Pakistani footprint.The blame game over the surgical strikes broke out on Tuesday when Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam called the military action fake and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the government to release proof to counter Pakistani propaganda against the operation.Mayawati, a political rival to both Congress and BJP, condemned the attempt to profit from the armys cross-border action ahead of the UP polls.Only the army should be felicitated and hailed for it not any leader, the defence minister or the Prime Minister, she said.Congress leaderKapil Sibal called for a stop to this poster-baazi and politics on the armys successes.BJP chief Shah attributed these posters to decisions taken by local leaders, but credited the Prime Minister for his leadership. He insisted that his party wont desist from using the issue during the elections to boost the morale of the armed forces.He lashed out at the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for seeking proof.Who is being questioned  the soldiers who risked their lives? What did Kejriwal want when he asked for proof? And after his statements, Kejriwal began trending (on social media) in Pakistan. From this, it is clear his words have helped whom, he said.Shah tried to corner the Congress, with scams such as Bofors guns deal and 2G spectrum auction when the party was in power.The use of the word dalali for soldiers shows the Congresss mindset. The word is synonymous with the opposition party whose leaders were embroiled in several scams worth thousands of crores, he said.Shah said Gandhi should concentrate on the potato factory for farmers as his understanding of the problems of agriculture sector is limited to that only. He was referring to Gandhis remarks made at a public meeting during his Delhi to Deoria march in UP.Congress leader Sibal hit back, accusing the BJP of giving birth to Jaish-e-Mohammed as it was during the previous NDA government that the militant outfits chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, was released from jail in a hostage exchange.But the BJP was not alone in criticising Gandhis remarks. The AAP too latched on to the issue.Such words (dalali) should not have been used by Rahul Gandhi. These are the times for us unite & stand along army,Kejriwal tweeted."

Others, taking a rather unkind view, said being a regular marijuana user he should not have stopped, which he has for the duration of the campaign.Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, is a two-time presidential candidate, he ran in 2012 as well. Though he never stood much of a chance of winning as a member of a party that has never secured more than 1% of the vote in presidential elections, many Republicans were willing to consider him as an alternative to their own partys nominee, Donald Trump.I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and (his running mate) Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall, Mitt Romney, the Republican party nominee of 2012 and a leading member of the NeverTrump movement, said on twitter on Wednesday.WATCH: Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson asks Mike Barnicle, ""What is Aleppo?"" https://t.co/BcG5hufHYf  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 8, 2016There is a very strong libertarian strain running through the Republican party, with former presidential candidates Ron Paul and Rand Paul, father and son, at the head of it. And as a former Republican himself, Johnson was a viable alternative to Trump.He has been polling at around 10%  he needs 15% to qualify to be on the presidential debate stage  and was looking to boost his numbers, but can he recover from this?The flub, which is trending on social media as just Whats Aleppo, may be headed for the pantheon of greatest campaign stumbles that include Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Dan Quayle spelling potato wrong in an interaction with schoolchildren in 1992; he put an e at the end. But that didnt stop the Bush-Quayle ticket from winning.George W Bush survived an even bigger share when running for president in 1999 wen he failed to name the heads of government of three of the four hot spots around the world India, Pakistan and Chechnya. He named the Taiwanese.This was just a year after India and Pakistan had conducted a series of nuclear tests that had led to as many headlines in the US as Aleppo, if not more."

More than four in five diabetics on medication in India do not have their blood glucose under control .The new study, of more than 1,100 patients across 10 centres  nine in India and one in Karachi, Pakistan  over five years and published in Annals of Internal Medicine, is the first global trial of diabetes management in low- and middle-income countries, home to 75% of the worlds 415 million diabetics.The study found that non-physician coordinators with technology that welded electronic health records with decision-support software sizeably improved blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol profiles of patients and lowered risk of complications such as heart disease, eye disease (retinopathy), kidney failure and amputations.What makes this model workable is the low dependence on physicians, who are often few and far between, especially in rural areas. Any graduate or social worker with six or more months of experience in healthcare, social work or allied sciences and basic computing and good communication skills meets the requirement for a care coordinator, who then gets trained for 2.5 days to get acquainted with key principles of diabetes management, said Dr Nikhil Tandon, head of endocrinology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which partnered with the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Emory University, Atlanta, US, to do this real life study of patients getting treated for diabetes in public and private clinics and hospitals.No new or expensive drugs were added as the intervention is based on improved data-management and human intervention. It enhances the patients skills of managing their disease on their own by providing individualised support and making the physician more responsive by making better data available, says Dr D. Prabhakaran, vice president, research and policy, PHFI.The outcomes were similar across public and private hospitals and the model has been replicated using the public-health resources. Auxillary nurse midwives at community health centres in Solan in Himachal Pradesh have used the intervention with excellent results, which shows it is translatable on a larger scale and at different levels of health care, says Dr Tandon.The decision-support software is free for public health facilities and will have a nominal charge for private clinics and users, says Dr Prabhakaran.Sugar-coated Trouble415 million people with diabetes worldwide75% adults with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countriesClose to one in two (46%) people with diabetes are undiagnosedDiabetes kills 5 million annually, one death every six secondsMore than 542,000 children with type 1 diabetesOne in seven births -- More 20.9 million worldwide -- affected by diabetes during pregnancyHealth expenditure of US$ 673 billion dollars in 2015India stats70 million in IndiaOne in 12 adults have diabetes80% patients with poorly controlled blood glucose (an HbA1c > 7%)30-50% diabetics with uncontrolled blood pressure and cholesterolSource: International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas, 2015Lowering riskStay active.

Prices of every day ingredients such as onions and potatoes have risen by about 75% and 50%, forcing many residents to keep them out of the daily diet.Customers in a number of city localities, including South City, DLF, Sushant Lok and Malibu Towne, paid between Rs 75 to Rs 90 for a kilogram of tomatoes on Tuesday. The cost of tomatoes had earlier risen from Rs 30 to Rs 60 around the second week of June.Residents said that tomatoes are essential in any kitchen and the ever increasing prices have forced them to avoid using the fruit in any dish. Chirag Sahani of Sector 31 said, No more tomatoes in salads. The fruit is too expensive that I first thought my vegetable seller was joking about the rates.The prices of onions, potatoes and brinjals have also increased by Rs 20 per kilogram on an average. The prices are likely to rise further in the next couple of days because of a delay in supplies and as the local production has been exhausted.Even the wholesale prices are extremely high. We are trying to reduce our profit window so that the people do not have to pay excessively high amounts for vegetables. The customers are complaining daily but there is not much we can do about it, Jitender Kumar, a retail seller in Sector 40, said.Officials of Gurgaon agricultural marketing committee said that the rise in prices is only seasonal.As the monsoon arrives, prices of vegetables start rising. The local supplies, which come from different parts of the state, including Mewat, Farrukhnagar and other areas, are over. We are depending on supplies from Himachal Pradesh, but because of the rain and road blockades, the trucks are not able to reach here on time, Deen Mohammad, state agriculture officer (Haryana), said."

It was above board and cleared purely on merit, said Singh, who served as defence secretary during 2007-09 and was one of the key decision-makers who authorised the chopper trials to be held in the UK.Defence minister Manohar Parrikar has panned the erstwhile UPA government for allowing chopper trials to be held abroad.Singh said there was nothing extraordinary about trials being conducted abroad and in the case of VVIP choppers, the decision was taken on the basis of specific recommendations from the IAF. He said then defence minister AK Antony noted that it would be a deviation from procedure after which the matter was put up before the defence procurement board (DPB) for approval.The DPB, headed by the defence secretary, also consists of secretary (defence production) and vice-chiefs of the three services.Bringing the choppers to India would have added to the delay and involved additional costs. Then IAF chief Fali Major, who was a distinguished chopper pilot himself, said trials could be held abroad. We gave weightage to his words, said Singh. Antony later endorsed the decision. Singh said trials were held abroad for Embraer and P-8I planes, too.Read: AgustaWestland deal: Top 5 points made by govt and CongressThe NDA government has cast doubts on the capabilities of the chopper. Singh said, It wasnt a machine out of nowhere. It was a proven platform and more suited to our requirements than its US rival Sikorsky.India signed a contract for 12 AW-101 VVIP helicopters in February 2010. The UPA government terminated it in January 2014 following allegations that middlemen were paid more than Rs 375 crore to secure the deal.The deal came back in focus in early April after an Italian court reversed the verdict of a lower court that held corruption could not be proved. But the higher court in Milan found two top Italian executives guilty of corruption.Meanwhile, an alleged middleman told a news channel that he did describe Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in 2008 as the driving force behind the decision to import the choppers. But Christian Michel James clarified that his suggestion that Gandhi and her son be lobbied by diplomats did not mean bribes were paid to them.Read: Tables turn on BJP in AgustaWestland scam: What went wrong in RS"

Today, its being sold at Rs 3 every kg. The government should immediately buy them from the farmers, who do not have storage facility, Saraswati said.Agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said the government had set up a price stabilisation fund for potato, onion and pulses but it has been shifted from his ministry to the food ministry. He replied in detail about the e-NAM, the electronic trading platform for agriculture market.You have given an elaborate reply. But the problem remains as it is. Dal prices are not going down and that of onion are not going up, Kairana MP Hukum Singh said during the question hour.Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to intervene by saying the question relates to e-trading, but the MP was unfazed. What will we do of e-trading? Today, farmers are selling onion for Rs 2 per kg. There should be solution to the problem and it will be solved only when the government enters the market, buy onion and save farmers. Singh evaded the question, saying it did not fall under his ministry.Earlier, replying to a separate question, home minister Rajnath Singh found himself in a difficult spot when party MP RK Singh disputed one of his claims.Following a remark of Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge that the Centre has discontinued a housing scheme under which 75% funds were provided by the Centre while states used to provide 25%, the home minister said police modernisation funds are not given to states only for construction of houses for policemen.I want to tell the House that it is not correct to say many state governments run housing schemes through the funds given by the Centre. Police modernisation fund is not given only for housing. It is possible that some state governments use the funds for housing. But police modernisation funds are not given for housing, he said. RK Singh, however, said there was a housing component under the police modernisation funds given to states, which was perhaps stopped now.Related storiesIs Air India safe to fly, asks Opposition; govt defends safety recordDefense spending nose-dived, woefully insufficient: Parl panelPolice suicide, army shortage, doping: What was discussed in both Houses today"

Divisional commissioner Ravindra Pastore said all the collectors of the adjoining districts had asked the farmers to grow more vegetables. The farmers were even provided with seeds to this effect months ahead of the festival. He assured that the vegetable supplies would be arranged from the adjoining districts at the administration and the wholesalers end. Superintendent of police MS Verma said special care would be taken to ensure safe movement of vehicles carrying food stuff and milk to the city in the nights.However, peoples fear is not baseless as over five crore people are expected to visit the city with five lakh population during the festival time. This is going to put pressure on food availability, sources said.Pushkaran Dubey, an old city resident who usually buys one kg of potato and onion, bought 50 kgs of each on Friday as he fears short supply during the Simhastha.Even if other leafy vegetables are not available, I could at least have aalu ki sabzi for my family and guests who are expected to come for the fair, he told HT.Not only Dubey, many citizens could be seen buying veggies with long shelf value from the market.One Usha Chhajlani, a resident of Mahashewta Nagar, said that she had stocked a sack each of tuwar dal, rice and besan along with 15 kg tins of edible oil and other groceries. She said procuring the usual food stuff could be a problem during the Simhastha in the face of high demand. My house is going to be flooded with relatives from different cities so preparations to serve them have to be made early, she said.Arun Agrawal, owner of a leading cereal shop, said the police allowed unloading only during the night during the fair. Arranging workers would then be a problem, which might also timely supply of food items."

Now 50, Kavita is a successful businesswoman  she runs clothing boutiques in the city, lives in a penthouse on Manik Bagh road, and has sent her daughter to the US for a medical course.It was 1981, and our financial condition was not good. My father used to sell potatoes and onions on a handcart. I still remember how my classmates pooled 25 paise each and paid the school fee on my behalf, she told HT. Kavita started giving tuitions to children after that episode, and continued it through the college until she landed a job. Life was a struggle. I gave tuitions during the day and studied at night. On most days, I had to study in candlelight as our landlord used to cut the electricity supply at 12 midnight, she recounts.After my fathers death, I was the sole bread earner of the family. I had to also ensure that my younger sisters and brother got decent education, she says.After completing her BSc from Holkar Science College, Indore, in 1984, she worked odd jobs for a few years before becoming a professionally qualified desktop publishing (DTP) operator. I was the first woman DTP operator in Indore as it was a new occupation then.Kavita started her boutiques after working for many years as a DTP professional, and established herself as a businesswoman. She also ensured that all her siblings were settled before she got married.I got my younger sister married before launching my own DTP business in 1994. My business of printing cards and other articles took off, and I bought a flat for my family, she says.In 1996, Kavita decided to tie the knot. I made it clear to my husband (who is also a businessman) that I will continue to support my family even after the marriage, she says.Kavita once used to share a one-room rented house with her parents and three siblings; today she is a millionaire and lives in a penthouse.

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"

It would be passed. Earlier this month, the law had found support from Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi.The cabinet amended an earlier clause to make it mandatory for developers to deposit 70% of the money collected from buyer in a separate escrow account to meet the construction cost of a particular project. Earlier, the ceiling was at 50%. This would check developers from diverting funds to other projects and ensure speedy completion of project for which money has been collected, said a housing ministry official.The bill, covering both residential and commercial real estate, proposes to set up a real estate regulatory authority (RERA) where developers will have to compulsorily register and disclose project details before launching it. Violation will lead to penalty of up to 10% of the project cost or three years imprisonment.Read | Congress writes to PM, Naidu: seek early passage of real estate billIn another pro- consumer move, the cabinet decided that rate of interest payable by the promoter or the allottee in case of default and delays will be the same. Also a developers liability to repair structural defects in the sold property has been increased to five years from the earlier two years. . Promoters have also been barred from changing plans and design without consent of consumers.However, succumbing to the builders lobby that has been protesting against some provisions, the cabinet in a first has introduced a new penal provision for allottees for failure to comply with orders of RERA. Allottees would have to cough up to 5% of the apartment cost or a year in jail or both for defaulting on payment or any other violation on their part.Read | Rahul Gandhi assures support for real estate bill to homebuyersThe bill had become a political hot potato after Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi attacked the Centre during the monsoon session last year and charged it with diluting various provisions that harmed the interest of middle-class homebuyers.Read | Homebuyers tag PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi in videos to pass real estate bill"

She was speaking metaphorically. As you know very well, much of politics is about cooking up things, explained a veteran, and theres no need to grill the poor girl about it. How else will we promise pie in the sky unless we learn how to cook up a storm? queried a politician-cum-chef. We have to get enormous amounts of black money past the Election Commissions scrutiny to fund our campaigns, explained a good egg, and we have to cook the books well in order to do that. Otherwise well get chicken feed.Our party is known for its half-baked ideas, pointed out a baker-cum-politician proudly, adding they sold like hot cakes. It takes long years of cooking to know how to have a finger in every pie, said a big cheese who was an expert in pork barrel politics.Read: Bihar board Inter toppers at venue for acid testEvery politician should know how to stir the pot of communal and caste passions, its meat and drink to us, said a pot-stirrer. A writer of potboilers said that was a fine kettle of fish. If you cant stand the heat, you should get out of the kitchen, said a member of the kitchen cabinet. We politicos are in the business of adding a bit of masala here, a little tadka there. We need to learn how to soup up things. Plain vanilla is boring, he said. He said the best fish was to be got from troubled waters.But some disagree. I have a beef with what the topper said. Cooking is part and parcel of politics, but she shouldnt have spilled the beans, said the veteran. And now they have turned up the heat and she is toast, he added. Another guy said no, the girl was a hot potato and she should be dropped like one. Besides, too many cooks spoil the broth, he added. A thoughtful chap said while the whole thing was food for thought, her goose was now cooked and she was now dead meat. He then warned the veteran that he could be lynched for possessing beef.Read: Bihar board results send alarm bells ringingA communist said that while Mao had said a revolution is not a dinner party, he hadnt mentioned whether it was lunch and lunch involved cooking. An egghead said one couldnt make omelettes without breaking eggs. A big fish said the girl should now make humble pie and eat it. A small fry said all politicians needed to learn the art of buttering up and currying favour and know which side their bread was buttered. He added they must also know how to sugarcoat things for their bosses, while making mincemeat of the opposition, rubbing salt in their wounds and ensuring they have egg on their faces.A politician who was no spring chicken summed up the sentiment by saying the girl certainly knows her onions but she must learn how to save ones bacon and to have her cake and eat it too. That would bring home the bacon and be the icing on the cake, he said, before pushing off, saying he had other fish to fry.Manas Chakravarty is Consulting Editor, MintThe views expressed are personal"
