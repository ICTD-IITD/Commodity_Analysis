His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read |After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less. People are poor and earn very little, there is not even one ATM here, there is electricity for only a few hours in a day, and infrastructure is in shambles, said Aashiq Hussain, a government employee. And do you think we can do e-transactions when the mobile internet network is so weak in the village? he added.Consequently, the local grocer, chemist, tailor and gas cylinder seller are all using cash in their daily transactions.Khokh, PunjabNek Singh, who sells seeds and saplings  from potatoes to tomatoes, chillies and onions has not had a change of heart.Few weeks ago, the owner of the sprawling nursery had been critical of note-bandi. Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat. Business is picking up once again, though one manufacturer said sales were still down. As against the normal sale of 1,000 kg a month, I now sell 500 kg, he said.Though the papad maker has survived, two of his staff were not as lucky. They were laid off and are currently unemployed.Bastar, ChhattisgarhThough dirt poor, the tribals of the region dreaded the demonetisation effect. Everyone in the region expected a fresh wave of extortion by Maoists seeking to replenish their coffers depleted by the banning of high-value currency.The fear still persists though the extortion hasnt begun yet. They know very well there is no money with the common villagers just now because villagers are not getting enough cash from selling their paddy crop.

Shah asked and put the Congress leaders remarks in the same league as maut ka saudagar, an old comment from the party referring to Modi.The army raids were being touted as revenge for Uri and could become a talking point for next years assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.Posters hailing Modi for the raids have surfaced in UP, prompting the Congress and BSP chief Mayawati to allege that the BJP was trying to gain political mileage out of the military action.I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocally, but I will not support using the Indian army in political posters and propaganda all across the country, Gandhi tweeted,standing by his dalali remarks.The political slugfest came on a day home minister Rajnath Singh announced sealing the entire the India-Pakistan border, while the finance minister said in Washington that every major terrorist incident in the world has a Pakistani footprint.The blame game over the surgical strikes broke out on Tuesday when Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam called the military action fake and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the government to release proof to counter Pakistani propaganda against the operation.Mayawati, a political rival to both Congress and BJP, condemned the attempt to profit from the armys cross-border action ahead of the UP polls.Only the army should be felicitated and hailed for it not any leader, the defence minister or the Prime Minister, she said.Congress leaderKapil Sibal called for a stop to this poster-baazi and politics on the armys successes.BJP chief Shah attributed these posters to decisions taken by local leaders, but credited the Prime Minister for his leadership. He insisted that his party wont desist from using the issue during the elections to boost the morale of the armed forces.He lashed out at the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for seeking proof.Who is being questioned  the soldiers who risked their lives? What did Kejriwal want when he asked for proof? And after his statements, Kejriwal began trending (on social media) in Pakistan. From this, it is clear his words have helped whom, he said.Shah tried to corner the Congress, with scams such as Bofors guns deal and 2G spectrum auction when the party was in power.The use of the word dalali for soldiers shows the Congresss mindset. The word is synonymous with the opposition party whose leaders were embroiled in several scams worth thousands of crores, he said.Shah said Gandhi should concentrate on the potato factory for farmers as his understanding of the problems of agriculture sector is limited to that only. He was referring to Gandhis remarks made at a public meeting during his Delhi to Deoria march in UP.Congress leader Sibal hit back, accusing the BJP of giving birth to Jaish-e-Mohammed as it was during the previous NDA government that the militant outfits chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, was released from jail in a hostage exchange.But the BJP was not alone in criticising Gandhis remarks. The AAP too latched on to the issue.Such words (dalali) should not have been used by Rahul Gandhi. These are the times for us unite & stand along army,Kejriwal tweeted."

Others, taking a rather unkind view, said being a regular marijuana user he should not have stopped, which he has for the duration of the campaign.Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, is a two-time presidential candidate, he ran in 2012 as well. Though he never stood much of a chance of winning as a member of a party that has never secured more than 1% of the vote in presidential elections, many Republicans were willing to consider him as an alternative to their own partys nominee, Donald Trump.I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and (his running mate) Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall, Mitt Romney, the Republican party nominee of 2012 and a leading member of the NeverTrump movement, said on twitter on Wednesday.WATCH: Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson asks Mike Barnicle, ""What is Aleppo?"" https://t.co/BcG5hufHYf  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 8, 2016There is a very strong libertarian strain running through the Republican party, with former presidential candidates Ron Paul and Rand Paul, father and son, at the head of it. And as a former Republican himself, Johnson was a viable alternative to Trump.He has been polling at around 10%  he needs 15% to qualify to be on the presidential debate stage  and was looking to boost his numbers, but can he recover from this?The flub, which is trending on social media as just Whats Aleppo, may be headed for the pantheon of greatest campaign stumbles that include Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Dan Quayle spelling potato wrong in an interaction with schoolchildren in 1992; he put an e at the end. But that didnt stop the Bush-Quayle ticket from winning.George W Bush survived an even bigger share when running for president in 1999 wen he failed to name the heads of government of three of the four hot spots around the world India, Pakistan and Chechnya. He named the Taiwanese.This was just a year after India and Pakistan had conducted a series of nuclear tests that had led to as many headlines in the US as Aleppo, if not more."

Divisional commissioner Ravindra Pastore said all the collectors of the adjoining districts had asked the farmers to grow more vegetables. The farmers were even provided with seeds to this effect months ahead of the festival. He assured that the vegetable supplies would be arranged from the adjoining districts at the administration and the wholesalers end. Superintendent of police MS Verma said special care would be taken to ensure safe movement of vehicles carrying food stuff and milk to the city in the nights.However, peoples fear is not baseless as over five crore people are expected to visit the city with five lakh population during the festival time. This is going to put pressure on food availability, sources said.Pushkaran Dubey, an old city resident who usually buys one kg of potato and onion, bought 50 kgs of each on Friday as he fears short supply during the Simhastha.Even if other leafy vegetables are not available, I could at least have aalu ki sabzi for my family and guests who are expected to come for the fair, he told HT.Not only Dubey, many citizens could be seen buying veggies with long shelf value from the market.One Usha Chhajlani, a resident of Mahashewta Nagar, said that she had stocked a sack each of tuwar dal, rice and besan along with 15 kg tins of edible oil and other groceries. She said procuring the usual food stuff could be a problem during the Simhastha in the face of high demand. My house is going to be flooded with relatives from different cities so preparations to serve them have to be made early, she said.Arun Agrawal, owner of a leading cereal shop, said the police allowed unloading only during the night during the fair.

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"
