The bill is touted as a key reform measure in the vast real estate sector.The Bill, slated for passage in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, aims to protect property buyers interest from unscrupulous realtors and regulate the real estate sector. The bills passage in Lok Sabha would be a cake walk for the government as it enjoys majority in the Lower House.Realty stocks rose up to 7% on Wednesday in anticipation of the passage of the Real Estate Bill.Read | Homebuyers meet Naidu to press for passing real estate billAlthough the Congress was the original architect of the bill, it could not be passed as it found no support from the BJP and some other parties during the UPA era.On Wednesday, a senior Congress leader told HT, We will support it. It would be passed. Earlier this month, the law had found support from Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi.The cabinet amended an earlier clause to make it mandatory for developers to deposit 70% of the money collected from buyer in a separate escrow account to meet the construction cost of a particular project. Earlier, the ceiling was at 50%. This would check developers from diverting funds to other projects and ensure speedy completion of project for which money has been collected, said a housing ministry official.The bill, covering both residential and commercial real estate, proposes to set up a real estate regulatory authority (RERA) where developers will have to compulsorily register and disclose project details before launching it. Violation will lead to penalty of up to 10% of the project cost or three years imprisonment.Read | Congress writes to PM, Naidu: seek early passage of real estate billIn another pro- consumer move, the cabinet decided that rate of interest payable by the promoter or the allottee in case of default and delays will be the same. Also a developers liability to repair structural defects in the sold property has been increased to five years from the earlier two years. . Promoters have also been barred from changing plans and design without consent of consumers.However, succumbing to the builders lobby that has been protesting against some provisions, the cabinet in a first has introduced a new penal provision for allottees for failure to comply with orders of RERA. Allottees would have to cough up to 5% of the apartment cost or a year in jail or both for defaulting on payment or any other violation on their part.Read | Rahul Gandhi assures support for real estate bill to homebuyersThe bill had become a political hot potato after Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi attacked the Centre during the monsoon session last year and charged it with diluting various provisions that harmed the interest of middle-class homebuyers.Read | Homebuyers tag PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi in videos to pass real estate bill"

She was speaking metaphorically. As you know very well, much of politics is about cooking up things, explained a veteran, and theres no need to grill the poor girl about it. How else will we promise pie in the sky unless we learn how to cook up a storm? queried a politician-cum-chef. We have to get enormous amounts of black money past the Election Commissions scrutiny to fund our campaigns, explained a good egg, and we have to cook the books well in order to do that. Otherwise well get chicken feed.Our party is known for its half-baked ideas, pointed out a baker-cum-politician proudly, adding they sold like hot cakes. It takes long years of cooking to know how to have a finger in every pie, said a big cheese who was an expert in pork barrel politics.Read: Bihar board Inter toppers at venue for acid testEvery politician should know how to stir the pot of communal and caste passions, its meat and drink to us, said a pot-stirrer. A writer of potboilers said that was a fine kettle of fish. If you cant stand the heat, you should get out of the kitchen, said a member of the kitchen cabinet. We politicos are in the business of adding a bit of masala here, a little tadka there. We need to learn how to soup up things. Plain vanilla is boring, he said. He said the best fish was to be got from troubled waters.But some disagree. I have a beef with what the topper said. Cooking is part and parcel of politics, but she shouldnt have spilled the beans, said the veteran. And now they have turned up the heat and she is toast, he added. Another guy said no, the girl was a hot potato and she should be dropped like one. Besides, too many cooks spoil the broth, he added. A thoughtful chap said while the whole thing was food for thought, her goose was now cooked and she was now dead meat. He then warned the veteran that he could be lynched for possessing beef.Read: Bihar board results send alarm bells ringingA communist said that while Mao had said a revolution is not a dinner party, he hadnt mentioned whether it was lunch and lunch involved cooking. An egghead said one couldnt make omelettes without breaking eggs. A big fish said the girl should now make humble pie and eat it. A small fry said all politicians needed to learn the art of buttering up and currying favour and know which side their bread was buttered. He added they must also know how to sugarcoat things for their bosses, while making mincemeat of the opposition, rubbing salt in their wounds and ensuring they have egg on their faces.A politician who was no spring chicken summed up the sentiment by saying the girl certainly knows her onions but she must learn how to save ones bacon and to have her cake and eat it too. That would bring home the bacon and be the icing on the cake, he said, before pushing off, saying he had other fish to fry.Manas Chakravarty is Consulting Editor, MintThe views expressed are personal"
