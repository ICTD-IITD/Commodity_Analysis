From the vast open fields of the Sunderbans to the Rann of Kutch, from the chilly upper reaches of the Himalayas to the dunes of Rajasthan, from the ultra-busy executive in Nariman Point to the wheeler dealer in Lutyens Delhi, the common man turned into a picture of patience and forbearance.Life came to a standstill and people on the move turned into a frozen silhouette against a tall steel-and-glass building, or dirty bylanes of a metropolitan city, near a crowded market in the suburbs or under the boughs in idyllic surroundings described by Davies.The Welsh poet was familiar with cows and sheep of the highlands, but was not fortunate enough to witness the common Indian at the end of 2016, who stood patiently in a queue ignoring responsibilities at home and office. Doctors left their patients behind, housewives their kitchens, teachers his students, pensioners their favourite television serials, actors his greenroom and sportsmen his games  all to queue up in front of banks and ATMs. Farmers cared little for his fields, workers left his tools in the factory sheds, fishermen abandoned his net and the butcher dropped his knife to queue up. Mothers left newborns at home and fathers their occupation.Pharmacists reported increased sales of balms for sore feet, stiff legs and low back pain. But the patience never wore thin.Many scurried out of their homes even before the first rooster woke up and stood in queues that seldom melted away before midnight. Pensioners doubled up in pain, chirpy college goers constantly glanced at their watches but they didnt walk out of the queue.More than 100 men and women departed for their heavenly abode while waiting in these queues, countless fell ill. In a queue in Hooghly district of Bengal a fifty something man, suffered a cardiac arrest and slumped to the ground. But none from the dozens waiting with him abandoned his position in the queue to assist him. He died, his death scripting an immortal ode to a nation with infinite patience.Life blossomed too. In Kanpur, a woman delivered a baby while waiting in a queue.At a few places like UPs Fatehpur, police wielded lathis on those standing. But the lines didnt vanish.It was more special because a large part of the nation, particularly the younger citizens, was a stranger to long queues. They only heard of people eager to buy food and kerosene stood standing in serpentine lines in the fifties, sixties and seventies. They also read about unending queues in the Eastern bloc (for almost everything from potato to clothes) in books and newspapers.From the pages of history, queues rushed back to emerge as a national vocation in every corner of this land spread over 3.287 million sq kms.Queues, or lines, have a variety of meanings. In geometry lines are defined by its length compared to a negligible breath. Right from the morning of November 9, real life began to approximate what we learnt in mathematics classes  with the queues continuously adding feet, their breath quickly became negligible compared to the length.Standing, or locus standi in Latin, has a wide meaning in law too. It defines a persons role or justification in any incident. Every one standing was given a locus standi  he/she was helping in cleansing the economy. The queue became the weapon of mass cleansing  another version of Swachh Bharat.As 2016 drew to a close, the common man of India stood the test of time and of patience, and as the ruling party would like us to believe, of patriotism.Irrespective of the driving motive, in 2016 the common man began to appreciate the appeal to stand and stare. Rarely does such a big and busy nation stand up in unison to respond to a poetic call."

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."

When they returned, Sonu was weak and admitted to a hospital.Wadwis son survived and made a full recovery but about 400 other children died from malnutrition-linked illnesses in Palghar between April and November 2016 -- a rising trend that campaigners put down to an annual pattern of migration for work.In the last three years, malnutrition has claimed the lives of about 1,600 children in Palghar, a tribal region battling high unemployment and poverty, with national headlines over child deaths prompting government action to address the problem.Read: Maharashtra tribals dont eat wheat, barter it for salt, oil, says studyKhoch lies 150 km from Indias commercial capital Mumbai and close to the border with Gujarat, one of the countrys most prosperous states, but unemployment is forcing parents to move to cities to find work to feed their children.Palghars problem of malnutrition is shocking because of its proximity to Mumbai, but it is migration to Mumbai that is at the root of this problem, said Milind Thatte, founder of Vayam, a movement for tribal development.People from Palghar migrate to Mumbai for work, but the cost of living there is very high. They dont eat to save money.Villagers start leaving Palghar in December for the Mumbai satellite towns of Thane and Bhiwandi where they often work 12-hour shifts at construction sites or road building projects.Once the monsoon season halts construction, workers return to villages in July for a jobless spell until October, when the start of the harvest provides daily work on farmland.Locals refer to September as starvation month, when many people are unemployed and childrens deaths peak.The end of the harvest in December again signals the end of the villagers home stay.We have no work now, but we will leave soon. We are waiting for the seth (the construction site contractor) to come and take us, Wadwi said.BOTTOM OF THE LADDERNamdev Savara, a member of the Kathkari tribe, has devoted an entire wall of his one-room hut in Khoch to colourful depictions of Indian gods and goddesses.So when his son, Ishwar - which means the supreme lord in Hindi - died in September, he hung a black and white picture of the child on this wall of worship.Savara said he will not leave Khoch in 2017 and he will work on a local road construction project with his wife. The couple will stay close to their two other children who go to school.According to government data about 39% of Indian children suffer from chronic undernutrition and around 42.5% are underweight.In Palghar, malnutrition most affects the Kathkari tribe -- a one time forest community which is among the lowest in the pecking order of the Indian caste system.Most children who died this year due to malnutrition-linked illnesses were from the Kathkari community, said Nidhi Chaudhari, who heads the Palghar local government office.Vivek Pandit, an activist who has represented the area in the Maharashtra state assembly, said Kathkari people dont have land and are handpicked for their ability to do strenuous work.They work at construction sites, break stones for road construction or at brick kilns, Pandit said.Employers usually prefer to hire Kathkari couples as they coordinate better and are cheaper than two men, with men paid around 200 rupees daily and women anywhere between 50 and 100 rupees.The migrant workers survive on rice and the occasional dish of potato and onions, saving their money for the jobless months.WEAK AND VULNERABLEDoctors said children suffer due to irregular feeding patterns when both parents work long hours.The parents priority is not their childs health but to earn their daily wages, said Ramdas Marad, superintendent at the Palghar sub-district hospital that runs at twice its capacity in the monsoon months between June and September.Children are more vulnerable to disease such as pneumonia or respiratory infections during this time as they are weak and their immunities are compromised.The government is drawing up a list of Kathkari tribe members to ensure they benefit from the government schemes for jobs and education, among the others that they are eligible for.The government has even started a new road project in Khoch to attempt to slow migration, but only a handful of people who have bank accounts are so far eligible.Savara is among them but his decision to stay in Khoch this year is an anomaly in the village where migration began last month.Many, such as Wadwi, even committed to leave in September, when a contractor visited families and bought promises of migration against an advance payment.I know my child was malnourished when we migrated last year. But what will I feed him if I dont work? she said."

Initially, the transplantation process had slowed down in the district due to severe cold, which affected the growth of the seedlings.As per reports, paddy seedlings have been transplanted in 4,687 hectares of land till January 27 against the target of 14,635 hectares for the current rabi season. Generally, paddy transplantation picks up from the first week of January during rabi season. But, stunted growth of the seedlings led farmers to put the transplantation on hold and wait for the sapling to attain the right size. However, the transplantation has gained momentum from the third week of January after the seedlings gained right growth.Umesh Mishra, a farmer of Satupali village under Dhankauda block, said, The severe cold badly affected the growth of paddy seedlings. But as temperature rose, the seedlings attained maturity for transplantation. Though every year he starts paddy transplantation in the first week of January, this season he did it from January 20, he added.District Agricultural Strategy Committee (DASC) has set a target to cultivate paddy in 14,635 hectares with a production target of 87,810 tonne during the rabi season. Till January 27, maize has already been cultivated in 365 hectares against the target of 401 hectares while wheat has been grown in 81 hectares against the target of 125 hectares. Similarly, pulses including moong, biri, kulthi, cow pea, field pea and gram have been cultivated in 12,299 hectares against the target of 15,527 hectares.Besides, oilseeds, including groundnut, sesame, mustard, castor and sunflower have been cultivated in 9,677 hectares against the target of 11,637 hectares. This apart, cultivation of vegetable, including potato and onion, has already been done in 14,604 hectares against the target of 17,676 hectares. Moreover, cultivation of condiments, including chilli, garlic and coriander has surpassed the target. The condiments have been grown over 7,067 hectares against the target of 6,750 hectares.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal admitted that the weather conditions were adverse for proper growth of paddy seedlings. However, he said things have improved and transplantation is underway in full swing across the district. He hoped that the transplantation would be completed by February 15."

As potato farmers are staring at heavy losses due to drop in demand and prices, the state government held a high-powered meeting to help them deal with the slump.The CM, who chaired the meeting, suggested that inmates in all the state jails should be fed potatoes. Another idea was to serve potatoes to schoolchildren, under the government-run midday meal programme, to add to their calorie intake. The state authorities discussed the issue after leaders of farmers unions had sought their help.Low-key affairAfter the state assembly polls, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife, Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, made their first visit to Amritsar on Saturday and attended the monthly bhog ceremony of akhand path at the Golden Temple.Unlike their previous trips, their outing remained low profile this time. Whenever the deputy CM was in the holy city earlier, the administrative top brass of the district used to be in attendance besides the entire local Akali leadership. However, neither any senior official nor any prominent local leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal accompanied the couple this time. The duo also showed less interest in talking to reporters.Beyond promisesIn the high-stakes poll battle for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), in its manifesto released last week, went overboard in making promises. The promises ranged from more schools and dispensaries to free education to more Sikh children.The party also listed promises it made and fulfilled. But one section titled Jo nahee kaha si, oho vee kita (What was not promised, but still accomplished) caught everyones attention. It included rescue operations carried out after Nepal earthquake and floods in Kashmir, and help given to farmers of Pehowa in Haryana to get their lands back from the state government.Foolproof formulaHaryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattars supporters in his assembly constituency of Karnal were upset over the indifference of district authorities to their genuine demands. But they have now found a way to get themselves heard.The formula, according to a local leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is to invite the CM to their residence. Once officials of the district administration find out about the CMs visit, they take their demands seriously and take no time in completing all pending works, he said. The roads get repaired and painted, potholes are filled up and other issues taken care of.Chinks in Chautala clan?The much-hyped Jal Yudh (war for water) of the opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana, which ended with the arrest of its leaders, including Abhay Chautala, on Thursday was seen as the launching pad of Abhays son Arjun Chautala into politics.It was the first state-level programme in which Arjun had actively participated and went to jail along with other senior leaders of the party. However, the absence of family members of Abhays elder brother Ajay Chautala, who is in jail in teachers recruitment case, was the talking point throughout the day-long protest.Neither Ajays MLA wife Naina Chautala, nor their two sons, Hisar MP Dushyant and Digvijay, were seen at the rally. Dushyant told reporters on Sunday that he and his brother were abroad as per a pre-decided programme.Preparing for poetic politicsHimachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh will present the general budget for financial year 2017-18 on March 10. The CM holds the finance portfolio and his budget speech lasted two hours last year. But it may be even longer this time.Officers of the finance department are making extra efforts to create a record of sorts in the state assembly, trying to incorporate just about everything.A special officer has been deputed to incorporate couplets and quotations. The officer has sent a message on WhatsApp to his friends, asking them to send best of Urdu couplets that can be used to hit out at the opposition.AAPs hilly dreamsThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lacks an organisational setup in Himachal Pradesh, but its supporters showed a lot of enthusiasm during the assembly elections in neighbouring Punjab.A number of its supporters had travelled to Punjab and spent there a month, canvassing for the party candidates. On their return, they are not only eagerly awaiting the poll results, but also visiting different villages and looking for prospective candidates, hoping that the party may enter the fray in the hill state, where the elections are due later this year.(Contributed by Gurpreet Singh Nibber, Surjit Singh, Rajesh Moudgil, Neeraj Mohan and Gaurav Bisht)"

Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Food being served at the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Primary Girls/Boys School. Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalWith nine children falling sick after dead rats were found in their food, the spotlight is back on mid-day meals. The Indian Express tracks the food from the kitchens to the students, and discovers some bumps along the wayA peppery aroma emanates from the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur, amid a sputtering of machines and flurry of human activity. On a Wednesday morning, nearly 70 men  supervisors, cooks, housekeeping staff and helpers  mop the 3,400 square yard area, load three 500 kg capacity steamers with potatoes, wash over 2,000 kg of rice, roll out 50,000 puris, temper over 800 kg of curry, and, finally, test the quality of food. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.We have 104 people and the second shift, which prepares meals for evening schools, is at work now. Between midnight and 5 pm, our kitchen prepares meals for 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools, which is about 80,000 students, says Godfrey Pereira, the NGO secretary. His is one of the 43 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to 18.46 lakh children in Delhi schools, run or aided by the Directorate of Education, the north, east and south civic bodies, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Cantonment Board.Unlike rural centres, there are no kitchen-cum-stores on school campuses in Delhi, primarily due to lack of space. All mid-day meals are prepared and delivered by NGOs, selected through a tender every three years Its a massive operation, and a small mistake at any of the levels  procuring, cleaning, cooking or serving  can have major repercussions, says Pereira, 58, whose NGO has been a part of the programme since 2003. Ye floor se paani saaf karo, Pereira instructs one of the helpers, pointing to the water that spread after rice was drained. He has just begun his rounds of the kitchen and will inspect all departments  grain clearing, cooking, vegetable cutting, dish washing, frying and storage areas  over the next few hours.On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.The small mistake Pereira refers to is what could have led to dead rats slipping into mid-day meals served at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli earlier this month. Nine students were hospitalised after consuming food provided by Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, one of the 16 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to Delhi government schools. The incident prompted Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to ordered an inspection of 33 such kitchens by secretary-level officers.Pereira feels that though checks and balances are in place, an error can occur, or be introduced, at any stage, including after food has left the kitchen. You can never rule out sabotage. Its a competitive field and anyone who has lost out on the tender can bribe a driver or helper to spoil food, he says, checking the tempering of the potato curry. Jaldi karo, vans aane waali hongi, he says.Narender Singh, a member of the Suparbhat Education and Social Welfare Society, which supplies mid-day meals to 28 Delhi government schools, feels that problems run much deeper. While 43 NGOs get the contract to provide these meals, they end up sub-letting their duties to other organisations. In case of Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, food was being provided by a third party. In such situations, monitoring quality becomes difficult, alleges Singh, whose NGO has been delivering meals since 2004. Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas refused to comment on the matter. Then there is the issue of training the staff. These third-party vendors simply hire daily wagers. The government must look into this, he adds.***Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalThe mid-day meal scheme has been operational in Delhi for nearly 15 years now. A November 2001 Supreme Court order made it compulsory for all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide the meals. Two years later, the programme was first implemented in Delhi in 410 MCD schools, and in 2004, it was extended to primary classes of Sarvodaya schools, under the Directorate of Education. In October 2007, the scheme was revised to cover children in upper primary classes as well  VI to VIII.Since then, selected service providers have been supplying meals with a minimum of 450 calories and 12 gm of protein to children in Classes I-V, and with 700 calories and 20 gm of protein for students of Classes VI-VIII.Pereira, now checking the consistency of the kadhi in an 800 kg aluminium vessel, says that while NGOs try and stick to the calorific and protein requirements, the budget for meals is very low. We try and add ingredients such as soya chunks to meet the protein content, but apart from grains, which we get from the Food Corporation of India godowns, there is no subsidy on any ingredient and we pay market prices. We add seasonal vegetables, which are cheaper, but that is it. Spices, kidney beans, are expensive, he says, adding that the gas subsidy provided earlier has been taken away too. We use 90 cylinders a day; heating up large vessels requires a lot of fuel.The NGOs get Rs 4.13 and Rs 6.18 per child per day for primary and upper primary classes, respectively. The organisations also get Rs 1,000 per month for the cook-cum-helpers that serve meals at schools and for Rs 750 per metric ton for transportation. The cost for the entire programme is shared between the Centre and the state on a 60-40 basis.Narendra Singh, whose NGO supplies food to schools in northeast Delhi, also complains about delays in payments. We are yet to receive money for December. In such situations, many NGOs are likely to falter on quality, he says.So, will increasing the number of service providers help? Not at all, in fact it will increase bureaucracy and make monitoring even more difficult, says a member of another NGO, which supplies food to 44 schools in northwest Delhi. You need to empower existing organisations. Increase funding, expand infrastructure and workforce Provide raw material and verify the stock on a monthly basis.Pereira agrees. The problem is that we are not considered a part of the government. The moment there is an incident, such as the one at the Deoli school, there is a blame game, and all fingers are pointed at NGOs. But its only if the government and the NGOs work as a team that issues will be resolved, he says.***The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schoolsThis is not the first time that the Delhi mid-day meal programme has come under scrutiny. In 2013, an audit conducted by the Union HRD Ministry found that the meal served in schools in the capital did not meet prescribed nutritional values. About 95 per cent of 365 meal samples failed to meet nutritional requirements in 2011-2012, and 98 per cent of 322 samples failed in 2010-2011. Seventeen NGOs were found violating norms.Vimala Ramachandran, a former professor at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, who has been part of several research projects on the subject, says, In cities, there is no space for kitchens on campus and that is where problems begin. Tamil Nadu is the best model where, except for Chennai, all food is prepared on campus. They dont rely on centralised kitchens (like the ones in Delhi). In Andhra Pradesh, sub-letting is not allowed. In Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Tripura, all grains come from the nearest public distribution system store, so it is all subsidised. Why cant other states follow this model, and link PDS or Kendriya Bhandars with mid-day meals?***Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis SultanpurOperations at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys kitchen have picked up pace. Four delivery vans have started queuing up at the entrance. Inside, cooks and helpers are putting final touches to the food. Hundreds of stainless steel vessels are being rinsed in potassium permanganate liquid and wiped, before food is packed in them. A few women are locking the vessels with a plastic seal.Hansika Rawat, a teacher from the Tughlakabad Extension government school, has arrived for inspection. Teachers from schools we supply meals too conduct inspections. We get three-four teachers a day, he says, directing one of his supervisors to show Rawat around. Following the inspection, teachers are expected to fill up a questionnaire with queries such as: Is there proper arrangement for drainage of waste water? and Are CCTVs installed in all the compartments?.Pereira appears confident. We follow all directions. I can monitor CCTV footage on my phone. It is a 24/7 kitchen and that is the first thing I do when I wake up at 5 am, he says.The vans take off on their journeys to schools, some as close as a kilometre away, others at least 6 km away. This is another problem. I dont supply food to the government school right next door, some other NGO does. Schools need to be allotted according to location of kitchens, he says.One of the schools Pereiras organisation provides food for is the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Primary Girls/Boys School, in Deoli, a kilometre away from the school where dead rats were found. Before children take their seats on durries in the corridor, a series of steps need to be followed: The room where food is served is mopped, then two cook-cum-helpers open seals of vessels in the presence of Ram Kumar Meena, the mid-may meal in-charge for the school, and then Meena, a few other teachers and two parents  who were there to speak to teachers about their wards  taste the aloo-puri. Following approvals, at around 3.20 pm, the cook-cum-helpers begin serving the meals to Class I students, who have brought their own bowls and plates. We send the food back if we feel it is spoiled. But then students suffer. It is difficult to prepare the meals again at such short notice. We give students biscuits, etc. on such days, says Meena.Soon, the conversation drifts towards the neighbouring school where dead rats were found. My eldest son studies in Class VI in that school and he loves the kadhi-chawal. But since the incident, I have been packing his lunch from home, says Indu Devi, 40, one of the parents tasting the meals.At the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli, meals continue to be served by the same NGO. No one, apart from students, is allowed to enter the school. Principal sahab baat nahi karenge, says the guard through a small hole in the gate. A little after 3.30 pm, a few students scale the school wall and jump outside. One of them walks over to the general store and buys a packet of chips. I dont like the mid-day meals too much, says the Class VII student.Ask him about students who fell ill, and pat comes the reply: Yes, a few students were vomiting, but they werent from my class. Today kadhi-chawal is being served, but I will go home and eat, he says, walking away with his friends, all of whom have decided to give school a miss today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

POORNACHANDRA KUMARK_V_POORNACHANDRA_KUMARLooking well beyond food security and hunger elimination, noted agricultural scientist and Father of Green Revolution M.S. Swaminathan sees bio-fortification, the process of improving nutritional quality of food crops, as holding the key to tackle malnutrition and under-nourishment.In his talk on Science and zero hunger challenge delivered at the 104th Indian Science Congress here on Friday, Dr. Swaminathan called it a matter of shame for the nation to rank low in child nourishment and food security, in spite of the farmers being the pride of the nation. He floated the idea of developing Nutrition gardens (botanical gardens with plants considered rich in vitamins, iron, iodine etc.) and creating public awareness. In this connection, he referred to the role played by the newly-developed sweet potato variety having orange-coloured flesh (high in beta carotene) in combating child malnutrition. After calorie deficiency and protein deficiency, the hidden micronutrient deficiency requires attention now, he pointed out.Calling food as curative medicine, as has been found in the case of tuberculosis, he said that reaching food to the masses would eliminate most disorders.On Ehrlich's prediction of India falling flat in achieving food security, he threw a challenge to the agricultural scientists to prove wrong all such prophesies. Dr. Swaminathan suggested genetic checkmating of new disease threats to usher in the era of food security.From Nehruvian focus on multi-purpose irrigation projects to Lal Bahadur Shastri equating farmer with the soldier with the catchy slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Dr. Swaminathan dwelt on former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayees inclusion of Jai Vigyan that gave the technological thrust to India's focus.On Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu's offer of Rs.100 crore to Nobel prize winner from the State, Dr. Swaminathan hailed it as having great potential to stimulate scientific thinking."

A total of 1.70 crore people have been hit hard, with 81.5 lakh losing their jobs. The Prime Minister can't run the country. Let there be a national government and let someone else from BJP take over. It can be Advani, Rajnath Singh or Arun Jaitley .""Appreciating what President Pranab Mukherjee said about providing protection to the poor, the CM urged him to become a saviour for the states.""The present PM is the great Kalidas who is cutting branches of the tree on which he is. The country isn't in safe hands of `buddhiharan babu' (a fool).Even government projects have been hit. I ask SDOs to get in touch with the CMO in the event of a government project being stalled,"" the CM said, asking officials to create a dedicated CMO phone number for this.Mamata feared that worse is in store for the state. ""What you are seeing now isn't the bottom of the crisis.The worst is yet to happen. How long can industries operate without funds? They are running out of working capital. People have money in banks, but they can't withdraw it. We don't know how long the cashless PM will continue with the cash withdrawal ceiling. Farmers, bidi workers, tea plantation workers, those working in jute mills, artisans, weavers and jewellery makers are the worst hit. The Centre had promised Rs 2,500 crore to cooperative banks. But they have got only Rs 300 crore. The cash crunch has taken a toll on rabi crops and potato farming too."" She argued that the slump in farming will lead to aspike in commodity prices in the near future and the country will be heading towards famine.The CM also hit out at Modi over his bid to do away with the old institutions. ""Yesterday , we got a letter from the ministry of corporate affairs dissolving the board for industrial and financial reconstruction (BIFR). This is not the only one. Soon after he came to power, the PM abolished the planning commission, which used to allocate resources for states. He replaced it with Niti Ayog. The PM has been eroding institutions that formed the country's backbone,"" the CM said.The CM took a dig at the deployment of CRPF jawans in front of the state BJP office. ""Political parties are calling in the CRPF when there is a state government. The PM is misusing government agencies. The country is witnessing a terror, we have to come out of it."" She then appealed to all political parties to set aside their differences and chalk out a common minimum programme for the national government."

Political parties too have framed special strategies to woo this large chunk of voters. Villages are expected to witness crowded 'chaupals'.The multi-phase elections will begin with notification for the first phase on January 17 and end with voting in phase 7 on March 8, coinciding with a period when farmers have some time on their hands. ""This season wheat has been sown in around 1.24 hectares alone in Agra district and potato in 79 hectares. Harvesting of mustard crop will take place on 30 hectares. Farmers will start harvesting potatoes from around February 25, followed by wheat and mustard in March,"" said deputy director of agriculture, K N Rai.Shyam Singh Chahar, district head of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Farms in Agra and nearby districts are covered with crops of wheat, potato and mustard.

During the day, farmers will be either at home or in public places in villages.BJP district president Shyam Bhadoriya said, ""The party in Agra has been in continuous interaction with farmers. Our wing, the BJP Kisan Morcha, has been helping farmers in their time of need. Ahead of elections we are going to organize special chaupals and interact with farmers around bonfires. We will remind farmers of the pro-agriculture initiatives of the central government and note down their grievances."" BSP district head Pramod Raina said, ""We will make farmers aware of the Centre's neglect and farlse promises by the state government.

West Bengal Governor Kesharai Nath Tripathi while responding to a question on the attack on the state BJP headquarters in Kolkata soon after Trinamool Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay's arrest, said: ""Every state, irrespective of political attachment, should try to ensure peace in the state and maintain law and order."" The governor didn't name any state neither did he comment on the prevailing situation in West Bengal.While BJP leader Rahul Sinha welcomed the governor's statement saying that Tripathi had advised the state government to discharge raj dharma, Trinamool secretary general and minister Partha Chatterjee feared that BJP was trying to use the governor's office. The Left also didn't spare the governor for ""breaking silence"" only after the BJP party offices and leaders came under attack.Political parties read between the lines of his statement giving political connotations to the context in which the governor made the statement. The governor's comment comes two days after the attack on state BJP headquarters on Tuesday evening, and a day after men carrying Trinamool flags mobbed Union minister Babul Supriyo's Kolkata home and also led a siege to BJP party offices in Durgapur and Hooghly. The violence apart from the bedlam in city continued even on Thursday, the recent being the attack on state BJP president Dilip Ghosh's house. All these caught the notice of Union home minister Rajnath Singh who in turn called the state BJP president and asked him to lodge separate FIRs on each of these attacks. The Union home department has asked for an action taken report for all these cases.The continuing violence without any arrest so far doesn't speak well of the state's law and order. Such a situation also blunts the state government's writing to the Union home ministry against the deployment of CRPF jawans at the state BJP office on the day of the incident without the state government's consent. On the contrary, the Union home minister's taking interest in the happenings in West Bengal has prompted the police brass at Lalbazar to take guard. Setting aside the usual nonchalance over the last two days, Lalbazar has fortified the BJP party offices and the residence of the leaders across the state, and are likely to make some arrests before sending a report to Nabanna. The state government also wants the police to take action before it sends the action taken report to the Union home ministry.Mamata Banerjee as opposition leader had witnessed such wrangling match between the BJP government at the Centre and the Left Front government in West Bengal in 1998-99 during the violence in Keshpur, Nanoor, Suchpur when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sent a central team to Bengal to take stock of the ground reality.State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee thus doesn't want to open yet another front of confrontation with Raj Bhavan. ""The government has no problems with the present governor. We may have differences at times but some people are trying to take it too far. I had a talk with the governor even today,"" Chatterjee said, adding that his party isn't in a mood to burn bridges with Raj Bhavan."

Swaminathan has said that climate change demands anticipatory action from scientists and policymakers.Mr. Swaminathan was speaking at a consultation on climate change and food security on Monday at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, of which he is founder. It was part of a project, called Clima Adapt, which is being supported by the Norwegian Embassy in India. The programme was also attended by Jon Georg Dale, Norways Minister for Agriculture and Food.In his speech, Mr. Swaminathan described how temperature, precipitation and sea level rise affects agriculture. We have made a study that showed that, as a result of higher temperature, the duration of wheat crop in the Punjab will go down by one week....This will bring down the wheat production in the country which will go down by 5-6 million tonnes, he said.Alternate farmingMr. Swaminathan said that rising temperatures will necessitate alternate methods of growing potato. We grow 50 million tonnes of potato; 30 years ago, we grew five million tonnes. How did this sudden potato revolution take place? It was because of a method developed for sweet potato production during what we call aphid-free-season. Now, when the temperature goes up, the aphid-free-season will be gone, he said.Minister Dale, who began by noting that Chennai has the same population as Norway, said that such projects are a win-win for both countries. The experience from such projects have been used in several projects in Asia and Africa, he said.The Minister said that MSSRFs work on sea water farming was of particular interest to his country. We are committed to a policy approach which sees water and water-related ecosystems are protected and managed sustainably, he said, repeating a G20 pledge.The Norwegian minister also hoped to an end to the Syrian conflict. Syria is important for this world. We hope that Syria, at the end of this horrible war, can resume agricultural production, he said.He said that agricultural policy will be affected by climate change. We must adapt food production and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from the agriculture sector....Agriculture must, as far as possible, take its share of (greenhouse gas) reduction, he said. Mr. Dale concluded by quoting Mr. Swaminathan: If agriculture goes wrong, nothing can go right."

The impact of the poor rainfall had been that 8,230 of 9,869 ha of maize, 1,665 of 2,916 ha of jowar, and 2,200 of 4,662 ha under pulses, had been affected.Of the 295 villages in the district, 276 were affected.

He had seen Narendra Modi in real life for the first time and from the closest possible distance. "" Chehra ekdum gora hai, aur chamakta hai (His face is totally fair and it glows),"" Singh, a backward class marginal farmer, tells those gathered at the teashop near his village. Last Wednesday, Modi addressed a rally in Kannauj, and Harinath had managed to wind his way to the front rows on the military ground. The five Assembly seats of Kannauj, represented by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple in the Lok Sabha, will go to polls this Sunday. At the teashop, Congress leader Tariq Bashir confronts Harinath. He asks whether Modi's ""glowing"" face will fetch "" roti"" for Harinath. ""Chehra dekhne se roti milega kya?"" Tariq asks. Harinath retorts "" roti"" is given by ""Bhagwan (God)"" but it is his dharma to respect a big person like Modi who has come to his place. Harinath points out how the Prime Minister has promised to waive loans of small farmers and ensure potato farmers get a fair price if the BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh. ""Modiji is such a big man and if he is promising, then we have to believe him,"" Harinath says. Tariq, the Congress leader, keeps arguing but Harinath doesn't give in. Eventually, Bhaiyalal Rathore, a retired teacher, steps in. ""You (Tariq) are opposed to Modi and so whatever he (Harinath) says you will not accept,"" Bhaiyalal says. The argument ends on a pleasant note with no sign of ill-will. Some point out it is "" matdaan (election)"" and so each one has his ""mat (view)"". After tea, Bhaiyalal and Harinath invite this reporter to their village. The village called Gadiya Kachpura, around 2km from the teashop, is dominated by non-Yadav backward classes in an area regarded as Yadav territory and a stronghold of the ruling Samajwadi Party. The over 500 dwellings are inhabited by residents belonging to castes such as Kushwaha, Kahar, Kaanchi, Dohre, besides a couple of Muslim and Yadav families. Gadiya Kachpura has electricity, road connectivity and other basic facilities. Most residents acknowledge "" vikas hua hai"" (development has taken place). They say Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are pocket boroughs of the Yadav family and the association has rewarded the region in terms of development projects. But some spoke of ""one problem"". ""Akhilesh has done a lot of work. Farmers are getting electricity and he has built roads. But there is one problem,"" says Pritam Singh, a Kushwaha. After a pause, he resumes: ""The problem is that one community is being more favoured. The government gives money for the wedding of Muslim girls but not for Hindus. In wazifa (scholarship) too, Muslims get a preference over Hindus."" Amrital a.k.a. Baba, saffron-robed and aged over 60 years, chips in. He claims his old age pension was stopped in 2013 and when he ran from one official to another, he was asked to pay a bribe. He claimed that elderly Muslim men and women get pension without paying any bribe. Vijay Pratap, a 38-year-old teacher at a government school, says there is no communal tension in the region that has never seen any communal flare-up. ""The villagers are upset over one community being given preference by the government,"" he says. Surendra Singh, 50, enters the discussion and says development is not everything. ""Safety and security of the country is most important,"" he says. He says "" badlao"" (change) is needed in Uttar Pradesh to ensure the country is safe and secure. ""Everyday we hear reports of aatankwadi (terrorists) infiltrating. The hands of the leader who works in national interest should be strengthened,"" he says holding up a clenched fist. ""Modi is working in national interest,"" Surendra adds. Many residents acknowledge that local BJP leaders and Vishwa Hindu Parishad representatives had been raising these issues much before the polls were announced. The villagers claimed that in the 2012 Assembly polls, the village had split 50:50 in favour of the Samajwadi Party and the BJP. ""This time it is going to be 80:20 in favour of the BJP,"" said Bhaiyalal Rathore, who claims he was a ""socialist"" but stands disillusioned because of caste and communal politics. The BJP is banking on the support of non-Yadav OBCs to end what they say ""the 14-year exile of the BJP in the land of Rama and Krishna"". Combined with the support of upper castes, the party hopes to regain power in Lucknow. The party has fielded over 100 backward class candidates. The undercurrent of communalism, particularly among the non-Yadav backward classes, appeared to be permeating beyond Gadiya Kachpura village. In Farrukhabad town, 40km away, J.N. Katiar, a retired state government official, insists the BJP is the best option for the state to become "" uttam pradesh (best state)"". ""Modiji will face re-election after two and a half years (the general election in 2019). He will come again seeking votes and so he has no option but to develop Uttar Pradesh. The SP and BSP will loot the state for three years and then do some work,"" he says. But soon Katiar reveals the main reason for his preference for the BJP: "" Hinduyon ki hitayshi sarkar UP ko chahiye (UP needs a government that serves the interest of the Hindus."""

""It is shameful that there is a son who is ignoring the struggle of (Samajwadi Party patriarch) Mulayam Singh Yadav. He has jumped into the lap of those who had tried to kill his father,"" the Prime Minister told an election rally in Kannauj. ""Akhileshji,"" he added, ""I want to ask you, did you forget the incident of March 4, 1984, when some people had fired at your father to kill him?"" Observers believe local political rivalry had led to the 1984 attack but Modi appeared to be referring to the Congress, as he played on the differences within the state's ruling party that has formalised a pre-poll deal with the Congress. Mulayam had opposed the tie-up but Akhilesh went ahead, eventually sealing a seat-share pact that left 105 of the state's 403 seats to the Congress. ""Nothing would be more shameful than such an act of a son to join hands with the attackers of his father for (the sake of his) chair,"" Modi said. The Prime Minister was speaking on a day 67 constituencies voted in the second phase of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Kannauj will vote in the third phase on February 19. Modi asked Akhilesh to listen to Mulayam, saying the chief minister does not understand the ""designs of the Congress"" which, he claimed, had also kept its future options open with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi's arch-rival. ""Akhilesh is new and he is not able to understand all this. But Mulayam Singh Yadavji understands very well the designs of the Congress party,"" Modi said. The reference was to Rahul Gandhi's comments at a joint media conference he had addressed with Akhilesh last month where the Congress leader had said BSP boss Mayawati's ""politics does not pose any threat to the country"". Congress sources had said Rahul avoided criticising Mayawati's politics to send out the message that the agenda for Dalit empowerment was a common goal. Although Modi appeared to be soft towards Mulayam at one point, he didn't mind targeting the entire Yadav family later in his speech. ""I don't have any car. I use one given to me by the government because I am the Prime Minister of the country. But the Samajwadi family has 200 cars. Is it socialism?"" he asked the crowd. Modi also attacked Akhilesh's wife, Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav. ""The daughter-in-law of the Samajwadi family had promised to the people of Kannauj during the 2014 Lok Sabha election that she would set up a factory to produce potato chips. Now is the time for you,"" he told the crowd, ""to ask her why she didn't fulfil her promise""."

Prices in wholesale markets rose 5.25 per cent last month from a year earlier, their fastest gain since July 2014, government data showed. In December and November, inflation based on WPI stood at 3.39 per cent and 3.38 per cent, respectively. In January 2016, the print was (-)1.07 per cent. The previous high in WPI inflation at 5.41 per cent was witnessed in July 2014. Inflation in the fuel and power basket more than doubled to 18.14 per cent in January, up from 8.65 per cent in the previous month. However, the food inflation basket witnessed a contraction for the second month in a row with inflation at (-) 0.56 per cent in January against (-) 0.70 per cent in December. ""The higher-than-expected print of January WPI is largely a function of rising global prices, helped further by adverse base effects. With commodity prices accounting for a higher weight in WPI (vis-a-vis CPI), the rise in the former will be understandably faster, reflecting in the January inflation prints, which has now seen WPI creep higher than CPI,"" Yes Bank said in a note. The rise in wholesale inflation is in contrast to the fall in retail inflation to a five-year low of 3.17 per cent in January. Industrial production too had contracted 0.4 per cent in December 2016 to a four-month low, with consumer durables taking the worst hit on account of the cash crunch post note ban. Industry chamber Ficci said the industrial economy was still weak and there was a need to improve the flow of credit to manufacturing and infrastructure sectors. ""We also need to see a further reduction in the lending rates by banks and we hope that the RBI's guidance on this to the banks will be followed up in the form of further reduction in rates for companies,"" Ficci said. WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)32.32 per cent in January, saw deflationary pressure for the fifth consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)28.86 per cent. Pulse inflation moderated to 6.21 per cent from 18.12 per cent in December. Potato prices recorded a sharp fall at (-)0.20 per cent from 26.42 per cent in the previous month."

Usually potatoes are harvested from December to February and then put in cold storage. Merchants start to purchase the crop from March 1 when it is taken out of cold storage. But this year the crop is lying in cold storages and we have almost no buyers, said Uttam Das, a potato farmer. Moreover, nearly 20 lakh tonnes of potatoes will probably rot in the fields as the nearly 450 cold storages in the State are unable to store this years harvest.Price to increase soonEven as he admitted that that there was a problem due to the limited number of cold storages, State Agriculture Minister Purnendu Basu avoided a direct reply on whether potato farmers have sustained losses. Pointing to this years high yield, the Minister said the 450 cold storages in Bengal do not have the capacity to accommodate such a large harvest and urged cold storage owners to set up more facilities in the rural agricultural markets set up the State government.In agriculture profits cannot be the same every year, he told The Hindu . On Monday, Mr. Basu claimed in the State Assembly that currently farmers are getting Rs. 4.50 per kg of potato and the price will increase soon."
58f4f1607be9e0185109fe04,Tomato trade feels currency squeeze,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170130/jsp/bengal/story_133058.jsp,2017-01-30,"Purulia, Jan. 29: Thousands of tomato growers in Purulia and Bankura have been hit hard by the absence of buyers of the fruit-vegetable, a not-so-indispensable item in this season of demonetisation. A tomato vendor waits for customers at Urma in Purulia. Picture by Mita Roy Farmer Balaram Kisku, who has cultivated around 100 quintals of tomato in Purulia in November-December, has been feeding a part of his produce to cattle instead of letting it rot in the fields. Agriculture department officials said the demand for tomato was all the more hit because people in eastern India can do without the fruit-vegetable in the kitchen, unlike potato or onion. According to the officials, around 1,000 tomato farmers had been hit in Purulia and Bankura. ""I sold tomato at Rs 20 a kg between October and November. The demand started falling in the middle of November and with it, the price too came down. The situation has come to such a pass that I am being forced to sell a bucket of tomato (around 20-22kg) for only Rs 10 to the wholesalers,"" said Kisku, a resident of Hatinada village on the Ayodhya hills. The vegetable trade has been hit hard in rural Bengal, where wholesalers depend on cash and digital transactions are still a hard nut to crack. ""The cash crunch has left vegetable farmers in serious trouble. The situation is worse for tomato growers because people can do without tomato for days. If people have cash, they would rather spend on potato than tomato,"" an agriculture department official said. In Purulia and Bankura, farmers usually grow tomato between October and March. Officials said the dry climate in the two districts and the hilly terrain are conducive to growing tomato. In the last season, about 3,000 tonnes of tomato had been supplied to various parts of the country from Purulia and Bankura. But this time, the demand has plunged several notches. Ramesh Pandit, a Dhanbad-based tomato wholesaler who owns a warehouse in Purulia's Balarampur, said around 150 quintals of the fruit-vegetable were lying unsold with him. Sources in the agriculture department said a good production this time had added to the trouble of tomato wholesalers in Bengal, which has very few multipurpose cold storage and processing units."
58f4f1697be9e0185109fe0f,Lalu's seat barb at Modi,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170111/jsp/bihar/story_129582.jsp,2017-01-11,"Patna, Jan. 10: RJD chief Lalu Prasad today said he was not invited to share the dais at Prakash Utsav with Narendra Modi because ""the Prime Minister was afraid I would raise the issue of demonetisation and request him to choose a square of his liking where people could punish him"". On November 13 last year, Modi had urged the people to give him 50 days to implement the note ban and said if after that they found shortcomings in his work they could punish him at a public square. At the Prakash Utsav event in Gandhi Maidan on January 5, Lalu's absence from the dais had set tongues wagging. ""I was happy to sit cross-legged for two-and-a-half hours along with devotees,"" Lalu said today at a news meet where he tore into the Centre over demonetisation. "" Ekdam tanatan hain, (I'm fit as a fiddle),"" Lalu said he had told Modi when the Prime Minister had enquired about his health. He said Modi's praise for prohibition was a red herring. ""Nitish has been demanding prohibition in the entire country, but Modi cleverly avoided committing on it. His praise for prohibition was to hide the failure of demonetisation and deflect public attention from it,"" Lalu said. He said the country was reeling from the note ban shock, with GDP growth rate plunging and the unorganised sector virtually destroyed, impacting around 40 crore workers and common people. ""Farmers across the nation are facing devastation. They have to sell potato and cauliflower at just Rs 2-3 per kilo,"" he said. Aboout BJP president Amit Shah's visit to Patna Sahib today, Lalu said: ""He has come late. Yet he should pray to Guru Gobind for forgiveness for implementing demonetisation in the country."" He also challenged Modi to declare how much black money the government has recovered after demonetisation. Peppered with questions about the bonhomie between the JDU and the BJP (read Nitish and Modi), Lalu flicked them away by saying ""it is a good thing"" and that the BJP should support the government in developmental works instead of mudslinging. Lalu also revealed that he had called up Akhilesh Yadav last evening and told the Uttar Pradesh chief minister: ""Enough is enough; you should meet your father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) to stop all this (the infighting). Akhilesh asserted that he was still with his father and had asked for just three months to officiate as Samajwadi Party (SP) president."" Lalu said he would call Mulayam tonight, and that SP leader Amar Singh ""should make efforts to bring Mulayam and Akhilesh together""."
