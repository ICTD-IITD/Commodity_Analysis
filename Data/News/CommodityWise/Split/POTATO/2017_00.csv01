The farmers said they spend nearly Rs 22,000 to cultivate potatoes in a bigha of land but are unable to get good returns. Social worker Chand Mamud said prices have gone down to Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg and farmers have no option but to sell their produce at low prices owing to lack of cold storage facilities. The farmers cannot sell them in the district headquarters markets either as cost of transportation is high. Mandia is the potato hub in the district, where 98 per cent farmers grow the tuber. The village, having a population over 3,500, is 10km southwest of the Barpeta district headquarters. Farmers in the village buy potato seeds, fertilizers and pesticides at high prices to grow the crop commercially. Most of them even take loans from private lenders at high interest. The village also lacks irrigation facility and due to which the farmers have to spend money to irrigate their potato fields. Prices of potato at Barpeta Road market varies between Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kilo as traders brings them from Nainital and Bengal. The production in the state has gone up since the agriculture department started distribution of the Kufri Jyoti potato variety for free from 2001 to 2014. ""This year, less rainfall in the winter helped potato production, said senior department officer Dipok Tamuli. Nagaon, Morigaon, Sonitpur, Biswanath Chariali, Barpeta and Darrang are the main potato growing districts in Assam. Agriculture department officials said abundance of quality seeds, coupled with favourable weather are the two main reasons for increase in production of potato in the state. ""Productivity of Pukhraj variety of seeds is almost double and that results maximum potato production,"" said Tamuli. The agriculture department distributed 20,924 quintals of Pukhraj and 1,860 quintals of Khyati variety of seeds among farmers this year. Both the varieties are from Punjab and known as short-duration, disease-resistant and cold-tolerant varieties. ""These varieties could be harvested in 100 days so farmers could opt for another crop assoon as the potato is harvested. Productivity is 15 to 20 times of the seed,"" said Seed Corporation of India managing director, M.P. Rownier."
58f501e97be9e018510a1711,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"

58f507a27be9e018510a1d61,What women really want,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170309/jsp/opinion/story_139644.jsp,2017-03-09,"Every year without fail when International Women's Day rolls around, it serves as a brutal reminder of how far women have come since medieval times and also how far there is still left to go. This year in the run up to the IWD, Gurmehar Kaur was abused and trolled for merely having an opinion; the Central Board of Film Certification banned Lipstick Under My Burkha, a film exploring female sexuality; 19 aborted female foetuses were found in Sangli in Maharashtra and many men didn't care enough about women's consent or legal consequences and proceeded to rape them. International Women's Day, in the Indian context, has been reduced to tweets, Facebook posts, corporate meetings on sexual harassment (where only women show up), WhatsApp messages and so on, that thank women in their roles as good daughters, mothers, wives, sisters. These messages then oddly suggest that women should be empowered and that they are like goddesses and so should be respected. I am writing this piece to draw attention to this doublespeak in Indian society that has significantly marred women's parity in all spheres - that we celebrate IWD and use it to only praise and laud women in certain roles where they are wholly and unquestionably subservient to others. As a society, it has been recently demonstrated that we will bully women into silence, pay no attention to her consent, and that we are most comfortable when a woman is in the kitchen surrounded by an endlessly recurring pile of potato peels. Part of the tension between female empowerment and how Indian's understand it is related to women's work and Indian society's reliance on unpaid female labour. Consider the fact that in Iceland, for instance, in 1975, 90 per cent of women in the country refused to show up for work and refused to undertake any household work because they were not being paid the same as men for the same job (roughly 60 per cent less than men). Last year, women in Iceland repeated their protest and left work at 2:38 pm because of unequal pay. Such protests over the years were crucial to women emerging in Iceland as a political interest group that paved the way for the election of the first female president in the world. What would happen in India if women refused to work for a day? Food would not be cooked, children would not be bathed and sent to school, husbands would not have their tiffin boxes for the office, clothes would not be washed, in villages and slums the household would have no water, construction work in many places would halt, food stalls would close, farm work would be hit, diapers wouldn't be changed, bathrooms wouldn't be cleaned, loads would not be carried, prayers would not be offered, in-laws wouldn't be fussed over and cared for and there would be a visible disruption of a huge portion of the unorganized sector. Essentially, all that is needed for Indian society to stop functioning at the basic unit of the family is for women to stop working for a week. I would like to think that the above is an exaggeration and that typical Indian men are in fact competent enough to take care of their needs; that they don't need someone in a subservient position as a sock-washer or sex-provider. However, men that help out at home are very rare in India, but more important, many men feel as if they are entitled to their wife's labour and if she is earning, then to her salary and wages. The most important thing that needs to be done for female empowerment to become a reality is that male entitlement over the female body and female labour must be broken. It is because of this that I find it important to be critical of the social media messages that liken empowerment to some state of female godliness that is rooted in antiquity. Making women believe they are goddesses is like asking them to consume LSD where they feel empowered in a mystical realm, but their reality is that they are still stuck at that kitchen sink. We have crafted an excellent script for Indian women, where in childhood the father-patriarch rules them and as adults the husband and son as patriarchs rule them. This also explains why we have an independently sponsored bill which seeks to limit expenditure on marriages, but does not suggest instead that it should be binding that at least the equal of what is spent on a girl's marriage should have been also spent on her education. We wait for a girl to change from child to wife, in spite of her educational accomplishments and career, and once she is married, we also expect her to prioritize children and family over her career. It is no surprise then that the housewife suicide rate in India is rather high if one looks at the NCRB statistics, and that almost no woman in India has a fight-free marriage where at some point or the other she is not depressed or in conflict with her husband, in-laws, her own parents and brothers over property. There is no point in celebrating International Women's Day if in India this day is only a mechanism for men to show that they are appreciative of female labour by likening women to something holy, when the women in fact would like to see some wages for their effort. The day isn't about how nice men are to send such messages on social media. This day is about rededicating oneself to a fight for parity in income, in social roles, inside the house, in nutrition, in healthcare access, in educational access. Women don't want a sharper potato peeler or a cheap trinket or a gaudy photoshopped message imposed on a water-colour female goddess as affirmation; they want to have the same life chances as men, they want to live fuller lives in the same measure as men, they want the same sense of freedom and entitlement that men have, they want the same income for the same job as men get and they certainly don't want to be trapped in an endless cycle of mundane chores to support any man free of cost. My only plea this year is that as a society we need to discard the double-speak and not put women on a pedestal of a goddess only to have her sweep and mop it. Let's instead pledge that everyday of the year we will all see the work that women do as work that men ought also to be doing. Let's not think that women live to serve men and that marriage is an ultimate goal after which women can give up ambition. Let's not teach our young girls to compete with one another over males. Let's teach them that no one is entitled to their labour for free and that it is better to be financially independent than to be liked by one's husband and family. In fact, let us teach young girls that possessing ambition is not synonymous with marriage. The author is the Chief Coordinator of Research at The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy"
58f508237be9e018510a1e5b,Bengal opens farm trade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170303/jsp/bengal/story_138748.jsp,2017-03-03,"Calcutta, March 2: The Mamata Banerjee government today amended the agriculture produce marketing act to allow the entry of major private players in the trade so that better prices were ensured for commodities produced by farmers. But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

How did this sudden potato revolution take place? It was because of a method developed for sweet potato production during what we call aphid-free-season. Now, when the temperature goes up, the aphid-free-season will be gone, he said.Minister Dale, who began by noting that Chennai has the same population as Norway, said that such projects are a win-win for both countries.The experience from such projects have been used in several projects in Asia and Africa, he said.The Minister said that MSSRFs work on sea water farming was of particular interest to his country.We are committed to a policy approach which sees water and water-related ecosystems are protected and managed sustainably, he said, repeating a G20 pledge.The Norwegian minister also hoped to an end to the Syrian conflict.Syria is important for this world. We hope that Syria, at the end of this horrible war, can resume agricultural production, he said. He said that agricultural policy will be affected by climate change.We must adapt food production and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from the agriculture sector....Agriculture must, as far as possible, take its share of (greenhouse gas) reduction, he said.

The details of that long journey are now hazy but Sharma's legacy, roughly 160-odd years later, is still edible. The deep-fried pooris that the UP villager served up in a corner of 19th-century Fort still form the daily bread for the sixth generation of his descendants.Pancham Puriwala, the famous puri-bhaji cafe on Perin Neriman street, near the GPO, traces its origins to the humble diner that Sharma set up in the late 1840s. Now managed by brothers Sandeep, Anupam, and Akshay , the restaurant retains a lowkey ambience, with its marble tiles and perforated steel seats. There is still no air-conditioning. "" ACs would invite taxes,"" says Anupam Sharma. Worse, it might encourage customers to linger. ""Ours is a khao-aur-khisko joint.""Amid an explosion of new cafes, the eatery's cheap and filling traditional fare continues to pack the tables, drawing both taxi driver and bank manager. A plate of five thick pooris (pancham means five in Hindi) and dry potato sabzi that used to cost four annas in the late 1800s today costs Rs 35. For Rs 60 to Rs 140 a thali, you can also sample modern takes such as masala pooris (infused with urad dal), green pooris (made of spinach) and the popular potato-pumpkin sabzi. ""Our USP is our authentic North Indian taste,"" says Anupam, who eats at the restaurant most nights.Anupam recalls the stories told by his grandfather Badriprasad Sharma , whose garlanded portrait hangs in the restaurant. When Pancham Sharma first came to the city , Perin Nariman street was known as Bazar Gate Street or simply `Bazar Gate' and had no street lights. Pointing to the office of DCP Zone I opposite the eatery, Anupam says the building ""was where petty criminals like ticketless travellers and drunkards used to be locked up."" Nearby is a peepal tree that Anupam says was planted by his great-grandfather, Mangal Singh Sharma.In fact, city historian Deepak Rao says that before 1857, there was a pond facing Pancham Puriwala called Gibbet's pond -locally known as Phansi Talao  which was a popular spot for public executions. In the Sharma household, legend has it that ""large crowds would gather to witness executions and afterwards they would drop in to eat puri-bhaji,"" says Anupam.In the 1960s and '70s, famous folks like music director Khayyam, actor Rajesh Khanna and former politician George Fernandes would grab a bite here. In those years, the Sharmas also briefly ran a sweet shop called Pancham Dugdhalay nearby .Lately there have been some nostalgic visitors. An old customer who moved to Seattle brought his son to the eatery just as his father did before him. And a British couple who were regulars before Independence revisited the restaurant recently . No wonder the late columnist Busybee, aka Behram Contractor once wrote that the eatery should be put on the heritage list.Still, the restaurant is slowly adapting to changing times (with annual margins as high as 30 percent, there seems to be no rush.) In recent years, the menu has been expanded, the interiors revamped, and deliveries started in the Fort area. And now demonetisation -which ate into 15 per cent of business  might force Pancham Puriwala into a revolutionary upgrade. ""We are planning to get a card swipe machine,"" says Anupam."

If it does not, the revenue from the power will continue to provide more income to an emboldened Taliban.Drug tradeThe Taliban have long tapped into Afghanistans lucrative drug trade and illegal mining, in addition to the streams of donations they receive from supporters abroad, mainly in the Persian Gulf states. But in the past two years, they have found new ways of diversifying and collecting revenue, according to interviews with officials, Taliban commanders and local residents.The diversification of the revenue collection system has raised fears that the balance of the war could tilt even further in the year ahead, and that the insurgency is becoming more entrenched and acting as a shadow government in parts of the countryside.What it suggests, essentially, is that the group is becoming more efficient in systematically taxing the areas they either control or have a lot of influence on, said Timor Sharan, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, a research institute. Efficiency of taxation is quite significant in terms of sustaining the group for a long time.In addition to collecting electricity bills from thousands of homes in provinces such as Kunduz and Helmand, the insurgents levy taxes on potato harvests, flour mills, teachers salaries, marriage ceremonies, and fuel and vegetable trucks crossing their checkpoints.At the same time, the Taliban continue to pursue their original sources of funding. The United Nations, in a recent report, said narcotics, illegal mining and external donations remained major income streams, with the drug economy bringing in up to $400 million in 2016.

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

Must travel more often to the south of south of Delhi, it will say.Readers know than I am a bit reluctant when it comes to criss-crossing the city in search of good food. The traffic is hell and even short distances turn into marathons when you are going along with the traffic. So when friends or restaurateurs invite me to a new place in the southern parts of the city, or beyond, I tend to demur. That is why I was reluctant when invited to the Pullman Hotel in the area known as Aerocity, near the Indira Gandhi International Airport, some days ago. But I did finally go there, and had such a happy meal that I resolved to step into uncharted territories.The meal was at its pan-Asian restaurant called Honk. The dcor is cheerful and the lights are dazzling. From the ceiling hangs this enormous chandelier, with slender lights casting a bright glow over the place. Well lit restaurants lift my mood, so I saw that as a good sign.I had an interesting conversation with the two chefs  Ajay Anand, culinary director, and Deepak Malhotra, executive sous chef  about the food that they cook. The menu seeks to celebrate what is essentially the street food of Southeast and East Asian countries. And since it is a fine dining restaurant, the food is served most aesthetically, which, to my mind, always adds to the taste and flavours.It was a sumptuous meal  consisting of, among other things, Asian greens with bean sprouts and avocado, duck and sour cherry dumplings, Jade prawn har gow perfume de hen dumplings and leaf wrapped Chilean sea bass. The greens were excellent; the avocado giving a light kick to the dish flavoured with sweet sesame. The jade touch to the har gow dumplings came from some wasabi, and the casing had been pierced with a syringe filled with strong chicken stock, which was the perfume de hen that the dish promised. The fish, nicely moist, came in a delightful buttered garlic sauce.You know my fondness for pork, so its no surprise that I hugely enjoyed the Singapore style pork ribs. The pork was tender and had soaked in the flavours of Chinese five spices, star anise and Schezwan pepper. The meat had been braised for two hours over a very low flame, which helped trap all the juices and spices in it. Likewise, the Nanjing style duck had the predominant flavours of star anise and Shaoxing wine. The meat, lightly powdered with potato starch, had been flash fried on high heat  which meant the duck was crisp from the outside, and meltingly soft within.I am on and off sweets these days  well, actually I must admit that I am more on than off  but I decided that to round off what was a very satisfying meal I needed to have something sweet. I had a spoonful of the jasmine flavoured crme brulee and warm ginger cake with a blob of raspberry and ginger ice cream. The caramel chocolate and peanut parfait was perfect  sweet and just mildly salted.The dinner at Honk made me realise that there is a world out there waiting to be conquered. A wise man had said that you need to dig deep for sweet water. And you have to travel just that extra mile for a memorable meal."

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling.

The tadka also consists of dhani chilli powder, which adds to the spicy taste of the dish. The dhani or bird's eye chilli is tiny but packs a punch in terms of spiciness.

Also, The Blue Poppy's momos are as famous as its momo sauce. The extremely spicy momo sauce has a pinch of dalle chilli (from Sikkim) paste  one of the hottest chillies of the northeast known for its sting and flavour.Laal maas, which literally means red meat, is a traditional Rajasthani dish that combines royalty with hotness. Succulent pieces of lamb are cooked only with roasted dry red chillies (locally called tikha laal), pounded in desi ghee and fragrant whole spice mixture or khada masala. It isprepared in a huge handi by simmering for hours together, letting the spices penetrate the chunks of meat and allowing them to be perfectly cooked. It is indeed not for the faint-gutted!

He said now potato crop was meeting the same fate. He further said that they had demanded a minimum compensation of Rs 30,000 per acre for vegetable growers.

However, the dip is not reflecting in the Kolkata markets, with prices ranging between Rs 7 and Rs 9. So essentially, due to meddling by middlemen, potato retail price turns five times dearer while covering 60-odd kilometres from the farm to buyer.Sensing an imminent crisis, the Bengal government is set to offer minimum support price to potato farmers in the state to stop distress sale of the food crop. The department of agriculture marketing has asked 460 potato cold storages to keep 10% space reserved for government-procured potatoes.According to the agriculture marketing department, this year, a bumper potato harvest is expected in three major potato producing districts  Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura and some blocks of other districts. The potato production, this year is pegged at 1.15 crore tonne in 4,500 hectres of land, compared to 90 lakh per tonne last year. A bumper production often leads to distress sale by farmers who fear rotting of the unsold crop in the field.According to the notification (245-AM/0/4C-05/2013) dated February 23, 2017, issued by the agriculture marketing department secretary R K Sinha, on the basis of the advise of cold storage expert committee, all cold storages were instructed to reserve 10% potato storage space for government-procured potatoes. This space will be at the disposal of the district magistrate till March 21. Significantly, the cold storage will be opened on March 1, 2017, for stocking of the potato of Rabi season.Both farmers and cold storage owners welcome this move. Chintamoni Santra of Pursura, the country's highest potato producing block, said, ""This year, I had potato-farming in 1.5 bigha land, which produces 90 packets per bigha. But I had to sell some of the produce at Rs 80-Rs 100 per packet, incurring a loss of almost Rs 100 per packet. If the government buys out some part of the produce, I will be relived of a huge stress.""Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said: ""Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said farmers must not suffer and middlemen must not loot. This is why we are adopting such measures without disturbing the market equilibrium. Each Panchayat will prepare a list of potato farmers in potato producing districts.""Arijit Saha, the owner of Dhanekhali Cold Storage, feels positive about the decision. ""This will save the potato market to a great extent. A lot of farmers will have a breather. But the Panchayat must prepare the list of potato farmers on a war-footing."""

They parked their bikes on the road, bought some puffs and sipped tea before zooming at at least 80-90kmph towards Ajaynagar.Neither any cop nor a patrol car was visible in the area.""Youths on bikes assemble here. They park their bikes beside the road, lean on them and harass girls passing by. Then they start racing against each other from Ruby rotary till Patuli,"" said a resident of Abhyudoy Housing co-operative Society.Prince Anwar Shah Road Connector-EM Bypass crossing (Biker 03)Time: 11.20pm-11.40pmWhat we saw: The Prince Anwar Shah connector is one of the most favoured racing tracks for the bikers who start from Sapuipara crossing and take a sharp turn towards Patuli from Kalikapur crossing and then again take a U-turn from Ajaynagar to return to the starting point. On this route, there are at least three police checkpoints. But after 11pm, no cops are found, be it on the road or at the kiosks. TOI spotted several bikers, without helmet, speaking over phones, occasionally smoking and passing on the counter to the pillion riders while speeding at above 100kmph.""The youths drive so dangerously zigzagging past cars that I fear one of them may hit my car any time while taking sharp turns,"" said Saikat Dasgupta, a Jadavpur resident, who take the road to return home.Kamalgazi flyover (biker 04)Time: 12am-12.30pmWhat we saw: Travelling against traffic seems to be the norm on this flyover as not only bikes but even cars were found racing against traffic using the wrong flank. This is the same flyover where two teenagers, Rahul Banerjee and Payel Guha, had died after Rahul's bike hit the side rails. Payel fell 35 feet down on the road after being flung off the bridge, while Rahul was killed on the flyover itself.A week later, TOI found no cops at either end of the flyover as bikers, without helmets, sped at ease. Two SUVs were also found climbing the south-bound flank from Narendrapur end and speeding towards Garia against traffic.Deshapran Sashmal Road-Prince Anwar Shah Road (biker 06)Time: 1.30pm-2pmWhat we saw: The crossing has three shacks that remain open all night serving tea, cigarettes, Maggi and even cannabis. The stretch from Prince Anwar Shah Road till Lake Gardens has three more shops that remain open all night selling cold drinks, cigarettes, potato chips and even alcohol, albeit in hiding. TOI spotted at least four bikes parked in front of one of the shacks opposite the Tipu Sultan Mosque. Some bikers were found sitting on their two-wheelers with one of them pouring alcohol in a soft drink bottle. Another was found preparing a cannabis joint.As a car passed by with a girl stretching her head out of its window, one of the bikers whistled and said: ""Bike pe aja darling. Zyada mazaa aayega (Ride my bike darling. You will get more fun).""Two policemen were found on the other side of the road near Tollygunge Phanri leaning against chairs and occasionally dozing. But the youths are unperturbed and so are the cops."

This has brought activities of the university to a grinding halt.Talking to TOI, Jigar Patel, the chief officer of Deesa Nagarpalika, said, ""We gave them sufficient time but they failed to pay the tax dues."" The civic body had served several notices since 1987 to SDAU, he said.Sources in SDAU said that being a government institute they are exempted from paying property taxes. Patel, however, did not agree with the claim.Meanwhile, it is learnt that the university has approached the Gujarat high court against the decision by the Deesa civic body.""With the civic body's decision all activities have come to a standstill. Many research works have been affected. Now, we are left with no alternative but to seek legal recourse,"" said an SDAU official."

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced this sop to bolster Trinamool's position ahead of next year's panchayat polls, following BJP 's spectacular victory in Uttar Pradesh The decision would cost the government anything between Rs 120 crore and Rs 200 crore. ""The kharif crop has suffered, potato farmers are making distress sales. We are ready to bear the pain despite our financial constraints. Let the Centre show some gesture by waiving farm loans,"" Banerjee said after the administrative meeting held at Kharagpur on Monday.According to sources, the CM's farmland tax waiver doesn't apply to the agricultural cess that applies to all landholders irrespective of their holdings. As of now, small farmers having a holding of 4 acres in irrigated areas or 6 acres in rain-fed areas have been kept outside the agricultural tax ambit. But they have to pay agricultural cess like others. The cess is likely to continue.The salaried class may fret, but the decision sounds more political than economic. Banerjee, who has been accusing the Centre of discriminating against Bengal, has used this sop to take the wind out of BJP's sails.""I don't mind Andhra Pradesh getting a special package from the Centre. But Bengal was denied its due on the Backward Region Grants Fund (BRGF) in Jangalmahal. The Rs 1900-crore Ghatal Master Plan is awaiting the Centre's nod. Why this discrimination? Why are banks sitting on projects submitted by self-help groups? The Centre has to give money to the people, not just go on riot-mongering,"" the CM said.Banerjee said her government had covered as many as 11,000 beneficiaries in West Midnapore under several state government schemes. She also handed over the first 50,000-rupee compensation cheque to a person who lost his job and returned home after demonetisation.While announcing the sops, Banerjee wanted the people to make a promise. ""Wadah koro  danga nehi karunga (make a promise you will not take part in riots),"" the CM said in a bid to combat the saffron challenge days ahead of the Ram Navami celebrations beginning in the state from Wednesday, when Hindu religious groups are planning an armed show of strength across the state.The chief minister also took note of polarisation. ""They are using social networking to spread rumours. Can you imagine, a Union minister has been claiming that the Trinamool government has stopped mangalarati in Dakshineswar temple? I request you to cross-check facts before making up your mind,"" she said.Taking on opposition CPM that has been alleging a nexus between the state government and the Centre, Banerjee gave it back to CPM. ""CPM and BJP are hand in glove. Many CPM activists are joining BJP. Do you know why? They think they can oust Mamata Banerjee by tying up with BJP. CPM has turned out to be BJP's main advisers. Those who are CPM in the morning turn BJP at night. They won't be able to remove us as long as people are with us,"" the CM said."

In western suburbs, truckloads of onions are brought for sale. Six kg of onions are sold for Rs. 100.Wholesale traders said there had been a 20 per cent increase in the price of locally grown vegetables in the past few days. But, the cost of some vegetables such as potato and carrot remain stable.Green peas and broad beans are popular choices as they are priced in the range ofRs. 20 and Rs. 25 in the wholesale market.Normally, prices go up in December and drop after Pongal.This time, prices of vegetables remained low due to demonetisation. Drought in other places has influenced the price now. The vegetable market receives only 350 loads of produce against its normal share of 400 truckloads daily.P. Sukumar, joint secretary of Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market Merchants Association, said normally, it takes two months for fresh harvest of vegetables.The cost of locally grown vegetables received from areas in the radius of 100 km may slightly dip by mid-February.But, the severity of drought and summer may have an impact on the prices of vegetable in the coming months. There are chances for the prices to escalate by 50 per cent in April if there is not enough rainfall, he said.Vegetable crops were destroyed during cyclone, particularly in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram"

Styled much like a British gentlemans club, it is situated on the ground level at Peninsula Redpine Hotel in the busy neighbourhood of Marol, which straddles the commercial with the residential.Its pretty much mandatory to go thirsty to a cocktail tasting, especially one that requires you to stir, shake, and get down to the dirty. We are at The Stables to attend a masterclass conducted by the bars mixologists. The bar/pub is is all done up in dark wood, and antique style with eye-catching chandeliers. Photographs of famous horses like The Secretariat dot the walls along with trivia, some examples of which are: Did you know the Seattle Slew had a habit of tiptoeing before a race, a move that came to be known as the war dance, and The Secretariat had a heart, two-and-a-half-times the size of a normal horse.Mixologist James Birch, who has come from the bars Dubai outpost, begins the workshop with two cocktails. The first one is Wind Suck (Rs. 400), a vodka-based drink, with fresh cucumber, lemon juice, honey, orange juice and lemonade. It is cool, refreshing and has a prominent kick (pun-intended). Wind Suck is so named as it is what the horse does when it is happy. It sucks in wind, he says, taking another empty glass to stir Stables Grog (Rs. 300), a drink named after Franky, a famous jockey. He is an ex-Godolphine club member, one of the biggest derby clubs in the world, owned by the Sheikh of Dubai. He once requested for a rum-based drink, which he grogged in under two minutes! exclaims Birch.Play on the palateNext up is mixologist Stephan Jovanovic who whips up the Oscar sangria named after yet another award-winning derby horse. The bright blue drink has a mash-up of Merlot martini, brandy, gin and orange curaao. While the backstory and ingredients sound promising, we dont like the drink for its jumbled mess it creates on our palate, its just too dry and sour. We pay keener attention to the last drink, Cribber Ascot (Rs. 450) made with white rum, dark rum, orange curaao, orange juice, lemon juice, grenadine syrup  all of which has a smoother play on the palate.Experts Birch and Jovanovic are done showing us their skills and it is time for us to try our hand at making Stables Grog. It isnt easy as it looks  we throw in Jamaican rums, pineapple juice, lemon juice, passion syrup and Angostura bitters, topping up the mixing glass with crushed ice and give it a good shake.But shaking cocktails is hard work and we discover that we need some sustenance, which comes in the form of the perennially busy popcorn machine; Loaded Nachos (Rs. 300), guacamole, sour cream, beans and cheese, and crisp potato skins (Rs. 300) topped with cheesy. The Portobello Mushroom Burger (Rs. 325) has marinated button mushrooms and tangy tomatoes sans a patty with freshly baked bun. Highway 55 (Rs. 400) is a wholesome, cheesy baguette sandwich with pork loin, with onions and mushrooms. The BBQ chicken pizza (Rs. 450) has juicy strips of grilled chicken and sweetened red onions.Since we are not indulging in a full menu tasting, and are concentrating on the drinks, we must mention the Smooth Mouth (Rs. 700), which looks like a cold coffee. We are not fans of milk-based drinks, solely because a shoddy rendition can ruin the night. We eye this one with contempt, though one sip and we claim it a stunner: its loaded with vodka, Amaretto, Baileys, Kahlua, brandy, orange curaao, milk and fresh cream. The comfort of Amaretto, the citrus punch from orange and the creamy Bailey makes it a comforting drink likely to get repeat orders. Dessert is a wholesome brownie (Rs. 399), drizzled with a thick, caramelised toffee sauce, with a vanilla scoop melting alongside its warm companions.The Stables, Peninsula Redpine Hotel, Andheri East; 40912345"
58f55739a3d24b0b70c20249,Ear to the ground,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ear-to-the-ground/article17404927.ece,2017-03-04,"Appraising the vote:In Kalan, numerically there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. Susheela Devi (far right) stands with her neighbours in the village. (Below) An old Thakur house.R.V. MoorthyThe sprawling village of Kalan is set in 1,200 bighas of fertile land in the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradeshs Sultanpur district. An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"

Shivakumar, CEO, PepsiCo India Holdings Private Ltd., said, we have nothing to do with PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a non-government organisation].Asserting that Pepsi had been a partner of Indian farmers all along, he said sustainability had been a crucial component of its partnership with Indian farmers. Pointing to the technology support and extension programmes that Pepsi had been providing to potato growers in the country, he said the focus of the exercise was to touch the entire value chain  from input provision to facilitating financial support and product procurement. The resultant ecosystem, he said, helped farmers improve yield, get higher price and earn predictable income.Mr. Shivakumar said Pepsi would try to extend similar support to those cultivating crops such as mango. Our effort is very much aligned to the countrys big need of doubling farmers income by 2022. We continue to invest into areas which are very important to farmers, he said.Pepsi, he said, was working with close to 24,000 potato growers. We have brought in Frito Lay variety of seeds into India. Farmers have a buy-back agreement with us, and their income have gone up by 35% over the last 2-3 years, he added.Mr. Shivakumar asserted that we are water positive. In this context, he said, Pepsi had given back 12.75 billion litres of water in 2015 alone through assorted conservation and replenishment initiatives. In Tamil Nadu, especially, Pepsi was water positive by 1.5 billion litres in 2015, he added.The three manufacturing facilities it had in Tamil Nadu provided direct jobs to 3,500 people. A release claimed that PepsiCo Foundation invested $17.6 million (close to Rs. 114 crore) between 2008-2016 for programmes related to WASH (Swacch Bharat) and improved access to clean drinking water, benefiting more than four million people across the country.Tamil Nadu is one of the key markets from the point of our investments, brand stature and community initiatives, he said. His statement must be viewed in the context of a recent call for ban on sales of Pepsi and Coca Cola drinks in the state by local traders associations.Reinforcing the 3 P thrust (on people, product and planet), Mr. Shivakumar said Pepsi would fully fit into the Prime Ministers Make in India campaign even as it sought to transform its product portfolio to contain more health products. We have a vision of this. And, we have a plan as well, he said.Innovation and local tastes would be the focal point of this transformation, he said. All these would make Pepsi more than a carbonated soft drink. In this context, he asserted that the introduction of Quaker products would transform the way breakfast was taken by the Indian people."
