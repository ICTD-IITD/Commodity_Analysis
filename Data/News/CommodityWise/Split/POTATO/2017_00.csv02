With this, King Momo , the mythical king of carnivals, will declare the year's four-day carnival celebrations open on February 25. Oh, what one would give, just to head to Goa and partake in the customary grand colourful parade at Panaji, along the Mandovi river! If that ain't happening, the Goan community settled here in Pune, has a celebration of equal pomp on the cards, if not more. And the best part is, you're invited!Festoons adorn the courtyard of the 113-odd-year-old Poona Goan Institute (PGI) at Rasta Peth. Here's where the city's Goan community will meet for a weekend of fun and frolic. Back in Goa, the grand parade is led by King Momo, atop a float with his queen and entourage of subjects. Jesters, dancers, fire eaters and revellers join in the jamboree.Clint D'Souza, honorary general secretary of PGI, promises that the celebrations here will call to mind memories of home. ""There's a food festival to partake in on Saturday, where one can sample Goan traditionals (sorpotel, sannas, and the likes). Musician Denver Mascarenhas will provide us with some foot-tapping music too.""On Sunday, King Momo and his entourage will declare the carnival party open. Goa Tourism might have selected musician Roque Tome Fernandes to essay King Momo this time, but PGI will have its own king. The parade is one that's fresh out of Mario Miranda's caricatures. ""It features people you see in everyday Goa  a fisher woman, a paowalla, and a padri (priest), among others,"" says Clint, adding that it is also customary for King Momo to choose his wife from the crowd.What good is the celebration, if we don't talk about the fare? City food blogger Hilda Mascarenhas, who specialises in Goan cuisine, says, ""Back then, when fewer people attended the parade, one had the luxury of enjoying their sorpotel, vindaloo and chourico (sausage) pulao by the wayside. But with large crowds now, people prefer finger foods."" The Goans love their meat, so there's a plethora of snacks, like prawn rissoles, mackerelcroquetas and mince potato chops, one can relish off roadside stalls.But no Goenkar can do without chourico pao (pao stuffed with pork sausages). ""Made with spices, smoked and dried, it can be prepared in various ways, either a dry chilly fry, or a thick gravy, to be enjoyed with Goan pao,"" Hilda adds.The last day of the festivities, Pancake (or Shrove) Tuesday, sees the community preparing 'alle belle', melt-in-the-mouth pancakes with a sweet stuffing of Goan 'pyramid' palm jaggery and freshly grated coconut. Hilda says, ""These are enjoyed with tea throughout the year, but Pancake Tuesday is when we use all the remaining home supply of eggs, sugar and milk to make these, before the onset of Lent, a period of prayer and abstinence."""

Giving an example, he said in the sale of potato chips, the farmer is ignored whereas being the grower of the crop, he should be an important factor in this chain.The state government is following the concept of peri-urban agriculture, as he had seen in Beijing, where farmers' output meets the needs of adjoining cities.""Agricultural products, being perishable, have a short life. Therefore, the farmers must cultivate need based crops in areas adjoining cities. Emphasis is being laid on bringing 25 per cent of the cultivable area under horticulture. Apart from a modern vegetable mandi, a flower mandi is also being developed,"" he added.The minister said in milk production, Haryana is next to Gujarat and Punjab. ""But as Haryana has potential to do better, it can excel in this field by promoting dairy farming as a profession and adopting some new means,"" he said.Referring to organic farming, he cited the example of Sikkim which is now an 'Organic State' and has been honoured by the Prime Minister.Dhankar said the 400 gaushalas in Haryana can contribute towards promotion of organic farming.The concept of climate-smart agriculture or risk agriculture has already been adopted in some countries to meet the challenge posed by climate change. For instance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is an initiative to meet such challenges, he added.To a question, he said the state government is keen to set up a processing unit for horticulture crops and a mandi of frozen products to facilitate the sale of agri products in off season."

Opening up palates and experiences, savoury-styled as well as herb and spice infused flavours are redefining the conventional tastes associated with the cocoa bean. From tangy to spicy and salty, the bar of sweet goodness is now a choc-ablock with surprises as chocolatiers experiment with not-so-go-to ingredients like masala chai and black Malabar peppercorn.""The concept of savoury chocolates is like ""The concept of savoury chocolates history repeating itself as we are rediscovering the cocoa fruit, which was consumed raw and as a beverage before the 16th century . The unprocessed version was a savoury and there was nothing sweet about it,"" says Mumbai-based Zeba Kohli of Fantasie Fine Chocolate who was in Chennai recent ly for a chocolate tasting session.""The present idea of having chocolates as a savoury is a fun fad that tickles the palate and makes people inquisitive about the ingredients,"" she says.Her tryst with sambar powder was one such fun experiment for a chocolate tasting session in Bengaluru. ""People did not realise that sambar powder was used in the ganache but they were excited that the combination worked so well,"" says Kohli.To tingle the taste buds, Chenddyna Schae, owner of Bengaluru-based chocolate store Jus' Trufs, created sea salt chilli bars, cheddar cheese, and balsamic vinegar truffles. The idea is to go with one's intuition and palate into newer territories. ""Some people are pleasantly surprised and some combinations shock the system, but it creates a range that caters to different palate profiles,"" says Schae, whose white chocolate with jalapeno dip, and potato crisps with chocolate fondue have led many of her customers into the exploratory path.The Indian market is still nibbling at the edges when it comes to savouries, feel some in the industry, as most people still see a bar of chocolate as a substitute for sweets. ""In my experience, savoury chocolates have not really picked up as it has in the West. But it shows that chefs are willing to learn and people are ready to try,"" says Chennai-based chocolate taster L Nitin Chordia . In 2014, he worked with a city hotel to lay out a five course meal with chocolates, down to the drink and appetizer. ""Such events are fantastic as experiences but they are not yet mainstream,"" says Chordia.It is herb infusions like masala chai, lemongrass, cori ander and thyme which are the flavours to savour, according to him. ""These are natural inclusions and not about a shocking ingredi ent. These are off the beaten track but do not really push the envelope,"" says the owner of Cocoat envelope,"" says the owner of Cocoat rait, which holds chocolate appreciation classes and brings fine chocolates to consumers.On the spice route are young chocolatiers like Sanjoy Solomon of Bean Therapy . The Guntur chilli and Malabar peppercorn under his label provide the kick and crunch of local spices, which he agrees are experiments and risks worth to at least initiate the idea of spiciness in a largely sweet product.It's the pairing that makes the flavours distinctive and interesting, feels Kohli. ""For me, savoury chocolates work best as marinade and in beverages,"" she says. Her wasabi chocolates and peppered wafers are to be seen as palate cleansers paired with wine or a dish, which is too sweet, she adds."

We are paying out of our own pocket,"" said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.Earlier, in March, the West Bengal government announced a support price of Rs 4.60/kg for potatoes and promised to buy 28,000 tonnes of potatoes, after the state faced a similar situation.The BJP Kisan Morcha actively campaigned for the provision of a support price in West Bengal. It has, however, so far, refrained from a similar campaign in UP.""The situation is same in UP. Farmers are only getting about Rs 200 per sack for potatoes. While his expenditure on cultivation, transportation and cold storage is much more. So, the farmer is in fact suffering losses. The state must announce a support price on potatoes, just like West Bengal. Farmers have been suffering and the government has not bothered to do anything,"" said Rakesh Tikait, BKU president.""When we include all costs involved in production, the total cost comes to Rs 7 per kg. The farmer is getting only Rs 3-4 kg in the market. So, there is a huge discrepancy. The government should announce a support price of atleast Rs 10 per kg"", said Pushpendra Singh, President of the KSS.Farmers are also disappointed that while the BJP's Kisan Morcha raised the same issue in West Bengal, it has failed to do so in UP, where it is in power. ""Politics supersedes everything it seems. It is an issue for the BJP in West Bengal, but not so in UP because they are in power themselves"", said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.The BJP's Kisan Morcha on its part assured the farmers that the issue will be raised soon, and they too will demand a support price for potatoes. ""We agree that there should be a support price. We will raise the demand soon with the newly formed government"", said Naresh Sirohi, General Secretary of the BJP Kisan Morcha."

Strangely, the slide in the wholesale price failed to have any impact on retail market. The retail price rose gradually from Rs 6 to Rs 10 in some markets till Monday.Demonetisation, bumper production in states like UP and Punjab and bumper crop in Bengal collectively have left Bengal's farmers in a tight spot. The shortage of cash and excess supply have hit demand, resulting in a dip in prices. Farmers stare at a huge loss as most of them have taken loans from mahajans at a high interest rate keeping in mind the profits made in 2015-16. ""There was low yield in 2015-16. The retail prices rose up to Rs 24 per kg in city markets,"" said Gour Das of Purshura, a potato farmer, who took loan at a high interest rate and now finds it difficult to recover production cost.It's a mystery how the wholesale potato price and the retail price become inversely proportional. While the potato wholesale prices plunge, retail prices rise. Potato traders blamed the 6-tier middlemen system working between the wholesalers and retailers and higher margin of profit by a retailer as reasons for the price mismatch. On Monday, the wholesale price in Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura  three major potato-producing districts  ranged between Rs 2.5 and Rs 3. Farmers fear that if the trend continues, the prices may plunge to as low as Rs 1 per kg.There is severe shortage of cash flow in the potato market. Besides, several big businessmen, a sizeable number of teachers, government employees and professionals invest in potato. ""They buy from the farmers and put the same in the cold storage, expecting a good price at the end of the season. However, demonetisation and this year's bumper production desisted them from investing in this sector,"" said Arup Dutta, an agro-economist.""While the total potato yield in 2015-16 in Bengal was 90 lakh tonnes, this year it has shot up to 1.15 crore tonnes,"" said potato merchant Biswarup De. He said that last year both the potato merchants and cold storage owners sustained heavy loss due to demonetisation as most of the transaction in the business is done in cash.Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said, ""We observe March 14 as Krishi Diwas. The CM will address the issues and will definitely find a way out."""

""The recent example before us is the heavy losses suffered by farmers of potato and pea crops due to demonetisation,"" said Virsa Singh , who owns seven acres, while addressing a gathering at Bachiwind village on Saturday.The farmers are of the view that if there was an MSP for potatoes and peas, they would have not suffered any losses since the government was bound to purchase their produce at a fixed rate, but the situation was other way round. ""Peas were sold for Rs 15-20 per kg last year, but now they are sold for Rs 4-6 a kilo.

MDMK general secretary Vaiko, leaders of People's Welfare Front and TNCC chief S Thirunavukarasar were among those who called on the protesters on Tuesday expressing their concern at the possible impact of the project on the environment.As per the resolutions passed at the protest committee meeting on Monday, protesters held black flags in their hands on Tuesday at Neduvasal.

The total budgetary outlay showing an 8% increase compared to 2016-17 and the 11% increase last year (compared to the year before that) is also an indication that the common man will have to wait for some more months to come out of the effects of demonetisation.A case in point is the MSME sector. Mamata has been crying foul over the plight of this sector that accounts for 25% of the GDP. This happens to be the mainstay of Bengal's industry . The finance minister has lowered the effective tax on units with Rs 50-crore turnover in this sector. He has also promised credit guarantee to SME loans, raising the cap from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. However, for this, the MSME transactions have to go digital before they can get access to credit. A study by the Naitional Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), New Delhi, indicates that the demand for credit would be low post demonetisation.Next comes investment in the rural sector. Even as the agriculture ministry has been claiming that the all-India acreage figures didn't show any dip post demonetisation, ground reports from Tarakeswar, Burdwan reveal that potato acreage has suffered because the district cooperative banks didn't get enough money to disburse as loans. The finance minister has provided for a Nabard corpus of Rs 20,000 crore to finance district cooperative banks and societies so that farmers get bet ter access to loans. And in a very limited scale, Jaitley has given a tax relief of Rs 1,000 a month for the sa laried middle class who bore the pains of demonetisation for days.Chances are that the small relief may not be enough to tackle the rise in indirect tax after the Centre rolls out GST.Third, there's hardly any takeaway for the rural poor in Bengal. In a state where a total 24,250 villages don't have any bank branch, it will be a tough task for the MGNREGS workers, or those under other schemes, to avail of the direct cash transfers. ""Look at what women got from this Budget. It's even less than the allocations the Mamata government has made for Kanyashree. Worse, from now, respective states have to co-fund the railway projects,"" said Trinamool Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra sees little chance of public spending in the state's infrastructure projects. ""Budgetary allocations for capital expenditure during the last financial was 1.86% of the GDP . This time, including railways, it's 1.84%.

Union agriculture ministry's 'District-wise Estimation of Production and Area of Fruits, Vegetables and Crops in India' has revealed that Banaskantha has produced 17.10 lakh MT of potatoes, which is 9% of the total production in the country. Gujarat is followed by Agra which has produced 15.84 lakh MT of potatoes. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had lauded the farmers of Deesa for their potato yield and their progressive agricultural practices.The McAloo Tikki burger, French fries, and potato wedges  among the most beloved fast food items  all contain the delicious 'grown in Gujarat' element. Potatoes for these menu toppers come from farms of Deesa of Banaskantha district. Potatoes are sourced from farmers by McCain Foods , a Canadian multi-national. Apart from McCain, a soft drink company and a local potato chip giant have contract farming deals for potatoes in the region, which have given high returns to the farmers.According to the data, the area of sowing was the highest in Muzaffarpur in Bihar, while Banaskantha was ranked third in the country on this count with a sowing area of 52,800 hectares.In Muzaffarpur, sowing took up 85,500 hectares. However, when it comes to production, Banaskantha was leading the chart.Rajesh Shah, a farmer in Deesa, said: ""We have adapted drip irrigation and with the availability of water, the per hectare productivity has increased."" He said five years ago, the yield was around 20 tonnes per hectare. ""But for the past two years, it has increased to over 28 tonnes per hectare."" Ashish Guru , the president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , said: ""Climate in Banskantha is conducive to growing the crop. Besides, farmers here are open to changes."" He said that the district has perhaps the highest number of drip-irrigation users. ""This has not only improved the yield has also improved the quality of the crop,"" he saidThe cold storage capacity in Gujarat was boosted by approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes. This also spurred the production of potatoes."

With drought and water scarcity affecting agriculture , the going hasn't been easy. Working in the fields fetched them Rs 150 a day. Money was always short.Around 10 women, in their 20s and 30s, recently came together and founded 'ShivParvati' self-help group by registering it with Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Program (SKRDP). The idea was to supplement their income and cut down on the mounting debts. Prabhakar Naik , a resource person from SKRDP, encouraged the women to form a group and start small savings. But the women had to pinch and scrape to save even Rs 50 from their daily wages.Naik saw that Khanapur had large swathes growing sweet potato. But the farmers growing sweet potato were not doing well as the government has not fixed even a minimum support price for this vegetable. ""My job is to empower women by creating jobs for them and improve their livelihood. I thought of a part-time job for these women so that they can earn some extra money and improve their livelihood,"" says Naik.Naik advised this group to try making snacks from sweet potato and sell them.Says Ashwini Rajput, a member of this group, ""We gave it a shot and started making snacks from sweet potato. We started selling a 100 gm packet for Rs 20. Well, it clicked surprising us too. We have been getting a good response and now we have also started taking bulk orders.""The women even recently bought a small potato cutting machine for Rs 5,000 from the money they managed to save. Every evening after a hard day in the fields, the group gathers at one of the members' houses to prepare the snacks. Tulsa Chougule, another member, says that while eight of the women are involved in preparing the snacks, two of them market it. The profit earned is distributed equally among all, she adds."

And it is expected that controversial President-elect Donald Trump 's official swearing-in ceremony tomorrow is going to cause just as much furore. As he takes oath as America's 45th president, the glamour-packed event promises pomp and circumstance in the US capital like none other.The run-up to what will be one of the most watched events in recent times has seen a flurry of preparations  from top-of-the-art robust sound systems to stages, lighting, security screeners, warming tents, halls for the ball, draperies, floral arrangements and more. The celebrations are being organised around the theme 'Make America Great Again', which Trump used in his campaign. The show will kick off with the wreath-laying ceremony by Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence at the Arlington National Cemetery. Artists are set to perform on the footsteps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump is also holding three inaugural balls (Obama had 10 of them at his first inaugural). His team also hopes to keep its parade to 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration , in 1953.As per reports, Trump will be sworn-in as the 45th US President on January 20 using two Bibles, one that former President Abraham Lincoln used at his first inauguration. The other is his own, which dates back to his childhood, which his mother presented to him upon his graduation from Sunday Church Primary School at First Presbyterian Church, on Children's Day on June 12, 1955.The inauguration is clearly not going to be an average affair by any means, but one with as much glamour and hoopla that can be imagined. A report says Trump has raised a record $90 million to cover its astronomical costs, far more than President Barack Obama 's two inaugural committees.A sizeable chunk of the who's who is not going to be seen at the inauguration. As per reports, key performers have stayed away, allegedly for their own reasons or from fear of a backlash from fans. Elton John has declined. ""He will not be performing,"" affirmed his publicist. Just a month ago, John said in an interview that the prospect of a Trump presidency made him ""fear for the world."" Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli is also not performing. County singer Garth Brooks affirmed he won't be there as ""scheduling conflict kept him from performing"". David Foster, producer and 16-time Grammy winner, says he ""politely and respectfully declined,"" too. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church says she was invited to perform, but she responded on Twitter to Trump, saying. ""A simple Internet search would show I think you're a tyrant.""Massive protests are being organised all over the country against Trump. In New York, Mark Ruffalo , Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore have organised a guys' march. Scarlett Johansson , Julianne Moore, Katy Perry , Debra Messing, Frances McDormand and Amy Schumer are expected to be in a women's march. Reports say tens of thousands are also readying to hit the streets of Washington DC during his inaugural week, to show their opposition to the newly-elected president.As per a menu released by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the traditional luncheon  for Donald Trump, Mike Pence, their families, congressional leadership, members of the Supreme Court and future Cabinet secretaries  will be a three-course meal of lobster and shrimp with a saffron sauce and peanut crumble, a second course of meat with dark chocolate, juniper jus and potato gratin, chocolate souffle and cherry vanilla ice cream.Trump inauguration souvenirs are being sold in the run-up to the big day. Stores in Washington are cashing in on the drama and selling everything from Trump-chocolate bars, to baseball hats, buttons, mugs, calendars and more.He may now hold the majority vote, but Donald Trump is said to have one big lesson to learn from outgoing US President Barack Obama. British behavioural expert Judi James says Trump needs to learn to cry so as to show a warmer side to him. ""If he could squeeze one tear out during his inauguration on Friday, people will turn around quite quickly their feelings towards him. Clearly, he is going to go swanning out there with his alpha male feathers strutting, but if at the right moment he could squeeze out a tear it would have an amazing effect on people,"" said the author. Obama has shown his emotional side over numerous occasions and has wept at least 10 times on camera.The Inauguration ceremony will begin on the west front of the Capitol with musical performances. Sixteen-year-old soprano Jackie Evancho will be singing thenational anthem. The Rockettes dance troupe will also perform.Opening remarks, followed by religious leaders offering the invocation and readings. Pence will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.Trump will recite the oath of office using Abraham Lincoln's inauguration Bible, as well as the one that his mother gave to him at his Sunday School graduation. He will then deliver his inaugural address.Ceremony ends. As per tradition, Trump and Pence will attend the Congressional Lunch in the Capitol.Inaugural parade. The new President and Vice-President make their way 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometres) along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House , with bands, members of all US military branches, etc.Trump, Pence and their wives will make appearances at three official inaugural balls, two of which will be held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and the other, at the National Building Museum."

She said, ""Organic colours, made from extracts of flowers and leaves, do not have any ill-effects. However, awareness about them is limited. It is high time we shunned readymade perilous 'gulaals' and geared up for a safe and responsible Holi by smearing each other with natural colours.""While many of us are still unaware of the advantages of organic 'gulaals', old-timers claim that Holi colours were originally made of dried flower petals. Boring Road resident Meera Roy, who has memories of Holis gone by, recalled how she and her sister-in-law made natural colours at home. ""Humaare samay mein milaawat nahin hota tha... We used ingredients that were easily available in the kitchen - flour, henna, beetroot, rose petals, sandalwood, potato and turmeric - to prepare homemade 'gulaal' with a natural fragrance. In fact, there are places like Vrindavan where revellers have kept alive the age-old tradition of celebrating the festival of colours with roses and marigolds,"" the sexagenarian said and advised Patnaites to switch to organic colours this Holi."

The 58-year-old farmer is an MA English (honours) and carries out his farm operations on 40 acres of land in addition to 35 acres on lease. In 1977, he started cultivating potato and emerged as an inspiration to other farmers. Having derived inspiration from him, Goniana block of Bathinda is today known for successful potato growers.Rajinder Singh Dhaliwal, from Aabuwal village of Ludhiana, and Vinder Singh of Chathe Nanhera village near Sunam in Sangrur, were awarded with ""chief minister award"" for excellence in horticulture. A progressive farmer, Dhaliwal gave up the traditional paddy-wheat cultivation and started the grass cultivation on one acre in 2006 after seeking technical guidance from the PAU department of floriculture and landscaping, PAU.He prepared weed-free grass roll from good quality variety, which was well-accepted by the nurseries of Punjab. At present, he is earning substantially by growing grass of seven different varieties on his five acres of land in addition to 12 acres on lease.Giving up the traditional paddy-wheat cycle, Vinder opted for crop diversification. In 1996, he started the cultivation of capsicum on one acre area on lease. Thereafter, he received training in hybrid seed production from the PAU's farm advisory service centre in Sangrur. A well-read farmer with immense scientific knowledge, he started raising and selling nursery of capsicum after procuring male and female lines from PAU.The other four awardee farmers include Narinder Singh of Ajowal village of Hoshiarpur, Hardeep Singh of Kagga village in Patran tehsil of Patiala, Paramjit Singh of Pawat village in Ludhiana, Aparpal Singh Mahal of Tungwali village in Bathinda."
