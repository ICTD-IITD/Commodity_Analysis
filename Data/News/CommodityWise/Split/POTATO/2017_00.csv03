Speaking to The Hindu, States Agriculture Minister Purnendu Basu, however, said he was not unaware of any potato farmer committing suicide due to losses. Being a potato farmer is not the only reason behind someone committing suicide, he said.On Friday, potato farmer Chandan Paul (40) died after he consumed pesticide in the Memari area of Bardhaman district, following heavy losses. According to the district CPI(M) leaders, Paul was under severe pressure as he had incurred a debt of nearly Rs. 50,000 for cultivating potato on 2.80 acres of land.Last week, another potato farmer, Swapan Hajra (45), allegedly committed suicide in the Anandapur area of Paschim Medinipur districts Keshpur block .Two other farmers committed suicide in Paschim Medinipur district.Potato farmers are facing severe financial crisis this year as its prices have fallen due to high production."

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

Sure enough, this budget has done it.The subsidy bill is projected to be Rs24,000 crore, up 30% from last year. The subsidy increase has been across the full spectrum of government activities.Subsidies extended to ailing ESCOMs, which account for almost half the subsidy bill, went up by 22%. The political hot potato of making even rich Bengalureans pay more for the electricity they consume was left untouched.Food subsidy saw a massive jump of 75%. This was chiefly due to the expansion of the scope of the Anna Bhagya Scheme. A related populist move was the announcement of one Namma Canteen for each of the 198 wards in Bengaluru. This intervention will adversely impact Bengaluru's vibrant darshinis and gaadis that already cater to a variety of price points.The streak of populism entered the domain of higher education as well. Free laptops have been announced for 1.5 lakh colle ge students.Here, Karnataka has finally joined Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and other states in extending freebies at the expense of taxpayers.In spite of all these populist impulses, the budget did not abandon all sense.For one, the allocation on long-term investment grew by an admirable 29%, including healthy increases on irrigation, flood control and water supply infrastructure.The budget speech included quite a few promising announcements. A growing state like Karna taka with an increas ingly complex econ omy needs smaller administrative units to take care of local needs. A total of 49 new taluks will be carved out of the existing 177 taluks. The state has a strong history of b re a k i n g u n w i e l dy d i s tricts like the old Bangalore rural into coherent par ts, but these usually did not involve changing taluks. The new move can be transformative.Akshara Foundation, Shikshana, Pratham and other foundations having a history of working with t h e g ove r n m e n t t o i m p r ove e d u c a t i o n a l o u t comes. In an unusual m ove, t h e C M f o u n d i t worthwhile to name them as par tners. One can be cautiously hopeful of more good ideas permeating into the broken government schooling system.T he budg et seems to mention a better focus on actual learning outcomes, which is big if implemented. That apart, English will now be a subject from class 1 in government schools in the state- a step that could potentially bring far greater equity for Kannadiga students working in a 21st century Karnataka.The writers are fellows at the Takshashila InstitutionReporting by Naheed Ataullah, Sujith John, Manu Aiyappa, Rakesh Prakash, Sandeep Moudgal, Rohith B R, Sunitha Rao, Aparajita Ray, Deepika Burli, Sreemoyee Chatterjee, Arun Dev, Avik Das.

58f5f054a3d24b0b70c264eb,"In potato town, a mash of livelihood and caste matters",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/In-potato-town-a-mash-of-livelihood-and-caste-matters/article17280533.ece,2017-02-10,": It is a little past noon and scores of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers wearing saffron caps have gathered at Hariyali Bazaar, a defunct farmers complex, to attend the partys Vidhan Sabha workers meeting. As they wait for the arrival of their leader, Subrat Pathak, a prominent businessman with interests in the ittar (perfume) industry and potato storage, the karyakarta s (workers) list their grievances against the Samajwadi Party leaders in the constituency.If the SP promoted the sale of illicit liquor, encouraged bribery and neglected the districts cottage industries, it was also accused of land grabbing, hooliganism and promoting Yadavvad  a reference to the partys alleged favouritism to the Yadav caste. The reserved seat, Kannauj Sadar, falls under the Lok Sabha constituency of Dimple Yadav, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. The incumbent MLA, Anil Dohre, is from the SP, making it a prestige seat for the ruling clan.The MP [Dimple Yadav] comes here thrice in five years, and then too meets only a select few from her coterie, not the common people. The MLA is also missing, BJP Kannauj vice-president Vikram Tripathi says.Apart from these criticisms, there is one issue every BJP worker at the meeting refers to: the communal violence that erupted in the densely populated locality of Lakhan Tiraha during the Durga Puja procession in October 2015. Two people were killed in the violence, which led to a curfew. Some BJP leaders were arrested or named in the FIR. Pathak was himself accused of instigating the violence.Memories of violenceThe BJP claims the SP (Samajwadi Party) government falsely implicated its leaders to appease Muslims and that they would protest the injustice meted out to them for speaking up for Hindus. Innocent people were implicated in the case while the main accused are patronised by the SP. We will raise a fight against this injustice, Mr. Pathak told The Hindu , as he arrived to take the stage. In 2014, he lost the Lok Sabha polls by fewer than 20,000 votes against Dimple Yadav.The BJP is relying on inciting the memory of that incident. Though locals make passing references to the communal incident, as one travels across the constituency, there is little resonance for it among the people. Everything is peaceful today. It is not an issue, says Rohit Joshi, a sweet shop owner who lives in the heart of the troubled area.The issues more relevant to this seat appear to be development, caste polarisation  mostly targeted against the Yadavs  and the impact of demonetisation. If the SP is relying on holding on to its support based on the goodwill earned by the Yadav family, development work and privileged treatment received by the constituency under Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP is hoping for an anti-Yadav polarisation among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and the upper castes, and for Mr. Modis appeal to pull it through.The BSP is hopeful that the search for better law and order would push voters, including Brahmins, towards it, so that its core Dalit vote gets supplemented, and that it makes a dent among the Muslims.No single issueThere is, however, no singular issue that might affect voting. Demonetisation has upset the districts famous potato farming sector  20 varieties of the tuber are grown here. But its bearing on voting is hard to ascertain.Hansi Devi, member of the Kashyap OBC caste, is collecting red potatoes from her field. She complains that the produce on her 13 bighas of land post-demonetisation was halved  the harvest falling from 80 sacks to 40 a bigha. There was not enough cash to buy seeds and urea. So is she waiting to teach the BJP a lesson? Not really. She rejects both Ms. Mayawati (She does not listen to anybody and works for her caste.) and Mr. Akhilesh Yadav (Under the SP, we face the dadagiri of Yadavs.)A few feet away, a fellow caste member, young Ram Kashyap, a farm labourer, has different views.  Notebandi has crippled us. Akhilesh Yadav is the best for farmers. The farmer wants electricity and water supply  he has given it all. If farmers have money, we get paid, Mr. Kashyap says.Traders bore the brunt of demonetisation. Many of the 110 cold storages here were forced to throw open their potatoes to rot as traders had no money to purchase them. It felt like we were punished for a sin, says Nurul Hasan Siddiqui, who suffered losses of Rs. 12 lakh.Siddiquis community, along with the Yadavs, is the fulcrum of the SPs support here. By and large, Muslims across the belt continued to express faith in the cycle, but there were a few differing voices. Significantly, Siddiqui, a former SP district head, is one among them. He is unhappy that Akhilesh Yadav overthrew his father Mulayam and promoted political novices among Muslims to shield his failures.The SP has won Kannauj for the last three terms. The BJP won the previous three before that  1991, 1993 and 1996."

Locals, meanwhile, said over 20 to 30 people could still be under the debris but the possibility of finding more survivors at the site appears bleak as a huge pile of debris is affecting the pace of rescue operations.DM Kaushal Raj Sharma, however, said that the police will investigate the offence, which will soon be registered against the owner-contractor duo.

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

The roof that once reeked of moisture and rain, is replaced now with an open cemented terrace that housed the marriage party of his daughter a few months ago. It was a distant dream for the family not very long which came true, thanks to Agra-Lucknow Expressway.When the government acquired around 12 bighas of Jaiveer's land what he and his family got in return was close to Rs 3 crore, and the tag of becoming a crorepati farmer in the small village. And, with money, came not just the house and the marriage, but also a tractor, two motorbikes, a car, a potato trading unit in Kanpur and land bought in another part of the district, all adding to the family's assets. It's, however, not just Jaiveer, but other farmers like Raghuvir and Pyaare Lal who have all earned the distinction of becoming millionaires because of the compensation that the expressway has brought""Pehle bas jaise taise khane peene ka kharcha nikal aata tha, ab hum crorepati hain. (Earlier, we would barely make ends meet, and now I am a crorepati),"" said Jaiveer. ""We are still the same people though,"" he quickly added.The family spent around Rs 5 lakh on the daughter's marriage, sending her off with all possible gifts that the villagers would have only dreamt of. ""The fridge and washing machine, double bed and other furniture that we gave her on the wedding, wouldn't have been possible earlier,"" said Asha Devi, his sister-in-law.Farmers Pyaare Lal and his brother Munshi Lal who live in Rata Purwa under Behrin Panchayat also joined the crorepati club overnight with over Rs 1 crore they received for their 7-8 bighas of land, that fell right on the highway curve. The family bought more land, a plot for a house and spent quite a sum of money on the treatment of one of their sons who met with an accident. ""One of my sons wanted to get into the police but was falling short since I could not put him in a good coaching and training centre due to lack of money. With the sum we got, he has now finally entered the police services and is posted in Fatehpur,"" said Pyaare Lal with pride.Another farmer, Raghuvir, from Rata Purwa had for the past two years been thinking of marrying off his daughter but borrowing a sum of Rs 4 lakh would have been too high a loan to take care of. Suddenly, the expressway came in and Raghuvir breathed a sigh of relief when his family was compensated for 16 bighas of land for a sum of over Rs 1 crore as the rate here was less as compared to Jaiveer's village.""Itni achhi shaadi na kar pate. I married her with the choicest of gifts that I had wanted to give my daughter. The wedding party was a big one with over 150 people from the grooms' side alone and the entire village still remembers it,"" he said. Not just the marriage, Raghuvir spent the money in buying more land, keeping his farming intact and also got a new house made."

About 86.68 lakh of them are estimated to have taken crop loans from banks and they would be benefited.""Reiterating the government's position, Singh said no officer would be allowed to act ""over-zealously"" while enforcing the law, and anyone found doing so would be taken to task. The government isin letter and spirit, Singh said.Reacting to the Cabinet decisions, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav accused the Yogi government of cheating the farmers.""This is not what the BJP had promised. It had promised to write off farmer loans and never spoken about any limit,"" he tweeted minutes after the waiver was announced.Replying to Akhilesh, power minister Shrikant Sharma said the BJP government was working towards fulfilling its poll promises but the opposition is habituated to being critical.Sharma also said anti-Romeo squads were doing good work and have been praised by all. Officers have been directed not to harass couples or ask for their identity cards, else strict action would be taken against them, he said.Clarifying on crop loans, Sharma said any farmer who has taken loan for pesticides, wheat, paddy, fertilizer and seeds would benefit.An eight-member committee under chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar has been formed to prepare the crop loan waiver scheme.The panel, also comprising heads of various departments like finance, agriculture besides the co-ordinator of state-level bankers committee, would work out the modalities of the waiver scheme after examining all relevant aspects. The government would finalise the financing arrangements based on the recommendations of the committee.The government's decision to purchase wheat in first phase up to 40 lakh metric tonne with a target of purchasing up to 80 lakh metric tonne is significant, it plans to do so through 5,000 wheat purchase centres.""If needed, these numbers could be increased,"" Sharma said, adding that over and above the MSP of Rs 1,625 per quintal, the government has also decided to give an additional Rs 10 per quintal as transportation and loading charges to farmers.The government decided to form a committee headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato farmers produce could be utilised so that they continue to grow it regularly. Other members of the panel include agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi and forest and horticulture minister Dara Singh Chauhan.Similarly, a committee headed by Deputy CM Dr Dinesh Sharma would visit other states to study their industrial policy before a new industrial policy is formulated in the state. Other members of the committee are Satish Mahana, Shrikant Sharma, Rajesh Agrawal and Nand Gopal 'Nandi'.A committee has been formed to study ways to check illegal mining. It would be headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and would have Suresh Khanna and Dara Singh Chauhan as members. The committee would submit its report in a week time, Sharma said. The Cabinet thanked the Central government for giving statutory power to National Backward Commission."
58f6cb917be9e031f13bbf23,UP polls: Note ban dents BJP in urban pockets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-polls-note-ban-dents-bjp-in-urban-pockets/articleshow/57106597.cms,2017-02-12,"AGRA: Demonetisation, farmer distress and poor living conditions notwithstanding, people of Agra are hopeful. And if the 'silent voter' does, indeed, exist, her voice may only be heard when the election voting machines beep in agreement with their choices.In Agra's nine assembly constituencies, it's hard to predict the electoral verdict. It is, however, almost certain that the BJP that is the chief challenger in almost every constituency in the district. And while some are vocal in their support, many are open in voicing their dissent. A Dalit farmer in Agra Rural reserved constituency, Govind Singh said, ""In 2014, we voted for Modi ji in the hope of seeing our fortunes rise. This time, though, I will not vote for him. That's because he did nothing for the farmer. In fact, with demonetisation, he hurt us badly.""Singh might have gone on about how the farmers are now looking for alternatives in the Rashtriya Lok Dal, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party but for the arrival of Chaudhary Phool Singh, an upper caste Jat. Singh arrives with a pack of young strongmen from the village. And from this point onwards, the Jats outshout the Dalits, and the conversation turns in favour of the BJP The Dalit now fall silent.In faraway Etmadpur, the opposite end of the Agra district, the Yadav voter is similarly silenced by the dominant Thakur voices in Barhan village. Here, the upper caste voters are divided in their support for BJP and the local BSP candidate Dharam Pal, who enjoys considerable goodwill in the constituency. Etmadpur is a traditional BSP seat where the BJP is usually never a contender. When former village head Shyambabu Tyagi alleges the incumbent UP government led by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has done nothing to ease the farmer distress in the potato belt, Pappu Yadav, a corner tea stall owner, says he received a cheque of Rs 750 when he lost his crops to a severe drought two years ago. Soon after, Yadav is surrounded by a group of naysayers in the village. Outshouted and outnumbered, he falls into an embarrassed silence. A local stringer, a bystander to the debate, says: ""Oonchi jaat waley bolne nahi dete. Waise yahan BSP jeetegi kyonki candidate accha hai. Lekin hum pe pressure hai (BJP se)...thoda help karneki.""If the BJP's traditional support in urban pockets is eroding, the saffron party is making up by making inroads into the rural terrains where it has not usually held sway. Though there is a dent in popularity in the BJP graph in comparison to the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, people are still hoping that the promise of ""acche din"" will bear fruit, especially if the BJP wins Uttar Pradesh. ""Agar aloo ke daam girte hain, to Modi ji ki kya galti hai? Yahan to aloo ke kisan hames ha hi pareshaan rehire hain,"" says Ajay Pal Singh, insisting that demonetisation has had no impact of farmers' fortunes."

The auditorium broke into applause each time the cricket icon's name was mentioned.A smartly dressed Dhoni, who is also the brand ambassador of the state, sat in the front row, next to Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) chairman Naveen Jindal . Jindal, known to be a sports aficionado himself, clicked a selfie with the cricketer and tweeted it from the stage.The former captain also found his fans among foreign and Indian business delegates. Harinder Sidhu, Indian-origin Australian High Commissioner to India, rained her praises on the ace cricketer.""The relationship between India and Australia is incomplete without cricket,"" Sidhu said in her address. ""Since we have him (Dhoni) here, I cannot help but mention about the Test match to be played between India and Australia in Ranchi in March. Ranchi will host a Test match for the first time,"" Sidhu said.Amid all the praises, the country's the former captain spoke ""not as a cricketer or a celebrity, but a boy who was born and brought up in Ranchi"". While speakers spoke of the state's mineral reserves, Dhoni highlighted that Jharkhand was ""number two (in India) in peas and potato production"".""Jharkhand was pitted on paper to be the most promising state when it was formed,"" the cricketer said, putting the onus on political instability for sloppy economic and social development. Borrowing his experiences from the cricket pitch, Dhoni said a ""captain was as good as his team"" before calling on everyone present at the auditorium to partner in the state's development. ""At times, people talk about security. I will say security is at par with any other state. My views and feelings are that of a boy born and brought up here and not that of a cricketer or a celebrity,"" Dhoni remarked.

Speaking to TOI, she said that Sidhu did not show any concern for the people of Amritsar who sent him to Parliament repeatedly .I think Navjot Singh Sidhu has been acting in `Laughter Challenge' and `Comedy Nights' for so long that he has made a mockery of himself. He even didn't bother about the party that gave him so much of respect and twice made him an MP. Not only did he not bother to attend Parliament but also didn't do anything for the people of his constituency . I think his lack of loyalty is highlighted by the fact that he could neither be loyal to his party nor he could be loyal to his godfather who brought him into politics.This is someone who can't be loyal to his own people and goes shopping for a post.Goes looking for whosoever will get him the biggest discount for the highest post.Sometimes he is seen joining AAP but when he is not promised the chief minister's post he drops it like a hot potato and goes shopping to the next party . And now, just 20 days before elections, he is arriving in Amritsar. I think he is not concerned about his people.When he was made an MP , he had his own government at the Centre. He had his party's government in the state. It was a golden opportunity to serve the people but I think his intentions were not to serve. That is why he ran away from the chance to work.AAP is acting like B team of the Congress in Punjab. AAP and the Congress are only concentrating on who they are fielding against Parkash Singh Badal, Sukhbir and Bikram. They are not concerned about who they are putting up against each other. AAP is posting its weakest candidates against the Congress, which is also going all out to support it. These two parties have done everything to disturb the peace and harmony of Punjab. They have got in touch with radicals to ensure all kinds of disturbances. Clearly, they are playing a friendly match to defeat Akali-BJP combine in Punjab.Someone who calls himself a fauji (soldier) but as soon as he sees a General in front of him, he runs away from the battlefield like a coward. He is not going to Lambi, he is running away from Patiala."

In Melbourne, they are racing at nearly 16 percent.The feverish pace of price increases prompted APRA to announce measures asking banks to limit new interest-only loans to 30 percent of total new mortgages, from 40 percent now. It also demanded that banks limit investor credit to ""comfortably remain below"" a previously set cap of 10 percent annual growth.""This latest step is a tactical response to current market conditions - we can and will do more, or less, as conditions evolve,"" he said at an industry conference in Sydney.""Our role in the current environment is to promote a higher-than-normal degree of prudence - definitely by lenders and, ideally, also borrowers - in both credit decisions and balance sheet strength.""Just this week, Australia's corporate watchdog joined the fray, introducing a new round of industry surveillance to ensure banks and brokers were not recommending overly expensive interest-only loans to customers.The measures come as regulators grow increasingly worried about a run-up in borrowing at a time when household debt is already at record highs, risking a damaging pullback in home prices.Australian banks are among the world's most profitable lenders with strong capital levels. They emerged out of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed and regulators want to ensure they remain safe.Banks have largely welcomed the recent measures.""I don't think any of us want to see house prices going backwards but more a leveling off of the trajectory would be a good thing,"" said Catriona Noble, Managing Director, Retail, ANZ. ""The 30 percent cap is good and... we can manage that.""""UNQUESTIONABLY STRONG""APRA was also looking at bolstering capital levels to ensure major banks are ""unquestionably strong"" to withstand a repeat of the global financial crisis. It had held off a decision on implementing new measures until an agreement was reached in Basel for global lenders. Although Basel has now extended its deadline APRA is pushing ahead.""It is important to remember that neither we nor the banking industry has stood still in the meantime,"" Byres said.""Without clarity as to a deadline for an agreement in Basel, we have decided it does not make sense to wait any longer to deal with the question of 'unquestionably strong'.""Byres expects APRA to announce new capital rules by mid-2017 and analysts say it is increasingly likely the watchdog will introduce tighter rules on assessing mortgage risk.""We believe a combination of macro prudential measures and higher risk weights could be viewed positively by APRA, the central bank and the government,"" said Richard Wiles, analyst at Morgan Stanley.""Higher capital requirements and slower investor property loan growth would enhance financial stability,"" Wiles said, while higher mortgage rates for property investors ""may remove the case for RBA rate hikes.""On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held interest rates steady at a record low 1.50 percent for the eighth straight month.(Reporting by Jamie Freed; Writing by Swati Pandey; Editing by Richard Pullin & Shri Navaratnam)"

The rate for storing one bag of produce (50kg) has gone up from Rs 80 to Rs 100 per bag in the past six months in Bathinda district. Now, the cold stores are asking farmers to pay Rs 20 per bag as advance too.The arrivals of fresh potato crop are expected to start in the first week of March. At present, potato is fetching a price of Rs 2 to 2.4 per kg with a 50 kg bag going for Rs 100-120.Bathinda has 35 cold storages with a capacity to stock up nearly 32 lakh bags of 50 kg each or around 1.6 lakh tonnes. Potato has been grown over 6,500 hectares in Bathinda and nearly 1.65 lakh tonnes of output of is expected in the district in the current season, which is the highest after the Doaba region.Though the state horticulture departments manages the potato cultivation, due to no minimum support price (MSP) it can't ensure higher rates from the market for the farmers. Even the rent of cold stores was fixed either under the Central Cold Storage Order, 1980, or the acts enacted by the state governments. Punjab had abolished the control on tariff fixation in 1994.""Earlier, demonetisation badly hit potato growers. With the cash flow diminishing from the market during November-December, the crop was not being sent to other states and farmers had to sell their produce in local markets at lower prices. The losses now mount further with the new crop also not fetching good rates and the cold store owners exploiting the growers,"" said Harcharan Singh Dhillon, a potato grower from Kararwala village near Rampura Phool sub-division of Bathinda. He has sown in potatoes over 200 acres. Rampura sub-division is the biggest producer of potatoes in the Malwa region.Another farmer from Kararwala Jaspal Singh said, ""The potato growers are failing to get bookings in the cold stores even after getting ready to pay more than the previous year. Most of the cold store owners are saying the space has already been booked by the traders."" He said the cold store owners had joined hands to make money by exploiting farmers.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon, however, denied any exploitation of the farmers. Iqbal said, ""Due to the hike in electricity rates, we are bound to make nominal increase in the storage rates. We are not saying no to any potato grower if we have space. Our cold store has the capacity of 80,000 bags. In the whole district, the cold stores have the capacity to store 30-32 lakh bags and nearly this much potato is produce already in the area.""Bathinda deputy director of horticulture Gurkewal Singh Dhillon also said that demonetisation had its impact on the crop and potato was not fetching the desired rates even now. ""We are taking up the issue with the cold store owners to get space for every farmer at reasonable rates.""The deputy director admitted that cold store owners had increased rates for storing potato. ""It seems tough for farmers to pay and we are trying to settle the issue,"" he said."

Punjab produces good quality potato seeds which are sold across the country.""No traders is coming to purchase the fresh crop and prices have nosedived in local mandis. In November, when potato seeds were to be supplied, demonetisation came. Farmers from West Bengal, which was the main market to be catered at the time, had no cash and the growers and suppliers here refused to sell on credit. Even according to conservative estimates, over four lakh bags (50kg per bag) were left in the stores in Punjab,"" said Inderdeep Singh Grewal, a major potato grower from Saraba village near Ludhiana. ""I too suffered big loss in November despite owning a cold storage,"" he added.""In November, several small growers had already sold most part of their produce and the middle and big producers were badly hit. However, this time, it's theses small growers who are worst hit as they sell their produce directly in the local mandis and don't have financial capacity to store,"" said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.""Most of the trading of potato crops is done in cash. Now traders are wary of making all transactions through banks,"" Sangha said. ""People are worried as to how would they return the crops loans,"" he added.""In Jalandhar, farmers had to sell potato at Rs 2 to 3 per kg which did not even make up the cost incurred on producing it leave aside its transportation or other charges like labour,"" Sangha said. ""We are considering to launch some protest or agitation to expose that how demonetisation has hit the farmers,"" he added.Grewal pointed out that the last two - three seasons were good for potato and the area under the crop also increased. ""This time production is good and if things don't improve a major part of the produce would simply left to be rotten,"" he said.Kala Sanghia-based potato grower Gurminder Singh, a middle-level grower, said that farmers were now striving to recover their costs only and even that seems to be an uphill task.""We don't have any money to sow maize crop and have no money to pay the land owners whose lands we have taken on annual contract,"" said Nawan Pind-based small farmer Mandeep Singh.

Kaustubh belongs to Vadodara, Gujarat, while Mohit is from Uttar Pradesh. A peeved Kaustubh told Pune Mirror, ""As I am a Gujarati Brahmin, I do not eat non-veg food. I never expected this kind of an experience at such a prominent restaurant, that too, during Navaratra, I was served a non-veg dish with pork. In fact, the restaurant served us the bill as well for the dish, which we hadn't even ordered. Both of us are law students, so we wanted to take legal recourse. We contacted student activist Pranay Ajmera and he suggested that we approach the consumer forum and file a complaint."" Both filed a complaint with the consumer forum on Monday.According to the police complaint, ""They went to the German Bakery Wunderbar on March 30 (Thursday). They ordered veg lasagna and hot chocolate for dinner, but were served a German Potato and Bacon Salad instead, by the restaurant's waiter. After having a bite, Dighe realised that the dish was not vegetarian. Soon after, a waiter came to their table again and served their original order. When they asked the waiter about the previous dish, he replied that it was non-veg and that they were served the wrong dish.""Shocked, they dialled 100 and called the police. ""The police took us to the Deccan police station and we lodged a complaint. The cops also called the restaurant manager and asked him to clarify the matter,"" Kaustubh said. Friend Mohit added, ""When we asked the manager, Gaurav Baraskar, about the issue, he misbehaved with us and replied arrogantly. That's when we called the police. When we asked Baraskar to give us a written apology, all he wrote was that the order was wrongly served.""When Mirror contacted Gaurav Baraskar, he said, ""I was not present in the restaurant at that time. A new waiter had served them a non-veg dish by mistake. The police called me and I gave them my statement.""

'What might be people in places that are conflict-inflicted, war prone or do not have enough food surviving on?' Her thoughts led her towards a new project named Starvation Cookbook, a series of recipes that aren't like anything you might ever get to taste, unless thrown into a situation of extreme living conditions. Karolina, who was recently at Kochi Biennale , staged her performance 'Hunger is/isn't an object,' documenting 14 instances of extreme starvation from across the world.Bread baked out of bark flour, cookies from mud, potato peels, black sugar, grass and water mixed with petrol, jelly made from carpenter's glue, water and salt soup eaten by residents in Syria... the taste of all these dishes are unique, as they represent hunger. 'Their purpose is not nourishment, but survival. And, a lot of people on famine belts and warzones in our world survive on them on a daily basis,"" says Karolina.Ask her what prompted her into taking up such a project and she says, ''Probably my interest in cooking. This thought struck me especially at a time when I was going through a phase in which I wasn't happy enjoying the space of an artist. I found respite in cooking, and exploring various recipes. On one such day, a thought about people who are famished, especially in areas where hunger is artificially created through wars and conflicts, struck me and I began my research on it. Starvation Cookbook is the result of the same,"" she says.According to her, what makes all human being equal is the fact that we have to consume our daily share of food for survival. An empty plate can reflect problems around the world quite well, she says. ""My project explores the condition of extreme hunger, the political or economic reasons for it and the survival mechanisms and sustenance measures adopted by local communities. It is something you can find everywhere. For example, if you go to a fancy Indian restaurant in London, you might find the most top quality dish  but the country would definitely have some unique recipes which the poor there would have been surviving on, for years together. For instance, take the case of kanji  which is quite tasty for a change and helped many in Bengal and Kerala survive at hard times,"" she says.With Starvation Cookbook, Karolina hopes to reveal the bitter differences between the taste of war, collectivization and inflation. ''It will get us closer to a notion of what the 'world food' really means,'' she signs off."

58f6df5c7be9e031f13bd430,Varanasi appeals to stomach and soul,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/varanasi-appeals-to-stomach-soul/articleshow/57712478.cms,2017-03-19,"Every year Varanasi plays host to thousands of tourists hoping to discover their spiritual side. That has been the temple town's calling card and commerce. But foodies know that Varanasi's crowded streets and bylanes are also avenues of gastronomic delights. Many famous hawkers appear with their pushcarts in the evening. Some don't even have a signboard. Hygiene isn't their forte. But their offerings -- golgappas, rasedar pakoras, lassi - are addictive and available at a price that would buy you only a snigger in a city like Delhi.Quality street food, to anybody who pursues it like an obsessive lover, isn't just about feeling good. The best snacks take you into an unchartered zone where the taste buds groan with delight. It's like discovering an unknown erogenous zone. In their own way, the street-side hawkers of Varanasi are everyday artists in the business of producing and peddling pleasure.You might get that kind of feeling wolfing down Lalman's golgappas, or paani puris, sold from a handcart in a bylane near Lahurabir Chowk. What makes them irresistible isn't the tangy tamarind water but the filling, a slushy mix of chickpea, boiled potato and spices. He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert. Like most golgappa sellers in the city, the stuff he serves is customized to the amount of spicy heat your tastebuds can handle. Varanasi is a city of paan eaters. A long-lasting love affair with the paan makes a tongue hypersensitive to spice. This is primarily due to the use of chuna (lime), an essential ingredient for paan; hence the adjustment.Like Lalman, there are several other artistes of the palate strewn across the city, which is now Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Lok Sabha constituency. One of the go-to places for breakfast is the late Chhanni Devi's, who sold puri-sabji and jalebis from a rundown shop in Lanka area, near BHU. Popularly known as ""Chachi"", she showered abuse on customers asking her to hurry up; the customers, in turn, were addicted to her rantings.Among the famous who graced the place was superstar Rajesh Khanna. The sabji served with the puri is made of pumpkin, potatoes and black gram. There is a rhythm with which her son Kailash Yadav flattens and shapes the dough before it is deep-fried, twice. The shop opens at 3.30 am. ""We start serving jalebis by 5 am and puri-sabji by 6. By 11.30 am, we are through,"" he says. A plate of four puris and sabji costs Rs 24.Adjacent are three shops selling lassi, all run by sons of Panna Sardar who ran the legendary original Pehalwan lassi. This is the third generation in the business. Lassis, with a dash of malai and saffron on top, are sold in clay cups. Some are so thick you almost need to chew.A kulhar (clay cup) of lassi is about beauty in minimalism. No frills; just the best of natural ingredients: curd made of buffalo milk, sugar and a hint of rosewater or saffron. It's part of the city's living heritage, created and consumed every day, sustained by a commitment to tradition. Places like these created a popular expression called 'Lanketing', going specifically to Lanka for snacks.Then there's Pappu's, the legendary tea stall in Assi mohalla that serves milk and lemon tea. The political gyan is free. The lemon tea here is flavoured with Hajmola, giving it a distinct whiff of heeng (asafoetida).There's much more. Near Lahurabir Chowk stands Jwala Prasad 's push cart selling rasedar pakora made of gram flour (besan), spinach and spices. The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then it's served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant generally laced with sweets.At Chetganj, Umashankar Sahu's family has been selling kachoris for three generations. As a peddler, Sahu has the smallest of stands where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Varanasi is also famous for its sweets to which the city's Bengalis have also made a singular contribution. Shops with signs of desi and Bengali mithai can be seen. Some shops located around Pucca Mohal area along the ghats, sell their stuff only between 7 pm to 2 am. On offer are sweets suggestively named: Palangtod (Bed-breaker) and Malaipuri.One has deliberately avoided referring to the iconic Kashi and Deena Chat Bhandars at Godowlia Chowk which are more established joints. Crowds, including tourists, throng to Deena for a taste of their tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kullars. In the winter, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage.Sometimes one wonders why food doesn't figure in the narrative of the holy city. Is it because it is primarily a business of yadavs and baniyas, who don't figure high in the city's intellectual story? There is no simple answer.What one does know is that there is a self-confidence to Varanasi; the way it looks at life, culture, and itself. The eternal city seems to stand a little above everything it surveys. There is a rhythm to its existence that's yet unspoiled by the ravages of time. And food is an inseparable part of it."

Locals alleged that as per the initial plan, the proposed railway track was to be constructed about 200 metres away from the pond. But the plan was changed at the behest of TMC leaders and now the rail track will pass through the pond, they alleged.Railway officials and TMC leaders denied the allegation.A senior Railway official involved with the project told The Hindu that the pond covers an area of about 17.40 acres out of which three acres have been acquired by the State government on behalf of the Railways and handed over to it in 2012.He said a section of villagers who refused to accept the compensation cheques were fuelling the agitation. Of the 283 villagers who were eligible for compensation, about 83 refused to accept cheques and are now opposing the project, he said.The related rail route between Tarakeswar in Hooghly district and Bishnupur in Bakura district covers a distance of 82.50 km and was conceived between 1999 and 2000 during Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees tenure as the Railway Minister.During the Singur land agitation, unwilling farmers led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee demanded that their 400 acres (out of the 1,000 acres acquired for the Tata Motors factory) be returned to them.Economic boycottVillagers alleged that for the past two weeks they have been subjected to economic boycott by local TMC leaders. They [TMC leaders] have threatened nearby shopkeepers not to sell anything to us. It is at the behest of TMC goons that local potato merchants have stopped buying potatoes from us. One of the leaders of the agitation, Sukumar Roy, has been slapped with a false case and is in jail for a month, a local said.The locals further alleged that the TMC had created an ambiance of terror to such an extent that students fear for their safety while going to school.Fish farming in the pond is one of the key sources of earning for the villagers. It is also the main source of irrigation for us, said a village resident. He said they were expecting a large-scale attack by TMC but will not back down.However, Superintendent of Police, Hooghly, Sukesh Jain said the situation was now under control.Local TMC MLA Manash Majumdar (Goghat Assembly constituency), whom the villagers have accused of terrorising the area, dubbed the allegation baseless. It is a project of the Railways. I cannot understand why the villagers are dragging our party into it, he said.Houses attacked by TMCMeanwhile, residences of three CPI-M leaders of Goghat area were allegedly attacked by TMC cadres on Monday evening for according moral support to the agitation. Not only did they attack our houses, but one of our party leaders, Tarak Biswas, has been arrested in a false case of possessing illegal arms, a local CPI-M leader Bhaskar Roy said."

Speaking to The Hindu, State Agriculture Minister Purnendu Basu said he was unaware of any potato farmer committing suicide in Bengal due to losses.On Friday, a potato farmer Chandan Paul (40) committed suicide by consuming pesticide at Memari in Bardhaman district. Locals said that following heavy losses in farming, Paul consumed pesticide last Wednesday and was admitted to a district hospital. He died this past Friday.

While last year potatoes sold at the rate of Rs. 550 per 50 kg, this year it has gone down to Rs. 200 per 50 kg."
