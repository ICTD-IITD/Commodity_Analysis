He predicts that the demonetisation will hit the economy quite drastically. In an interview with Suvojit Bagchi at his home in Santiniketan, which he visits every winter, Professor Sen spoke about the motives and impact of the move.Weve seen the primary impact of the demonetisation: long queues outside banks and shortage of cash. Now we are seeing the secondary impact, which is on the informal sector. Potato sowing in West Bengal is affected and some other businesses are collapsing. What could be the impact of all this?What you are calling the secondary impact shouldnt at all be surprising since the availability of money plays a very big part in facilitating business and trade. Particularly for small businesses (farming, for example), money is often used in the form of cash. In the long run, cashless transactions can perhaps be made into routine practice, through organisation and training, but that would take time. To act on the presumption of instant learning and institutionalisation is to place the hard-earned interests of many people without any connection to black money in serious risk.Most of what we now call cash is actually promissory notes, the emergence of which reflected a big advance over relying only on precious metals (like gold and silver). Promissory notes played a significant part in building up the financial backbone of industrial Europe. If in the 18th or 19th century, Britain had been demonetised suddenly, it would have devastated British industrial progress.Given the underdevelopment of electronic accounts and transactions, big parts of the economy are similarly vulnerable. For many, especially among the poor, making efficient and correct use of electronic payments and receipts would remain difficult to master and the possibility of losing ones money would be hard to avoid, especially given the shortage of infrastructure and the slowness of learning in using cashless transactions. The perplexing question is why some people  those who gave us demonetisation  did not foresee that this would happen and even more perplexing is how the promoters of demonetisation can be so blind even now to the overwhelming evidence of a crisis.Why has over 85 per cent of cash suddenly been taken out of circulation?The Government of India seems to have been caught in a confusion of purposes. Demonetisation has been seen both as a way of catching and eliminating black money, and as a way of moving towards a cashless economy. The former has gradually been replaced in the rhetoric of the government by the latter, which is not surprising as demonetisation can make only a very small contribution  at a huge social cost  to the black money problem. This is because only a very small proportion of black money (it is estimated to be 6 per cent or so, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. Most black money is in the form of precious metals and other assets in foreign accounts. The inconvenience and loss imposed with no black money (workers earning wages; small businesses doing trade or production; people, even housewives, keeping small savings) are much more acute than any benefit from catching relatively small amounts of black money. There are going to be huge job losses too, and the recent reports by All India Manufacturers Organisation are beginning to show that serious job losses are already happening as a result of what Londons Financial Times has called a dramatic drop in business in the 34 days since Narendra Modi announced his plan to scrap 86 per cent of its banknotes.The unrealistic governmental expectation that the black money problem can be solved, or largely removed, by demonetisation soon became clear even to the government. Then the initially trumpeted objective of getting rid of black money through demonetisation was suddenly changed into a very different objective  to leap rapidly into a cashless society. However, for such a structural change, much more time is needed, and the draconian measures  penalties installed in the hope of catching black money  are particularly ill-suited. The result has been a combination of chaos and widespread suffering rather than an orderly transition to a cashless society.Do you think there are political reasons behind the demonetisation move? The elections are coming up, so that may have been one?I dont really know. Since economic reasoning could not have sensibly led to such a ham-handed policy, it is natural for people to suspect an explanation in terms of political advantages that the ruling parties were expecting to get. It has certainly given, at least for the time being, a great political image to the Prime Minister of being a huge fighter against corruption, even though the policy has done very little to achieve anything on that front.These 50 days of hardship will not take black assets out of the economy?How could it? Only a very small proportion of black money (around 6 per cent, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. How can cleaning up of 10 per cent, at most, of black money clean it all up? Even that 10 per cent is a huge overestimate, since the black money dealers are much more skilled in overcoming official barriers than are normal honest people who are simply harassed  or made to lose their money  because of their lack of specialised skill in avoiding transaction barriers.If it is a bad policy, why do you think there havent been protests against demonetisation yet?The governments publicity surrounding this inept move has been very strong. People have been told again and again that if you are against demonetisation, you must be in favour of black money. This is a ridiculous analysis, but a readily exploitable political slogan. The persistent crisis created by demonetisation is only slowly becoming clear in terms of hard statistics as well as in public perception.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda. The truth may ultimately prevail, but the government might be able to maintain the loyalty of a large part of the public for a long time, certainly until after the U.P. elections.It is worth remembering that the notorious Irish famines in the 1840s did not immediately cause serious public agitation against the government run from London. That happened only later  much later  but when it did happen, the understanding of blame had a huge long-run impact, making the Irish people deeply suspicious of everything that the government in London did.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda"

Makeshift steps with wooden slats were lowered but to no avail. Food had to be sent down, and a bucket with water lowered.Keeping a watchTwo persons were posted to keep an eye on her. Sometime in the night, when the cloak of darkness had settled on everything around, she came out.On Tuesday, zoo staff decided to let her munch fruits inside. Steps are being built inside the enclosure to the moat so that they can move up and down easily, he says.With Kohima, there were no such unanticipated situations. When let out first, he took his time exploring the enclosure and even climbed up a tree. I let him out when I come in the morning. I also take him some fruits to eat. He remains there till food arrives around noon, and then its back inside, says Radhakrishnan Nair.Food includes watermelon, pumpkin, pineapple, boiled eggs, and rice. Sweet potato that was a staple for them in Nagaland is yet to be given, as it is not available here always.But there is honey to make up for it. Apple, grapes, and banana too are given. And then there is some punch too  watermelon pieces in blocks of ice. If the ice isnt too hard, they keep going at it till the ice breaks and they can gorge on the melons, says Radhakrishnan Nair. There is medicine too  for worms.The daily outings will continue till the bears are deemed fit enough to be released into the enclosure permanently.Since they are in the growing phase, they need lots of exercise. They cannot be kept inside much longer since their stomachs have started sagging, says zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander.The animals are doing fine, their initial stress as good as gone, Dr. Alexander says. The minor injury on Dimapurs paws has healed, he says.Just before Kohima climbed up the ledge in his enclosure with a piece of pumpkin to nibble, Radhakrishnan Nair let the bear lick some honey from his fingers. But he would not try that with Dimapur who loves baring her teeth. She puts out her paws so that she can grab us, and even sloshes drinking water at us, he says, smiling."

Party leaders are expecting at least 3,000 workers from each Assembly constituency in the district.District JD(S) president K.S. Lingesh said at a press meet on Tuesday that the party was expecting more than four lakh workers from across the State to take part in the programme. The convention is being held under the leadership of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. All legislators and leaders of the party take part in the convention, he said.Budget lacks focusHe also remarked that in the recent budget, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had not shown any focus on the States development. We were expecting a potato research centre for the district. The government did not sanction it. Besides that, the farming community was expecting waiver of loans. The government has not responded to the severe drought, he said."

We should move to being lightly regulated and well governed, where the efficient and honest are encouraged and the inefficient and dishonest are penalised, he said, addressing the graduating students of the Indian School of Business.A well-known face of the Indian industry, Mr. Bajaj mentioned this while outlining what he believed politicians should do. There is no place for crony capitalism, he said.Attributing the relatively low per capita income to a misdirected socialist pattern of industrialisation, especially between 1970 and 1990, he said resources were wasted on the public sector while the private sector stymied. We developed a language of rights, not responsibilities, and created a huge burden of distortions and subsidies in the economy.Politicians should realise the damage done by the socialist clap trap and essentially dismantle the old system. If the private sector has progressed it is because it functions on the basis of merit.Public sector banksTracing other issues such as inefficiencies and corruption, labour laws, and collapse of public education and healthcare, Mr. Bajaj said, Public sector banks have been repeatedly looted by politicians and businessmen in collusion with banks officials. This, he explained, was done to create bad loans, whose cost is ultimately borne by the honest tax payer, leaving us with the hot potato of the twin balance sheet problem.The focus of politicians should be on efficient provision of services in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure, besides a light but effective regulation of the private sector. Emphasising the need to minimise the role of black money and criminals in elections, Mr. Bajaj said public funding of elections and simultaneous elections at the Centre and the States were a necessary step in this regard.On their part, businessmen should first and foremost run their businesses well, growing in size, reach and capability. We must set and achieve the high standards of governance we expect from the government.Underscoring the significance of teamwork, he told the large gathering of students their families that leadership is about performance, consistent behaviour, and trust worthiness.Chairman of ISB Board Adi Godrej and dean Rajendra Srivastava urged the new graduates to focus on building a better society and be conscious of the need for utmost integrity and diligence. The graduation day marked the graduation of of the largest group of students  1,014  from the institute."

A shipment of potato seeds (which were to be distributed to farmers for sowing in the coming season) had arrived at Whitefield Railway Station from Punjab. The delicate seeds had to be taken to a cold storage facility close to Hoskote within a few hours, else they would become duds. We did not have the time to remove our seats to increase capacity of our buses. We rushed 20 buses within half hour, he said.Nearly 100 trips were done to and from Whitefield station, and the whole load  crammed into luggage spaces, on and under the seats  were transported.As the transporters strike intensifies, more associations have joined the strike against the hike in insurance premiums for goods vehicles.With the strike expected to continue longer, KSRTC has geared itself for all exigencies.We have instructed all our district offices to ensure buses to help farmers transport their agricultural produce. The last two seats of the bus can be removed if needed to increase the transport capacity. KSRTC will coordinate with Deputy Commissioners of the districts so that KSRTC buses can be called to transport health essentials or horticulture produce, said S.R. Umashankar, Managing Director, KSRTC.At Kolar, a meeting held on Wednesday, sought to prepare KSRTC buses and trucks owned by the State corporation in case milk transporters go off the roads.Fruits, veggies prices upRates of fruits and vegetables, primarily procured from outside the State, have started to increase as the transporters strike continues. There has been a nearly 40% dip in quantum of oranges coming from Nagpur or beans from Ranchi or even peas from Ooty. Some manage to bring it to the markets through trains or trucks that are not on strike. But as supply has been hit, prices have gone up, said Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms.For instance, in three days, the price of Orange Nagpura has gone up to Rs. 57 from Rs. 45; while peas from Ooty has touched Rs. 100 per kg."
58fbd25ca3d24b44f321f598,The breakfast story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-breakfast-story/article17660948.ece,2017-03-25,"On some Sundays, my breakfast consists of two fluffy bhatureys with a good helping of chholey, and some onion slices and pickled carrots and chillies on the side. I go to the local sweetshop for this, and I find that their fare is usually good. But the last time I got our breakfast packed from this busy eatery, I was a bit disappointed. The chholey was fine but the bhatureys were a little hard. They reminded me of bedmi, and suddenly I yearned for the bedmi and hot aloo sabzis that Chandni Chowk is known for.Vegetarian sideOnce the stomach demands, the body obeys. So a few days ago, I decided that while the weather was still bearable, I needed to go to Purani Dilli. I had gone there in the evening once and had my fill of kababs. Now I needed to go to the vegetarian part of the Walled City in the daytime for bedmi aloo.Think bedmi, and you think of Shiv Misthan Bhandar. This is an old, old shop on the mouth of Kucha Ghasiram (Shop no. 375, phone no. 23921406). This is near the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, away from the Red Fort end. The shop has just 11 items on the menu.If you are there in the mornings, you can breakfast on nagori halwa (Rs. 60), a delicious dish of small puris which you pierce in the middle (the way golgappas come) and stuff with halwa and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo (Rs. 90), they have chholey bhaturey (Rs. 80), and kachori and samosa (Rs. 50). They sell six kinds of sweets  jalebi and imarti (Rs. 500 a kilo), gulab jamun (Rs. 450), suji halwa (Rs. 400), mung dal halwa (Rs. 450) and malpua (Rs. 400). You can also buy them by plate  two imartis, for instance, are for Rs. 60 and two pieces of jalebi for Rs. 50.When I used to go there earlier, you had to stand and eat. Now the place has expanded at the back and there is seating for at least 30 people. If you are eating there, helpers keep filling your slot for sabzi and chholey if they find it empty. I, of course, took the bedmis home  and had a delicious lunch of two big puris stuffed with a dal paste, a nicely runny potato sabzi and lightly cooked chholey. I had all this with some tart methi chutney and pickles.The best thing about Shiv Misthan Bhandar is that every dish is cooked in desi ghee. I love the flavour and taste of ghee, so bedmi fried in ghee is like ambrosia for me. And because there are only 11 items on the menu (unlike the big vegetarian fast food chains, where you get everything these days from pizzas and pasta to noodles and burgers and bhatureys and chaat), Shiv Misthan keeps a strict check on quality. I have been eating their food for years, and find that it is as good as it was when I first went there long years ago.The place is known for its chholey bhaturey and imartis, too. And I firmly believe that their jalebi is a lot better than the thick ones that you get in Dariba. Shiv Misthans jalebi is juicy, yet crisp. And its delicious when eaten hot, just off the kadai.My craving for bedmi aloo has been met. But its been a while since I had Shiv Misthans nagori halwa. One day soon, I tell myself."

More than 4,000 varieties are grown in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.International Potato Centre researchers transported 700 kilos of the soil to Lima, planted 65 varieties and waited. In the end, just four sprouted from the soil.In a second stage, scientists planted one of the most robust varieties in the even more extreme conditions of the simulator.The winning potato  a variety called Unique."

Wisps of smoke rise in the air and disappear in the medley of sound and colour that this street around Jama Masjid in Old Delhi is known for. You see men, old and young, grilling kababs on their small barbecues. Crowds gather in the evenings, just as the sun sets, for an evening snack or an early dinner.The Walled City has its own rules. Lanes devoted to vegetarian food open up at dawn. Thats when you get breakfast fare of crisp kachoris and runny potato curries, or juicy jalebis and thickened, creamy milk. In other parts of the Old City, the food stalls come to life in the evenings. Thats when the grills come out, along with the skewers and marinated meat.In this street called Urdu Bazaar, there is a small counter at the end of a lane. Thats where you find Anmol Chicken Corner, where the grilled chicken is so good  and so deliciously sinful  that you dont forget it once you have had a taste of it.Untold delightsAround the lanes of Jama Masjid, you can see spot eateries with little hillocks of marinated chicken pieces or whole chicken hanging from iron rods. They are cooked in different ways  grilled in a tandoor or on a rack over an open fire or simply fried. For many die-hard chicken lovers, these lanes promise untold delights.But Anmol is different. It sells butter chicken, which is not to be confused with the butter chicken  tandoori chicken in a tomato-and-cream based sauce  that Delhi is known for. Anmols butter chicken is just what the two words imply  chicken in butter.Relatively newIn Old Delhi, where some eateries are over a 100 years old, Anmol is relatively new  they have been at the spot for the last 20 years or so. Every day, some 100 kilos of chicken are grilled and served. It has become quite a rage in the city, popular both with local residents and distant tourists and food walkers.If you are there any evening, you will find at the counter a mound of marinated pieces of chicken, boneless or with bone, in a huge wide-bottomed vessel known as a paraat. Next to is a large slab of butter. The ustad at the counter grills the chicken on a skewer over a coal fire. Once done, the pieces are put in a bowl. A masala is sprinkled over it  a mix of chillies, dried mango powder and chaat masala  and a spoonful of chutney. In a pan, a slab of butter is heated and once it melts into a golden liquid, it is poured over the chicken. The pot is given a good shake, and Anmols butter chicken  hot, spicy, buttery and juicy  is ready.

Uttar Pradesh resembles Saharan Africa,"" Modi said quoting a para from the state government's official website up.gov.in.Modi also ridiculed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his latest ""coconut juice"" remark.""There is a Congress leader, and I want to pray for his long life... he recently went to Manipur to address an election rally. There he told farmers that he would extract juice from coconuts and send it to London. In fact, a coconut possesses water (and not juice) and it is grown in Kerala,"" he said.""It is like setting up a potato factory,"" Modi said referring to Rahul's earlier remarks that he wants to set up potato factories in Uttar Pradesh."

These are expected to be completed by March, 2018.Official sources said there is hadly any response from private promoters to set up cold stores in tribal-dominated backward districts despite huge subsidy offered by the Government. While the subsidy for new cold stores in plain area is 55 per cent of the project cost subject to a maximum limit of Rs 2.20 lakh, the subsidy amount is Rs 2.80 lakh for scheduled areas.Under the mission, the State Government had planned to bring about 60,000 hectares under potato cultivation to achieve a production of about 11.25 lakh tonnes and 1.42 lakh tonnes of seed potato by 2017-18. However, the area coverage under potato cultivation has been marginally over 25,000 hectares in 2016-17.Referring to a survey conducted by National Centre for Cold-chain Development (NCCD) and NABARD Consultancy Services (NABCONS), the Minister said the State required additional cold store capacity of 2.88 lakh tonnes.In a bid to raise vegetable production in the State, the Government had decided in 2015 to set up 150 new cold stores under PPP mode by 2019. Though the decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, there is hardly any progress due to lack of response from private partners, the sources added."

The imported white wines Villa Antinori from Toscana and Ricossa Gavi DOCG from Piemonte and the red wine Santa Cristina from Tuscany are perfect accompaniments. The fruity Toscana wine complements the earthy starters.The other white wine from Piemonte is more citrusy and goes well with the rich, creamy texture of buckwheat pasta (which tastes like ragi). The crunchy and meaty chicken is also paired well with the sour red wine.The raw and marinated vegetables such as zucchini, carrots and broccoli served on a layer of basil cream cheese in the starter Insalata di Vergue di Prato (Lombardia) taste fresh.The menu reads the vegetables are grilled, and they been rightly done without being smoked or charred. A specialty of Lombardia, a region in North Italy known for its art and culture, the dish is healthy and filling.Then comes the soup. The La Cisra (piemonte) is a chickpeas soup served with winter vegetables. It takes us by surprise as chickpeas is an unusual ingredient in soup.The chef informs us that this soup is usually prepared with pork in Italy. As in India more people prefer vegetarian to meat, he prepared the soup with the stalk of chickpeas. The boiled carrots and onions in the soup make it chunkier and more colourful.Unlike the usual Italian pasta preparations with tomato, Pizzoccheri di Teglio (V) (Lombardia) is prepared with buckwheat fresh pasta, potato and savoy cabbage. It has a creamy texture, yet is healthy. The buckwheat pasta slices had a strong, bordering bitter flavour.Price for two: Rs 5,000"

It came as shells fired by the Islamic State group on government-held parts of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour wounded two members of a Russian media delegation visiting the area, according to state-run Syrian news agency SANA.Russia is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russian journalists enjoy wide access in government-held parts of the country.Russia's Anna-News military news service, which employs the journalists, said one was wounded in the arm while the other suffered leg and stomach wounds. The news service said the two were evacuated adding that their condition was ""satisfactory.""The United Nations is not overseeing the transfer deal, which involves residents of the pro-government villages of Foua and Kfarya and the opposition-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani. All four have been under siege for years, their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV, earlier said that 3,000 people will be evacuated from Foua and Kfarya, while 200, the vast majority of them fighters, will be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya.Abdurrahman and opposition activist Hussam Mahmoud, who is from Madaya, said the evacuation has been delayed.Abdurrahman said no permission was given for the evacuation to go ahead while Mahmoud said it has been delayed for ""logistical reasons.""It was not immediately clear if the evacuees feared attacks similar to Saturday's bombing.Abdurrahman said Saturday's blast which hit an area where thousands of pro-government evacuees had been waiting for hours  killed 126. He said the dead included 109 people from Foua and Kfarya, among them 80 children and 13 women.No one has claimed the attack, but both the Islamic State group and the al-Qaida-affiliated Fatah al-Sham Front have targeted civilians in government areas in the past.A wounded girl, who said she lost her four siblings in the blast, told Al-Manar TV from her hospital bed that children who had been deprived of food for years in the two villages were approached by a man in the car who told them to come and eat potato chips. She said once many had gathered, there was an explosion that tore some of the children to pieces.Anthony Lake, UNICEF's executive director, said in a statement Sunday that after six years of war and carnage in Syria ""there comes a new horror that must break the heart of anyone who has one.""""We must draw from this not only anger, but renewed determination to reach all the innocent children throughout Syria with help and comfort,"" he said."

The Interior Ministry had also placed Saeed and 37 other JuD and FIF members on Exit Control List, barring them from leaving Pakistan.At the rallies in several parts of Pakistan today, the participants demanded the immediate release of Saeed.In Lahore, Yakjahtee (solidarity) Kashmir Conference was held at Nasser Bagh in which a large number of activists of JuD and FIF participated. They shouted slogans against Pakistan, Indian and the US governments for detaining Saeed, and said the Nawaz Sharif government was damaging the country's image by maintaining friendship with the Narendra Modi government.""Pakistani nation is united for Hafiz Saeed's release,"" said JuD central leader Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, who is also the brother-in-law of Saeed. He said unfortunately due to Saeed's detention ""our message of solidarity to Kashmiris is not that powerful and encouraging this year"".The Sharif government, he said, should make its stance clear on Kashmir and tell the people of Pakistan that it is loyal to Kashmiris, and not India.Makki said trade of potato and onion with India is not right.

However, the situation might change, if the strike continues, warn experts.As many as three lakh lorries in the State went off the roads from Thursday pressing for their demands which include withdrawal of the Centres order increasing the third-party insurance and high toll tax collection on State highways. Though the lorry owners association has exempted essential services like milk, medicines, water and petrol from the purview of the stir, some sections of petrol tank operators have joined the stir across the State on Saturday.""Of the total 1,500 petrol tankers, only 500 were operated on the third day of the stir. Already the petroleum sales have dipped by 60 per cent from Monday, the petrol tankers association has also decided to join the stir in a full-fledged manner. If this happens, the petroleum users across the State might face a serious problem, said Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna.Speaking to Express, Rythu Bazar estate officer M Ramesh Babu said that indefinite lorry strike has no impact on the vegetable prices. Most of the vegetables are procured from the nearby villages across the city through auto rickshaws and APSRTC buses. Moreover, the vegetable prices are slashed by Rs 5 on each variety as this is the harvesting season for all the horticulture crops, he said.Veggies turn dearer as arrivals declineThe prices of vegetables also remained stable in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram, but the situation was different in Kurnool. The strike has created artificial scarcity of essential commodities, especially vegetables and their prices are going skyward.As Kurnool city depends on vegetable imports from places like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and other places, the supply constraints due to lorry strike burnt holes in the pockets of consumers.Kurnool imports potato and ginger from Delhi, Agra, Gujarat and nearly 100 tonnes arrives every day to the local markets. Because of strike, potato prices have doubled from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg, while ginger too saw similar price hike from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg. Tomatoes which were regular imports from Kadapa, Chittoor and Mahabubnagar districts also had its prices doubled from Rs 15 per kg."

In the last kharif season, nearly 65,000 farmers had availed Rs 64 crore loan while during rabi crop, only 19,960 farmers availed crop loan of Rs 36.78 crore.The farmers of the district have not shown interest in getting their crops covered under the scheme mainly due to official apathy and lack of farmers account in cooperative banks. The farmers hesitate to open the accounts in cooperative banks with a contention that their earlier agri-loan arrears will be deducted from the PMFBY amount. While the insurance amount differs for every crop, lack of information on the scheme is also one of the reasons for the failure of the scheme in the district. The insurance scheme covers only four crops, including green gram, black gram, groundnuts and potato. While potato is covered in Kujang block, groundnut has been declared as notified crop for Balikuda and Nuagaon blocks in the district.In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the new scheme to minimise the burden of premiums on farmers who take loans for their cultivation and safeguard them against inclement weather. There will be a uniform premium of only 2 percent to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5 percent for all rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid will be only 5 percent.Lead Bank Manager Anil Pattnaik said not a single farmer has availed the crop insurance under the scheme from cooperative banks in the district while 50 farmers have insured their crops of `30 lakh for the rabi season through UCO Bank. Meanwhile, the disbursement of crop loan through cooperative banks and Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) has been affected due to demonetisation as it is a cash-based transaction.Farmers leader Bansidhar Mohanty said due to lack of awareness and Government apathy, the disbursement of crop loans to farmers through PACCS and cooperative banks has been affected. Collector Yamini Sarangi expressed displeasure over the status of crop loan during rabi season and said steps have been taken to ensure the benefits under PMFBY in the next kharif season."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

In addition to that, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC) has decided to directly purchase potatoes from the farmers.Khuswant Singh, (45), of Moosapur village in Jalandhar, committed suicide after he suffered a loss in his potato crop, and was in debt of Rs 20 lakh, including cultivating his crop on leased land. The Punjab government has also instructed the education department that schools should directly buy potatoes from farmers at Rs 5 per kg for the mid-day meal scheme in government schools across the state to boost their sales.The meeting in this regard was held between BKU representatives and Kahan Singh Pannu, Managing Director of PAIC, in which all the details were given to farmer leaders.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has agreed to the Punjab Governments request to keep five lakh bags of potatoes in its cold storage.Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. However, the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.The State government has sent the case to the Election Commission of India to sanction Rs 5 crore so that it could buy the first lot of potatoes after the mode of conduct is in place.All the Deputy Commissioners in the State have been directed to buy the crop directly from farmers at Rs 500 and send it to prison departments and schools for the mid-day meal scheme.Meanwhile, Chief Secretary of SGPC Harcharan Singh said, we would be buying the potatoes directly from the farmers as we have told the managers of the gurdwaras and other institutions under the SGPC control to do the same. Presently our institutions are buying potatoes from the open market at Rs 8 per kg on an average. I have also discussed this matter with Punjab Agro Industries Corporation officials.Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region had on Wednesday dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation had greatly affected them."

They believe it will put a resurgent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar on the mat and throw a hot potato at the Modi-led Centre while widening RJDs acceptance levels among Bihars masses.Lalu Yadav wants a vigorous public campaign for special state status for Bihar. State finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui has set the stage for it, said an RJD leader, referring to the demands raised by Siddiqui at the pre-budget meeting of state finance ministers in Delhi earlier this month.The call for special category state status was made by JD(U) when it ruled the state in alliance with the BJP. They put tremendous pressure on the UPA-II Central government then. Dozens of rallies on the issue addressed by Nitish Kumar and a statewide signature campaign helped JD(U) consolidate its position among the masses in Bihar.RJD, which was then an ally of the Congress-led Centre and the main Opposition party in Bihar, had not been keen on the issue. But now, with it being the biggest party in Bihars grand alliance and the Centre having a BJP government, Lalu is serious about leading the call for special status.We have demanded funding by the Centre for Bihars rapid growth. PM Narendra Modi had announced an economic package of `1.25 lakh crore ahead of the Assembly elections in October-November 2015. But Central funds aid remains inadequate, said Siddiqui.RJD leaders know that JD(U), whose support for demonetisation created differences in the ruling alliance, will support the special category state.Some RJD leaders describe the partys plans to lead a public campaign as stealing JD(U)s thunder. The two parties still do not see eye to eye on many issues and engage in subtle one-upmanships.Special category state status is a very legitimate demand of Bihar and the Centre cannot escape any longer, said RJD legislator Bhai Birendra."

(FIle | AP)WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday revived two blocked pipeline projects as he signaled his determination to unpick existing environmental legislation.Trump gave an amber light to the Keystone XL pipeline -- which would carry deposits from Canadian tar sands to US refineries on the Gulf Coast -- and an equally controversial pipeline crossing in North Dakota.Both had been put on hold by president Barack Obama's administration on environmental grounds.Since being sworn in on Friday Trump has begun rolling out an orthodox conservative agenda, despite a campaign often being out of kilter with Republican party ideology.He has moved to curb funding for abortions, embraced Israel, frozen government hiring and now sought to unwind environmental legislation.But he has also bucked orthodoxy and sought to put his nationalist and populist print on policy, especially on the economy and trade.True to his claim to be a hard-charging dealmaker, Trump said both pipeline projects would only be built subject to renegotiated terms and conditions.""It is subject to a renegotiation of terms, by us,"" Trump said. ""We are going to renegotiate some of the terms and, if they like, we'll see if we can get that pipeline built.""- Made in USA -The freshly minted president indicated that one possible focus could be who makes the actual piping.In a separate executive order issued Tuesday, Trump decreed that pipes should be American made -- echoing his ""America First"" doctrine.""I am very insistent that if we are going to build pipelines in the United States the pipes should be made in the United States,"" Trump said.""We want to build the pipe, put a lot of steel workers back to work.""Most, although not all, oil pipelines buried underground and made of carbon steel.Obama had rejected a permit from Calgary-based firm TransCanada to build the 1,179-mile (1,900 kilometer) Alberta-Nebraska section of the project.Environmentalists have assailed the project, arguing that the Alberta deposits produce some of the ""dirtiest"" crude in the world.The Canadian government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cautiously supported the plan, seeing it as a means of boosting business.But Canada's liberal leader has also helped wage the international charge against climate change.Ahead of Trump's announcement, natural resources minister James Carr said the move would be ""very positive for Canada,"" creating 4,500 construction jobs.""We believe that it's a good project for both Canada and the United states and we're very hopeful.""- Dakota chill -The Dakota Access Pipeline is more of a political hot potato in the United States.Native Americans and their supporters strongly protested against the project, prompting the US Army Corps of engineers -- which has approval authority -- to nix the plans under the Obama administration.Thousands had camped in freezing winter temperatures to block the oleoduct's planned route.The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is concerned about potential water pollution, saying the pipeline's route endangers areas with sacred historic artifacts.The standoff -- which included some 2,000 military veterans who joined the protest -- prompted violent clashes with law enforcement as well as sympathetic demonstrations nationwide.But Trump has supported the 1,172-mile (1,886-kilometer) oil pipeline, which would snake through four US states."

Yet to recover from the crop loss of 2015-16 kharif season, they were forced to go for distress sale of cabbage, tomato and chilli and now it is the turn of potato.The farmers had put all their hopes on potato and looked forward to make up for the loss. Even as potato is being sold for `8 per kg in the open market, the farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of cultivation with traders offering anything between `2 and `3 per kg. In the absence of cold storage, the farmers have no way out but to dispose of the produce at throw away prices.Moreover, the State Government is yet to fix the minimum support price (MSP) for potato despite tall claims of Potato Mission. To make things worse there is no organised market to ensure fair price to the farmers.Under Potato Mission, besides providing incentivised potato seed, the State Government had also committed to give capital subsidy for new cold storage as per the agricultural policy of 2013. It was also mooting subsidising power tariff for existing and new cold storages till March 31, 2018.Plans were also sketched to maintain buffer stock to deal with short-term scarcity situation and a target has been set to bring 60,000 hectares of land under potato cultivation by 2017-18. But, on the ground the picture is not rosy. This year, the Department of Horticulture had distributed 5350 quintal potato seeds to 29 farmers in Bhatli, Bargarh and Attabira blocks.The seeds were meant to produce 424 quintal of potato. This apart, about 500 quintal of seeds were procured from open market and cultivated by farmers across the district. As the situation stands today, many farmers have resorted to distress sale of potato while many are refusing to harvest it as they want to avoid further losses.Premanand Dang of Jamurda village in Bargarh block had cultivated potato over half an acre of land. But, he has no purchaser and is forced to sell his produce at distress prices.Those who had taken debt for the crop were the first to sell their crop at `3 per kg in absence of any organised market in the district. Similar is the condition of Rajkumar Pradhan of the village, who is not daring to harvest his crop in absence of market. Even if he harvests the crop, the amount he would be getting for the produce would not be enough to recover the harvesting cost.Assistant Horticulture Officer, Sunil Kumar Seth said no communication has been received from the State Government on MSP of potato. There was no cold storage in the district and said if farmers wish they can avail the facility in Sambalpur, he added."

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."
