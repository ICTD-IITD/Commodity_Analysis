But this time it is not the big brand ambassadors who are doing image building, but professional influencers who are trying to tap bloggers who could be opinion makers.The New Indian Express has learnt that the cola major has hired a Chennai-based influencer to reach out to bloggers with good following for an image revamp.Chennai-based Digital Influencer or Dinfluencer is currently conducting a telephonic survey and sending out questionnaires on behalf of PepsiCo to hardsell its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.Since the cola major has been in the news for all wrong reasons, with protesters holding them responsible for depletion of ground water table, Dinfluencer told that objective of the survey was to change that perception.There is a perception that Pepsi is depleting groundwater and not doing anything to the farmers, but actually it is not true. They (Pepsi) are giving more to farmers. We need to create awareness about their new CSR initiatives, the marketing representative says.Heres how the conversation goes: Do you know that PepsiCo helps around 25,000 potato farmers in Punjab by buying their produce for its popular snack, Lays? Do you know that PepsiCo sources about 65 per cent of all fruits used in their products like Tropicana from Indian farmers? You can write about these CSR initiatives in the social media, the caller helpfully suggests.As part of the public relations exercise, the callers request the bloggers to make on-site visits to check out the CSR initiatives and write about them.Next month, an interactive event with PepsiCo will be organised in Chennai to put all bloggers who are on board on one platform.After this reporter sent his responses to the survey, another representative of Dinfluencer called in, saying: We will be contacting you through e-mail for influencer campaigns to promote the CSR initiatives of PepsiCo, and the association can be long term. At the end of survey, we will send you a gift hamper worth Rs 300 to your address."

Around 4 lakh transport vehicles in the State have stopped loading and unloading operations and joined the strike, said APLOA general secretary YV Eswara Rao. He stated that they had exempted emergency services like milk and water tankers from the strike. We will intensify our strike if the government neglects our demands, he said.Contrary to expectations, the lorry strike did not have any remarkable impact on the economy on the first day of the indefinite strike across the State. There was no effect on the prices of perishable goods such as vegetables and essential commodities. Oil filling station staff in Vijayawada and Guntur said they would fill fuel till the existing stocks last.When contacted, M Ramesh Babu, estate officer of Rythu Bazar in Patamata, said there was no problem in procuring vegetables on Thursday. Most of the vegetables come here in small trucks and autos which are not participating in the strike. Since Friday is a holiday for the market, there might be some problem on Saturday, if the strike continues. Even then, only a few vegetables like carrot, beetroot and potato which are transported by lorries will get dearer, he said.The lorry delivered vegetables in the morning as usual on Thursday. Most of us in the vegetable market are unaware of the strike. We have to wait and see how things will turn out on Friday. If the vehicle does not turn up, there might be a problem, said V Veerababu, a vegetable vendor at Kaleswara Rao Market in the city.Speaking to TNIE, Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna made it clear that petrol dealers are not participating in the indefinite strike and it is only limited to transport operators. Only 2 per cent of petrol tankers operated in the State on Thursday and the total operation will be stopped from April 1.Though there will be no impact on diesel sales, two-wheelers might face a harrowing time from Friday with insufficient stock of petrol at the filling stations. The indefinite strike of transport operators will be a great loss to the government rather than the operators, he said."

Hesitantly she picked up, only to be pleasantly surprised by one of her elderly customers.He was a Jain from Chennai and he called me Annapoorna as I was preparing special satvik meals for him without onion and garlic, says the city-based home-cook whose authentic North Indian fare has a huge fan following.Be it lasooni paneer, baigan bharta or green chilli paratha, she ensures a burst of taste and authenticity. Come up with any typical North Indian vegetarian delicacy, and Deepika will deliver it at your doorsteps. I keep adding to the menu and as of now cheesy potato paratha is a hot favourite with my customers, she says. Deepika, who relocated to the city from Kanupur, says she started cooking for her North Indian friends practising in Medical College.They were missing ghar ka khana and asked me to cook for them on a daily basis. That was some two years back and now the number of my customers has grown in leaps and bounds, she smiles.Her facebook page Leelas Kitchen is a talk among the foodie groups in the city as you dont have to order much in advance. All I need is one hour. I have two helpers who do the peeling and chopping. We are always prepared to take the order and finish it in an hour, she says.Deepika says though she is an expert cook now, once she hardly had any idea about what happens inside the kitchen. It was my mother-in-law Leela who taught me the art, with all its nuances and tricks. She had magic in her hands and hence my page is named after her.There are many specialty restaurants in the city dedicated to North Indian cuisine, but Deepika says their preparations lack that authentic taste and flavour. You dont get a paratha with a thick methi filling there. While we use atta they use maida, and there is always the hygiene part. From the flour to garnish, we make sure that everything is 100 per cent North Indian.Then there are customers who want specific food, something in sync with their health or religion. I think there is no other eatery in the city that provides Jain food, she adds.But its not just homesick North Indians who place orders at Leelas Kitchen. I get equal or more orders from Keralites. I think yummy home-cooked food is something that appeals to all, she winds up."

While farmers appear anguished that much of the promises made by the BJP during the 2014 polls remained unfulfilled, the chief minister seem to be beating the anti-incumbency factor, as locals claimed that Yadav has turned Agra into Paris.Even while the long drawn out family feud within the Yadav clan continues to command the attention of the people on the lines of a never ending television serial, the state chief minister seems to be gaining the support. Akhilesh Yadav has taken the right step to take control of the party. Mulayam Singh Yadav should have passed the baton to avoid the family drama. Akhilesh Yadav has done a lot of good works for the state. There is no anti-incumbency factor against him, said Rajesh Pachauri of Bakalpur village in Mathura.Even while the BSP supremo Mayawati had faced the CBI probe in the Taj corridor project, the chief minister seems getting the credit for its completion. With carved and lighted red-sandstone pillars dotting the Taj corridor in Agra, the stretch has become a major tourist attraction. Akhilesh Yadav has turned Agra into Paris. You may just go and take a look, said Rohit Singh, who added that the inner ring road in the city along with the promises of airport and Metro have endeared the chief minister closer to the people in Agra.Even while Agra had traditionally been a BSP bastion, the SP is making spirited attempt to make inroads into the area. The prospects of the SP had apparently taken a hit after the sudden demise of its nominee Chandrasen Taplu. However, his wife Mamata Taplu, who is now the SP candidate from Agra Cantonment, after winding off campaigning late evening, told EXPRESS that people in the city are rallying behind the chief minister due to his development credentials. He is a youth with a clean image. The chief minister has fulfilled all promises that he had made for Agra. My husband had also done a lot of developmental works, said Mamata Taplu.While Akhilesh Yadav is drumming up support for completion of road projects and welfare schemes, the BJP is facing anger of the farmers. Farmers sowed pulses in the hope of better prices. But once the crop matured, the prices crashed. Similarly, the potato farmers could not recover even half the input cost, said Ajay Singh, a farmer in Sikandara.Having won the political battle against his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, people on the ground claimed that the chief minister could not be blamed for poor law and order situations in the state. People are well aware that there were bad elements who did not allow the chief minister to function independently for most parts of his tenure. Now that those elements are out of the party, Akhilesh Yadav has come out clean and stronger. The Muslims will back him in this elections, said Gani Mohammed, a retired teacher, in Agra."

With summer in full swing, most vendors in the city expect the prices to skyrocket even further.The price rise is seasonal, said Balu, a vegetable vendor at Begumpet. Balu, who buys his vegetable stock from Gudimalkapur Rythu Bazaar, said:The present rise is not due to lorry strike. There were a lot of trucks supplying vegetables to the market on Monday. Farmers are not releasing stock and there is a shortage of supply in the market, said the vendor.The retail price of potatoes have shot up by `4 and are now being sold for `12 a kilogram. The price of ladies finger, carrots, beans, cauliflowers too have gone up.Sem beans have become unaffordable for us vendors. Two days ago the price was `35 a kg but now it is selling at `50 per kg. I decided not to stock the vegetable, said Ravindra Reddy, owner of Hindupriya Vegetable shop at Begumpet. The prices do keep changing every few weeks but a steep rise usually happens in the summer, he added.Interestingly, the rise in potato prices in Telangana comes at a time when the prices have gone down in West Bengal and other states due to bumper crop resulting in over supply.The Centre-owned National Horticultural Boards data for the second half of March also showed a 25 per cent decline in wholesale vegetable prices across many states. The reason for the falling prices has been attributed to farmers rushing to sell off their stock fearing spoilage of vegetables due to summer."

Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region have dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The Punjab government had asked Markfed and National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) to procure the potato crop, but they had failed to do so. So, we dumped about 500 quintals of potatoes on the main chowk in Kartarpur on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway, said Harmeet Singh Kadian, State president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation ensured they could not pay for it.Usually, Punjab farmers sell around 200 quintals of potato seed at the rate of `3,000 per quintal. This time, the losses are estimated at Rs 1,500 crore. Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. But then the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.Post-demonetisation and the coming of the new crop, there has been a crash in potato prices. Now, potatoes are selling at Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg compared to Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg earlier, said J S Sangha, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary.Farmers should dump the potato outside banks if the government doesnt support them in anyway. The crop dumped yesterday was just a trailer. We will dump the whole crop across the State, as storing it in cold storage costs us much more.In an attempt to resolve the crisis, the Punjab government is now trying to export the crop to Russia and Iran."
58fd22237be9e06c937158c8,Being a vegetarian in Dubai,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/apr/05/being-a-vegetarian-in-dubai-1590329.html,2017-04-06,"HYDERABAD: At every occasion, my friends grab the chance to ask me, Tereko paneer hi chicken hai na! When I told them that I was visiting the worlds most happening and luxurious city  Dubai, I found them rolling on the floor, laughing and asking me how I would survive in Dubai. I just facepalmed them and walked away. I left for Dubai half-heartedly because even I was not sure I would survive being a vegetarian in Dubai. But then...Global approach:As I settled down with my seatbelt and my book on the Emirates EK 527, I was filled with excitement on my first trip to Dubai. I checked into Rove City Centre hotel and realised there was a supermarket on the ground floor. I felt relieved,thinking I would survive on chips and sodas, if not on paneer and baigan. The view of the skyscrapers from the hotel room ensured the Dubai feeling soaked in. We headed off to Global Village. Well, before we get into food, let me brief about the worlds only place where we find America and Russia under one roof. Wondering how? Global Village has pavilions of all the countries representing their culture, food and shopping activities. Guess what! Indian pavilion represented our country in the real sense of the term. While the other countries co-existed in silence, Indian pavilion had Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Kajarare playing in high decibels.The special tea at the African pavilion awakened all my senses and I was all set for the surprises Dubai was throwing at me. After some adventure with roller coasters, I went to Thailand arena just to relish those fresh-cut exotic fruits like dragon fruit, wild pineapple and peaches. Well, they are available at every supermarket in our city, but the Thai fruits were bigger and juicier. They were organic and tastier. While walking through the sprawling Fun Park, I stumbled upon Turkish ice cream stall and the magic that they weaved with it won me over. Nutella donuts to nutella icecreams and tarts, the hazelnut and chocolate lovers can go crazy. We stopped by the Grand Barbeque, anIndian restaurant to have our dinner along with our new Syrian friend, an employee of Global Village. The joy of making him taste the spicy panipuri and Afghani paneer with masala kulcha was thrilling beyond words. Just like in the movie Queen, he got teary-eyed when he first tasted the spicy pudina and imli pani, but later he couldnt resist from eating more. Well, I felt good turning into the panipuri wala bhaiya temporarily. The dinner was complete at the Chinese pavilion with some steaming hot jasmine tea.Ripe Market:After a scrumptious breakfast at the hotel, we went to Zabeel Park and were introduced to a concept called Ripe Market. Here farmers and food creators from the world over gather and exhibit what they offer to the world. Well, I got to taste caramel and lotus-flavoured iced-tea and cow milk icecream, various hybrid varieties of olives, white honey, queens honey, mountain honey, Mexican pina colada, organically grown fresh fruits, vegetables and more than 90 varieties of cooking oils. In addition of all these raw food, we got to indulge in some doughnuts, cupcakes and brownies.Beach Canteen:We Indians are used to eating at the beach. Arent we? Bhajjis, peanuts, corn and what not but the experience of having organised stalls of gourmet brands from across the globe. Well, what else can a man ask for! Clean beach, plethora of food and of course some music and dance. The live cooking sessions too were attractive, but surely not for the vegetarians. Beach Canteen at the Kite Beach had everything one could die for. Waffles with fresh cream and fruits to Japanese veg sushi to Lebanese style of cheese samosa,the authentic Emirati sweet delicacy- Luqaimat. It is fried dumplings with some date syrup or caramel syrup on it. I bet, one cant stop with one. It is as addictive as Lays or Kurkure. Some cold pressed organic drinks containing vegetables, fruits and herbs with names like Better than Botox replaced the regular aerated drinks. I tried all their flavours. Haagen-Dazs ice cream completed the beach experience.Street Night:The pop culture in Dubai is just beyond imagination. After having the taste of global platter at the Beach Canteen, the evening began with some street style food trail. Battle of BBoys welcomed us to the Street Nights where people thronged to get some chilled out vibes and sample the hottest street food vendors. Regions top graffiti artists too jammed in a live graffiti, adding to those vibes. Guess what was the best part of Street Night, Kaapi.. Kaapi Filter Kaapi! We Indians always manage to mark our presence and stand out. Well, coming to food, a young South Indian boy owns a food truck called Wokinakki, where he serves you the recipe of happiness. The fusion of Thai and Indian veg rice bowl made the non-vegetarians turn green in envy. Yes! The falvours of Thai curry with exotic vegetables and a pinch of Indian masala made the dish stand out among all the other rolls and sandwiches. Moving to the Egyptian stall, I was wondering, if I would get something non-meaty and to my surprise, a dish called Kushdari, made of rice, noodles and crispy macaroni with the right amount of spices gave me an insight into the fact that there are vegetarians in every country and it is not always about meat. Just to add fun to my goal-worthy food trails, I tried some lemon-mango popsicles. Oh wait, the Poland stall offered me some charcoal lemonade and Dutch offered me some cheese sandwich. Perhaps it is a global tradition to end the meal with a dessert and at Street Night, it was at Cryspes. It was fritters with preferred flavour topping. The toppings varied from caramel, nutella to the famous Lotus biscuits of Dubai.Comptoir 102The third day at Dubai started off on a healthy note. Comptoir 102 on Jumeriah road offered us more than just healthy food. Winner of the Whats On Award of the best Healthy cafe in Dubai, Comptoir 102 is one among the favourite places for healthy eating. The philosophy behind the caf is to offer a more conscious and healthy lifestyle by bringing more sustainable and nutritious food. The cafe had French ambience and arty stuff around were a delight to eyes. The cafe sources ingredients from local organic farms, sugar-free and dairy-free, with raw, vegan and gluten free options menu, changes daily according to harvest, just like at home. The smoothies and juices are vitamin-packed. We were served Skinny Boast- a smoothie made of cucumber, banana and basil, Heaven on earth- a smoothie made of cinnamon, cocoa and banana. Acaio, almond butter porridge, chocolate porridge and pancakes surprise my tummy that was full of junk.City Walk:From a simple milk chocolate to exotic dark chocolate, the mall had chocolates from all parts of the world. If this is not called heaven, then what is! Just when I was relishing those chocolates, I was introduced to a new snack called French fries. Puzzled? Well, these were sweet potato french fries. This just goes to prove that no matter how ugly potato looks, the output of it is delicious and addictive.Kak:At the Lebanese canteen, we tasted Kak. It is a bread with sesame seeds and a filling of our choice. For the sweet tooth, it was nutella Kak and for the chessy people, it was the herb and cheese. This authentic Lebanese dish has a history of being the most favourite street food of the middle eastern countries.We had dinner at Rang Mahal at JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai on the last night of our trip and it was exotic. Chef Atul Kochhars team ensured we were served unique dishes. The yam starter was simple, but most memorable. Wait a bit to know more about his venture and food.(The writer was invited to get familiarised with the Dubai Food Festival by Dubai Tourism)"
58fd23e27be9e06c93715b2a,Fusion fare,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2017/apr/13/fusion-fare-1593347.html,2017-04-14,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Marrying two culinary streams can be a risky affair. But when chef Alexander offers you his steaming canary-yellow pumpkin soup, you are instantly tempted. It comes with a subtle, silky texture, enhanced by the sweet, familiar flavour of coconut milk. And, instead of the traditional garlic bread arrives regular baguette garnished with cinnamon and pepper. The chef brilliantly brings in three Kerala elements in this international dish- cinnamon, pepper and coconut milk.If you ever fancied a slightly tweaked or spicier version of gourmet cuisine, a little hatke from the regular fare, the Taj Gateway Hotel at Varkala is the place to visit. The newly-joined chef Alexander specialises in fusion cuisine, giving continental delicacies a desi twist. Its crucial to maintain the balance while replacing dairy cream with coconut milk. If the flavour is overpowering, it will totally ruin the character of the classic English soup, he says. The roasted pumpkin soup is a slow preparation where the pumpkin undergoes oven-roasting before pureeing to lock in the flavour and nutrients.Milk from all coconuts are not suitable for creaming a dish. Certain parts in Kerala like Varkala and Alappuzha are known for creamier coconuts. The quality of a coconut is dependent on the soil it grows and its distance from the ocean, chips in Ashirbad Praharaj, general manager.He calls it a western-recipes-meet-Indian-ingredients menu as some risottos with red-spicy prawns roll in. While making risotto, the rich creamy Italian rice dish, the chef opts for bamboo rice, another local specialty. The short organic rice grains add a unique edge to its taste and consistency.We find the risottos super yummy, and the prawns fried in Syrian Christian style juicy and sharpened with the right amount of spices. Here most of our guests are Europeans and they normally indulge in western cuisine. But the new menu I created is a blend of local and global culinary elements, he says.Next comes grilled fish on a bed of green peas, fennel and potato mesh. Usually its sea bass, a neutral-flavored fish thats used for the preparation. But here we are using a denser, full-bodied local fish, he says.The dish, that comes with fine raw papaya ribbons on top of it, is soft and moderately spiced. Another item on menu is Rack of lamb, a New Zealand dish for which the chef uses a sauce made of demy glaze and red wine.  I do mild alterations to many original recipes without taking away the authenticity. By customising it to suit local taste, we create a little drama around the same old dish. Some call it fusion cooking, I call it personalisation, he adds.Choco mocha walnut brownie de milky ganache, a dessert so divine, turns out to be the perfect finale for our fusion dinner. But this time there is no local tweak. There are some preparations that are too perfect for customisation and this one belongs to that league, says the chef."

Place potatoes in a medium bowl of cold water. In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Stir in the milk and egg until the mixture is smooth. Let it stand for 20 minutes. Pre-heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees. Fry potatoes in hot oil until they are tender.Drain them on paper towels. Dredge the fish in the batter, one piece at a time, and place them in the hot oil. Fry until the fish is golden brown. If necessary, increase the heat to maintain the 350 degrees temperature. Drain well on paper towels, fry the potatoes again for 1 to 2 minutes for added crispness. It can be served with salsa and Thai sauces. Sounds good?Chef Sathya, Hablis HotelI have been a chef for a year now. Previously I have worked in Le Meridian Chennai, London Hilton, Arbutus. My first job was in Le Meridian Chennai, which I got through campus, and my first-ever experience of cooking was when I took it up as a profession;I made a salad of tandoori, prawns and pineapple and garnished it with different peppers and lemonade sauces. When it comes to my favourites, I always prefer European food, particularly pork belly, beef burger and roasted salmon dish. I am a serious person when it comes to cooking and I am really focused!Spice or sweet; it doesnt really mater! What matters is the balance of taste. If there is one ingredient I cant live without, it would probably be potato, because when I was in London for long, we would eat lots of potatoes in different forms and it was part of our diet.Without potatoes, nothing works in the kitchen!(laughs) They contain starch and carbohydrates which is must in every meal. In Europe probably we either have mashed potatoes or baked potato and even boiled potatoes part of every meal.I have no specific person in mind that I want to cook for but to be specific, it would be a sportsperson and I will look at the preference of his taste, based on that, I will decide the menu and start cooking. If the person is a non-vegetarian I would go for braised lamb with potato, carrot puree, rice and hazelnut. If he is a vegetarian, probably something with cheese.Talking about experimenting with food, I do a lot and well, fusion is part of our job. For instance, we had lemongrass chicken cooked with Asian flavours, the combination was a success because of the different tastes and flavours that blend in together.Now settled in Chennai, I must confess that my food experience has been very minimal. Nevertheless, I always look out for samosas in Chennai and mixed chaats and snacks in Pudhucherry!"

Singhvis association with the animal rights activists in this case, thus, became a political hot potato for the party unit in Tamil Nadu, leading to open criticism.Jallikattu is a Tamil tradition, and it is the basic right of people here. Those who are against it are our enemies, Tamil Nadu Youth Congress State general secretary, Mohan Kumaramangalam, told Express, condemning Singhvis decision to appear in the case.We urge Singhvi to not appear in the court in this case. If he thinks his profession as a lawyer is more important, then he should resign his Rajya Sabha seat and also from the Congress party. If he appears against jallikattu, we will protest against him, Kumaramangalam added.Following this, TNCC president S Thirunavukkarasar took up the matter with the party high command, urging the leadership not to permit Singhvi to appear in the case.On Wednesday, a battery of lawyers led by Singhvi filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the jallikattu bill. The plea was filed on behalf of the Animal Welfare Board of India, Compassion Unlimited Plus Action and other animal rights activists. It termed the amendment a fraud on the Constitution and a violation of a 2014 Supreme Court judgment. The case is now slated to come up for hearing on Monday."

But if you are going for Goan traditional food, which the pub claims is their speciality, hit the main course first, I would say.The plain rice served with salad and pickle along with Goan Prawns Curry was delicious. The curry was rich and creamy and the Thai-based vegetable curry was a delight. Made in coconut milk gravy, it tasted sweet and looked richer than its non-vegetarian counterpart.We tried a couple of starters along with some cocktails. The Fiery Crispy Potato had the crispy wedges glazed with hot and spicy red sauce. Cooked in oriental style with bell peppers and onions, the starter looked colourful and bright against the dim lighting of the restaurant. The sauce and bell peppers made it very spicy and reminds one of masala fries.The description for the Bollywood Crackers in the menu reads crispy, crunchy, cheesyrest is a secret. But the rest in this case turned out to be a disappointing. The round patties were crunchy and cheesy, but also sour and oily. You may not enjoy this one unless you are a cheese lover.The Chicken Cafreal is served with pav. Cooked in Goan style with coriander and mint flavour, giving it a green tinge. It lacks the said flavours. The meat was a little hard and did not look appetising.The Spicy Prawns in Port Wine was better than the other starters. Do not go by its look. It does not look interesting but tastes better compared to the rest. Simmered in butter, port wine and crushed red pepper, the prawns were served, topped with chilli flakes. It had a strong flavour of vinegar and tasted sweet and sour.The cocktails lacked alcohol punch. The Watermelon basil is said to be well balanced drink to cool you down with a refreshing mix ginger, basil and vodka but you could barely feel the kick, making it just like a juice. The Lemon Drop is suggested as a tangy refreshing vodka cocktail with a burst of fresh lemon. Well, you feel the burst of fresh lemon, making it taste more like a fresh lime juice, rather than a cocktail.It lacks the alcohol punch. The Lusty Chocolate has a consistency of melted chocolate and icecream. The menu reads this sweet version made of vodka, chocolate syrup, baileys and fresh cream is so sophisticated in taste that you dont want to share. It reads true, you wouldnt really like to share, not because it is a sophisticated drink but the mix of milk, cream and alcohol was not soothing. To be safe with the choice, you can go for Mai Tai or the Orange Blossom. The Orange Blossom is a vodka-based tangy and refreshing drink.Among desserts, Bebinca, a Goan dessert is a good choice. The pudding, made with flour, sugar, egg yolk and coconut, is served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce. You can feel the sugar syrup lingering in your mouth. Definitely my favourite pick from the dinner night."

He then opened a joint news conference by noting that his late mother was born in ""Stornoway, which is serious Scotland."" Scotland is part of Great Britain.Trump and May were seen briefly holding hands as they walked along the White House colonnade after leaving the Oval Office. Their talks continued in the State Dining Room over lunch of iceberg wedge salad, braised beef short ribs with potato puree and salted caramel crme brulee.For her part, May congratulated Trump on his ""stunning election victory,"" and announced that he had accepted the queen's invitation for a state visit for the president and his wife, first lady Melania Trump, later this year.But the attempts at mutual flattery didn't completely mask the leaders' differences over some issues, including NATO and Russia.May tried to push Trump toward positions she supports, noting that he had assured her he was ""100 percent"" behind NATO, a world body he has dismissed as ""obsolete."" Trump did not contradict May as they stood together and answered journalists' questions in the White House East Room.May also took a tougher stance on sanctions against Russia.When asked how close the U.S. is to lifting penalties that were imposed on Russia after its incursion into Ukraine, Trump said it was ""very early to be talking about that."" May said sanctions should remain until a 2015 cease-fire agreement for Ukraine is fully implemented.Trump has been less critical of Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, than his predecessor and some lawmakers, including fellow Republicans. He has cast doubt on findings by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the presidential election to help him win the White House, and has praised Putin's leadership. Trump's stance has fueled speculation that he could ease or remove the sanctions against Russia.Trump also reiterated his belief that torture works. Britain takes a vocal stand against it.The appearance alongside May was more amiable than Trump's most recent public appearance with a foreign leader: a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto last August. Trump was more staid and serious then, and read from lengthy prepared remarks.Coincidentally, Trump and May met a day after Pena Nieto canceled his own trip to Washington next week amid disagreement with Trump over which of their countries will pay for the wall Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump says Mexico will pay; Mexico says it won't.Trump is something of a mystery to world leaders, many of whom expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election. They also don't know his administration's main interlocutors with foreign governments, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior adviser Steve Bannon, a conservative media executive.So May was on a bit of a scouting mission.She has strong reasons for wanting the relationship to work. Britain is set to leave the European Union and its 500 million-person single market, and is eager for a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. The United States is Britain's biggest export market, and such a trade deal would be a major prize.Trump has drawn parallels between Britain's choice to leave the EU and his own success, using the Brexit vote last June to bolster his derision of the 28-nation bloc and his preference for striking bilateral agreements.Often combative in the presence of journalists, Trump seemed relaxed and humorous alongside May. At one point, after a British journalist asked whether people should be alarmed by his past statements, Trump joked: ""This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.""He backed May's determination to make Britain strong and prosperous once it leaves the European Union, saying he thought Brexit would be ""a tremendous asset and not a tremendous liability.""And when asked whether the two very different leaders had found common ground, Trump said they had.""I think we're going to get along very well,"" he said. ""I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa."""

Politically, the BJP will benefit the most from this investigation, said Rahul Sinha, BJP national secretary and former state president.The chief minister appeared to have anticipated that the BJP would up the ante in view of the election results in five states. While reacting to the court order, she made her first political move.Over the next few months, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has to battle the opposition parties that are lining up their arsenal to gun for her. (Subhankar Chakraborty)Our party will move the Supreme Court. The judgement was most unfortunate. How could the state president of a political party predict that the court would order a CBI investigation once the UP elections were over? she asked while addressing the media at the state secretariat.The judges were asking right from the beginning why a CBI probe should not be ordered. If a judgement is leaked before it is passed, it is unfair, said Banerjee. She was referring to BJP state president Dilip Ghoshs recent remark when he predicted that a CBI probe into the Narada scam was imminent.This is a grand conspiracy. The footage was also released from the BJP office, she reiterated. State BJP leaders reacted by saying they might file a contempt petition against the chief minister for making such remarks on a high court order.Read: Election results: Why BJPs sweep in UP could be ominous for Mamata BanerjeeThough Congress was the first party to move court on the Narada scam, Bengal PCC chief and MP, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, somehow seemed convinced that the BJP would now claim its pound of flesh.Virtually the entire Trinamool leadership may land in jail soon, Chowdhury told HT. He ruled out any possibility of the investigation going slow - as feared by the Left- given the BJPs dependence on Trinamool Congress to save its newly-formed government in Manipur.The Narada verdict came at a time when the Trinamool chief is at the pinnacle of her popularity following the redistribution of the SIngur land among the farmers and her move to rain in private hospitals. (HT Photo)The BJP is a master is horse trading. It is Mamata Banerjee who should feel scared. There may come a time when her party leaders will start flocking to the BJP to save their skin, said Chowdhury.Political observers however pointed out that no matter how hard the state BJP might try to corner Trinamol Congress, the Left and Congress would work out their own strategy to regain lost ground.Read: Setback for Mamata and Trinamool, HC asks CBI to probe Narada sting operationCPI(M) state secretary Suryakanta Mishra and Politburo member and MP, Md Salim both alleged that the BJP and Trinamool were allies and hence, the CBI probe meant little. How does one explain why the Parliaments Ethics Committee headed by L K Advani didnt meet even once over the past one year? Since some of the accused are MPs, the matter was referred to the committee long ago, said Salim.The partnership was evident in Manipur where the BJP formed the government with support of the sole Trinamool MLA. Had the Centre been serious about Naradha, Saradha, Rose Valley and other scams, they would have taken steps long ago, alleged Mishra.The chief minister is not above suspicion. Why wasnt any action against S M H Mirza, the IPS officer seen accepting money in the Narada tapes? The chief minister has argued that political parties accept donation to contest elections. Question is, do IPS officers accept those donations on behalf of politicians? said Mishra."

The state agriculture department and Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Limited (PAIC) are working out modalities for exporting the crop to the two countries.As supply of potato from Pakistans Punjab province in the current season will end by March 15, the Indian side is gearing up to export consignments. The state agencies woke up to the farmers plight after they complained of earning less than the input cost and fleecing by traders.

(Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Financial commissioner, development, NS Kalsi, who is in charge of the agriculture department, said the landing cost of potato in the two countries will be Rs 18 per kilogram, while it will sell for Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kilogram.The profit will be passed on to the farmers. The corporation has sought Rs 5-crore financial help from the government to start lifting the produce from farmers, he said.Bharatiya Kisan Union president Balbir Singh Rajewal said area under potato has been expanding and this season an alltime high of one lakh hectare was under potato cultivation, with 25-lakh tonne production expected.Last season, the area under potato cultivation stood at 70,000-80,000 hectares.Although the quantum of export is negligible as compared to the total production, it will give a fillip to the trade, he said.He, however, questioned the delay in listening to the farmers, who had to bear heavy losses, and suggested export of the produce should be made a regular exercise.Jalandhar potato growers association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha said big growers have offered their produce for export for free and the income generated by the corporation could be passed on to farmers after recovery of payments from the foreign buyers. To help small farmers, we have offered to lift their produce at Rs 4 to Rs 5 a kilogram, he said.WHY PRICES CRASHEDFollowing the Centres demonetisation move, traders stopped lifting the produce. Seeing the drop in demand, cold storage owners refused to stock the crop.If farmers are not able to sell their produce, they will not be in position to pay for the storage charges, reasoned a cold storage owner. There are 500 cold storages in Punjab, with a combined capacity of 25 lakh tonne.Seeing the plight of farmers, the state government had asked deputy commissioners to ensure cold storage owners dont fleece them."
58fedb067be9e0429666a8d3,Yogi government's market intervention strategy: A cool move or a hot potato?,http://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-government-s-market-intervention-strategy-a-cool-move-or-a-hot-potato/story-o3E0FMSg1qAekNjGDLNs7L.html,2017-04-24,"In a first for Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi Adityanath government has offered a support price for potato and promised to procure 1 lakh metric tons of this vegetable at Rs 487 per quintal as a lifeline for farmers.Realising the challenge of managing a bumper crop of potatoes in a state where prices fluctuate greatly between different bulk markets or mandis, the UP government has come up with a unique plan of inter-market fine-balancing of potato supply to keep the price within the acceptable range.The potato crop is sown between September and December and is ready in three months with the last lot being harvested in March.The state government has ordered district magistrates and horticulture officers to keep a close watch on price fluctuations of potato this summer and undertake the juggling act to ensure supply of potato in adequate amount from low-priced districts to high-priced ones where the 19 bulk markets of the state exist.POTATO CULTIVATION HUBS Agra, Firozabad, Hathras, Kannauj, Farrukhabad, Aligarh, Badaun, Etawah, Mathura, Mainpuri and Barabanki districts produce about 64% of the total crop of the state, said Dina Nath Shukla, an agriculture expert and professor of botany at Allahabad University. He has done a wide-ranging research on potato and the diseases affecting it.He said Uttar Pradesh was the biggest producer of potatoes in the country amounting, to 29-35% of the total national production.Ground reports said 2016-17 saw potato cultivation in an area of 6.14 lakh hectare across the state with an expected production of 155 to 160 lakh metric ton.With the BJP having made huge promises to farmers during assembly polls, handling of the potato harvest will be the first true test of the Yogi government, especially in light of UP being the largest producer of potatoes in the country where lakhs of farmers cultivate this cash crop. Last year, thousands of potato farmers were forced to dump their crop, leaving it to rot owing to very poor price being offered for their produce in the market.To ensure that all promises are kept, the state government, based on recommendations of an expert committee, has come up with a market intervention strategy to handle the potato harvest in the state.Based on it, the principal secretary (horticulture) Sudhir Garg has shared that a scrutiny of the 19 bulk markets or mandis of the state has shown that on April 10, 2017, the bulk price of potatoes varied between Rs 290 and Rs 690 per quintal.Garg has communicated this information through a government order sent to director (horticulture and food processing department).Potato sold at Rs 290 per quintal, the lowest in the state, in Farrukhabad and at Rs 680 per quintal, the highest, in Lucknow.Further scrutiny of the markets has shown that in districts like Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Moradabad, Allahabad, Kanpur, Farrukhabad, Meerut and Saharanpur the bulk price of potato was Rs 400 or less per quintal on April 3, 2017. Its price was Rs 500 or above in districts like Gonda, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Mirzapur and Varanasi.The order says that the government believes that timely and adequate supply of potato from low-priced markets to high priced ones can help achieve a balance in pricing that benefits both farmers and consumers.The government wants the district magistrates and the district horticulture officers to not just get the potato prices printed in local dailies but also through coordination with their counterparts of other districts facilitate flow of potato from low priced districts to markets in high- priced ones.The state government also plans to send potato to other states with support of their agriculture ministers via respective distribution agencies and marketing federations and tapping the e-NAM or e-national agriculture market.Welcome step but support price too low: ExpertExperts believe that extending support price for potato, which is the most important cash crop of UP, is a welcome step. However, they say the support price of Rs 487 per quintal is too low, especially as a bulk of the potato farmers are small scale cultivators.Out of the states total production, around 75 lakh metric ton is consumed by the people and around 7 lakh metric ton is used for processed food. Another 20 lakh metric ton is used as seed. The surplus is exported to other states and even abroad, including Nepal, said prof Pradeep Bhargava, a noted development economist.Uttar Pradesh has 1708 private and government cold storages at present with storage capacity of 130.26 lakh metric ton, amounting to 81% of the expected produce.The state government has said that till March 31, 2017, 96.49 lakh metric ton of potatoes, 74% of the storage capacity, had already been achieved.When there is a bumper harvest, the governments move will enable farmers to get at least the minimum support price. This is a welcome step. However, the support price should have been much higher so as to ensure a decent minimum earning for small-scale farmers who farm on 1 to 5 bigha land so that it justifies their investments and helps make enough money to promote farming and also support their livelihood, he added.Prof Bhargava says that on the face of it, the fact that cost of production on average is Rs 28,000 per hectare and the return is Rs 84,000 per hectare seems impressive. However, when the farmer is small scale and sells potato at a price of Rs 4.87 per kilogram earning hardly Rs 8,400 per bigha, he ends up with hardly enough to justify his investments and labour of three-four months. A better support price therefore is needed, he added."
58fedbe67be9e0429666a989,Snack and the city: How the vada pav has kept up with Mumbai's appetite,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ht-mumbai-meri-hai-vada-pav-a-migrant-learn-city-s-history-through-the-humble-snack/story-zLC1Jwbp7uZGugizovOL2I.html,2017-04-17,"Its a fairly odd recipe, as recipes go  carbs dipped in more carbs, wrapped in carbs.But thats no accident. The vada pav is the answer to a riddle from the last century: What filling snack can you offer a mill worker with just a few annas and no time to sit and eat?Even before the vada pav, its ingredients  chilli, garlic and potato  were already favourites, says food historian Kurush Dalal. What the stalls of the 1960s did, was take the migrant workers average meal and package it to go. And that just worked. It soon became a hit with students or whoever had little money to spend, but wanted a good snack. It is only later that it has become an identity of Mumbai itself. Now, everyone who comes to Mumbai tries the vada pav, he says.Today, you cant turn a corner without running into fresh, hot vadas served with garlic powder, teekha-meetha chutneys (imli and green chilli), and fried chillies on the side.You already want one, dont you? Chances are youve had at least one in the past month. And it may not have been at a pavement stall either.You can now order Mumbais favourite snack at trendy cafs and casual fine-dining restaurants in the city. Sometimes itll come to you in the form of a slider; other times, its deconstructed.Its a fairly well-travelled little fellow too. You can now get a vada pav in London, New York or Sydney  granted, you will have to ask for the Bombay burger when you order.Its been a symbol, snack and political icon. At each stage of the citys transformation, it has acted as a mirror  going corporate at the turn of the century, saffron in the oughts, and taking to casual fine-dining in the early parts of this decade.Its a migrant too!Interestingly, the vada pavs core ingredients arent really local. The pav is a legacy of the Portuguese; the potato and groundnut came to us from the Americas, also via the Portuguese. The garlic is localand the chickpea batter.Like any good Mumbaiite, the snack is supremely adaptable. Its many things to many people, often at the same time.In 2008, for instance, it became a political statement when the Shiv Sena launched more than 100 Shiv Vada Pav stalls across the city. As Sena legislator Anil Parab puts it, It is a part of Mumbais culture. Several people who had vada pav stalls were Shiv Sena supporters already, so the party felt it would do well for the business and the city to turn it into a brand.These stalls werent the snacks political debut either. Theres a theory that the vada pav has its very roots in the Senas battle to establish a Marathi identity as the basis of Mumbais melting-pot culture.In the 1960s, some Shiv Sena protest signs read Idli dosa bhagao [Stop idli and dosa], referencing the two iconic snack foods of Tamil Nadu, as Sainiks attacked South Indian Udipi restaurants because the party founder, Bal Thackeray, accused south Indians of taking jobs that rightly belonged to the Marathi manoos, says Harris Solomon, a professor of cultural anthropology at Americas Duke University, in a paper titled The Taste No Chef Can Give: Processing Street Food in Mumbai, published in 2015.It was then, as a counter to the increasingly popular idlis and dosas and as a way to promote entrepreneurship, that the party first encouraged Maharashtrians to start their own vada pav stalls.It was about encouraging the Marathi people to turn entrepreneurs instead of hunting for jobs, says Parab.#MumbaiMeriHai What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city? We will trace the roots of Mumbais most popular street foods, drop in at its maidans, explore the workings of its stock markets and that grand dream machine that is Bollywood. We would like to hear from you too.Tweet, Istagram your favourite pictures of the city with #MumbaiMeriHai, or write to us at @htmetro@hindustantimes.comPav wowTwo decades on, came the real boost for the vada pav.When the citys textile mills began to close in the 1980s and people needed income, they sold vada pav outside the mills. The rest of the mill workers would pass their former colleagues on the streets selling vada pav, and buy from them, Solomon writes.Then came the post-liberalisation boom. In 2001, Dheeraj Gupta launched Jumbo King Vada Pav, with its first outlet outside Malad railway station.This was followed by trendy kiosk-style outlets with names such as Goli Vada Pav (2004) and Wow Vada Pav (2012).With their shiny clean interiors, quirky combinations and customisable toppings, they soon became popular.All three now have scores of outlets across the country  from Jharkhand to Uttarakhand and Hyderabad to Delhi.Somewhere in Ranchi, then, there is someone eating what started out as a mill workers snack, now available in local flavours  with chhole, for instance, or achari-flavoured.We think of the vada as the ultimate finger food, says Gupta. And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers. Weve made no changes and have no secret recipe. It just works, and has kept working.The many avatas of the Vada Pav DECONSTRUCTED At Farzi Caf (top) and SpiceKlub, you get potato mousse or patties accompanied by smears or pouches of chutneys, sprinkled with lasoon chutney, sev, fried chillies and curry leaves IN A BAO Casual fine-dine restaurants such as the popular Social chain put the patty in a soft Chinese bun called a bao. Accompaniments include a lehsun chutney mayonnaise. AS A SIZZLER At outlets of Bar Stock Exchange, the vadas come with a side of vegetables, cumin rice and kachumber, topped with AS A SALAD Dishkiyaoon in BKC serves the potato patty comes with salad leaves, pomegranate and a pinch of farsan.Smart casualWith the boom in disposable incomes and the mushrooming of stand-alone restaurants, the vada pav went smart casual.The changing economy changed the way people snacked too, says Mumbai columnist and city chronicler Smruti Koppikar. Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food. Like any true Mumbaiite, the vada pav is at its best under pressure and on the move."

The central bank left policy lending rate (repo) unchanged and hiked borrowing rates (reverse repo) at the last policy review on April 7.RBI has already signalled that uncertain monsoon and low statistical base effect will keep CPI inflation at 4.5% in the first half and 5% in the second half of 2017-18. The government may also increase the minimum support prices (MSPs) of crops, which will put an upward pressure on inflation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.A pick up in new currency in circulation helped revive consumer demand after a bout of severe cash crunch during the demonetisation drive of November-December of 2016.The March inflation number was still higher compared with the 0.45% fall in WPI during March 2016, as prices of petrol, diesel and minerals, firmed up due to an upward trend in global prices.Festival demand pushed up prices of vegetables by 5.7% and fruits by 7.6%. However, potato prices fell 17%, onion 10.8% and pulses 6.1% from a year ago.Mineral prices were up 23.5% while fuels were costlier by 18.2% as petrol and diesel prices were revised up.Last week, government data showed a rise in the prices of sugar, confectionary, snacks and fruits during Holi pushed up Indias consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3.81% in March from 3.65% in February.The slowing pace of remonetisation, or pumping new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes into circulation, during March to replace the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, helped inflation to stay within 4% in the financial year ending March 2017.Consumption and investment activity were dampened after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the bold decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.While the demonetisation weeded out Rs 15.44 lakh crore or 86% of currency from circulation, the government and RBI has been able to pump in about Rs 13.35 lakh crore worth of new notes so far."

Owners have invested money to realise a dreamBorivli is a suburb located along the western suburban line of Mumbai and has several eating joints, including themed restaurants. As one stands in front of the well-known Esspee Tower near the Borivli railway station, an aquarium shop, a rather big one, lit up well and spic and span, stands out.As one approaches the shop, the visitor would see Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd, one of the biggest aquarium shops of Mumbai and Caf Hydro, the first aquarium-themed caf in the country with the biggest fish tunnel.Such aquarium cafs or ocean restaurants are quite common in some of the big tourist destinations in the world. In India it is the first of its kind with a fish tunnel or an aquarium tunnel. In the country, there are several restaurants with an aquarium or a fish tank or an aquarium wall.For 41-year-old Rupesh Sakpal, the director of Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd and Caf Hydro, this was not the first time that he had made an aquarium tunnel. The dream project of Rupesh is at Rajendra Nagar at Dattapada Road at Borivli East. In fact, Borivli is a bustling tourist destination and a happening place in the suburbs. When the Taraporewala Aquarium on Marine Drive was refurbished a few years ago, Sakpals company was tasked to create a 180-degree acrylic glass tunnel of 10x15 sq feet.A restaurant was on the back of my mind. We thought why not to make it more interesting. An aquarium always attracts crowd. In fact, in a restaurant where there is a fish tank, people prefer to sit by its side and dine. I thought of giving a different experience altogether, said Rupesh, explaining his pet project.The 17x15 sq ft fish tunnel is at the level-2 of Caf Hydro. The level-3 has a huge wall aquarium. Setting this up was a challenge and we decided to give it a try, adds Rupeshs uncle Manohar Sakpal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bhagirathi Group.With a variety of colourful, exotic, big and small fish of over a dozen varieties gliding around and excellent lighting, you are in a different world. When you have a meal, there is nothing like it, said Shaibal Gupta, a foodie who had dined at Caf Hydro.Manohar supported Rupesh, who has a Bachelor of Fisheries Science degree, when he started a 100 sq ft aquarium shop on September 9, 1999, near the Borivli railway station. His three-storeyed aquarium shop and caf now are spread over 10,000 sq ft.The ground floor or level one is filled with youngsters and has a feel of Mumbais local trains. It has been constructed using train tracks, train floors, sleepers, racks, ladders and a blue-coloured staircase. The roof has several artwork and bottles.The one-stop pet mall restaurant has been set up at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore. We have made investments to realise the dream. We are very clear that aquarium is our core business and everything will revolve around it, said Rupesh, who is also developing a public aquarium in Ranchi in Jharkhand. We have to look at hygiene and service and nearly 100 people work round the clock in three shifts, he said as he attended phone calls.After Caf Hydro was inaugurated on January 26 this year, the number of calls have increased. Several corporate houses want to visit, do group bookings or have a similar aquarium in their offices and workplaces, he said. Nowadays people are looking for what is known as a stress-buster aquarium.Paste food, which is made of proteins of fish, is the unique concept of this restaurant. There are variety of delicious dishes like fish bao, fish burger, fish hotdog, fish bullets, fish cake roll.I stay in Borivli and came to know about it and decided to visit the place.

WPI was 3.15% in November.Price rise in vegetables printed at (-)33.11% in December, prices of onions fell (-)37.20%. Prices of fruits, potato and pulses grew on a slower clip leading to a contraction in inflation in food basket of (-)0.70%.Price rise in fuel and power segment rose 8.65% in December. While the prices of diesel rose more than 20%, petrol became dearer by over 8%.The WPI data comes on the back of consumer price inflation easing to 3.41% in December from 3.63% in November.Reacting to the WPI data, Ficci said, broadly prices remain benign which bodes well for the economy. Even though upside risks have been indicated by RBI in its last monetary policy assessment, prices are expected to follow RBIs indicative trajectory this year, At this juncture, it remains critical to further growth considerations.The latest index of industrial production numbers have reported an improvement; but this has come on the back of a favourable base. For a sustained turnaround, we will need to keep the focus on reforms. The forthcoming Union Budget is being looked forward to with great anticipation and should focus on driving consumption, investment and job creation.DH News Service"

Despite good crop yield, they are not even able to recover the input cost of their produce.Uttar Pradesh witnessed an increase of about 20% this year in the areas under potato cultivation. There has been increased production as the weather too remained conducive, said Ram Saran Verma, a leading farmer of Barabanki who has introduced many innovations in potato farming.Farmers are getting Rs 3-4 per kg in the wholesale market for potato that is being sold at Rs 8-10 in the market. The cost of production alone has been around Rs 4 per kg and thus farmers are running into losses, said Verma.Kannauj, Barabanki, Farukkhabad, Firozabad and Agra are some big potato producing areas in UP.The scenario is same in other potato producing states, including West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar, where potato has been priced almost at the same rate in the wholesale markets.The reason for low prices is very good yield this season. Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP. But as production has been good this time, these storages are likely to be full to capacity and farmers would have to sell off their produce at low prices.Farmers who manage to get their potatoes stored will be safe. But others are sure to incur huge losses. About 30% of the produce is likely to get either spoiled or farmers will be forced to sell it off for Rs 1-2 per kg, said Verma.Read more: Prepare roadmap to prevent farmer suicides, SC tells government"

There has been experience of imposing labels on junk food in some countries part of one of the recommendation on the food, said the FSSAI chief.Pawan Kumar Agarwal, CEO of Foods Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). (via Livemint)The FSSAI came into prominence after the Nestle Maggi fiasco, soon after which Agarwal joined as its CEO. An officer with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Agarwal, sees a huge requirement to make people aware and educate them about food, and help them follow a healthy diet.In the past, he has brought large temples and mosques under the regulators surveillance. Shree Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai, Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Tirupati and Sai Baba temple in Shirdi, follow safety standards for the Prasad or bhog that they offer to its devotees.The regulators move to introduce junk food label comes at a time when India is going through an era of higher degree of urbanisation. A large number of small towns and cities are being exposed to the American burgers and Italian pastas, and millions of kids are acquiring new tastes. This has led to a debate on introducing a fat tax on junk food.There is a larger problem  obesity. India ranks third after the US and China, with 41 million obese people, according to Global Burden of Disease Study.To control the growing problem, FSSAI had set up a committee to prepare guidelines on healthy diet for Indians. The committee has made eight recommendations in the report, and a lot of it is about public education, Agarwal added.So will there be a special label for junk food? Agarwal said it is under consideration and a final decision will be taken soon.FSSAIs bigger problem will be to regulate local shops selling Indian fried snacks such as samosa and cutlets. That is the challenge There are practical difficulties in the Indian context for street food. You can do it in potato chips, but if someone sells a samosa on the street, it is difficult, Agarwal said.However, Agarwal is not giving up yet. Based on the committee report, he has chaired multiple discussions to see how street food vendors can be regulated. We are applying our mind because there is a lot of public interest Large, vocal and articulate consumer organisations say that something should be done, but the practical problems have to be taken into consideration, Agarwal said."

Its poetic, yes - pure music to film geeks the world over, yes. A work of movie marketing genius, by most accounts. But its a tagline. And almost 40 years have passed, but no other has come even remotely close to capturing the tone of the movie its selling with such concise, chilling and underappreciated success.Its not often we talk about movie taglines. But this one, for Ridley Scotts classic creature feature Alien, is worth talking about, even 40 years after audiences first saw it on that equally iconic poster. Especially now that Life, the new space thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson, is out. The movie is, to put it plainly, like a mutated clone birthed in a secret government lab using smuggled Alien DNA, but unlike the dozens of other films it has inspired, Life probably comes closest to not seeming like an out and out rip off, and takes, against all expectations, a life of its own.For one, its remarkably well made. Almost too well made in fact, for the sort of film it is (a largely derivative thriller which borrows heavily not only from the goofy monster movies of the 50s, but also from gory 80s horror and pulpy 90s action).In it, a crew of six racially and culturally diverse astronauts carrying out important scientific experiments on the International Space Station intercepts a cargo vessel which is said to have discovered a mysterious organism on Mars. Its microscopic, a single cell of life that in itself is an achievement worth writing home about.And indeed, back on Earth, everyones losing their minds over what important heads on Times Squares massive LED screens are calling the greatest discovery in the history of mankind. And our brave crew is tasked with bringing it back home. But over the next few weeks, what used to look like a wondrous, inanimate version of Baby Groot begins showing signs of intelligence. At first, its just small movements; a slight twitch, a steady growth in size, a noticeable reaction to its environment, to touch, to warmth. But before you can say Run! the tiny cell (which theyve christened Calvin, the idiots) begins consuming literally everything it can sense in the goriest, most stomach-churning manner possible.It is explained to us, in just one scene of expertly crafted terror, that there is no stopping Calvin. It will continue getting stronger. It will continue getting bigger. It will continue killing. One by one.And in space, no one can hear you scream.What struck me most about Life was how well it was written. Really, its so rare these days to see such a solidly put together piece of popcorn entertainment. By definition, these movies are supposed to be filled with plot holes and cardboard characters, convenient contrivances and pathetic, laughable dialogue. But not Life, no.You couldnt tell it, but its the handiwork of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, whom the nerdiest of readers will remember as the real heroes behind Deadpool. With Life, theyve managed to deliver a masterclass in blockbuster movie writing. Its a meta commentary on the very nature of these movies  especially the violent slasher horror films it so lovingly rips off.Theres so much that could have gone wrong. God knows we see it happen often enough. Theres so much explaining to do, made up science-y gobbledygook to deliver with a straight face, so many wafer thin characters to develop just enough for us to care about their survival.Remember how The Martian made you feel like a genius? How every time Matt Damon would explain a complicated potato farming scheme, and youd nod away like it was Nigella Lawson whispering a cake recipe? Well, Life chooses to completely ignore exposition, which, if you really think about it, is a rather bold move.Sure, this also means that a lot of plot elements remain mostly unexplained. And sure, the whole thing looks like Gravity, sounds like Interstellar and feels like Alien anyway, but it never explains itself, or feels the need to explain itself. And soon, as you are wont to do when faced with these situations, you stop resisting. You stop comparing it to the other films its borrowing from, simply because of the honesty with which it is going about it.And finally, a word about director Daniel Espinosa, who I feel never really lived up to the promise of his terrific Swedish debut Snabba Cash. He was given several big-ticket projects to work on when he moved to Hollywood (he first worked with Ryan Reynolds in Safe House, and then with Tom Hardy in Child 44), but be honest, do you remember either of those movies? And he very nearly stuffs up the landing in this one too (the final scene simply doesnt work). But the movie leading up to it is made with such well-oiled precision, delights in such gleefully claustrophobic chills, its difficult to resist.So dont.Watch the Life trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"
58feee957be9e0429666b8cb,Top 16 decisions in 30 days:&thinsp;Yogi Adityanath's first month as Uttar Pradesh chief...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/16-decisions-in-30-days-yogi-adityanath-s-first-month-as-uttar-pradesh-chief-minister/story-ie7VVu00sxZJB7KjLj2g2N.html,2017-04-19,"Yogi Adityanath, who completes one month as Uttar Pradesh chief minister on Wednesday, has hit the ground running, grabbing headlines with a series of decisions ranging from banning paan and gutkha at government offices to cracking down on illegal slaughterhouses and setting up anti-Romeo squads.A new chief minister usually begins his stint by overhauling the bureaucracy, but Adityanath did not make changes immediately after assuming office. He retained former chief minister Akhilesh Yadavs set-up, but warned officers against laxity.He effected his first major administrative reshuffle on April 12, three weeks after taking charge, and shunted 20 senior IAS officers, putting eight of them on the waitlist. He transferred 44 IAS officers on Tuesday, the eve of his one-month completion in office.A list of his key decisions and directives:1) ASSET DECLARATION: An hour after he took oath on March 19, Adityanath ordered all ministers to declare their income, movable and immovable properties within 15 days. He asked them to submit declarations to the CM secretariat.He also made them take an oath of cleanliness and honesty. He made it clear that his government will have zero tolerance on corruption and law and order. Though not all ministers and officers have come forward to declare their assets, Adityanath is unrelenting and has demanded adherence to the new deadline.2) CLEANLINESS: Adityanath administered an oath of cleanliness and honesty to his ministers. He has fixed Friday as the day when the state staff must tidy up workspaces. He asked them to devote two hours per week to cleanliness. He also asked them to read the BJPs 2017 poll manifesto and mull over how to implement them in their respective departments, besides making budgetary provisions for it.3) PAAN BAN: On the second day as CM, Yogi ordered a ban on paan masala and gutkha consumption in government offices, hospitals and schools.4) MEAT CRACKDOWN: He ordered a crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses, meat shops and cow smuggling. Some meat shops were burnt, and traders went on strike, drying up supply. The government has clarified that only illegal abattoirs were targeted.5) ANTI-ROMEO SQUADS: The CM also asked for setting up of anti-Romeo squads across the state to check harassment of women. When the anti-Romeo action created an outrage with the way police responded, Adityanath on March 25 ordered framing of guidelines and said the police should not be inhuman while implementing it.Polices anti-Romeo squad questions a couple in Jhansi on March 22. (HT FILE PHOTO)6) SETTING THE AGENDA WITH MODI: On March 21, Adityanath went to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss distribution of portfolios to his ministers. He also informed the PM that MPs were lobbying for transfers, postings of officers. Modi, on March 23, ordered all MPs not to interfere in transfers and postings.7) CLOSING POTHOLES: On March 25, Adityanath set a deadline of June 15 for making all UP roads pothole-free.8) METRO IN GORAKHPUR: The new CM has also announced Metro train projects for Gorakhpur (his Lok Sabha constituency) and Jhansi.9) CRACKDOWN ON LAXITY: During a visit to Gorakhpur, Adityanath said those officers who cannot work 18-20 hours were free to leave. He also said that the state will promote regional dialects. The state government staff began sticking to 9am-6pm duty hours in office following surprise inspections by various ministers.10) FARM LOAN WAIVER: At its first meeting on April 4, the state cabinet waived farm loans up to Rs 1 lakh each of small and marginal farmers. This waiver was among the top promises in the BJP manifesto.The decision is projected to cost the state exchequer more than Rs 36,000 crore and benefit approximately 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers across the state.The cabinet also approved the construction of a sports stadium in Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The region has been Adityanaths area of political influence. He is a five-time MP from Gorakhpur since 1998.11) WHEAT AND POTATO PROCUREMENT: The government announced setting up of 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state and projected that it will buy 80 lakh metric tonnes from farmers. It also announced it will buy potato at Rs 487 per quintal from farmers.12) INDUSTRIAL POLICY: The government has announced that it will form a new industrial policy soon.13) POWER SUPPLY: Last week, the Adityanath government also signed an agreement with the Centre assuring 24-hour power supply to the district headquarters, 20-hour supply at tehsil level and in Bundelkhand region, and 18 hours in rural areas. The government declared that by November 2018, all the villages and households in the state will get power supply.14) REGULATION OF FEE IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS: The state government announced that it will form rules to check and regulate fee in private institutions. The government has asked all such institutions to submit their fee structure to the administration.15) MORE MEDICAL COLLEGES: The government has said it will set up 25 medical colleges in the state in five years.16) NAMING IAF TERMINALS: At Tuesdays cabinet meet, on the eve of completion of one month in office, the BJP government decided to name the civil terminal at IAF airfield in Agra after BJP ideologue Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and the civil terminal at the IAF airfield in Gorakhpur after Mayayogi Gorakhnath."
