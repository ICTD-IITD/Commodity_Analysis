The two paintings were wrapped in cotton sheets, stuffed in a box and hidden behind a wall in a toilet, said General Gianluigi DAlfonso of the Italian financial police, who was on hand at the museum for the ceremonial unveiling.The paintings were found in a farmhouse near Naples as Italian police seized 20 million euros worth of assets, including villas, apartments and even a small airplane. Investigators contend the assets are linked to two Camorra drug kingpins, Mario Cerrone and Raffaele Imperiale.After years shrouded in darkness, they can now shine again, said Jet Bussemaker, the Dutch minister for education, culture and science said as an orange screen slid away to reveal the two paintings behind a glass wall.The canvas View of the Sea at Scheveningen, one of the two recovered paintings. (Reuters)One of the two men convicted of stealing the paintings told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that said he originally wanted to steal Van Goghs world famous Sunflowers painting, but it was too well protected.Another well-known Van Gogh work, The Potato Eaters, was too big to get through the hole that Octave Durham and his accomplice smashed in the security glass to get into the museum after clambering over a fence and using a ladder to get onto its roof.Durham, who was sentenced to 3 1 /2 years in prison after being convicted in 2004, told De Telegraaf that the paintings were sold to the mafia after a Dutch criminal who had agreed to buy them was murdered.Experts said they suffered remarkably little damage even as the thieves in 2002 ripped them out of their frames and fled.It is not only a miracle that the works have been recovered but its even more miraculous almost that they are in relatively unharmed condition, Rueger said.The museum director was on vacation when the call came last year from Italian authorities who believed they had recovered the paintings. He didnt celebrate right away; hed had calls like this before.I was hopeful but also a little hesitant, because over the course of the years we had multiple occasions when people phoned us, contacted us, claiming that they knew something about the whereabouts of the works. And each time it was false, the trace went cold, he said. The way has been peppered with disappointment.But museum experts dispatched to Italy to check the authenticity of the works quickly turned Ruegers doubts into delight.The canvas Congregation Leaving The Reformed Church in Nuenen, one of the two recovered paintings. (Reuters)It was something we had secretly been hoping for, for all those years, he said.The two small works are not typical of Van Goghs later and better-known works, but are still vital pieces for the museums collection, Rueger said.The Scheveningen seascape, with a fishing boat and rough sea under a typically gray, cloudy Dutch sky, is one of Van Goghs earliest works. It is the only painting in the museums collection painted during his time in The Hague. It suffered a missing rectangular chip from the bottom left-hand corner.The painting of the church in Nuenen portrayed the village where his parents lived.He had painted as a gift to his mother, so its a very personal and emotional connection, Rueger said.Rueger said the paintings are now back for good at a museum, which is home to dozens of works by Van Gogh, whose paintings fetch millions of dollars on the rare occasions they come up for auction.The security, I can assure you, is of Triple-A quality now. So Im very confident that everything is safe in the museum, he said."

Instead, childrens palate is assaulted with unhealthy food high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and low on essential nutrients they need to grow mentally and physically.Chips, sweetened beverages, instant noodles, fries, samosas, bread pakoras and patties are the standard fare in most school cafeterias. When schools ban them, enterprising vendors set up makeshift kiosks and sell meals-on-bicycles outside schools. With no running water or quality control for cooking and storing, most children end up with empty calories and very often, gut-destroying germs.All refined, fried and processed foods are just empty calories because most of the essential sugar and fat the body needs is present naturally in food, such as sugar in fruits and fat in dairy, seeds, nuts, meats and cooking oil, says Rahul Verma, founder of the Delhi-based non-profit Uday Foundation, which filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court in December 2010 asking for a ban on the sale of junk food in schools. Though traditional snacks are freshly made and do not have additives such as colour and preservatives added to them, they are usually high in low quality oils, salts and sugars, Verma underlines.In March 2015, the Delhi High Court asked the administrator of Delhi to issue healthy eating guidelines under Rule 43 of the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, and directed the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to formulate guidelines, which have since been circulated but are not binding.While many private schools in Delhi and Mumbai have not waited for government guidelines and moved towards healthier snacks years ago, Punjab, where the states child rights commission banned junk food in schools in January 2016, unhealthy foods are still widely available.Delhis Springdales School, Pusa Road, removed fried snacks and aerated drinks from their canteen menu a decade ago. The shift in the attitude occurred after a survey showed 70% of the students were overweight and were either suffering from associated conditions or would grow up to be unhealthy adults.Children have only one meal in school during recess. To make the child healthy over-all, we have to involve the parents. Too many children were getting two-minute noodles, fried potato taters or foods high on sugar and fats, says Ameeta Wattal, principal, Springdales, where poha, idli sambar and wholewheat sandwiches are sold along with drinks like lassi, chaach and lime juice.Read | Out of the box: Healthy eating is now part of school lunchroomsThese foods are also part of the cafeteria menu at Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, where the menu is changed periodically to include seasonal vegetables. The school also has a committee  consisting of teachers, students and some parents who work in the field of nutrition -- that monitor the nutrition value of the food, the taste and the oil it is cooked in. Our canteen is outsourced, but we strictly monitor it to make sure that the quality of the food is maintained, says Manohar Lal, principal of the school.In Lucknows La Martiniere Girls College, children are encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables from kindergarten. The practice was introduced by our former principal Late Farida Abraham and it is still continuing, vice-principal Aashrita Dass told HT.In Mumbai, parents associations are sore at the lack of guidelines in Maharashtra. Schools receive cutbacks from vendors, and canteen contractors also prefer such items because it boosts their sales, says Jayant Jain, president, Forum for Fairness in Education, a parent-teacher body.Read | Boys in India eat better than girls: Oxford studyEven education officials admit they do not check whether schools serve junk food as there is no regulation against it so far. We cannot stop a school from serving junk food, as there is no official ban in place. We can at best advise them to opt for healthier choices, concedes BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai division.While many schools said it is difficult to restrict junk food in its vicinity, some have come up with innovative ways to restrict fast food in the campus: Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri serves fresh, hot and hygienic food breakfast and lunch on campus and doesnt allow home food to ensure parents dont send unhealthy food. Aerated drinks are banned.At Ryan International, Kandivali, teachers patrol the streets after school to ensure children walking out dont stop at the nearby McDonalds or other junk food joints.In government-run schools, the hot meals provided under the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (Mid Day Meal Scheme) are nutritive and safe but remain a challenge in many districts. The scheme was launched to increase enrolment, retention and attendance while improving the nutrition levels of children by giving them 300 calories of energy, 8-12 gm of protein and adequate micronutrients.The meals were not good enough to keep children in school. A 2015 audit of the action taken on the Comptroller and Auditor Generals 2008 Report on Mid Day Meal Scheme showed that the enrolment of children in the midday meals-covered schools dropped from 14.69 crore in 2009-10 to 13.87 crore in 2013-14, while enrolment in private schools shot up by 38% in the same period.The audit also found children were given less than the prescribed quantity of 100/150 gms of foodgrains and prescribed inspections were not carried out to ensure quality. Most schools sample checked in the audit were lacking in infrastructural facilities like kitchen sheds, proper utensils, availability of drinking water facility etc. There were several instances of food being cooked in the open in unhygienic conditions, the report found.Few lessons seem to have been learnt from the shocking case of negligence that left 23 children dead and dozens others seriously ill after they ate a pesticide-laced midday-meal at a primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman in the Saran district in Bihar in July 2013. A month later, 30 children fell ill in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh; and in November 2014, 25 children fell ill after eating their mid-day meal at a government school in Gaya district in Bihar.In July 2016,40 students fell ill in Chincholi village of Adilabad district of Telangana after eating food prepared in the school kitchen for a farewell party for seniors. In September that year, 25 students were hospitalised in Kolar district in KarnatakaIn September 2015, about 150 students in Chandoor town and Ilapuram village in Telangana started vomiting after their mid-day meal.Such cases of food poisoning are very rare and take place in remote areas due to lack of proper supervision and maintenance of kitchen. Otherwise, there is a periodical check on the quality of food by officials, parents committees and teachers. Even we eat the same food regularly to ensure the quality, said L Ravinder Rao, a senior headmaster in a government school in Ranga Reddy district of Telangana."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal.

Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though.

The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

Now, even the safest of SP seats might see a tough contest.The BSP, with only six MLAs, and the BJP, with five, are trying their best to take advantage of the Yadav family feud.Sundays polling will decide the fates of Shivpal Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadavs younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, his nephew Anurag Yadav and Akhileshs aide Anurag Singh.Also in the fray are BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who is fighting against Aparna Yadav, SP ministers Nitin Agarwal and Abhishek Mishra and BSP heavyweight Nakul Dubey.SP minister and MP Naresh Agrawals son Nitin is contesting from Hardoi while minister Farid Mahmood Kidwail is contesting from his current seat Kursi (in Barabanki). Another minister, Arvind Singh Gope is fighting to retain his Ramnagar seat in Barabanki.Union home minister Rajnath Singhs influence on the five Lucknow seats under his Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency, will come under test.The polls will also tell whether the big-ticket projects of Akhilesh Yadav government in Lucknowthe Metro, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Gomti River Frontwill convert into votes.Unlike the previous two phases, the third phase has the highest number of big fights, and figures many first-timers among the 826 candidates.The phase will be critical for both Akhilesh and Shivpal, who were locked in a bruising months-long feud for party control. The chief ministers move to replace 20 winners with new candidates will be put to test.

It remains common among Muslim families even in Jakarta, although doctors there typically carry out a less extreme form of the procedure that involves pricking the clitoral hood with a needle.In an effort to accommodate cultural and religious considerations, the government has moved away from previous attempts to ban the practice entirely and has instead sought to stamp out the more harmful methods and ensure safety.Authorities insist the methods most commonly used in Indonesia -- usually involving a pin prick -- do not amount to female genital mutilation.The methods used in Indonesia are generally less harsh than the most brutal forms of FGM found mainly in African and Middle Eastern countries, that can go as far as total removal of the clitoris.Read: Female circumcision: A cruel practice that numbs womens sexual pleasureThe UN, however, disagrees with the Indonesian governments stance, classifying FGM among harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes and has passed two resolutions aimed at stopping it worldwide in recent years.The global body says FGM has no health benefits and can cause many problems, such as infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications.Not in KoranDebate within Indonesia has been heating up in recent times, with activists and even a major Muslim organisation arguing against female circumcision, saying it violates a womans right to do as she wishes with her body.I believe there are no verses in my religion that allow female circumcision -- it is not in the Koran, Khorirah Ali, a member of the government-backed national commission on violence against women, said.The countrys second-biggest Muslim organisation, Muhammadiyah, discourages its followers from partaking in circumcision but the largest, Nahdlatul Ulama, and the countrys top Islamic authority the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) is still in favour.The issue is a hot potato and the government has flip-flopped in recent years.Also read: Over 800 girls circumcised in Tanzania despite govt crackdown on FGMIn 2006, the health ministry banned doctors from carrying out female circumcision, saying there was no medical benefit -- but the MUI hit back with a fatwa saying that women who undergo the procedure would be considered noble.The government backtracked several years later and said licensed medics could conduct the procedure as long as it was only scratching the clitoral hood, only to later void this measure in favour of asking a specially appointed council to issue safety guidelines.Campaigners say the constant changes have created confusion about what is allowed and more harmful practices -- such as those used in Gorontalo -- continue to exist.Despite the opposition, the practice is unlikely to end soon in the country of 255 million people.Jurnalis Uddin, an expert on female circumcision from Jakarta-based Yarsi University, and a member of the governments advisory council, said the focus should be on encouraging the less harmful methods.To get rid of the practice completely is like swimming against the current, he said."

While these figured in the political manifestos of all the prominent parties, these were only in the form of sweeping statements promising pothole-free roads and rejuvenation of open spaces that have formed the fine print of most manifestos for at least the past two civic polls. The parties offered no clarity on how they plan to achieve this, neither in their manifestos, nor in the public addresses and rallies of its major leaders.Ashoke Pandit, a citizen activist from Juhu, said, No one reads manifesto. It is a cut-paste paper work. I wanted to know what will be offered to me in next five years, but all I heard was abuses thrown against each other. This took over all the important issues that needed to be addressed.Mumbai has been grappling with inadequate open spaces with a per capita open space of just 2.48 square metres as per the open spaces reservation in the citys development plan. In reality, this dwindles to less than 1 square metre per person with several of these open spaces built upon, not in use, or having restricted entry.A policy to free up these open spaces, develop and maintain them has been long overdue, and stuck in political tangles with a significant number of such plots currently in the care of trusts backed by political bigwigs. Several of these plots, which were allotted under the old contentious caretaker policy that was later stayed, have been turned into swanky clubs with access based on a membership fee, and open entry for the public in a limited area for a restricted time. However, despite this, none of the parties have clearly stated how they plan to improve access to open spaces. While the BJP and Congress manifestos promise that the BMC will maintain open spaces, they are silent on reclaiming existing plots handed out under the caretaker policy.Nayana Kathpalia, an activist, said, The first draft of the open spaces policy came in 2007, and ten years later it is still under works. These are promises that will only remain on paper, as political parties are never on the same page when it comes to maintaining open spaces.Despite spending about Rs 1,500 crore annually on Mumbais roads, potholes continue unabated during the monsoon. Since the last election in 2012, the BMC has recorded 87,000 potholes across the city. Despite bad roads having turned into one of Mumbais identities nationally, political parties have not come up with any new solutions or technologies to offer voters.While pothole-free roads and fast-tracking concretization are promises seen on nearly every partys manifesto, how they exactly plan to improve the quality of works and curb constant digging for utility works remains unanswered. Instead, the Shiv Sena and BJP have focused on promising showpiece projects  a coastal freeway from Nariman Point to Dahisar, and a Goregaon Mulund link road by the former, and elevated roads running 250 kms in length by the latter.Mumbais draft Development Plan (DP) was a political hot potato in the civic body over the past two years, with the citys blueprint for the next two decades proposing a spurt in the Floor Space Index (FSI) and affordable housing by opening up No Development Zones (NDZs). However, when it came to campaigning for elections, none of the political parties opposed or supported the plan in their manifestos. While Congress was the first to oppose the draft in the BMCs general body, it failed to even mention the issue in its manifesto. The BJP has, however, promised to make the implementation of the DP a mandatory duty of the BMC, with just 30 percent of the current DP, published in 1994, having been implemented.Mumbai also struggles to manage its 9,400 tonnes of daily waste with two of its dumping grounds saturated beyond capacity. However, the only place where Mumbais garbage featured in political leaders verbal campaigning was in political one-upmanship and graft charges. Shiv Sena and BJP leaders stated their wish to close the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds, but only while pointing at each other, alleging vested interests in the promise. Moreover, none of the parties manifestos, except for the Congress, have said a single word about closing dumping grounds, which have turned into a serious health hazard for the city. The Congress promises to move these out of the city, but does not specify where and how.READ MOREBMC polls Live: Mumbai steps out to vote for a better tomorrowMumbai civic polls: When it comes to governance, we mean businessBMC polls: Whatever be your choice, but please vote, say candidates"
58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

Lucky (10), could not open his eyes when he saw the sunlight first time in four years. They were beaten with hammers for reasons such as cooking extra rice, dozing off at work and even trying to go to the washroom during work.Their job was to cut threads of jeans and pack it. The task was to pack 10 pieces in 10 minutes and the one who finished last used to be beaten with a hammer by the employer. The tale of extreme torture was disclosed by the 26 boys, in the age group of 8 to 13, who were rescued from a jeans factory in northeast Delhis Seelampur area last month.We were allowed to sleep at 5 am and the employer used to wake us up at 7 am. In between work, if we fell asleep, he used to wake us up by hitting us with a hammer. For four years, we were having two meals in a day - potato and rice. The menu never changed and we were not allowed to go out of the room even for a second, said Raheem, a 7-year-old boy, who was brought in to the factory six months ago.Shyam, who has seen at least five new boys coming every month, could not move on his own when he was rescued. He had to be lifted. Now, we are giving him physiotherapy and he has started moving his feet. Almost every boy has injury marks on their body and has vitamin deficiency. We have never seen this kind of torture in our life, said a member of Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO run by Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi. The NGO runs a children home Mukti Ashram in north Delhis Burari, where these boys are staying and getting treatment so that they can lead a normal life.We were kept in a small room and I have not seen the sunlight in four years. When, I was rescued, I could not open my eyes as I was not used to it. We were not allowed to take bath or go to washroom since every day we used to pack 5,000 pieces of jeans, said Lucky.All boys are from Motihari district of Bihar and were brought to Delhi around six months ago. Six of them are from the same village, indicating that they could have been victims of child trafficking.I am furious. Twenty six child slaves were rescued and most of them have not even seen daylight in four years. I recall a similar case from 1983 when all 27 children we freed from the carpet industry in Mirzapur were beaten, branded, hanged upside down on trees, said Satyarthi.He said there is little change even after three decades. Each child rescued from Seelampur has faced the worst form of slavery. Their hands are scarred, they carry burn marks all over their bodies and their arms have signs of torture.Are children not safe anywhere, not even in the capital of the country? Slavery is not a myth. Child abuse and violence against children are all harsh realities surrounding us. We have to wake up to this bitter truth. I strongly demand fast track courts, child friendly court procedures and time bound trials so that our children and their childhoods do not have to wait, said Satyarthi.The case began to unravel after six children roaming at Anand Vihar railway station were noticed by NGO Childline on February 3. The children said that they had fled from the factory and wanted to go back to their hometown. They also told the NGO that there are many other children trapped in the factory.The matter was brought to the notice of the Child Welfare Committee which asked police and NGO to conduct a raid at the location described by the children.A joint team conducted the raid in Seelampur and 20 more children were rescued on the same day. The children were confined in one room and were living in pathetic conditions. Police also arrested the owner of the jeans factory.According to a global survey report, India has the largest population of modern slaves in the world, with more than 18 million people trapped as bonded labourers, forced beggars, sex workers and child soldiers. The Global Slavery Index by human rights organisation Walk Free Foundation said the number was 1.4% of Indias population.*Names have been changed to protect identity"

He also decided to slash the rates of commission charged by the commission agents from 5% to 1%, with immediate effect.Badal also asked the Punjab Agro and Markfed to explore the feasibility of export potential of potatoes to Russia, Dubai, Iran, Sri Lanka and other countries for which the state government would subsidise the freight.Besides, the agriculture department has also been directed to undertake distant marketing of potatoes in the other parts of the country to ensure better prices to the growers.The CM also asked the agriculture department to ensure rational utilisation of storing capacity of cold stores across the state to curb the malpractice of hoarding.It was also decided in the meeting to issue an advisory to the department of education and jails, besides other government institutions, for optimum utilisation of potato in the mid-day meal scheme and for consumption of jail inmates for rich nourishment, which would also boost the sale of potato in the state."

We were ruined by the note ban, he said.Demonetisation also impacted the small local industries that depend heavily on cash transactions to pay wages of the labour procured locally. Traders were also adversely hit.Big industries did not experience the pain... the smaller ones were badly hit, said Rajesh Gupta, a trader in Lakhimpur-Kheri district."
58ff2b297be9e0413616325e,"Not modified, but  genetically 'edited' foods",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/590846/not-modified-genetically-edited-foods.html,2017-01-11,"Kenneth Chang, Jan 11, 2017, International New York Times 22:59 ISTA new generation of crops known as gene-edited rather than genetically modified is coming to the marketIn a few years, you could be eating the next generation of genetically altered foods  potatoes that do not turn brown or soybeans with a healthier mix of fatty acids.And you may have no idea that something is different, because there may be no mention on the labelling even after a law passed by the US Congress last year to disclose genetically modified ingredients takes effect.A new generation of crops known as gene-edited rather than genetically modified is coming to the market. Created through new tools that snip and tweak DNA at precise locations, they, at least for now, largely fall outside of current regulations. Unlike older methods of engineering genes, these techniques, like CRISPR, for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, have generally not been used to add genes from other organisms into the plants.The US Department of Agriculture has asked companies to advise it of their plans. But once the companies submit data to show the agency that the gene edits do not introduce foreign genes from plant pests into the crops, the agency is giving businesses the green light.Hundreds of acres of gene-edited crops have been grown in several states, unencumbered by oversight or regulations. And a few people have eaten them. This is not Frankenfood, said Andr Choulika, chief executive of Cellectis, one of the companies developing gene-edited crops.In October, Cellectis hosted a dinner at Benoit New York, the Alain Ducasse Manhattan restaurant, and served dishes made from its gene-edited soybeans and potatoes. Guests included professors, journalists and celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris, the actor. I dont even know what gene editing is, Harris said. I thought we were supposed to wear jeans.Calyxt, a subsidiary of Cellectis doing the gene-edited food, is also developing new versions of wheat including one with greater resistance to fungal diseases, another lower in carbohydrates and higher in dietary fibres.Other companies also developing gene-edited crops including DuPont Pioneer, which has used the technology for a new variety of waxy corn, used most commonly not for food but for starch in adhesives. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University have used CRISPR to create mushrooms that do not turn brown as quickly.The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms, where scientists used bacteria and viruses  typically from plant pests  to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plants DNA. That worked, but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted, and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with non-GMO crops.Companies like Calyxt have portrayed gene editing more like moving the cursor in a word processor to a particular location and making a small change to the text. Federal agencies have not yet said how they intend to regulate gene-edited foods, and the incoming Trump administration, while criticising overregulation in general, has not weighed in.Other parts of the world are also considering whether to regulate gene-edited foods and how to do so. In Europe, where many countries have banned the cultivation of GMOs, the European Commission has created a scientific panel to study the issue, with debate resuming this year.Choulika said the inspiration for the October gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier, by Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, a French scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to Europe from South America. But many Europeans scorned the potato. France even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748. Largely because of Parmentiers work, potatoes were declared to be safely edible in 1772, and the ban was lifted. Still, few wanted to eat them.In 1778, Parmentier organised the first in a series of lavish dinners for the high society of Paris, serving dishes all made with potatoes. Potatoes became a fixture in French cuisine. With farmers harvesting the first substantial plantings of the Cellectis gene-edited potatoes and soybeans last year, Choulika thought of throwing a modern version of Parmentiers gathering. This is the first dinner on Earth with gene-edited foods, Choulika said to the diners. Things that you eat today, millions of people are going to eat during the 21st century, and this will not stop.At the dinner, the soybeans were transformed into a several dishes. Carole Pourchet, director of the Lab, the research and development arm of Ducasses food enterprise, said the gene-edited soy cooked like normal soy, but the potatoes were a little drier, leading to the idea to fit them to retain moisture.The potatoes showed up in mashed potatoes and potato pie. The dinner was maybe potatoes cooked 10 ways, said Richard C Mulligan, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who was one of the guests. Choulika worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Mulligans laboratory two decades ago.Cattle without hornsFederico Tripodi, chief executive of the Calyxt subsidiary, said the company hoped the soybeans would be used in cooking oil for commercial and industrial use by 2018. The potatoes, edited to remain fresher longer and not produce carcinogens when fried, could be grown and sold in 2019. A second potato that is slower to turn brown just got word from the USDA that it, too, is not subject to regulation.Gene editing is not being used only with plants. A Minnesota company, Recombinetics, is editing the genes of farm animals  for example, creating cattle without horns. Critics warned that the industry was repeating the same mistakes of GMOs.Weve never been against any of this technology, said Michael Hansen, a senior staff scientist at Consumers Union. We dont say its inherently bad or these crops are inherently dangers. Its just they raise safety issues, and there should be required safety assessments.While the gene-editing templates match a specific sequence, it is possible that the same sequence occurs elsewhere in the genome or they will match similar sequences, and the DNA will be sliced in those places, too, with unknown consequences. They make it sound very exact, Hansen said. It will have off-target effects.Mulligan of Harvard said he was not sure that people would see much difference between gene-edited and genetically modified. The objection that people have is a more visceral and vague objection to messing with DNA, he said. Its hard to see that the public would see the difference. He admitted that he was more excited by the chef."

Scientists grow 'super potato' plant in Mars-like...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farming-possible-on-red-planet-scientists-grow-super-potato-plant-in-mars-like-conditions/story-D9NnzM3kt2Br4rdnzDTZcJ.html,2017-03-30,"In a lab in the Peruvian capital of Lima, a simulator mimicking the harsh conditions found on Mars now contains a hint of life: a nascent potato plant.After experimenting in the Andean nations dry, desert soil, scientists have successfully grown a potato in frigid, high carbon-dioxide surroundings.Though still in early stages, investigators at the International Potato Center believe the initial results are a promising indicator that potatoes might one day be harvested under conditions as hostile as those on Mars.The findings could benefit not only future Mars exploration, but also arid regions already feeling the impact of climate change.Its not only about bringing potatoes to Mars, but also finding a potato that can resist non-cultivable areas on Earth, said Julio Valdivia, an astrobiologist with Perus University of Engineering and Technology who is working with Nasa on the project.The experiment began in 2016  a year after the Hollywood film The Martian showed a stranded astronaut surviving by figuring out how to grow potatoes on the red planet.A scene from Hollywood sci-fi movie: The MartianPeruvian scientists built a simulator akin to a Mars-in-a-box: Frosty below-zero temperatures, high carbon monoxide concentrations, the air pressure found at 6,000 metres (19,700 feet) altitude and a system of lights imitating the Martian day and night.Though thousands of miles away from colleagues at Nasas Ames Research Center in California providing designs and advice, Peru was in many ways an apt location to experiment with growing potatoes on Mars.The birthplace of the domesticated potato lies high in the Andes near Lake Titicaca, where it was first grown about 7,000 years ago. More than 4,000 varieties are grown in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, where potatoes have sprouted even in cold, barren lands.The Peruvian scientists didnt have to go far to find high-salinity soil similar to that found on Mars, though with some of the organic material Mars lacks: Pampas de la Joya along the countrys southern coast receives less than a millimeter of rain a year, making its terrain somewhat comparable to the Red Planets parched ground.International Potato Center researchers transported 700 kilos (1,540 pounds) of the soil to Lima, planted 65 varieties and waited. In the end, just four sprouted from the soil.In a second stage, scientists planted one of the most robust varieties in the even more extreme conditions of the simulator, with the soil  Mars has no organic soil  replaced by crushed rock and a nutrient solution.Live-streaming cameras caught every tiny movement as a bud sprouted and grew several leaves while sensors provided around-the-clock monitoring of simulator conditions.The winning potato: A variety called Unique.Its a super potato that resists very high carbon dioxide conditions and temperatures that get to freezing, Valdivia said.The super potato resists very high carbon dioxide conditions and temperatures that get to freezing levels. (AP Photo)Nasa itself also has been doing experiments on extraterrestrial agriculture, both for use on spacecraft and perhaps on Mars.Ray Wheeler, the lead for advanced life support research activities at Nasas Kennedy Space Center, said plant survival in the open on Mars would be impossible given the planets low-pressure, cold temperature and lack of oxygen, but showing plants could survive in a greenhouse-type environment with reduced pressure and high carbon-dioxide levels could potentially reduce operating costs. Most research on growing plants in space has focused on optimizing environments to get high outputs of oxygen and food.But understanding the lower limits of survival is also important, especially if you consider pre-deploying some sort of plant growth systems before humans arrive, he said.In the next stage of the experiment, scientists will build three more simulators to grow potato plants under extreme conditions with the hope of gaining a broader range of results. They will also need to increase the carbon dioxide concentrations to more closely imitate the Martian atmosphere."

I want to see Made in Rae Bareli on packaged products one day, Gandhi said.Rae Bareli, which has five assembly segments, is the Lok Sabha constituency of his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Rae Bareli voted on February 23.October 1, 2016 (Firozabad): Addressing a gathering of farmers in Uttar Pradeshs Firozabad, Gandhi said he ask the government to set up a potato factory. This was in reply to villager asking him to set up a potato chips factory so that they would be able to get a good price for their crop.Gandhi had told the farmers: You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader. I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers.March 6, 2014 (Mirzapur): Addressing a rally in the carpet-manufacturing belt of Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said he wanted the American president to one day wear a wrist watch bearing Made in Mirzapur tag.I want to see a day when the American president is asked: Bhaiya, what is the time? He looks at his watch and on it is written Made in Mirzapur. He then asks his people: Where is this Mirzapur? These youth of Mirzapur are snatching jobs from American youth.

About 92.5% of the states farmers fall in the small and marginal categories.Besides, the cabinet also decided to write off Rs 5,630 crore in non-performing assets (NPAs) of 700,000 farmers.The twin waivers  among nine decisions the cabinet took  would together cost the government Rs 36,359 crore.The cash-strapped government would float farmer relief bonds, called Kisan Rahat Bond, to generated funds to implement the loan waiver.The BJP had promised loan waiver to marginal farmers in its poll manifesto. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Adityanath had said the decision would be taken at the first meeting of the state cabinet.State minister Siddharth Nath Singh told reporters the decision was in accordance with Prime Minister Modis announcement to provide relief to farmers.Its a coincidence that the cabinet took nine decisions on the occasion of Ram Navami, which marks the end of the nine-day Navratra festival, he said.Bundelkhand Kisan Union national president FK Dharma welcomed the loan weaver and said this was the first step towards easing out a major crisis faced by farmers.But Samajwadi Party president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav was not impressed.A promise of complete loan waiver was made to the farmers, he said. Millions of farmers were feeling cheated with the ceiling of Rs 1 lakh.     ,    .             .       .  Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) April 4, 2017Earlier in the day, the Congress hoped the BJP government will waive off loans of farmers to the tune of Rs 92,000 crore.Party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said: The BJP has waived off loans of Rs 140,000 crore of big industrial houses and industrialists. Will it waive off loans of Rs 92,000 crore of UP farmers?Other than the loan relief, the government will buy 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat from the farmers with the minimum sale price (MSP) of Rs 1,625 a quintal. It will give an additional Rs 10 a quintal to farmers cover transport and loading expenses.A three-member committee of ministers will find ways to ensure potato growers got remunerative prices for their produce.The government also decided to go ahead with its crackdown on the states illegal slaughterhouses, another poll promise of the BJP that won a landslide victory in the assembly elections. The Yogi government took charge a fortnight ago.The action against unauthorised abattoirs would strictly follow Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal directives and guidelines.The cabinet blamed rival political parties of spreading canard against the governments move to set up anti-Romeo police squads to check growing instances of harassment of women in public places.Allegations mounted that Uttar Pradesh has been turned into a nanny state by the BJP government, as reports emerged that these anti-Romeo teams were harassing men arbitrarily  even brothers dropping sisters at exam halls or men giving a lift to their woman colleagues.The cabinet decided that policemen wouldnt be spared if complaints of harassment were received.The government will form two groups of ministers (GoM)  each headed by deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya.The Sharma-led group will visit Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and other states to study and recommend a new industrial policy for Uttar Pradesh.The second GoM under Maurya would submit a report in a week on measures to check illegal mining in the state."

Even if we cannot give them profit, we will ensure they do not incur loss, Sharma said.He said district magistrates were asked to set up procurement centres wherever needed.If the previous SP regime had played a proactive role, the condition of potato growers would have been better, he added.Sugarcane dues to be paid in 14 daysThe government also made it mandatory to clear the current dues of the sugarcane growers within 14 days and previous dues within 120 days.Legal action will be initiated against sugar mills if they fail to make payments, Sharma said.Steps to end shortage of building materialsThe state cabinet also decided to amend the Uttar Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1963, in a bid to end the shortage of sand and coarse sand, which is adversely impacting construction activities.Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state cabinet had constituted a committee, headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, at its last meeting to look into the issue.The committee had submitted its report, he said.The state government will allow transportation of minor minerals with valid transit permits from other states.As a short term measure, district magistrates will issue e-tenders to allocate up to 10-acre area for sand mining for six months.

The government will buy potatoes at Rs. 4.60 per kg, she said.Ms. Banerjee was speaking at a government programme on Krishak Dibas (Farmers Day) observed by the Trinamool Congress government on March 14 to pay tribute to those who died during the anti-land acquisition movements at Singur in Hooghly district and Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district.As per the projected estimates of the State government, the number of schools (up to Class VIII) to be covered under the midday meal scheme is 83,673 and the number of students is about 1 crore.

Congress circulated video clips of Rahuls election speech to stub out Modis coconut juice jibe.Rahul Gandhis video is universally available. You must watch it... He didnt speak about coconuts, but about pineapple juice. Prime Minister Modi is just making up things, said Randeep Singh Surjewala, incharge of the AICC communication department.Surjewala hit back at the BJP, dubbing it a Bahut Jhoothi Paathshala (School of Lies) and describing Modi as a professor in the art of peddling lies.Modi should stop being the professor of lies and must apologise not to the Congress alone, but to the entire nation for misleading the people by falsifying the words of the leader of the principal Opposition party, he said. At a rally in Maharajganj on Wednesday, Modi had ribbed Rahul over selling Made in Manipur coconut juice in London and setting up potato factories.Rahuls coconut juice remarks could be traced to inaccurate reports in a section of the media about his speech in Manipur.You grow lemon, oranges, pineapples here. I want a day when someone will drink pineapple juice in London and see Made in Manipur on the pack, Rahul had said at a rally on Tuesday. It seemed the BJP managers had picked certain inaccurate media reports to ridicule Rahul.On the campaign trail, when Modi dished out the acronym SCAM to refer to the Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, Rahul tried to turn the tables, saying SCAM stood for Service, Courage, Ability and Modesty."

It came as shells fired by the Islamic State on government-held parts of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour wounded two members of a Russian media delegation visiting the area, according to state-run Syrian news agency SANA.Russia is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian journalists enjoy wide access in government-held parts of the country.Russias Anna-News military news service, which employs the journalists, said one was wounded in the arm while the other suffered leg and stomach wounds. The news service said the two were evacuated adding that their condition was satisfactory.UN not in chargeThe United Nations is not overseeing the transfer deal, which involves residents of the pro-government villages of Foua and Kfarya and the Opposition-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani. All four have been under siege for years, their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and Hezbollahs Al-Manar TV, earlier said that 3,000 people will be evacuated from Foua and Kfarya, while 200, the vast majority of them fighters, will be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya.Mr. Abdurrahman and Opposition activist Hussam Mahmoud, who is from Madaya, said the evacuation has been delayed. Mr. Abdurrahman said no permission was given for the evacuation to go ahead while Mr. Mahmoud said it has been delayed for logistical reasons.The perpretratorIt was not immediately clear if the evacuees feared attacks similar to Saturdays bombing.Mr. Abdurrahman said Saturdays blast, which hit an area where thousands of pro-government evacuees had been waiting for hours, killed 126. He said the dead included 109 people from Foua and Kfarya, among them 80 children and 13 women.No one has claimed the attack, but both the Islamic State group and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Fatah al-Sham Front have targeted civilians in government areas in the past.A wounded girl, who said she lost her four siblings in the blast, told al-Manar TV from her hospital bed that children who had been deprived of food for years in the two villages were approached by a man in the car who told them to come and eat potato chips. She said once many had gathered, there was an explosion that tore some of the children to pieces.Anthony Lake, UNICEFs executive director, said in a statement Sunday that after six years of war and carnage in Syria there comes a new horror that must break the heart of anyone who has one."
