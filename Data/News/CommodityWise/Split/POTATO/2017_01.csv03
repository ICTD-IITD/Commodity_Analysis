EU governments were asked to vote on the future of two grades of GM maize, Pioneers 1507 and Syngentas Bt11, which kill insects by producing their own pesticide and are also resistant to a particular herbicide.However, the votes against were not decisive in blocking their introduction because the opposition did not represent a qualified majority  also including countries that make up at least 65 percent of the EU population. The governments were also asked to determine whether to extend authorisation for Monsantos MON810, an insect-resistant maize that is grown mainly in Spain, but banned in a number of other counties. More countries voted against than in favour, but again the vote was not considered decisive.Mute Schimpf, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said the decision now rested with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. He can put himself on the side of the majority of countries, citizens and farmers who do not want genetically modified crops, or he can back the mega-corporations behind the industrialisation of our countryside, she said.At the end of last year, 55 GM crops were approved for import as feed and food into Europe. While approved for human consumption, in practice the crops are used as animal feed. Repeated EU scientific assessments have concluded that GMO crops are as safe for humans and the environment as their conventional counterparts, but consumer opposition to the technology in Europe remains strong.MON810 is the only GM crop grown in Europe. A potato developed by BASF was granted approval in 2010, but the German company withdrew it in 2012.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Also, raw green potatoes should not be served at all.Recently, seeing the potato glut in the market, Punjab government has proposed its export to other countries. Also, government schools were ordered to enhance potato purchase for mid-day meals and gurudwaras for langars.Speaking to The Indian Express, Dr Manju Wadhwa, head of animal nutrition department, GADVASU said, We have studied potential of potatoes as livestock feed. It can be a good source of cattle feed that improves the milk yield without any adverse effect on milk composition or body weight (BW) of the animals.As per GADVASU study, potatoes should be thoroughly washed and introduced gradually into animals diet with increasing amounts over period of 2-3 weeks. At start, feeding should be 1.52.5 kg/day with gradual increase to 4.56.5 kg/day for calves, 1011 kg/day for yearlings (above one year) and 1618 kg/day for 500 kg cows.We should not feed potatoes higher than 30% of the DM (dry matter) intake or 2.5-4.0% of body weight (BW). In any case it should not exceed 10% of their BW in any case. Frozen potatoes should not be fed because animals cannot chew them and are likely to choke while attempting to swallow them whole. They should be mashed or chaffed with roughage, added Wadhwa.The study has also found that  nutritional value of 4.55 kg potatoes are equivalent to 1 kg barley or corn grains. But this does not mean a farmer should feed cattle with 4-5 kg potato at once. It has to be fed very carefully beginning with limited quantity, she said.Feeding higher levels may cause milk fat depression, indigestion and bloating among animals, cautions Wadhwa. In no case, fungal infested, sprouted, sun burnt (green) potatoes should be fed. Frozen potatoes should be brought to room temperature and then fed, she added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

When a food festival is held at Thekkeppuram, there is no question of authenticity as this is where most of Kozhikodes traditional cuisine is originated.The Thekkeppuram Food Fest 2017 that began at the M.S. Aboo Haji Hall on Pallikkandi Road at Kallai on Wednesday is a coming together of expert cooks from 40 residents associations in the region that spreads between Valiyangadi and Kothi Bridge. Here we find mostly home-makers coming up with authentic homely recipes to tease the palates of food buffs in the city.Traditional snacks such as kadukka nirachathu, meen pathiri, irachi pathiri, jeeraka pathiri, unnakkaya, kumbilappam, undaputtu, chemmeen pidi, chattippathiri, chippiyappam, athishaya pathiri, chemmeen meshappoo and muttamaala are trademarks of this region. However, enterprising cooks here have largely experimented and improvised on various food items to create their own recipes. Thus you find brain omelette, bread cake, chemmeen idli, chicken cushion, tender coconut pudding, rava biriyani, pudina pathiri, silk pathiri, kirsa, a sweet made of macaroni, chicken 18, beef potato chilli and various versions of pizza, sandwiches, burgers and kebabs.There are also desserts such as kottayilummoomma with a basket and some sweet concoction in it.Though Thekkeppuram is predominantly a Muslim region, the Gujaratis who came to Kozhikode years ago too have come up with some traditional Gujarati cuisine at the Thekkeppuram fest.Besides, you get a variety of dosas, fries and all kinds of fish that you could select from a fishing boat and watch live cooking.The evenings at the fest are enriched with cultural programmes such as mappilappattu and oppana. A Rafi-Kishore musical concert will mark the final evening of the fest. The festival will conclude on Friday."

By 2015-16, the number of such villages more than doubled to 1,137, according to the data tabled by the state government in the recently-concluded Budget session of the Assembly.The maximum number of villages covered by water tankers were in Banaskantha. In this district of north Gujarat, 459 villages were provided with tanker water during 2011-16.Banaskantha was followed by Bharuch in South Gujarat with 406 villages getting water through tankers. River Narmada passes through this district.The other districts where sizeable number of villages received drinking water by tankers were Kutch (330 villages), Junagadh (335), Rajkot (302) and Dahod (231). In fact, all the 231 villages in the predominantly tribal district of Dahod were provided water through tankers during 2015-16.This year too, at the very onset of summer, the Gujarat government has announced that it would be providing drinking water to 102 villages using 72 water tankers. On Thursday, the government announced that it would be providing water tanker services to these 102 villages in districts of Kutch, Surendranagar, Porbandar, Dwarka, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Amreli, Patan and Banaskantha.The use of water tankers to supply drinking water has always been a political hot potato in Gujarat, which over the years has developed an elaborate water-grid that is largely based on River Narmada. This water grid has a 2,727-km bulk water pipeline managed by the state-run Gujarat Water Infrastructure Limited (GWIL) and an additional 1,20,000 km pipeline for supplying drinking water under the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB).The implementation of the water supply scheme in Gujarat is based on Narmada canal and executed under two different programmes  Sardar Sarovar Canal Based Project (SSCB) and Sujalam Sufalam Yojana (SSY).The state has also taken up bulk pipeline packages under Mahi and Narmada bulk water transmission pipeline projects. By the end of October 2016, the work on bulk pipelines of 2,727 km has been completed and commissioned.Water tankers are used mostly in special cases and on humanitarian grounds. Most of the villages that are covered with tankers are either located in remote areas or might have reported some technical problem or breakdown regarding water supply, said Tushar Dholakia, member secretary, (GWSSB), a statutory body set up by the state government for development, regulation and control of drinking water sector in the state.State government officials said that tankers were usually used as the last resort in villages where other sources of underground water were unavailable largely due to salinity ingress. Tankers were also used in places that have difficult geographical terrain (or on a gradient), sources said.According to the latest edition of Socio-Economic Review (2016-17), at present 12,000 villages are connected to this water grid under the Rural Regional Water Supply Scheme. Apart from this, The Government of Gujarat has formulated, sanctioned and implemented a master plan amounting to Rs 13,990 crore for the Sardar Sarovar Canal-based drinking water supply project covering 9,633 villages and 131 urban centres.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: REUTERS)The evacuation of more than 3,000 Syrians that was scheduled to take place Sunday from four areas as part of a population transfer has been postponed, opposition activists said, a day after a deadly blast that killed more than 120 people, many of them government supporters. The reasons for the delay were not immediately clear. It came as shells fired by the Islamic State group on government-held parts of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour wounded two members of a Russian media delegation visiting the area, according to state-run Syrian news agency SANA. Russia is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russian journalists enjoy wide access in government-held parts of the country.Russias Anna-News military news service, which employs the journalists, said one was wounded in the arm while the other suffered leg and stomach wounds. The news service said the two were evacuated adding that their condition was satisfactory.Also Read | Mass evacuation in Syria to proceed after deadly blastThe United Nations is not overseeing the transfer deal, which involves residents of the pro-government villages of Foua and Kfarya and the opposition-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani. All four have been under siege for years, their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and Hezbollahs Al-Manar TV, earlier said that 3,000 people will be evacuated from Foua and Kfarya, while 200, the vast majority of them fighters, will be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya.Abdurrahman and opposition activist Hussam Mahmoud, who is from Madaya, said the evacuation has been delayed. Abdurrahman said no permission was given for the evacuation to go ahead while Mahmoud said it has been delayed for logistical reasons.It was not immediately clear if the evacuees feared attacks similar to Saturdays bombing. Abdurrahman said Saturdays blast which hit an area where thousands of pro-government evacuees had been waiting for hours  killed 126. He said the dead included 109 people from Foua and Kfarya, among them 80 children and 13 women.No one has claimed the attack, but both the Islamic State group and the al-Qaida-affiliated Fatah al-Sham Front have targeted civilians in government areas in the past. A wounded girl, who said she lost her four siblings in the blast, told Al-Manar TV from her hospital bed that children who had been deprived of food for years in the two villages were approached by a man in the car who told them to come and eat potato chips. She said once many had gathered, there was an explosion that tore some of the children to pieces.Anthony Lake, UNICEFs executive director, said in a statement Sunday that after six years of war and carnage in Syria there comes a new horror that must break the heart of anyone who has one. We must draw from this not only anger, but renewed determination to reach all the innocent children throughout Syria with help and comfort, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

But why this tangy chutney of indignation at the innovation? The masala dosa, after all, is a many-splendoured thing, one of Indias most inventive dishes, always metamorphosing into delicious new forms.Unlike, say, rice and daal, the masala dosa comes cloaked in the glamour of a thousand rumours. One urban legend says the masala dosa wasnt created in cosy homesteads at all but actually dished up in Udupi restaurants, where clever cooks used spare potato bhaji, folding this in a light, crisp, savoury crepe. This masala dosa was a huge hit; but it didnt stop at one chewy avataar. Constantly innovating, the masala dosa features in hundreds of variants, localising, specialising and targeting individual customers well before multinationals learnt how to spell idli; versions include the paneer dosa, khakhra dosa, cheese spread dosa, even mutton-fry masala dosas. There are ragi and oat dosas for health nuts  and there are pizza dosas for those who prefer taste over waist.Why be mealy-mouthed over meals evolving anyway? Modern gastronomy means mixing, blending, breaking rules and combining cuisines, dishing up a brave new world of food, from bacon ice-cream to vegetarian chicken, foie gras falafel to charcoal chocolate. The West may be loving fusion cooking now but India has been a master-chef at this for decades. Remember, we invented the dhokla pizza, tandoori momo, paneer enchilada, masala omlette sushi and that most brilliant of culinary creations, which even slides cheekily past a stony Great Wall  gobi Manchurian.

5903e3157be9e02646bd90bd,Deadly bacteria and ineffective antibiotics,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/599726/deadly-bacteria-ineffective-antibiotics.html,2017-03-05,"Deadly bacteria and ineffective antibioticsSuma Sarojini, March 6, 2017 23:35 ISTRecently, a woman in her 70s reportedly died at Nevada, USA, due to bacterial infection caused by a dangerous strain, Klebsiella pneumoniae, which could not be treated even with 26 different antibiotics. The World Health Organisation has referred to Klebsiella pneumoniae as an urgent threat to human health.Clearly, this is an alarming situation where microbes, which are continuously pitted against antibiotics, have gained an upper hand in the struggle for existence. Antibiotics are the only armour that man possesses against bacteria and, therefore, intensive R&D efforts are underway to maintain a scientific edge over these teeny weeny creatures that can wreak havoc on our lives.The aim of any life form is to multiply for survival on planet earth. For over a century, the mankind has been in a race with bacteria to overpower it with antibiotics.Today, science seeks to maintain a lead over microbes with a few antibiotics which are effective  but the gap is rapidly narrowing down with the emergence of smart bacteria. These are bacteria which have become multidrug resistant like the notorious Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which invades the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in hospitals.Lately, the multidrug-resistant bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae has assumed dangerous proportions especially in ICUs where it causes urinary tract and respiratory tract infections.This bacteria belongs to the group of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) which are multidrug resistant and proves a nightmare for scientific and medical communities alike who have to fight the battle against this strain both in laboratories and hospitals.In 2008, a Swedish tourist fell ill in New Delhi and did not respond to many classes of antibiotics. Finally, the doctors isolated a Klebsiella strain resistant to almost 10 different kinds of antibiotics.This bacterial strain was labelled superbug since it had a powerful antibiotic resistance gene which could easily be transmitted to other bacteria. These superbugs have a special enzyme called NDM  New Delhi Metallolactamase  which can destroy antibiotics.In order to combat this dreaded super bug, scientists globally seek to discover more potent antibiotics to save mankind from death by infection.A 2011 study published in the scientific journal The Lancet revealed the presence of this super bug even in tap water samples in Delhi. This shows that the superbug was not contained in the labs and hospitals alone but has managed to pervade the environment with its dangerous presence. Clearly, since 2011, these bugs would have further contaminated the physical environment.Antibiotics, as one of the major discoveries in the early 20th century, contained, to a large extent, the premature death of animals and humans over the last century. The absence of antibiotics killed millions between the 13th and 17th century when Bubonic plague, popularly known as black death, swept Europe.Microbes which constitute both fungus and bacteria, can also cause havoc indirectly  like the Great Irish Famine (1845-52), when a fungal pathogen devastated the entire potato crop in Ireland that resulted in the death of over 10 lakh people and displacement of many more.The first chemically synthesised antibiotic, Salvarsan, popularly called Magic Bullet was introduced in 1910 to cure syphilis. It proved to be a boon for many people suffering from this dreaded sexually transmitted disease which lacked an effective cure until then.In 1928, Alexander Fleming isolated the antibiotic, Penicillin from a fungus. During the World War II, this antibiotic proved to benefit thousands of soldiers from immediate death because of the timely administration of this drug.Without antibiotics, these soldiers would have either died or lost their limbs to infection as amputation was the only option if their limbs were badly infected.Thereafter, many antibiotics were discovered which could kill virulent bacteria. However, with the advent of antibiotics, humans thought that they had won the war against bacteria. But, sadly, that was not the case.In 1946, in less than four years after mass production and use of Penicillin, many bacterial strains became resistant to Penicillin. Scientists continued to discover new drugs day in and day out but the smart bacteria continued to gain resistance against these drugs too. Bacteria became resistant to antibiotics largely because of the misuse of these drugs by humans. For instance, in India, antibiotics can be bought over the counter at pharmaceutical shops.Rampantly misusedThe problem arose because people started to consume antibiotics even when not necessary like in viral infections, allergies etc. Antibiotics are rampantly misused as additives to poultry and cattle feed.All these practices have led to the emergence of superbugs  bacteria resistant to several classes of antibiotics. Two antibiotics, namely Colistin and Tigecyclin, were the last weapons in the medical arsenal to combat such multidrug resistant bacteria. However, the recent death of the lady in the US suggests that these bacteria have now successfully dented the ultimate antibiotic armour, too.The issue is time-sensitive because it will not be long before these bugs can pass on their resistance genes to other bacteria which already have a different set of resistance genes. Once this happens, these bacteria will not respond even to the strongest antibiotics available now.Therefore, the medical and scientific communities globally should take immediate action along with their governments to combat the threat to humanity. The first step is to regulate the use of antibiotics to make sure that the bacterial community does not become invincible.(The writer is Assistant Professor, Department of Life Sciences, Christ University, Bengaluru)"

Spot LNG prices have also risen from USD 5.25 to about USD 9 per MMBTU on winter heating requirements. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is used for power generation.As per the data, food inflation basket witnessed contraction for the second month in a row with inflation at (-)0.56 per cent in January as against (-)0.70 per cent in December.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)32.32 per cent in January, saw deflationary pressure for the fifth consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)28.86 per cent.Pulse inflation moderated to 6.21 per cent, from 18.12 per cent in December. Potato prices recorded sharp fall at (-)0.20 per cent, from 26.42 per cent in the previous month.Rate of price increase in egg, meat and fish was 3.59 per cent during January.Inflation in manufactured items saw some uptick at 3.99 per cent compared with 3.67 per cent in December.While the rate of price rise in sugar was 22.83 per cent, for fibres, it was 15.18 per cent, and 25.44 per cent for minerals.The WPI inflation for November has been revised upwards to 3.38 per cent against the provisional estimate of 3.15 per cent.The rise in wholesale inflation is in contrast to the fall in retail inflation, which hit a five-year low of 3.17 per cent in January.In its policy last week, RBI retained the benchmark interest rate and changed the stance from 'accommodative' to 'neutral', indicating that there will not be any rate cut in the near term.It may, however, have to review its policy stance in the wake of retail inflation touching multi-year low in January.The RBI projected inflation will remain below 5 per cent in the January-March quarter of this fiscal but hardening of global crude oil prices and volatility in exchange rates could put upside pressure in the next financial year.It said inflation will be in the range of 4-4.5 per cent in the first half and 4.5-5 per cent in the second half of 2017-18."

PTI PhotoDelivering on BJP's poll promise to small and marginal farmers, the Yogi Adityanath cabinet today decided to waive their crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh, totalling a staggering Rs 36,359 crore, at its very first meeting.The move will benefit over 2.15 crore farmers, besides 7 lakh others who had secured loans which turned into non- performing assets (NPAs).The Yogi Adityanath cabinet decided to float Kisan Rahat Bonds for raising Rs 36,359 crore required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers who form 92.5 per cent of the total 2.30 lakh farmers in the state.The decision comes a fortnight after Adityanath took over the reins of the state on March 19 after BJP and its allies stormed to power in the 403-member Assembly capturing 325 seats, an over three-fourth majority.Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets ((NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off.The loan waiver promise was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state party president Keshav Prasad Maurya and it is the duty of the government to fulfil the promise made in BJP's 'sankalp patra' (manifesto) and the Yogi government was moving ahead in this direction, the two ministers said.In the past, farmers in the state had suffered because of successive drought and hailstorm.Singh said Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act mandated that no state can allow its fiscal deficit to grow beyond three per cent of its GDP. Hence, funds for meeting the expenditure on loan waiver would be raised through Kisan Rahat Bonds.Taking into account the problems faced by potato growers, who face immense hardship in case of bumper crops, the cabinet decided to set up a three-member committe headed by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to see how they can get adequate remuneration for their produce.The ministers said the committee will also look at how to help the potato growers.The ministers said the cabinet also decided to raise by Rs 10 per quintal the minimum support price for wheat procurement as loading and unloading charges. The MSP for wheat it Rs 1,680 per quintal.A target of 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procurement has been fixed for this season and, in the first phase, half of it will be procured, they said. The ministers said instructions have been issued to ensure direct procurement from farmers and that they should not be harassed.In order to check illegal mining, the cabinet decided to constitute a group of ministers. The GoM headed by Maurya will give its report in a week.The ministers said the cabinet also took up the issue of investments in UP for setting up industries so the youth get better employment opportunities in the state itself.For this, a five-member GoM headed by another Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma has been constituted. It would visit other states and study their industrial policies.The GoM will study the policies of BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh among others for preparing an industrial policy for UP for enhanced investment through a single window system."
5904666a7be9e04154df64d6,The importance of political symbolism: EC has its work cut out finding graphics for UP poll candidates 😜,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/the-importance-of-political-symbolism-ec-has-its-work-cut-out-finding-graphics-for-up-poll-candidates-f0-9f-98-9c/,2017-02-04,"Rose is a rose is a rose, said Gertrude Stein. The Election Commission, would, however, dismiss such a poetic conceit when it comes to allotting poll symbols to candidates on the grounds that too close a similarity in such graphics could confuse voters. Even as the dust has settled after the Samajwadi Partys internal fracas, which led to a dispute as to who was the true claimant of its cycle symbol, an aandhi of what might be called political trade mark wars has swept through UP.The state is fielding a record number of independent candidates, which has caused the already hard-worked EC to burn the midnight oil in the course of finding suitably dissimilar poll symbols for all of them. Still, some of the pictorial representations that the EC has come up with might well leave many in a daze of decipherment.For instance, the coconut, which is traditionally used in religious ceremonies, might be deemed to be auspicious by many, but some could also interpret it to mean that the allottee will find the upcoming contest a tough nut to crack. Similarly, the symbol of a cot could prove ambiguous, conveying to voters that the candidate in question could either make all their dreams come true or merely sleep on the job.Though a candidate who has been assigned a TV set as his electoral chhaap seems pleased as punch, saying TV is an appealing sign. It broadcasts messages, the message that voters might receive could be that the contestant might turn out to be a do-nothing couch potato more interested in the idiot box than the ballot box.Considering that the object in question is often used as a missile to denote displeasure, the symbol of a chappal could be construed as an augury of a flip-flop show, if not a flop show. Or, on the other foot, it could suggest someone possessed of down-to-earth humility who is prepared to tread the strait and narrow.The hypodermic needle could also convey ambivalence, either being viewed as a depiction that the contestant will give the body politic a much-needed shot in the arm and is exactly what the doctor ordered, or that after the hustings the candidate will prove to be as elusive and hard to find as the proverbial needle in a haystack.The harmonium might strike the right chord with voters, or it could just as easily be taken to mean that itll make the electorate face the music. Some might find the air-conditioner really cool, though others could get het up about it, particularly if theyve endured long power outages.Symbolic logic has its pitfalls as revealed by the cautionary tale of the party which, in an area of low literacy, put up posters showing its sign with the mark of approval superimposed upon it. When it lost by a landslide, it discovered that all the voters had dutifully followed instructions and stamped the palms of their own hands, instead of the Hand on the ballot sheet."
590467a67be9e04154df66ee,What does Swachh Bharat tell us about ourselves?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/second-thoughts/what-does-swachh-bharat-tell-us-about-ourselves/,2017-02-10,"Since coming to power in 2014, one of the most prominent initiatives of the NDA government is the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Prime Minister Modi has personally invested his energies in the initiative and continues to be its face. Celebrities have joined the campaign, the media support has been widespread, and even the new currency notes carry the Swachh Bharat motif. In terms of visibility, outreach and sheer simplicity, it is unparalleled. Perhaps demonetization might give it a fair run, but demonetization is exceedingly complex and unlikely to endure in public imagination once the cash becomes easily available. The idea in essence is quite simple  that we ought to keep our surroundings clean. But shouldnt that be quite obvious? Should it not boggle the mind that the Prime Minister of the largest democracy must tell its people to do what they should be doing anyway?Bharat or India is basically not swachh. All of us have grown up seeing garbage littered in our public places, streets, railway or bus stations, hospitals, riverfronts, sea beaches, footpaths, gardens and so on. Empty plastic water bottles dot the countryside. The stench from open sewers is suffocating. It is quite normal for someone to buy a pack of potato chips or pan masala and throw the wrappers anywhere. The absence of civic consciousness is breath taking.So what is it about Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that touches the chord in all of us? It has less to do with actual litter than what it symbolizes. We want to claim the public spaces as our own. The litter invades our sense of ownership even if it is only partial, and the litter-thrower is an unmerited imposition on the turf that does not solely belong to him. The litter violates our sense of propriety.Surprisingly though, most people do not litter. Very few people cause most of the problem. At a recent handicraft fair, I counted 14 instances of littering over a 30 minute span as I sat sipping tea, while an estimated 400-500 people walked by  giving the number of litterers at about three percent. This resonates with the well-known problem of free-riding tendency. Recall your student days when you had to work on group projects. Invariably, one or two members turned up to be free riders. They did no work whatsoever, and the rest had to all the work. And even though the rest were in a majority, they could not prevent the free riding behaviour. Game theory tells us that groups are generally unable to police themselves. They are powerless against free riding behaviours, and require an external authority to bring the lawless to order. In the context of Swachh Bharat, the external authority is the apparatus of the organized state.Therefore, Swachh Bharat is not just about the physical litter. It symbolizes the failure of the self-policing by the groups amidst a weak or an absentee state. The lack of civic consciousness is only a symptom of an unfinished contract between the citizen and the modern state. Our long cultural memory still dates back to royals and kings, living in splendid opulence, sporting Rolls Royces, and utterly incompetent and unconcerned about the public. We are yet to forget that memory and figure out what we can fairly expect from the modern kings.An unfinished contract means that the state remains weak or absent. A weak state implies that we get locked into a million prisoners dilemmas with fellow citizens, leading to enormous under-performance. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is actually an opportunity to repair the contract between the citizen and the state, where each can levy fair expectations on the other and obtain mutually reinforcing positive gains.When Gandhiji returned from South Africa, one of the first things he did was to pick up a broom and start cleaning public places. How right he was!"
5904680a7be9e04154df67a9,Budget For Railways: Focus on safety and basics is welcome,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/talkingturkey/budget-for-railways-focus-on-safety-and-basics-is-welcome/,2017-02-01,"For the first time in the history of independent India, finance minister Arun Jaitley incorporated the Rail Budget within his Union Budget presentation for 2017-18. Although he clarified that the railways will continue to enjoy functional autonomy, the merger of the two budgets brings to an end an outdated tradition. True, the mass-mover deserves special attention given its role as a fundamental pillar of the countrys economy. However, its also a fact that the practice of having a separate Rail Budget had created much scope for politicking. As a result, for decades we were witness to the bizarre exercise of the rail minister announcing new trains with an eye on political calculations, even though the railways was bleeding financially.The net effect was the creation of a vast railway network that wasnt profitable  hiking railway fares being a political hot potato that no government wanted to deal with. Predictably, our railway infrastructure began to crumble with poor maintenance and slow pace of upgradation. Add to this babudom and bureaucratic red tape, and its easy to see why the railways is in its current lacklustre state.Given this background, the need of the hour today is to overhaul our railway infrastructure and get the basics right. We need better rail coaches, better track maintenance, better customer services and better safety. All of this simply cant be achieved if the railways is treated as government largess to be used for political gains. In that sense, its certainly welcome that the independent Rail Budget has been done away with.That said, what did Budget 2017-18 have in store for the railways? First, it announced an 8.3% higher budgetary allocation for the sector at Rs 1,31,000 crore which includes budget support of Rs 55,000 crore. Second, it announced the creation of a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore over a period of five years  an important decision considering recent rail accidents. Third, as many as 500 rail stations will be made differently-abled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. Fourth, by 2019 all coaches are to be fitted with bio-toilets. Fifth, unmanned railway level crossings are to be eliminated by 2020. Sixth, steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for pilgrimage and tourism. And seventh, service charge on rail tickets booked through IRCTC will be withdrawn.Many of these proposals are rudimentary and should have been done a long time ago. But thats precisely the point  in the pursuit of populism successive governments have failed to implement the basics for the railways. We are far behind a country like China which not only has an excellent railway network but has also used this as an economic force multiplier to boost manufacturing and exports. In fact, Chinese proficiency in railway technology and building is now a crucial part of Beijings transnational connectivity projects under its Silk Road Economic Belt. The latter will see Chinese trains and Chinese-build/sponsored railway tracks transport goods all the way from China to Europe.Hence, its welcome that the 2017-18 Union Budget keeps the focus on basics in the railways rather than headline-making bullet trains. For, it is only by upgrading the basics that the railways can achieve its true potential as an economic force multiplier and not a burden on government. It is now up to government to implement its announced proposals in an efficient manner and drive the railways into the 21st century."

On Tuesday the government decided to purvchase potatoes directly from farmers in a bid to cut wastage and provide maximum monetary benefit. UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and Agra was the largest potato producing district in the country for many years till Gujarats Banaskantha displaced it this year.One of the biggest problems faced by the agriculture sector is large-scale losses of crops after the harvesting period. Farmers toil in the rain and sun only to see their hard work being wasted due to shortage of storage facilities across the country. As per a 2015 study commissioned by the ministry of food processing, quantitative harvest and post-harvest losses of fruits and vegetables ranges between 6.70% to 15.88% for fruits and from 4.58% to 12.44% in vegetables. The reasons range from sorting/grading and packaging to transportation and storage channels.In a first, UP govt to purchase potatoes from farmers directly https://t.co/U941AArind  TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) April 12, 2017As per data available from parliament, India has 32 million cold stores (Bulk & distribution hubs) but requires additional 3 million more. As far as reefer trucks are concerned, India needs around 62,000 units compared to the current number of less than 10,000. If we look at the larger picture, almost 8679 tonnes of food grain was damaged across FCI godowns in 2016-17 as compared to 3115 tonnes for the previous year of 2015-16. UP lost about 13,513 tonnes of food grains in 2015-16 alone.Centre okays decision to procure 1 lakh MT potatoes from UP farmers https://t.co/26BG7S6IMD  TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) April 11, 2017Yogis government must be given credit for reaching out to farmers but it needs to have a robust storage and disposal plan in place as well. Else farmers will find it difficult to get out of the vicious cycle."
5904714a7be9e04154df6d07,Don’t cry for me India,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/strategic-insights/dont-cry-for-me-india/,2017-03-30,"The recent shootings of Indians or of people of Indian origin in the States has raised many of them to fear: Do we really belong there?The shootings have also caused a considerable hue and cry in India. Are Indians safe in the US? Are their children safe? Is this all happening because of the seeming hatred engendered against immigrants by the new American administration?Lets deconstruct the issue. There are Indian nationals in the US and there are American nationals of Indian origin. What does a sense of belonging mean for each group?Unlike most Europeans who immigrated to America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most Indians who migrated to the US in the latter part of the twentieth went, yes, due to economic reasons, but their hardship was nowhere in comparison to say that of the Irish.After the Great Irish Potato Famine of the mid-nineteenth century, millions of Irish faced a stark choice: Starve or go to the new country. In the new country, they were known as the Dirty Irish. The first generation had a distinctive accent. It was not until the third generation that they started blending in.In addition they were Catholic in an overwhelmingly Protestant country, which looked upon the old faith with disdain. A similar story could be said of the mafiosi Italians, or the Polish, or the Russians, or the Hungarian. In their case, assimilation was even more difficult as they spoke no English and there were hardly any English as a Second Language Classes to help.Still they had no way of going back, and had to make their way in their new land. Did they miss home? Sure. But the inescapable realization was that you were in America to stay, whether it felt like home or not.For many whites, America became a true melting pot, and by their third generation, intermixed whites certainly felt America as home. The point being that it can take a generation or two for an adopted country to feel like home.For non-whites such as African-Americans, the migration was not just harder, but brutal. They could not go back to where they were ripped away from. Colour prejudice kept them away from any integration with whites. Even after a black president, and tens of generations after the first slave was brought to America, African-Americans still feel queasy in America.Why then should the Indian community expect that America will open its gates of heaven for them? Most are educated and came to America out of choice. Most have the means to return back to the home country whenever they want. For sure, they have a few things going against them.Colour prejudice. A different, esoteric religion. A heavy or sing-song accent, whichever way you hear it. Strange customs and different food. But they also have advantages. Their Indian education and English skills enable them to get higher education and highly-paid jobs.Everywhere you look there are Indians in leadership positions: academia, politics, industry, even as motel and hotel owners. Indians could well argue that they have worked hard for their gains, and nothing was handed to them for free. Sure, but seeing such a particular community suddenly getting prosperous breeds resentment.Then the question of a sense of belonging comes in. The prized green card allows you to stay ad nauseam in the US, while retaining your Indian passport, and is the preferred choice of many Indians. But many Indians have crossed over to the other side, by becoming American citizens.Now, while they are still called Indians in the US, they are technically Americans of Indian origin. They have now lost their Indian citizenship and have come under Americas jurisdiction. The transition is not just that a piece of paper; it is mental and emotional as well.In my case, an Indian friend with a green card coerced me to adopt American citizenship. I said no, no, no. India was where I would change the world, and where my ashes would be set forth in the Ganges, as I did for my fathers, and he did for his fathers.Dont get emotional, cautioned my friend. In the post-9/11 situation, the US could stop awarding its citizenship. So what, I responded? Then he remarked, pragmatically, just use the American passport as a travel document.I reluctantly heeded his advice and went through the naturalization process. But I had checked before, that with the Overseas Citizenship of India, I could regain my Indian citizenship in a few years. That was most encouraging, but I was wrong.A few years ago, I returned to India, in part to regain my Indian citizenship. I learned that I could rewin it, but would have to renounce my American one. What a convoluted way to go about life. And then my American citizenship came in handy where I least expected it, as protection against tough times in India.I would go for an evening walk in a neighbourhood park. Pollution made me wear a mask, which no one in my colony did. I had a beard, was dark-skinned, and tall. I quickly became known as a rapist in the park. One guy went around spreading the jolly news that I had quit the States because I had a rape record there.Women started looking at me with trepidation. I complained to the colonys president. He said he could do nothing. Only when I told him that I would moan to the American embassy that he promised to do something. Still nothing. I stopped going to the park.I had returned to India to live and work, to look after aged parents, and guard my ancestral property. But my cousins, with whom I shared the inheritance, were miffed upon seeing me. Hadnt I made enough money in America?Thats the other thing. India embraces only those NRIs and people of Indian origin who have achieved signal success in the West. The media gets into the act, praising them to the high heavens. Arent we Indians so smart, outsmarting the whites even?For many ordinary Indians returning, the experience can be harrowing, as exemplified by the New York Times article here. They find resentment, disdain. The poor returnee is already struggling with his new life in what has now become a strange land. His teenage daughter returns home crying every day that she is treated as easy meat in school. Finally the returnee puts up his hands in despair: If India does not need me, I dont need India.Americans of Indian origin also dont need Indian ministers bawling over their plight, which is done mostly for the consumption of domestic audiences. For sure, they should help afflicted Indians, but please leave us Americans alone. The American justice system is sufficient to take care of us.Strong words, eh? So where is home really? Home is where the hearth is. And that for me now is America. Unless India awards me dual citizenship. Like the Beatles song goes, Indians might perceive me as a nowhere man. Maybe I am. Or maybe I have become a nomad, an everywhere man.But please, dont cry for me India."
590471547be9e04154df6d19,Game of Thrones: A medieval finale,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/game-of-thrones-a-medieval-finale/,2017-04-02,"Yesterday we were driving along the North Antrim coast, on our GOT treasure hunt. And today, we are headed for the undulating County Down, with its little green hills (Drumlins), deer farm, sheep and the Quoile River, also touching a Christian heritage trail passing through Inch Abbey, dedicated to the patron saint of Ireland, St Patrick.Before I continue with the GOT trail story, let me confess that it came as a great relief to learn that forty per cent of GOT trail visitors here may not even have watched the HBO series that has acquired cult status. But wait, they say they wish to be part of the experience and then some day they hope to see the entire series and savour it. What about spoilers? Ah, never mind, with social media going berserk, its spoilers all the way, anyway.Interestingly, corporate groups come here to bond and engage in confidence building activity, including learning to wield the bow and arrow (very useful, post nukedom). An Indian IT group that won the trip in a contest was here recently, and were told they relished the experience. The only challenge was controlling their selfie-taking sprees, including one that involved clicking selfies in front of an approaching helicopter! Imagine, getting decapitated at Winterfell, not by the sword but by a helicopter blade!Winterfell aka Castle WardForty minutes by road from Belfast, is the 1,000-acre Castle Ward, overlooking Strangford Lough, now better known as Winterfell of GOT fame, capital of Westeros, the seat of the ruler of the North and the traditional home of House Stark. We are welcomed and given those huge robes with fur collars that envelop you like a tent. How did they stay agile under such a bulbous garment?Ah, the Tower. The backdrop of many an episode, but hey, it looks rather different. Thats because GOT used Castle Ward and its Tower as props that were propped by extensive computer generated imagery (CGI), completely transforming the place into a living, breathing, medieval scene.William, who runs Winterfell Tours, takes us around, reliving certain scenes in GOT episodes, playing relevant clips on his iPad even as he explains how the imagery was done. Very interesting, indeed.Robbs Archery Range & DecapitationNext, we all have a go at shooting arrows at targets  and losers (who are far off the mark) undergo decapitation by winners, as they place their heads on a log of wood! Shooting an arrow looks very easy indeed but when one actually tries to do it, it is very difficult, having to coordinate vision, arm, aim and what not  it obviously requires a great deal of dedicated practice. This is where Bran, Rob and Robb practice archery in the courtyard with their father, Ned Stark, and Arya, bored with her sewing lesson, abandons it, grabs a bow and annoys Bran by out-shooting him. (Yay!).Castle Ward, they say, has become synonymous with Winterfell, even though it was the filming location only for Season 1. So it made quite an impact, apparently. And is now a much-frequented tourist destination.Audleys Field & CastleRobb Starks Camp, Oxcross was filmed here at Lecale, bordered by Strangford Lough and the Irish Sea on the north, east and south coasts. The castle originally belonged to a Norman family that came here in 1210.On the grassy clearing before the Castle (what remains of it) and overlooking the beautiful Irish Sea, all 17 of us in the group are encouraged to fight  were given (rubber) swords and of course, were already wearing our medieval cloaks, so theres no stopping us as we fly at each other, raging and screaming, pushing and stabbing. Good fun.Inch AbbeyBack to the coach and on our way to Tollymore Forest we pass through Inch Abbey and Downpatrick Cathedral, the final resting place of St Patrick. The Cistercian Abbey ruins here formed part of the location of GOT and many scenes of GOTs Season 1, Episode 10, Fire and Blood, used Inch Abbey as Robb Starks camp at Riverrun.Tollymore ForestWe drive to the ancient forest where by a brook, Ned Stark and his sons find a dead stag which has gored to death a female Direwolf that has given birth to pups. The Stark children take the pups home. The location where all of this happened is right there, before us! William plays the video on his iPad, making us relive the experience. Next, the clearing in the forest where the deserter from the Nights Watch finds those dismembered Wilding bodies  Very graphic indeed.We also take a look at the Vampire Tree, a gnarled, ancient tree with its limbs spreading out in crooked directions.Parts of the film Dracula and Frankenstein were shot here. The 800-acre forest once belonged to one family, but is now taken over by government. The forest inspired C S Lewis to write the Chronicles of Narnia; he is said to have spent a lot of time here at the Mourne Mountains and Tallymore Forest, shaping the plot to his story.Medieval Banquet & WhodunnitThe action-packed day that began at 8:30 am culminates in an extraordinary dinner, with theatre actors chipping in at The Cuan, a charming Guest Inn with bar and restaurant and a charming couple that owns it, Caroline and Peter. We are welcomed at the entrance by Jon Snow, King of the North and Tormumd Giantsbane, leader of a band of Wildings and trusted lieutenant of The King Beyond The Wall.Inside, the dimly-lit hall has tables with medieval earthen goblets (designed from the GOT series) in which wine is served, and stone plates and serving dishes straight out of GOT. As the only vegetarian there, I get a special menu that is simply delicious, potato and blue cheese cutlets with veggies and rich, nut-filled bread slices.All through the dinner, the actors weave in and out of tables, mouthing dialogues from GOT, and finally, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister, falls down suddenly, gasping, clutching her throat, and  dies. Who killed her?Were given a form to fill with our answer and the reason we came to this conclusion.Excellent finale to a wonderful experience of The Game of Thrones locale-hopping in Northern Ireland. And you can be sure I shall watch avidly the upcoming Season 7 of GOT in July, perhaps, now that Ive had first hand locale-and-more experience!"

Highly placed source told TOI that the state cabinet may gives its nod to the draft of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to be signed between UP government and the Centre.The MoU is likely to be signed in Lucknow in the presence of chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi on April 14. The BJP in its election manifesto had promised 24-hour power supply in the state by 2018. The MoU between UP and the Centre which was expedited due to a keen interest shown by the CM would be a major step towards fulfilling this promise, says a senior official of power department.Another major decision related to energy department likely to be taken by the cabinet is changing of malfunctioning transformers within 24 hours. This was also promised by the ruling party in the election campaign and the government is moving ahead to fulfill it.Similarly, the cabinet may also approve major decision in the mining policy to provide cheaper house construction material related to the public. ""The CM has been very particular about the mining department and in order to check rampant corruption in the department, he has kept the portfolio with himself. Now, he wants to introduce drastic changes in the mining policy to plug the loopholes,"" says a source.The chief minister had constituted two ministerial sub groups to submit their reports on mining and another was on the potato production and purchase. The ministerial sub group's report on potato purchase may also be tabled before the cabinet for its consideration.The CM also wants to make cheap meals available to the poor people in the state and a plan is being formulated in this direction. At its Tuesday's meeting, the cabinet might take up this plan as well."

Bengalis will celebrate Poila Boishakh , Malayalis Vishu Tamilians Puthandu and the Assamese Rongali Bihu Punjabis will celebrate Baisakhi on Thursday.On Wednesday, members of the Punjabi Association met thespian Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu at the actors' Pali Hill bungalow to present him a special award on the occasion of Baisakhi. ""Dilip Sahab hails from Peshawar and was pleased to receive this honour as a son of the Punjabi community,"" said spokesman Jasbir Singh Dham.Bengal Club will celebrate Poila Boishakh at Shivaji Park on April 15-16. President Tapan Dasgupta said, ""Our Kali mandir will be open for puja all day. On Saturday afternoon we will serve a vegetarian meal of shukto (mixed vegetables), echorer tarkari (small jackfruit), dal, fried potato and rasgulla."" On Sunday night, about 100 Bengalis will assemble for a potluck meal, and this time, non-vegetarian delicacies will be included.This year, Good Friday coincides with Vishu so a few Malayalis will spend April 14 in prayer. Apart from an elaborate 'sadya' or vegetarian feast, the highlight of Vishu is the 'vishukani' arrangement. Elders assemble an image of Lord Krishna, betel leaves and nuts, uruli vessel, mirror, haldi, kumkum and the yellow kanikonna flower that blossoms in April. Early morning, each member of the family is blindfolded and led to the vishukani which is the first thing he is made to glimpse after unravelling it.Around 1,500 Malayali families in Airoli, Navi Mumbai, will celebrate with the Kairali Airoli Malayalee Samajam. Its president R C Pillai said, ""At 5.30am, we will arrange the 'vishukani' and carry it around the homes of a few community members. These days it is not possible for everybody to assemble all the items at home so we devised this idea.""Where families are buying five 'konnu poovu' flowers for Rs 50 in Matunga market, lucky residents of Airoli pick the bl-ossoms from the trees that line Airoli-Mulund bridge or Reliance and Siemens compounds."

In the last 15 days, prices of many vegetables have more than doubled barring that of potato and onion.In retail markets and shops in Satellite area, except potatoes and onions, no other vegetable is available at rates below Rs 50 per kg. While in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, (APMC), Ahmedabad, brinjal is selling somewhere between Rs8-Rs16 per kg in wholesale, the same is selling in retail at Rs 60 per kg in city localities.The prices of vegetables at APMC have gone up by around 15%, while in retail the prices have almost doubled. Officials from APMC said that all vegetables, except potatoes and onions, are in short supply.According to Gujarat agriculture department, the sowing of vegetables, which was normally done across 1.24 lakh hectares was done only across 82,000 hectares. The department however claims that the sowing of vegetable was around 9,000 hectares more than that in last year.Prices of several vegetables had crossed the Rs 100 mark in retail market in 2016, but had eased after demonetization.Agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, however, said, ""The shortfall in sowing has no relation with demonetization. The sowing was delayed because there was less rainfall in 2016, and hence farmers moved away from vegetable to crops that needed less water.""""We hope that prices will likely come down within the next fortnight when the summer crop starts to arrive. The prices are generally on the higher side during this period,"" said D M Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad.Patel said, ""During demonetization, bulk buyers were away from the market. As a result, farmers were forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. But now the market has stabilized.""APMC officials said that supply of potato to the APMC each day was 370 kg more than what is normal at this time of the year, and the supply of onion is 415 kg more than expected, daily."

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

The approval is in tune with the state cabinet's decision to procure potatoes so that the farmers are not forced to sell it at throwaway prices in summer.The purchase will be made at Rs 4,870 per MT. The agriculture ministry will provide an additional Rs 1,217.50 per MT for overhead expenses such as transportation charges, mandi tax and godown charges. Purchase centres/areas will be decided by the state government in consultation with the state procurement agency.The move comes days after the UP government's decision to waive farm loan of small and marginal farmers and speed up wheat procurement drive at minimum support price (MSP) in the state.""The decision to procure potatoes is expected to provide a big relief to farmers who have, otherwise, to sell their produce at low price due to intervention of middlemen. Absence of cold chain in many parts of the state forces farmers to sell their produce within months of its harvest once temperature rises and this led them to get lower prices"", said an official.Announcing the decision, the agriculture ministry said, ""The MIS will be implemented by the state agency. The potatoes will be purchased from the cooperative societies, farmers' organisations or directly from the farmers to eliminate the possibility of middlemen taking advantage of the scheme. The state government will ensure that the produce is purchased from genuine farmers only"".It is decided that the procured stocks will be disposed of in the open market to ensure maximum realizable price. ""If necessary, this can also be sold to processing units within the state. The state agency would also make efforts to export the procured potatoes after processing"", said the ministry.""In order to avoid recycling, the stock would not be sold in the same market/state from where it has been procured during the period of the scheme. However, if the prices are better it can be sold locally"", said the official.The ministry made it clear that barter payments or payments in kind to farmers for procurement will not be allowed. It said, ""Payment to farmers as far as possible will be made through non-cash transaction and receipts for sales must be through banking channel only, preferably through demand draft""."

However, most of the agreements signed during the previous two editions of the Progressive Punjab investors' summit are yet to see the light of the day.The previous SAD-BJP alliance had organized the first investor summit in 2013 and claimed to have signed agreements worth Rs 67,000 crore. The second edition of the event in 2015, focused on attracting investments in manufacturing, IT agro-processing , healthcare and bio-sciences, and garnered promises of Rs 1.13 lakh crore investment.According to Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion, a total of 519 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were inked at the two summits of the previous regime. Of these only 22% have materialized so far, several agreements remain only on paper. The first summit witnessed 128 MoUs and of these 62, around 48%, have actually materialized so far. Similarly, at the summit held two years back, of 391 MoUs were inked. Of these, barely 53 or 13%, translated into investment.There was lot of euphoria over the initial interest shown by the big companies to invest in the state. An official of the bureau said that some agreements were in the process of being converted into investment and the final figures would go up. These include 17 projects from the 2013 summit and 64 from the 2015 summit, he said, citing ADLABS amusement park worth Rs 1,200 crore, and Rs 1,400 crore integrated food manufacturing unit as examples.Some of the key projects that have construction work completed include ITC's Rs 680 crore food-cum-logistics center at Kapurthala and Mahindra & Mahindra's Rs 18 crore seed potato project in Mohali. However, there are certain projects that have been put on hold due to various policy issues, including a Rs 50 crore frozen meat project in Mohali, and Rs 80 crore food processing project in Ludhiana.A private university with investment of Rs 350 crore, super speciality hospital for Rs 900 crore, medical university and hospital with estimated cost Rs 1,200 crore, are also in the pipeline listed under the ""Active Conversion Projects"" even though the MoUs were signed after the 2013 summit.The previous government had offered a slew of incentives including cheap power to new investors at Rs 4.90 per unit for five years, VAT retention, exemption from stamp duty, and electricity duty as per the 2013 industrial policy."
5905da7d7be9e04154e03cba,Why Easter is actually a bigger deal than Christmas...,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/why-easter-is-actually-a-bigger-deal-than-christmas/articleshow/58195310.cms,2017-04-16,"During childhood, Christmas is easily everyone's favourite season. And why not, there's Santa Claus and gifts; marshmallows and cookies; reindeers and snowmen. But as one grows older, and wiser, it dawns on every Christian that Easter indeed, is the real deal. These Hyderabadis tell us why:For Christians, Easter is more important than Christmas. While most cultures make a bigger celebration of X'mas, rejoicing the birth of Jesus, Easter is more significant because it celebrates the Resurrection of Christ, which led to the birth of Christian faith. It is Easter that gives Christmas it's true meaning and therefore, it calls for a bigger celebration.As children, we looked forward to going to our grandparents' house for breakfast in the morning. And lunch was always at the residence of our other set of grandparents. Ours is a multi-cultural family, so our feast is a potpourri of multiple cultures. For breakfast we haveappam, stew and a lot of sausages along with bacon, ham and stuff like that. Appam and stew is everyone's favourite.The lunch is typically a Hyderabadi fare with korma and biryani. For dinner at our home, we prefer to keep it light, with garlic bread, chicken roast, pie, macaroni and cheese. Salad is a must, keeping in mind the season. And that's how we end our day. I make a lot of special Easter eggs and cake. I make two-three varieties of cake like cream cheese cake, carrot cake and a special date and walnut cake which is my kids' favourite. Melanie Gabriel , home bakerAs children, you learn that Lent is a solemn time. While the adults in the family didn't touch meat or alcohol for 40 days, the children too abstain (from meat) on Wednesdays and Fridays. So Lent was never a fun time for us; we waited very eagerly for it to end. But with time, I understood the importance of Easter  it is the time to reflect and help those in need and resolve to change for the better.As for the celebrations, they begin early Sunday morning. My children are still young enough to believe in the Easter Bunny and jump out of their bed looking for their basket of eggs and candy. It's like Santa Claus all over again!Easter Sunday itself is time for family and very close friends. We head to the morning mass that symbolises the end of period of mourning and the beginning of celebration of the resurrection of Christ. Lunch and dinner are an intimate close knit affair. Early evening is party time for the children as they invite their friends over for an easter egg hunt and egg decorating that goes on for a couple of hours. By the end of it all, you feel a sense of peace and satisfaction and look forward to seeing through the resolutions made during Lent. For me, Easter is the Christian New Year. Sabina Xavier , socialiteThe very foundation of Christianity revolves around the Holy Week (which starts from the Sunday preceeding Easter). Unlike Christmas, which has become more about gifting than the humble beginnings of Christ, Easter still retains the very essence of the faith. After the 40-day period of Lent, which includes abstinence  from meat, alcohol, smoking  and days of fasting and prayer, Easter is celebrated with a feast. At our household, the day begins with a breakfast spread of eggs sunnyside up, sausages, and potato mash. But the feast takes on a new avatar during dinner with korma roast, spuds, coleslaw and trifle pudding.As a child, I remember Easter being all about Easter Bunnies and Easter Eggs. We used to make our own little eggs with egg shells and paint on small faces like that of Humpty Dumpty. I think children do those kind of things now. Jack Jigg , biker, DJEaster for me has always meant spending time with family. The first thing we do is attend the sunrise service and then come home to eat delicious food cooked by mum and grandma. We make all kind of dishes  kheema and roti for breakfast followed by chicken biryani for lunch. That is followed by beef salad and cutlets for dinner.And of course, there are Easter eggs! My best childhood memory of Easter was when I would stay awake the night before for the Easter eggs to arrive so that I can eat them secretly without anyone knowing about it (laughs).

5909e9a97be9e033f19b8b92,CSO data on GDP lacks authenticity,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/590673/cso-data-gdp-lacks-authenticity.html,2017-01-09,"Jan 10 , 2017, 0:03 ISTThe advance estimate of 7.1% growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the current financial year ending in March 2017 looks good on the face of it, but clearly defies ground reality  a subdued consumer demand and confidence, distressed trade, tentative corporate performance and rural dismay. While releasing the data for the full year with more than a quarter to go, the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) did give a disclaimer about not incorporating the impact of demonetisation in its projections about the countrys growth. The deceleration to 7.1% from 7.6% in the previous fiscal has come about on the back of considerations like global headwinds, retaining Indias status among the fastest-growing economies of the world. But such self-congratulatory report card carries no credibility when vast segments of the economy are in a state of disarray.In the initial days of the note-scrapping exercise, unprecedented anywhere on this scale, Indias micro-small industries reported 35% job losses and 50% dip in revenue, according to a study by the All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO). Job losses may go up to 60% and revenue loss to 55% before March 31, the AIMO study further projected. Certain vital sectors of the economy, which are among the largest employment generators, have come to a standstill even as they battle the image of being the parking lot for black money and corruption. Real estate and jewellery industries are almost shut, while tourism, infrastructure, automobile, media, fast-moving consumer goods, transportation, among others are in the grip of a slowdown. Agriculture sector and the entire rural landscape  which had a godly opportunity of rewarding farmers and farm workers, courtesy good monsoon  seem to be squandering away prospective gains as distress sales of onion, tomato, potato and several other crops are being reported from a large number of states following the note ban.The CSO may have managed to give flattering data by some technical and financial jugglery, but the GDP numbers without factoring in the impact of demonetisation are meaningless and are being taken so by the markets and independent analysts. The Finance Ministry, which is busy making the Budget to be presented a month ahead of the conventional last day of February, would do well not to rely too much on the CSO advance estimates while projecting the revenue and expenditure figures for the fiscal 2017-18. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley admitting visible impact of the invalidation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on the economy, an ear to the ground policy would serve better."

His aim is to clear civil services examination and become a district collector and help farmers in distress. Innocence and confidence on his face fail to reveal the travails the teenager has faced in the last few years. He is building a life for himself after his father, a cotton farmer in Gadchiroli district, committed suicide unable to clear mounting debts.He can hope to achieve his goal, thanks to Adhartirth Adharaashram, a first-of-its-kind ashram in the country which houses children of farmers who are victims of the agrarian crisis in Maharashtra.There are many like Ashok, who are dreaming amid deep crisis and personal grief. As many as 100 children from 30 districts are in the ashram located on the outskirts of Triambakeshwar, a holy shrine for Hindus. Spread over three acres, the ashram is managed by the 21-member trust, which was setup by Triambakrao Gaekwad in 2007.Trustees are still building the infrastructure for the ashram and improve facilities to accommodate more children. With a picturesque hill in the background, the land was bought by raising Rs 15 lakh through donations. The ashram has a dining hall and it is in dire need of repairs. Children work in the kitchen garden and grow vegetables such as potato and daikon and they are used in the ashram. It also has a spacious multi-purpose meeting hall and dormitory for children. Toilets and bathroom are being constructed.Gaekwad, the founder-president of Adhartirth Adharaashram, is the son of a farmer. He says: In 2007, a farmer committed suicide in Amaravati because he could not repay a mere Rs 1.5 lakh debt. He left behind his young wife and children. I was distraught at the vulnerability of fatherless children and helpless widows. That made me think of securing the future of such farmers' children.Gaekwad discussed the plight of farmers with his friends who are also from agricultural background. The idea took concrete shape and the ashram was started on a small scale with five children. The ashram admitted more children as donations started pouring in. Five women, who saw their husbands end life unable to repay debt, work in the kitchen for a monthly remuneration of Rs 400. Called mousi by children, they stay on the campus. Sankri Thethale, wife of a sarpanch who committed suicide, is secretary of the trust.Ashram has 16 orphas, including nine girls. Lovingly called ""appa"" by children, Gaekwad is worried about the future of these children. ""God only knows about their future Gaekwad says as he looks at them. The children wake up at 5.30 am, offer prayers and take breakfast before walking to the government school in Talegaon village, which is 4 km from the ashram. After school, the children spend some time in shram daan and clean the premises.Interestingly, senior students perform the role of caretakers and mentors for new entrants. When juniors fall sick, seniors tend to their needs.Jana Chaudhary from Yavatmal has been in the ashram for nearly nine years. She said children are divided into groups to perform daily chores. Group's eldest member takes care of the needs of juniors. The seniors wash clothes, make their bed and ready school bags. ""We take care of each other as siblings. We know all of us are from the same background,"" she says.Weekends are special days as philanthropists, guests visit the ashram to share their happiness. Birthdays are celebrated with the children and they have breakfast, lunch and dinner along with them. Ashram children wait for the celebrations as they get sweets and cakes on those days. Every time guests come to the ashram, the children offer prayers, entertain them by singing and performing dance to Marathi and Hindi numbers.Manoj Ambre, a Pune-based techie, celebrated his son's second birthday in the ashram. Manoj says, It is difficult to think of the mental state the children are in. Every day Rs 8,000 is spent on food and on special occasions, expenditure touches Rs 12,000. Without constant support from the donors, it is a daunting task to meet the needs of the children.Two years after the ashram was started, Gaekwad read a news item about the suicide of a young farmer. He visited the bereaved family in Chandori village in Niphad taluk. Along with children, he noticed the impact of the children's visit on villagers. Then he decided to run a campaign urging farmers not to commit suicide.Based on the reallife stories and agony of families, songs and dramas were penned. A fortnight in every January is reserved for the campaign, which covers Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. They start the campaign on January 12 , birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda and Jijamaata, mother of the great Maratha king Shivaji. They commence the tour by offering prayers at the birthplace of Jijamaata in Buldhana district.At least 40 boys and girls accompanied by their mausi take part in the campaign. Children enact 10 minutes street plays which depict the problems children and dependents face in the event of the head of the family resorting to suicide unable to face financial problems. The aim of the plays is to convince farmers against taking the extreme step, which affects their beloved. Children also make efforts to convince villagers to quit alcohol and other bad habits. Children meet families in despair and console them.Adhartirth Adharaashram has made a name through its work and is highly respected in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. Gaekwad says there could be hundreds of children in need of facilities offered in his ashram.But we do not have financial resources to accommodate more children, he says.He is hoping that the government will come to the aid of the ashram and help it continue its services. He feels that it will be difficult to run the ashram only on public donations."

Official data shows three-fold increase in the number of farmers employing micro-irrigation techniques in just a year, underscoring the need for judicious use of available water through alternative systems.In 2015-16, only 300-350 farmers applied for subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for micro-irrigation systems. A year on, the number rose sharply to 1,257 in 2016-17. Officials from the Agriculture department link the spurt to the drought that has gripped the State.According to the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency (TANHODA), subsidy is given for growing horticulture crops like vegetables including potato and onion, and non-horticulture crops such as cereals and pulses, based on the area of cultivation.The cost of devices ranges between Rs 31,000 to a few lakhs depending upon the acreage. Those having up to 5 acres are classified as Small and Marginal farmers and provided full subsidy for installing micro-irrigation systems such as drip or sprinkler units. Large-scale farmers are also included in this scheme, and given 75 per cent subsidy, R Mohankumar, Assistant Director of Agriculture told Express.Selected farmers will be offered a choice of 34 government approved companies to choose their equipment from.Officials, however, point out that a majority of farmers employ micro irrigation techniques, despite the subsidy, only as the last resort.February and March saw maximum enrollment of farmers for subsidy. Drip and sprinkler irrigation systems are thought of only during drought and as a last recourse, an official said.The success stories of farmers who reaped benefits of employing micro irrigation techniques are inspiring scores to adopt the same. Such was the reception that farmers who installed the drip and sprinkler system to irrigate horticulture crops are now extending its usage to non-horticulture crops by making minor modifications, officials added.Speaking to Express, M Peter James, a black gram farmer from Manickapuram village near Manachanallur, said, Prior to installing a sprinkler unit in my 4.5 acres of black gram and ladys finger fields, I had to operate the borewell for nearly 4 hours a day per wetting. With sprinklers in place, the running time of borewells has come down to 1 hour per wetting. Drip irrigation for paddyTiruchy-based Anbil Dharmalingam Agriculture College and Research Institute, in September 2016, cultivated multiple varieties of paddy using drip irrigation on experimental basis at Manikandam where the soil is alkali (less permeable, saline) and ground water saline. It turned out to be a success and harvest was done in January 2017. Paddy varieties such as ADT36 and TRY2 were found to viable for drip irrigation.Maintenance of the system is also very important. Agriculture department officials urge farmers to carry out routine maintenance.In the case of saline water, accumulation of salty substance in drip nozzles have to be regularly cleaned for better results, they say."

The chefs at the roadside joints knew the palate of their customers. They did not have to imagine hard for a hybrid snack, having earlier successfully tried their hands at recreating an aloo-da-paratha or mooli paratha or a gobhi paratha with chicken, mutton or fish stuffing. The plain, innocent pakoda is the worst victim. It had seen lacto-vegetable stuffing earlier, but lately has to bear with the more thriving non-vegetarian filling such as the chicken pakoda or the fish pakoda.Now the saddest part. The ubiquitous golgappa, which also goes by the name pani puri or gup-chup in the West and the East of India respectively, are being sold with chicken stuffing in metros like Mumbai and Calcutta. The mashed potato is the victim again. The days are not far when the same will be sold in your neighbourhood joints. These innovations lack creativity and are simply brazen acts of stealing from the recipes of our great-great-grandparents across India.""If it was not for the chicken stuffing inside it, I would never try it in the first place,"" a friend, relishing chicken samosa at a roadside joint, once confided in me in a whisper. I appreciated his sensibility. He perhaps whispered to avoid offending the simple, authentic samosa on my plate. That's guilty consciousness there. I had to return the gesture. I contained my aversion for the metamorphosed food on his plate and reciprocated with a smile. I said okay. Long live our Indian snacks! Now the days are not far when even our pani puri with chicken stuffing will be available in the Indian restaurants in the West, with happy native takers!Email: gurbirwrites@gmail.com"
5922c2377be9e01fe6dfa621,Has Pakistan walked into a Saudi trap?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/apr/04/has-pakistan-walked-into-a-saudi-trap-1589681.html,2017-04-04,"Its now official: Pakistans much acclaimed former Army Chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif is heading for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to take up command of the yet-to-be-formed and Saudi-led 39-country Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism (IMAFT). The alliance has been variously described by pundits as an Islamic Nato.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif informed the Pakistanis in a television interview, over the weekend, that the government had conveyed its formal no objection to the generals new assignment to the Saudis in response to an official request from them to requisition his services for whats still, in a sense, a pie-in-the-sky.The news about the Saudis luring General Raheel, whod stepped down as army chief last November, had first surfaced earlier in January this year. But at that time the government took the babu (bureaucratic) line of defence and claimed it hadnt received any thing formal in that respect.The uproar, then unleashed, didnt focus on General Raheel donning a new mantle within months of his retirement. Rules of business in Pakistan, otherwise, frown on any soldier taking up a foreign governments employment before two years of retirement.The uproar, instead, was centred on a Pakistani military chief heading a clap-trap conjured up by the Saudis whod tried earlier, but failed, to rope in Pakistan, militarily, on their side in the ongoing war against a hapless Yemen.Much to the chagrin of Nawazwhose abiding and unquestioning loyalty to the Saudis is an open secret in Pakistanthe Pakistani parliament had, unanimously, shot down the idea and forbidden Pakistan from assuming any role in the Yemeni imbroglio. The lawmakers objection had a ring of authentic visceral reading of the pan-Islamic crisis the Saudis had spawned off their own bat against a weak and dirt-poor Yemen.The Yemenis, according to the Saudi narrative justifying their flagrant violation of the Yemeni sovereignty and territorial integrity, had been blamed for working as Iranian proxies to challenge Saudi Arabia at its traditional turf in their underbelly Yemen.The Pakistani lawmakers, as well as the much-maligned chattering class of the intelligentsia not in hog to the Saudi-servile and pusillanimous Nawaz regime, however had no problem in seeing the Yemeni adventure as a product of Saudi-Iranian tug-of-war for one-upmanship within the Islamic Ummah. IMAFT smacked too brazenly of the Saudis beefing up their ranks, with as many followers as they could cajole, coax or coerce, in their war of nerves against the Iranians.Pakistan, the nay-sayers argued, was a majority Sunni Muslim state with a sizeable Shiite Muslim minority, numbering at least one-fourth of its total population. On top of it, Pakistan shared a longand lately increasingly troublesomeborder with Iran, while sharing none with Saudi Arabia. Pakistan, common sense dictated, shouldnt burn its fingers in joining an alliance that didnt include an Islamic state as important and sensitive as Iran. Walking into the Saudi trap would be suicidal for Pakistan.At that time, some mealy-mouthed pundits had reasoned that General Raheel himself, wasnt in favour of becoming the head honcho of any scheme palpably calculated to become a divisive force and had so informed the Saudis.But the latest turn of events suggests that either the general had no such reservations to begin with, or had since been won over by the Saudis and the Nawaz government working in unison. A defence ministry spokesperson literally seemed to put a stamp of authenticity on it by telling the media that smoothening the way for Raheel to head IMAFT was part of the state policy.According to official sources, the general will be taking up the command of his still-nebulous force in Riyadh in April, weeks ahead of a May meeting in Saudi Arabia of defence ministers of participating states in the alliance to chalk out its structure and modalities. They will arguably be fleshing out the putative alliances bare bones.However, putting the general in harness before the Ministerial conclave seems apparently motivated by the Saudi tactic to pre-empt any move from any quarters to have some other soldier, from some country other than Pakistan, heading the alliances command.That, Raheel-specificity, precisely, is the sore point for the visceral Pakistani pundits, lawmakers and intellectuals objecting to what they see as a crooked Saudi scheme to rope in Pakistan against a neighbour of such sensitive dynamics as Iran. They may have lowered their guard in the months since the idea was first mooted but are losing no time to scramble to it in the face of the Nawaz clique succumbing to crude arm-twisting of their Saudi mentors.It makes sense for a beleaguered Nawazwhose fate hangs in the balance with the apex court still sitting on its judgment in the case about his and his childrens corruption and wholesale money-makingbeing desperate to do a last service to his Saudi mentors. He may, if the throw of the dice goes against him, still end up seeking another refuge with them, as he did earlier in 1999.But really perplexing is the military brass change of heart. Earlier the generals were in sync with those who loathed any idea of Pakistan going out on a limb in an intra-Islamic feud; it was a hot potato they rather shouldnt relish. What has transpired in just two months, since last January, to have made such a sea-change?The Pakistani pundits are lost for a logical answer other than a premonition that their civil and military leaders may blindly be walking into an abyss of national shame.Karamatullah K GhoriFormer Pakistani diplomatEmail: K_K_ghori@yahoo.com"
5922c2d97be9e01fe6dfa6fa,JD(U)'s refusal to back Lalu on BJP charges angers RJD,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/may/01/jdus-refusal-to-back-lalu-on-bjp-charges-angers-rjd-1599904.html,2017-05-01,"PATNA: With the Opposition BJP continuing to accuse RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadavs family of illegally acquiring massive property, RJD ally JD(U)s unwillingness to support Yadav in the matter on Monday sparked off an ugly verbal spat between Bihars two ruling allies.Even as senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has been levelling allegations against Yadav one after another for nearly a month, JD(U) leaders had been maintaining a tight lip on the issue. But JD(U) washed its hands off the political hot potato when the partys Rajya Sabha member RCP Singh, considered close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, made it clear on Sunday that his party was under no compulsion to defend anybody.JD(U) sources said Nitish Kumar, facing BJPs continual taunts about his silence over the allegations Yadav faces, finally deployed Singh to put forward his partys stand. We (JD-U) are not responsible to speak on this matter (BJP charges against Yadav familys assets). People who face the charges should answer, Singh said.Modi has named three shell companies that came into the total ownership of Yadavs family members in recent years and thus handed them prime land. He has also accused Yadav of having taken prime land and house as gifts for his two sons from two senior RJD leaders - Raghunath Jha and Kanti Singh - in return for making them ministers in the UPA-1 government. RJD leaders have rubbished these charges even as Modi demands a probe by the state government.RCP Singh is no real leader He was a bureaucrat who was brought into politics. They (JD-U) must not make the mistake of thinking that we (RJD) are weak. It is on our votes that they are in power today, said Bhai Birendra, a senior RJD legislator close to the party chief. RJD has the largest number of MLAs in Bihars three-party alliance government. He also said most RJD legislators are unhappy with the government led by Nitish Kumar as JD(U) leaders, he said, were getting officials posted as per their wish.JD(U) reacted sharply with spokesperson Sanjay Singh asking RJD to muzzle leaders like Birendra. If the snake-charmer himself becomes snake, he must be immediately killed, he said, adding that Bihars people handed victory to the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance due to the leadership of Nitish Kumar.RJD leaders were also angered by Singhs statement on BJPs charges of Yadav promoting dynasty politics. While RJD leaders have been strongly defending the posts occupied by Yadavs family members, saying they are all duly elected leaders and peoples spontaneous choice, Singh said JD(U) is against dynasty politics. yadavs two sons are ministers in the State government - deputy chief minister Tejaswi Yadav and health minister Tej Pratap Yadav - and his daughter Misa Bharti is a Rajya Sabha member, while the RJD chiefs wife Rabri Devi is an MLC."

Many families lost their valuables, but no one was injured.This was the third major fire accident here in the last six months.The fire broke out around 5.10am, and 18 fire tenders rushed to the spot within 30 minutes. The haphazard placement of the huts made it difficult for the tenders to reach the spot, so the fire brigade decided to use pipe extensions and contain the fire from three different directions. They managed to control the blaze before it could do further damage in the area.Local residents, upon hearing the commotion, rushed outside. Some managed to salvage their valuables, but a majority could not.The fire brigade ran into some resistance from the residents, who were desperate to save their homes. A few youths broke the water pipe on a fire tender and tried to douse the fire in their homes; a few miscreants took advantage of the confusion and made off with the tender's copper nozzles. A few others tried to take the pipes away.Ansarbhai, a local resident, was sleeping in his home with his wife and two children. ""We heard noises like fireworks, and woke up. We ran outside the house, and there was pandemonium outside. I am happy that we all are safe,"" he told TOI.However, Ansarbhai lost all of his earthly possessions. ""I recently, put up new tin sheets on the roof. But now everything is gone,"" he said.Fire brigade officials suspect a malfunction in a potato chip-making unit nearby as the cause of the fire, which was fuelled by the oil stored in the unit. Local residents say the unit was being operated illegally. A detailed report on the incident will be submitted to municipal authorities.All the huts in the locality were built using tin sheets. A few structures were used to store timber or other wooden objects. They were all destroyed in the conflagration.Six months ago, about six timber shops were gutted in a blaze. Three months ago, three shops, a few houses and five four-wheelers were charred in a fire in the same area."
5922c2f47be9e01fe6dfa723,Blowing hot and cold over spy saga,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/apr/17/blowing-hot-and-cold-over-spy-saga-1594264.html,2017-04-17,"The pot of simmering tension between India and Pakistan has been stirred to another spasmodic boiling point with the death sentence of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an alleged Indian spy on the payroll of Indias prime intelligence agency, the RAW.Jadhav, said to be an in-service Indian Naval officer on loan to RAW, was handed down the capital punishment by a military court in Rawalpindi on April 10. The charge sheet against him alleged he was running an extensive spy network in Pakistans strife-torn Balochistan provincewith hundreds of locally-recruited agentsfrom his sanctuary in neighbouring Iran. Hed been nabbed in Balochistan last year. His trial lasted for more than three months.Briefing the Senate in Islamabad on April 11, Pakistani Defence Minister Khwaja Asif said Jadhav was working against Pakistans integrity by promoting terror and by spying for India. He defended Jadhavs trial and conviction by being charitable at the same time. Under Pakistans Military Act of 1952, Jadhav has 40 days to appeal to a higher military court and has also the right to move a higher civilian court if his sentence is maintained. A mercy appeal to the president of Pakistan for clemency will be a last resort for him.Understandably, the harsh penalty to Jadhav has touched a raw nerve in India. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, decrying it as pre-meditated murder, warned Pakistan to beware of its fallout on Indo-Pakistan relations. She also assured an irate Lok Sabha that India will go out of its way to ensure Jadhav's return. Of course she didnt elaborate what that out-of-the-way would be.Not surprisingly, Jadhavs sentencing is being hailed in Pakistan as convincing evidence that a BJP-controlled India, swayed by its Hindutva ideology that professes hate against Muslims, has been pursuing a conspiracy to unhinge and destabilise Pakistan. The nerves in Pakistan have been badly rattled by the BJPs victory in the recent UP elections.The complete eclipse of Muslim influence in what has traditionally been seen as the cradle of a millennium-old Indo-Gangetic culture has rubbed the Pakistaniswith many still having families in UPthe wrong way. The Jadhav saga has only fuelled their abhorrence of Hindutvas exclusivist agenda. But theres certainly much more to this cloak-and-dagger saga of an Indian spy caught red-handed as per the charge against him.Giving a macabre twist to the unfolding drama of two countries with a hot potato on their hands is the disappearance of a retired colonel of the Pakistan army from Nepal, close to the border with India.The strange story of this ex-serviceman strains credibility and sounds too apocryphal to be true. He was called for a job interview to Nepal by an Englishman with a presence in that country. The phone number used turned out to be computer generated from India. The man hasnt been heard from since April 9, from his last location near the India-Nepal land border.But the bizarre twist has many takers in Pakistan. Conventional wisdom on the grisly episode is already hooked on the belief that the RAW has engineered this drama, enticed the Pakistani ex-soldier to walk into their trap and abducted him. The bets are on that there would, eventually, be a trade-off between the two countries.Pundits are already refusing to hedge their bets on their prognosis that Jadhav will not be hanged. A spy swap will be an ideal scenario to bring down the curtain on all the commotion-filled drama. It will be a solution with a lot of necessary face-saving for both countries. And face-saving will have to be an essential and unavoidable part of any rancour-free settlement.Once again, the dyarchy of the Pakistani establishment hasnt failed to manifest its role in this spy saga, too.The GHQ-inspired gung-ho chauvinism is looking for a lot of fodder in it to feed its nationalistic pride. It isnt jingoism, exactly, but something bordering on it. Sushmas tough talk hasnt gone unnoticed and invited a quick and robust backlash from those not prepared to ever remove their blinkers. They arent mincing their words on paying back India in its own coin if New Delhi follows through on its warning of a dire fallout from the saga.But Nawaz Sharif seems still unswayed and unscathed by the wave of swashbuckling riposte to India in the face of Sushmas harsh words. Addressing the passing-out parade of officers at the Air Force Academy on April 12, Nawaz still seemed poised to extend an olive branch to India. Without ever mentioning the Jadhav episode, he said Pakistan believed in being on good terms with all its neighbours.The Jadhav episode, since his arrest last year has, in fact, been wielded by Nawazs political opponents as a whip to lash him with publicly. Nawaz has been accused of being pusillanimous, vis-a-vis a jingoistic India. His opponents accused him, for instance, of getting cold feet in his address to the UN General Assembly last September, and not making a pointed reference to Indias blatant meddling in Pakistan and its alleged sponsorship of terrorism.So Nawaz is apparently treading a very fine line, not only in the context of this spy saga, but in relation to the totality of Pakistans strained relationship with India. He must always keep an eye on how a robust parochialism, whipped on the theme of a confrontationist India, is distancing his softer approach from the popular wave. Nawaz is obviously on thin ice. But to his abiding dismay, if not alarm, his stance is getting no help from an India itself consumed by Hindutva fanaticism.Someone has got to throw him a lifeline.The author is a former Pakistani diplomat.Email: K_K_ghori@yahoo.com"

Yet each birthday marks a milestone in ones life, justifying a celebration no matter how small. Perhaps nothing brings people together as readily as a birthday does. A birthday party I once attended turned out to be hilarious.The birthday boy, an ingenuous youngster in his early 20s, turned up and breezily announced, Ill join all of you as soon as Ive changed into my birthday suit! For heavens sake, dont!, almost everyone chorused in mock horror, leaving him completely baffled. It turned out that the nave guy had got a new suit specially tailored for the occasionand was blissfully unaware of the negative connotations of appearing in ones birthday suit! Forgetting a loved ones birthday is a common human failure.I sometimes forget my wifes birthday, triggering much acrimony. And trying to make amends only sours her disposition further, bringing forth stinging accusations like You never forget your brothers birthdays! I usually cut a sorry figure conceding that she does have a valid point there. As Ogden Nash pertinently observed, Marriage is the alliance of two people, one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other never forgets them.It was Robert Frost who defined a diplomat as one who always remembers a womans birthday but never her age. Sadly, Im no diplomat and sometimes tend to blurt out indiscreetly, As far as I can remember, you turned 37 last year.This gaffe is usually enough to make the flustered lady blush a shade of red seldom seenand drop me like a hot potato from her list of future birthday party invitees! While in service, I used to wish my Scottish boss unfailingly on his birthday. Then one day he surprised me with his perspicacity. Tell me, he remarked shrewdly, Is there any link between my birthday and your annual confidential report thats due around the same time? Smirking, I left it to him to draw his own conclusions!It must be said, to his credit, that after retiring from India he thoughtfully gifted me a three-year subscription to The Writer on my thirtieth birthday. This London-based monthly for aspiring writers proved to be a real boon. I still treasure the old yellowing issues. Talking of birthday gifts, a friend once confided that a clever wife is one who knows how to re-tie the birthday gift her husband has hidden from her!"
