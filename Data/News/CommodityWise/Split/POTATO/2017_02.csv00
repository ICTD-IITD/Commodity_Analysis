Rohtang pass received over 20cm snow. The traffic on Manali-Keylong highway remained interrupted. Peaks of Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Kangra and Kinnaur were seen wearing a white mantle. While Keylong recorded minimum temperature of 2.6 degrees in the last 24 hours, Manali was cold at 6.2 degrees Celsius.Snowfall came as surprise for farmers of Lahaul, where vegetable crops worth lakhs of rupees are likely to get damaged. With the melting of snow and higher temperature, they had started cultivating cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, peas, potato and many other varieties. Dinesh, a farmer from Shansha village of Lahaul, said that, ""Cabbage and peas have been damaged after snowfall. I shall have to cultivate it again. Farmers have suffered huge losses."" Another farmer Prem from Jahlama village said he had cultivated peas, cauliflower and lilium (flower) on five bighas,which has rotten after the snowfall.According to the meteorological centre, Shimla, the minimum temperate at many places in Himachal was below the normal temperature at this time of the year. There is prediction of more snowfall on high hills in the next few days."

They are, of course, talking about food. I always tell them that there are places that are not new  in fact, some are as old as the hills  but they are still new to us.But since the question pops up every now and then, I made my way to Sham Sweets at Bud Shah Bullah the other day to find out more about these old, but still unknown little places in Old Delhi.Tell me, I asked my friend there, where do I go for samosas in Old Delhi. The owner, Sanjay Aggarwal, thought for a bit, and then urged me try out a small samosa shop in Galli Anaar. They fry samosas with a filling of bhindi, or okra, he said, and my mouth started watering at once.He gave me the directions, and I hopped on to a passing rickshaw. Its easier to reach Galli Anaar from the Chandni Chowk side of Old Delhi. From Chandni Chowk, get into Dariba Kalan. Then turn right into Kinari Bazaar. After some 20 shops or so, you will pass Hazari Lal Jains khurchan shop on your left. Turn left immediately after that into an old and narrow lane. Keep moving on that galli till you spot Jain Saabs shop on your left. Keep an eye for it, because its a nondescript little place thats easy to miss.The shop, I was told, has been there from 1944. Though locally known as Jain Saab kachoriwaley, the formal name is Jai Tara, or Badri Prasad Tara Chand Jains shop. The address is 2283 Dharampura, Dariba, and the phone numbers are 011-23260425 and 9811008716.Jain Saab is no more. The shop is run by one of his younger sons. I asked for my bhindi samosas. The two assistants there were taken aback, because that was the first they were hearing of it. They didnt make bhindi samosas, I was informed. And being Jains, they didnt do potato samosas either. They used to earlier fry samosas filled with green bananas, but there were not too many takers for those. So these days, their samosas were filled with a mash of peas and spices.That sounded good, too, but unfortunately it wasnt my day for samosas. They prepared their samosas only in the evenings, they said. The daytime was for kachoris.At the back I could see a big kadhai filled with bubbling oil, and a new batch of kachoris being fried. The smell was heady, and the kachoris looked delicious. So I asked for a khasta kachori and had a wonderful early lunch.Crispy and lightThe kachori was truly crisp, and had been fried so well that there was no trace of oil on it. Of course, it is deep fried, so a kachori is by definition heavy in oil. But a good kachori stands out when it is not dripping in oil. And this one stood out.Second, the filling of a dal paste was excellent  with just the right spices and seasoning. Third, it came with some yummy methi (fenugreek) chutney and chholey. There was a time when the kachoris were only served with the chutney, but market demands prompted the owners to give a helping of chholey on the side. The chutney is also good for those with diabetes, one of the assistants helpfully added.Kachoris and samosas are for Rs. 15 a piece. They also sell sweets, but have a limited menu. On it are gulab jamuns, balushahi , besan and atta laddoo, gujiya and ghewar during the rains. Among the savouries they have khasta mathri and kurkurey. And, of course, they prepare samosas every afternoon and kachoris in the mornings.Though I had been salivating over the image of a samosa filled with fried, spicy okra, I wasnt unhappy with the kachori at all. The outside was crunchy and the stuffing was soft. I broke off a piece of the kachori, scooped out some chholey with it, and then topped it with the chutney. I can describe the experience in one word  Aah!I must remember to thank Sanjay of Sham Sweets. For now, I have an answer to that question, So whats new."

Thirtysix-year-old Ayaskant Badpanda of Dangarpada village under Jujumura block of the district has turned 50 acres of agriculture land into a profitable integrated-farming model for others to emulate.Ayaskant grows paddy, vegetables and fruits besides undertaking poultry farming and pisciculture. This season, he has cultivated vegetables like potala (pointed gourd) in two acres, potato in three acres and chilly in half an acre of land.He has also planted watermelons in five acres and banana in half an acre.While Ayaskant owns five acres of land, he has taken the remaining 45 acres on lease from fellow villagers. Only during kharif season, he grows paddy in the entire 50 acres as the village depends on monsoon for paddy cultivation.A Matriculate, Ayaskant said he earns around `7,000 per acre from paddy cultivation in the land owned by him while he gets about `3,000 per acre from the land taken on lease during kharif season. Apart from paddy, vegetables and fruits, he generates around `1.2 lakh annually from poultry farming and about `50,000 annually from pisciculture in the tank spread over one acre. Altogether, his annual income from farming comes to about `7 lakh.Ayaskant was attracted towards farming at the age of 16 years and learnt the nuances from his father Nirakar Badpanda.He said his father was cultivating paddy in five acres besides potala and watermelon in half-an-acre each. However, he started farming independently in 2001 with cultivation of paddy in five acres besides potala and watermelon in one acre each. At present, he has engaged 20 labourers who work in his farm land throughout the year.He draws water from lift irrigation project set up on the banks of Bhutel nullah passing through the village besides a deep borewell for cultivation of vegetables and fruits. He had procured a tractor, a power tiller and dug up the borewell with support from National Horticulture Mission.Selling the farm produce has never been a problem for Ayaskant. His fresh vegetables and fruits are much in demand among people and traders, who often come to his village to procure his produce. He also sells vegetables and fruits at Golebazaar, the main vegetable market in Sambalpur, situated at a distance of about 25 km from the village."

Opposition members raised the issue about the chaotic scenes involving the two Cabinet Ministers.Singh also said that the two ministers have held discussions. Both Raju and Geete were present in the House when Singh made the statement.During the Zero Hour, there were unruly scenes with Shiv Sena members protesting against the ban and even thumping the desk of Raju in anger."

This is the first big project by a foreign national in the recent years in Punjab.The state government is hoping that would lift industry sentiments in the debt-ridden Punjab that has largely seen shutdown of units and flourishing of sand and mining mafia in the past few yearsA PepsiCo delegation, led by its chairman & CEO India Region Shiv Shivakumar and vice-president (global procurement) V D Sharma, met chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday to discuss major expansion and investment plans in the state.The company, which already has Asia's largest potato minituber lab in Zahura in Hoshiarpur district and a state-of-the-art bulk storage in the state, has offered technical support to the Congress government to develop Punjab as a premium citrus fruit producing state.""In this project, PepsiCo will now help realize the government's vision of farm diversification to steer farmers from paddy cultivation to the cash-rich citrus fruits,"" said Amarinder.Horticulture specialist James H Keithly from USA, who was also part of the PepsiCo delegation, unveiled a five-year plan for the production of high-yielding quality processing varieties of citrus plants at Jallowal nursery in Hoshiarpur.The delegation showed interest in collaborating with the state government to revive the horticulture project initiated during Amarinder's previous tenure, besides exploring the possibility of sourcing citrus fruits for their juices and concentrates from the state.Total 1,125 acres of area would be covered under the citrus plantation across the state. According to the plan, 55 acres would be brought under plantation of citrus plantation varieties of Kinnow, Daisy and W Murcott. In 2018, 170 acres would be brought under Carrizo, JattiKhatti and Carrizo rootstock liners. Likewise, 300 acres of area would be brought under Carrizo, JattiKhatti and Volk liners during 2019, 2020, and 2021, to expand the ambit of citrus cultivation in order to tap the land potential in the state.The chief minister, while reiterating his government's commitment to farm diversification to improve the lot of the state's beleaguered farming community, directed additional chief secretary, horticulture, Himmat Singh to work out the modalities for the citrus project in collaboration with PepsiCo.The chief minister urged the delegation to further explore opportunities for the farmers of south Punjab to be a part of the project while directing the horticulture department to give liberal subsidies for schemes like drip irrigation. He also asked the department to prepare a comprehensive action plan to adequately enhance the capacities of the two existing Punjab Agro juicing plants, at Abohar and Hoshiarpur, to meet the juicing demands of PepisCo.Amarinder directed the CEO Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion to make the proposed new industrial policy conducive to the juicing industry to enable the state's farmers to reap the maximum benefit by getting a remunerative price for their crop. He also asked the principal secretary to take up the matter of ensuring eight hour uninterrupted power supply to the orchards with the chairman-cum-managing director, Punjab State Power Corporation."

""Now, she is less enthusiastic about resuming school,"" says her mother Tina.Preetha Sharma, a 12-year-old student, echoes Alisha's sentiments. ""I usually buy vada pav, chips and chocolates almost thrice a week from the canteen . I will miss eating all these items if they ban it. Though I carry lunch from home, I love eating fast food during the short break. All my friends do it, too. My parents tell me about the ill-effects of eating junk food , and it's only at school that I have it. Once I reach home, I anyway drink milk and then eat fruits in the evening, followed by dinner. So why can't I have my favourite foods once in a while at school?"" she asks.Alisha and Preetha are among the many kids in the city who are upset about the ban, which came into effect after the Maharashtra government issued a Government Resolution (GR) on Monday, asking schools not to sell items that are 'High in Fat, Salt and Sugar' (HFSS).Now that items like potato chips, noodles, aerated drinks, pizzas, burgers, cakes, biscuits, buns and pastries might no longer feature on canteen menus, parents are happy that this will keep childhood obesity and other related disorders in check. Arundhati Chavan, president of Parents Teacher Association (PTA), shares, ""We've been fighting for this for the last five years. While some schools anyway don't encourage sale of junk food and have their own midday meal programmes, others instruct parents on what they need to pack for tiffins. Some parents do give their kids snacks like noodles and wafers in their dabbas, but that's only when the children throw a tantrum. We don't recommend junk food because kids tend to feel hungry soon after consuming it and lose concentration as well.""There are some parents who believe that despite the ban, kids will eat junk food outside the premises. Radhika Kochhar, mother of a 13-year-old boy, shares, ""Kids may be forced to eat healthier items in school from now on, but when they step out of the premises, they will buy junk food from vendors. So, how do we control that?""Anushka Desai, teacher at a suburban school, adds that it's not just school authorities who are responsible for what kids eat. Parents, too, need to be strict when it comes to their diet. After all, the GR does not stop children from carrying junk food in their lunch boxes. She says, ""Parents should resist giving in to the demands of kids and try to limit intake of unhealthy food items even at home. They can control consumption of junk food by ensuring that the kids have a balanced, nutritious diet throughout the week  be it at home or in school. Kids can be allowed to indulge in their favourite food items once a week. They need to be taught why junk food is called 'junk' and emphasise on the unhealthy aspects of it. If they start at an early age, it is easier for kids to make correct food choices.""Dietician and sports nutritionist Sakina Patrawala believes banning all junk items from the canteen is not the solution. ""Schools need to get a nutritionist on board to review the canteen menu and make healthier changes without compromising on the taste. This will help improve the quality of food served at the canteen. The school also has to ensure complete hygiene among canteen staff and also in the premises. Also, seminars on health need to be regularly organised for children as well as parents so that they can learn about healthy eating habits.""Nisha Ranganathan, mother of a teenager, adds, ""While I believe that the ban is a first step in the right direction, parents and school authorities should come together to ensure kids eat healthy. I think seminars and talk sessions on food habits must be made compulsory. Also, make healthy meals interesting for kids by presenting them in innovative ways.""> Instead of maida in frankies, use whole wheat to make the rolls.

5922e1b17be9e01fc7f5b1bb,Here's how Wajid Ali Shah made the Kolkata biryani,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heres-how-wajid-ali-shah-made-the-kolkata-biryani/articleshow/58622647.cms,2017-05-11,"You could take the Nawab out of Lucknow, but could you ever take Lucknow out of the Nawab? Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."

5922e8ac7be9e01fc7f5b93b,Peru Supreme Court rules against Newmont in dispute over gold mine,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/peru-supreme-court-rules-against-newmont-in-dispute-over-gold-mine/articleshow/58505285.cms,2017-05-04,"LIMA, May 3 (Reuters) - Peru's Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday in favor of a farmer who Newmont Mining Corp claimed had illegally occupied its land, dealing a blow to the U.S. miner's long-stalled efforts to build a $5 billion gold mine in the Andean country.A lower court had ruled in favor of potato farmer Maxima Acuna in 2014, a decision Newmont appealed. While the court's Wednesday ruling upholding the lower court's decision in the criminal case is final, two civil cases to determine ownership of the land are still winding through the courts.Newmont put plans to build its Conga mine on hold after violent protests broke out in Peru's northern Cajamarca region, one of the country's poorest and its second-largest in gold production. Environmentalists said the mine would poison local water sources and displace people living and farming there.Acuna had said her home was destroyed as part of the mine's construction, and that the family's attempts to rebuild it have been blocked. Newmont's Peruvian unit Minera Yanacocha SRL, in which Peru's Buenaventura SAA is a junior partner, took her to criminal court, saying she had ""usurped"" its land.""I feel happy and relieved that here in the capital [the court] has also provided justice,"" Acuna, who won the Goldman Prize for environmental activism last year, said after the court hearing on Wednesday. ""I only hope not to suffer more abuse from the company.""Speaking to reporters after the court decision, Yanacocha lawyer Christian Schroder said the company considered the disputed lands part of its property. Yanacocha is open to ""dialogue with the family to not continue all these cases underway,"" he said.Yanacocha's namesake mine, also in Cajamarca, has historically been the country's largest, but production has fallen in recent years. Conga has been expected to offset dwindling output at the aging Yanacocha, and Buenaventura told Reuters earlier this year it was studying a long-term business plan with Newmont that could include Conga. In a statement, Yanacocha said it would respect the Supreme Court decision and would ""continue defending the company's rights"" through the pending civil court cases.

5922ec357be9e01fc7f5bc91,The man who launched a thousand Darshinis,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/the-man-who-launched-a-thousand-darshinis/articleshow/58557709.cms,2017-05-07,"Coffee or kokum sherbet? Rava or ragi dosa? Even as newbies wonder what to order at Upahara Darshini (UD) in Jayanagar, Manasa Harish buys tokens for her staple - masala dosa, picks up her plate and settles with it and a glass of water at the small stainless steel table. She sniffs at the ragi dosa eater who is picking at her food and quickly finishes her crisp dosa filled with a mildly spiced potato masala. ""Every time I come to the maternity hospital nearby for consultation, I eat masala dosa here,"" smiles Harish.Eating at a Darshini is an exercise in minimalism. There is no time or lengthy menu to plot the next culinary adventure. Once you give the order, you should be prepared to hop from one counter to the other in quick succession, and eat your food standing while sharing the table with office-goers, offduty security guards and moms with cranky school children in tow.So it is better to stick to tried and tested food as the kitchen at UD churns out dosas and thatte idlis in full view of its diners.This is how Prabhakar R envisioned the ideal Indian fast food restaurant when he started the first Darshini in 1983 where now UD stands. ""Darshini means to see and select food (from a menu) as in a KFC or McDonald's,"" says Prabhakar. In this case, one gets to order south Indian staples at pocketfriendly prices just like he saw during a trip abroad. ""Simple and fast. That's what we needed to beat MNC restaurants and high food prices,"" says Prabhakar, sitting at his Banashankari residence.Today, three decades later, Baba Ramdev wants to start a chain of Indian QSRs or quick service restaurants to gain nationalist mileage and profits while beating 'foreign competition'. Prabhakar, who calls himself a consumer activist and a consult ant, says the more the merrier.""Maybe, Ramdev will be able to do it na tionally,"" he says.Prabhakar is underplaying the impact his Darshinis have had on the eating-out culture. The city has hundreds of Darshinis, most of them mentored for free by the 64-year-old. The model is so popular that the city cor poration has been issuing trade licenses for ""Darshini type hotel"" since the mid-2000s.At the heart of a successful Darshini eatery is pricing. And that is achieved by scaling up operations while keeping things sim ple. ""Earlier, people used to put money on fancy interiors and charge food at three times its price.There was no quality and affordable food for students and working population,"" recalls Prabhakar.At the age of 27, he was already a businessman running a grocery store in Basavanagudi. Prabhakar, whose father G Ranganath ran Udupi hotels in Mumbai and Solapur after leaving Kundapur , had insights into the food industry after helping manage the familyowned Nithyanand Coffee Bar in Basavanagudi. Adulteration and high prices bothered him. A trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Europe helped him come up with a solution. ""I saw KFC and McDonald's and realized that we needed south Indian fast food restaurants,"" says Prabhakar.Back home, Prabhakar adapted the self-service restaurant model at his brother-in-law's Cafe Darshini, which required minimal investment in real estate and labour. ""No body took it seriously as they thought fast food won't work. Then they saw the rush and high turnover,"" smiles Prabhakar.A number of Darshinis came up and Prabha kar became the go-to mentor for food entre preneurs.G Srini vasa Rao, chairman and MD of Mayura Group, still recalls Prabhakar's suggestion to serve 120 ml soup for Rs 5 in 1996. ""I was new to Bengaluru and he was called Darshini Brahma by then. I followed what he suggested and it was a big hit,"" says Rao. That suggestion built the iconic Cool Joint in Jayanagar. ""He knows three things: how to ensure quality of food, what kind of food locals will like and at what price.Cool Joint's sandwich and soup menu was revolutionary,"" he says.Entrepreneurs like R Vasudevan of Hot Chips sought out Prabhakar when the time came for expansion. ""He advised us to keep the price low with no compromise on quality,"" says Vasudevan. But how to sell coffee for Rs 3 in 1995 and make a margin? ""He asked us to focus on volume; that is to sell 2,0003,000 coffees a day,"" says Vasudevan. Prabhakar also told which Coorg coffee to buy and sent experts to train the team in coffeemaking. The experiment worked, says Vasudevan whose 30 self-service restaurants now have a turnover of Rs 100 crore.""This is the model he created even before KFCs and others came to India. By the time the international chains came in, we realized how good his foresight was. He had prepared us even before the competition came in,"" says Vasudevan.Innovations didn't stop there. There was food by weight concept, food trucks, dosa camps, the rural-themed Halli Mane, much ad mired by writers like UR Ananthamurthy, and jazzy new outlets like Taaza Thindi and South Kitchen. ""The interiors and hygiene have to be good to appeal to young sters. There are many north Indians in Bengaluru who are homesick. So food has to appeal to them too,"" says Prabhakar.Despite a nerve problem leading to vision loss, Prabhakar remains active. ""His latest project is South Kitchen. Finally , the family owns something that he has created, after he sold off the original Cafe Darshini all those years ago,"" says Santhosh Prabhakar, his son, who runs cafeterias for corporates.At one point, Prabhakar was so focused on helping others that he stopped running his retail business. Then there were threats from people whom he exposed through media campaigns as adulterators.""My family wanted me to stop my consulting and campaigning. But I didn't stop,"" smiles Prabhakar.His children Seema and Santhosh say that they understand their father's passion for social justice. Santhosh says his father was shaped by the ups and downs any businessman goes through.Though his lack of interest in profit-making occasionally puzzles him, he is happy that Prabhakar tried to make the food industry more process-oriented.There is no quiet retired life for Prabhakar. He continues to consult and remains vocal about 18% GST being ruinous to small eateries. As for the ambitious plan of Karnataka government to start affordable canteens, he is blunt. ""It is going to be a 100% failure as there is no planning,"" says Prabhakar. Unlike in Chennai, which pioneered the popular Amma canteens, real estate is costly in Bengaluru. But where to cook food hygienically? It might work if they have a centralized kitchen and food trucks to sell the items,"" he says.As they say, it is all about the process with Prabhakar."
