The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel. Self-taught baker and dessert chef Tanvi Kirawant, or as she likes to call herself the Nagpur tigress, tells it takes her 50 steps to make the dessert. We manage to polish it off in five, quick bites.Swey at Atria, Worli, is open from 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.; 9820436666"

Potato output would be around 47 million tonnes this year,"" National Horticulture Board (NHB) Managing Director A K Singh told .Initially, NHB had projected 43.88 million tonnes output for this year. But this will be revised after assessing the arrival, he said.Singh further said that total area under potato was more or less at last year's level. But, good weather conditions coupled with recent unseasonal rains just before the harvest gave boost to the crop prospect and improved yields, he said.The crop condition in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar -- the top three potato producing states -- is in very good condition.As per the state data, the output in Uttar Pradesh -- the country's top potato producing state -- is projected to be higher at 15 million tonnes this year as against 13.8 million tonnes last year, he added.So much potato is grown in UP that the centre has started procurement operation to ensure farmers avoid distressed sale.The output in West Bengal and Bihar is also expected to be better than last year. In 2015-16, the output stood at 8 million tonnes and 6 million tonnes, respectively, in these two states. LUX BAL"

Prices are generally lower in western UP than in eastern parts of the state.In 2016-17, the state produced a record 155-160 lakh metric tonnes of potato. Adityanath has also reached out to the Narendra Modi government for help, asking Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh to impress upon other states to procure potato from UP and immediately call a meeting of state agriculture ministers in this regard. The UP chief minister also wants potato crop from the state to get prominence for procurement in the Centre's e-National Agricultural Mart.This comes after a top-level committee set up by Adityanath last week submitted a report. As per the report, potato prices in 19 key markets of UP as on April 10 vary widely between Rs 290 per quintal in Farukkhabad and Rs 690 in Lucknow.In nine mandis including seven in western UP in Agra, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Meerut, the wholesale price is less than Rs 400 while it is above Rs 500 in six other mandis including ones in eastern UP in Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Gonda.""If an arrangement is made to transport potato produce from low-price mandis to the highprice ones, then farmers can get a proper price. District collectors of these districts should coordinate, publicise the mandi prices in newspapers daily and inspire farmers to shift their produce from the low-price offering mandis to the high-price ones,"" the UP government said in an order issued on April 18."
5923077f7be9e01fc00712f2,Wholesale inflation decelerates to 5.7%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wholesale-inflation-decelerates-to-57/article18089491.ece,2017-04-18,"A decline in the prices of fuel and manufactured products helped inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), to moderate to 5.7% (provisional) for March 2017 despite hardening of food prices, data released by the government on Monday showed.The WPI inflation had touched a 39-month high of 6.55% (provisional) in February while it was -0.45% in March 2016.Compared to last month (February), WPI Inflation declined by 85 basis points (bps) to 5.70% in March17 due to sharp decrease in prices of items like potato (-17.07%), onion (-10.78%), non-food articles (4.91%), oil seeds (-0.9%), said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, Economic Research Department, SBI.Earlier, the largest decline in month-on-month inflation was in August 15, Mr. Ghosh added. The decline was accentuated by decline in fuel and power inflation and manufactured products.... Fuel prices were significantly cut on March 31 while rupee has been on an appreciating trend since February 2017.These two factors have pushed down fuel and manufactured product prices, he said.Primary food inflation trended higher as vegetable inflation emerged after six months of deflation although food price pressures are not yet a concern, as prices of cereals, pulses and spices have fallen sequentially in the last two to three months, said an analysis by Nomura.Fuel price inflation moderated on favourable base effects and a fall in most market-linked fuels. Furthermore, manufactured inflation moderated sharply to 3% in March from 3.7% in February as prices for manufactured food, non-metallic minerals and machine tools declined sequentially while other categories experienced muted increases, it said.Food inflation has increased a bit and this would require greater monitoring in light of the evolving weather conditions, said Pankaj Patel, president of the industry body FICCI.The government is keeping a close tab on the progress made on irrigation projects, cold chain projects etc. and improvement in these areas is likely to yield positive results.The focus on drip irrigation and micro-irrigation along with improvement in the efficiency of cropping patterns and water use mechanisms will strengthen agri-production and productivity, he said. Commodity prices  crude as well as metal prices  had been edging up putting pressure on wholesale prices over the past few months. However, the WPI based inflation announced today shows a decline from the previous month and this can be attributed to softening of inflation in fuel and power and manufactured goods segments. Further, the recent strengthening of rupee vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar will also contribute towards limiting imported inflation, he said.Output pricesThe analysis done by Nomura research analysts Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf said: Despite the surge in input cost inflation since January, firms have been reluctant to raise output prices, likely reflecting uncertainty over the demand outlook after demonetisation.As demand recovers, we expect firms to start passing on past input cost increases to consumers and the sharp drop in perishable food inflation to reverse. Yet, we believe February marked the peak in year-on-year WPI inflation and it should gradually taper off over 2017 on base effects, they added.Considering the higher-than-expected WPI inflation in Q1, we are raising our 2017 forecast to 4.7% (from 4%) they said."

We will take action against officers if the roster is not implemented at the rural level, which was ignored earlier. The government is working for providing 24-hour power supply by October 2018, he said.It has also been decided to change defective transformers within 48 hours not in 72 hours, the time fixed earlier, and 24 hours in urban areas.Settlement schemeAnnouncing a one-time settlement scheme, Mr. Sharma said it was decided to waive surcharge on domestic connection and take only principal amount of the bill.For farmers having bills of over Rs. 10,000 pending, they will get relief by making the payment in four instalments, he said. In a bid to end woes of potato growers, the Cabinet decided to purchase 1 lakh tonnes of potato at Rs. 487 per quintal."

59284bf77be9e0137c77c98b,Changing the way you live,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612558/changing-way-you-live.html,2017-05-20,"Alok Ray May 20 2017, 2:59 ISTAdvertisers target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions.Perhaps the quickest way to understand a societys culture is to study the advertisements. In fact, ads have a two-way link with society. Firstly, ads reflect the prevailing social mores and preferences of the people.For example, the matrimonial ads in India at one time used to seek as groom in order of preference: doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and, as last resort, professors. Some were even more categorical in specifying that the brides family would consider only doctors having degrees from UK and engineers from IITs. Then, over time, with the rising flow of Indian IT professionals abroad, such people working in USA, and Europe began to occupy the pride of place in the list.For some families, apart from enjoying a better material standard of living, staying abroad had the further attraction that it would enable the bride to stay away from the in-laws family. More recently, with MBAs  particularly from the top IIMs  typically earning more than engineers, IIM MBAs have entered the list. Also, an increasing number of matrimonial ads are asking for working brides, instead of housewives, to supplement family income. At the same time, the proliferation of fairness cream ads testifies the premium that the Indian society, by and large, still places on fair skin.It is also interesting to observe how the products promoted by the ads have changed over time. With rising affluence (and aspirations) of the new generation along with easier availability of bank loans for consumer products, the ads for simple consumer goods like basic soaps, detergents and tooth pastes are giving way to more upscale products like body perfumes, air conditioners, motor bikes, cars, LED TVs, smartphones, jewellery, diamonds, flats and villas.Secondly, advertisers  through their ads and promotional campaigns  try to change the tastes, habits, choices and the aspirations of the public. They would make you believe that life is largely meaningless if you dont have a smart phone, shoes, watch, perfume, motorbike, car of a specific brand to distinguish you from the hoi polloi or to make a fashion statement for you.Advertisers particularly target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions in todays society. In addition, investing in changing their preferences is likely to yield higher returns as their life span is longer.In this game of marketing and promotion, celebrities play a significant role. This is an age-old technique. Older people would remember seeing ads in newspapers and movie theatres (long before the advent of TVs) depicting film stars like Nargis or Madhubala using Lux soap every day. The same tradition is continuing, except that the range of products promoted by film stars and sports personalities has widened enormously. Even some state governments are employing such personalities as brand ambassadors for the purpose of attracting tourists or investments.Why do companies pay enormous sums to hire the services of such celebrities to promote their brands? There are two possible reasons. One, the face of a celebrity attracts the viewers attention immediately to the ad and the product stays in the mind of the viewer through association.Second, the fact that a company can afford to pay the huge sum to the celebrity implies that the product must be a good one bringing a lot of revenue. That helps establish the quality of the product in the minds of prospective buyers.Should celebrities be held accountable for the quality of the product or the service being advertised by them? True, it is not possible for an outsider to know fully about the quality (including any fraudulent claims made by the company).Product qualityYet, the celebrities  because of their celebrity status being used to sell the product or service to unsuspecting people  should exercise due diligence before endorsing. Since they are earning huge money, at least they should be made to pay some monetary penalty if they are found endorsing a product making false claims. That would make them more circumspect.Do companies have to spend on ads to survive? In theory, if the products being sold by different firms are identical in quality and consumers also think so, then it does not pay for any firm to spend on ads. Since the identical products would sell at the same price, the extra cost incurred on ads cannot be recovered.That is why we dont see ads for potatoes or tomatoes but find ads for different brands of potato chips and tomato ketchups (as these are not considered identical by consumers). At the other extreme, a monopolist  because he gets 100% market share by definition  cannot gain by spending on ads except when the ad helps expand the total market of the product by making more consumers aware of the product or an improved variety of the product or by enhancing the image of the company by advertising its CSR activities.Is so much spending on ad socially justified? Here a distinction needs to be made between ads to disseminate information and ads to take away sales from the competitors. The first type provides some useful service to the society. The second does not add any net social benefit. One firms gain is cancelled by another firms loss.While ads at tax payers expense aimed at changing social attitudes like open defecation, child marriage, demanding dowry etc are justified, wastage of national resources occurs when politicians use page-long ads to promote themselves under the pretext of informing the public about the laying of foundation stone for a project.If providing information is the objective, a simple press note in the media or a smaller ad without the names and photos of the numerous ministers and politicians should do.(The writer is former Professor of Economics, IIM-Calcutta)"
592874f57be9e013b183fd7f,Small lives made smaller,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2017/jan/05/small-lives-made-smaller-1556239.html,2017-01-05,"It was on the bus to Mancherial that I remembered the bottles of anardana I had forgotten to pack. Adilabad had been chilly and I subsisted on a plate of two idlis and several packets of potato chips. There was no direct bus to Peddapalli, one of the new districts carved out by the TRS government. So I took the bus to Mancherial and was glad to be ushered to the ladies seat. I had the window seat and the sun was out. But by the time I reached my destination, I had a headache, leaving me longing for anardana.From the bus terminus, I rushed to the railway station to catch the Kagaznagar Express. On the way, I spotted a Patanjali store and I thanked the stars and Baba Ramdev. As I paid for a box of Amla Pachak, I asked the woman minding the store if the past year had been good to her. It has been nothing less than perfect, said Anasuya, her optimism surprising me. She commutes 20 km to the store every day but the job kept her happy. I am single. No dependents and nothing to worry about. The note ban didnt affect me, she said, laughing.How so? I dont need a lot of money. I can live on Rs 2,000 a month. Big families are the ones suffering, she explained.Still mulling over this new surprising angle to demonetisation, I stopped at the Women Police Station to eat my Amla Pachak. My headache had eased but now I was hungry. I espied an old woman roasting corn on the cob on the street outside and sensed an opportunity to have a conversation while I sated my hunger. I picked a cob and asked her to a rub a lot of lime and salt on it. As she took my tenner, I asked how business has been. The reply was a staccato burst of fire, taking down the entire political economy of Telangana: My husband died six years ago and I havent received a single benefit from the government. I live with my son who has his own life. What Telangana? Curse Telangana. Nothing has happened since it came. Theres nothing for us. Not a house, not any money. Is this the way to look after old people like me?And she declared: Write this! Ill never vote for Modi or KCR again.Unlike the luscious American corn invading Hyderabad, this cob was of the native variety, hard to chew even for someone whos used to opening beer bottles with her teeth. The headache threatened to come back and so I licked the salt and lime and threw the cob away.The 30-minute journey to Peddapalli on the 12758 Up Kagaznagar Express was remarkable only for my encounter at last with the formidable mother-in-law passenger who insisted on keeping her bag on my seat rather than let me sit in it. The Peddapalli railway station was rather more interesting: it had more monkeys, looking diseased, than people. Wary of simian interest in my hair or my bag, I tiptoed out and asked the first auto driver I saw to drop me at the bus stop. Its only 1 km away. You can walk, said the kind man. He reminded me of the autowallahs back home. I smiled and asked him to drop me anyway.Mirza Ghouse Baig didnt think the new district would change his fortunes. He had stopped believing false promises anyway. When the state was formed, the local MLA promised a number of things. He said they would construct houses for those who had land. Nothing has happened till today. It has only become worse with the note ban, said the 32-year-old with two children and a wife to take care of.He used to make about Rs 300 per day driving the auto but the note ban has brought his earnings down.

He disrespected the party that gave him so much respect that they twice made him the Member of Parliament.Watch: Punjab Polls: Navjot Singh Sidhu Will Campaign For Congress, Says Captain Amarinder SinghNot only did he not bother attending the parliament, he does not have even one thing to his name that he did for the people of his constituency, she added.Kaur, who is the Member of Parliament from Bhatinda, also taunted Sidhu for his disloyalty towards the BJP.I think his loyalty is highlighted by the fact that he could neither be loyal to the party that made him the Member of Parliament, nor to the pradhaan or his Godfather who brought him to politics. A person, who cannot be loyal to his own and goes shopping for a post to see who can give him the biggest discount or the highest position, cannot be trusted, she said.Harsimrat added, One day, he is joining the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and when he is not declared as the CM candidate, he drops it like a hot potato and goes shopping to the next party. And now, 20 days before the elections he has arrived like this.Disregarding his intention to serve the people, the Union Minister said that Sidhu doesnt seem to be eager enough to serve the people.When he was made the Member of Parliament, he had his government at the Centre. He had his government at the state. It was a golden opportunity for him to serve the people. But I dont think his intention was ever to serve them, which is why he ran away when the opportunity arose, she said.Earlier in the day, the former BJP leader officially joined the Congress in the presence of party vice-president Rahul Gandhi. This political development came months after Sidhus wife Navjot Kaur joined the grand old party.The Congress is planning to field Sidhu against the Badals in the upcoming polls.Sidhu may either be fielded from Lambi, where Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal is the Shiromani Akali Akali (SAD) candidate or from Jalalabad against Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.Punjab goes to polls on February 4.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Manju told reporters here on Wednesday that MLA H S Prakash is unnecessarily confusing people.He is a member of Hassan Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and is aware that even if farmers go to court, it will not help them. The aspirants would be allotted sites through draw of lots at Kalabhavan at 11 am on Thursday. Besides, the farmers who have lost their lands for the Outer Ring Road will be soon compensated as per the law, he said.The minister said that suitable action would be taken against Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) officials and traders if complaints are lodged and the allegations proved that they are indeed cheating farmers. Manju said that potato is the commercial crop of the district and around 2,771 farmers who had enrolled would receive certified seed potatoes.Taking a dig at MLA H D Revanna, Manju said that the previous governments had distributed potatoes used for cooking to farmers. As certified seeds are being distributed now, they are levelling allegations because they are unable to tolerate it. The APMC president and the traders are supporters of JD(S). Is it not possible for Revanna to rectify the problem by speaking to them, he questioned.Those who get certified seeds will be given 50% discount on pesticides and crop insurance facilities. The farmers should get receipts for the seeds they procure. The administration is ready to supply the required amount of seed potatoes but farmers should enrol in advance, he said.Stadium neededManju said that the district does not need an airport or golf course but needs a stadium of international standards. The stadium would encourage sportspersons and also increase the value of the land which will help in the overall development of the district, he said.Vacant posts to be filledThe government will fill the vacant teachers posts in the district soon, he said. He lamented that the overall percentage in the SSLC results had slumped as compared to the previous years. The schools should hold monthly meetings to discuss the preparations with teachers, he suggested."

Jasbir Malhi INLD MLA Parminder Dhull protests against the state government for low potato prices, outside Haryana Vidhan Sabha in Chandigarh Wednesday. Jasbir MalhiINDIAN NATIONAL Lok Dal MLA Parminder Singh Dhull on Wednesday brought 200 kg potatoes for symbolic sale in the Haryana Assembly complex to show the pitiable condition of potato growers in the state because of a very low price of the crop. He sold the potatoes at the rate of Rs 1 per kilo, alleging that the government has failed to protect the interests of farmers.Watch what else is making news:The employees and others standing in the Assembly complex bought the potatoes from Dhull. The farmers have been forced to sell the potatoes at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg in bulk. Many farmers in Ambala and Sirsa were forced to throw their potatoes on the roads in Ambala and Sirsa because they have to pay carriage charges to take them to the markets in neighbouring towns, Dhull told The Indian Express. Dhull, who brought four bags of potatoes in his Innova, installed a temporary sale counter in the Assembly complex. Here, he was joined by leader of the opposition, Abhay Singh Chautala.The Haryana government should learn from the Assam government which buys potatoes at the rate Rs 5 per kg from farmers offering them minimum support price (MSP) for the vegetables. I fail to understand why the BJP state government doesnt introduce MSP concept for vegetables and fruits to help farmers, added Dhull, a two-time MLA from Jullana constituency of Jind district. According to Dhull, the potatoes are grown in Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Sirsa districts. Chautala said they would support the farmers, who have planned to agitate, demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Commission Report to ensure profitable rates of their crops.Later, the INLD MLAs also staged a brief walkout from the Assembly after expressing dissatisfaction over assurances of Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar over the issue. Dhankar said the state government sends the recommendations to the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Prices (CACP) for fixing the MSP of crops on the basis of expenditure incurred on the crop in the interest of farmers.Thereafter, CACP submits the recommendations to the Government of India, which after a detailed discussion with the representatives of states, announces MSP. When the market price of pulses and oil seeds is lower than the MSP, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) procures the crop on MSP through HAFED. Likewise, if the market price of cotton is lower than the MSP, it is purchased by the Indian Cotton Corporation at MSP, said Dhankar.He further said that as the market price of black gram and barley is more than the MSP, there is no need for intervention by the government. In addition, according to Dhankar, the state government provides subsidy to the farmers through implementation of schemes sponsored by the Centre and states. Subsidies are provided on seeds, equipments, fertilisers and pesticides, he added. Dhankar said Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is being implemented in order to compensate the farmers for losses on their crops due to natural calamities.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59294a157be9e0138af8dc77,Ludhiana: Watermelon growers hit hard by high seed prices,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/ludhiana-watermelon-growers-hit-hard-by-high-seed-prices-4562856/,2017-03-09,"Watermelon growers, Punjab Watermelon growers, watermelon seed price, Watermelon growers hit hard, Punjab watermelons, indian express news Watermelon growers, Punjab Watermelon growers, watermelon seed price, Watermelon growers hit hard, Punjab watermelons, indian express newsALREADY FACING a potato glut, farmers in Punjab have been hit further by skyrocketing prices of hybrid seeds of watermelons and muskmelons. Before the onset of the paddy season, farmers in some pockets of Punjab prefer growing watermelon and muskmelon from March to May. With the state-owned Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) not producing any hybrid seeds of watermelons, the farmers are solely dependent on private companies, which are selling seeds ranging from Rs 20,000 per kg to Rs 70,000 per kg depending on the variety. Even the seeds of PAUs non-hybrid watermelon variety, Sugar Baby, are not available for sale at its seed shop on the university campus. When The Indian Express visited the PAU seed shop to buy the watermelon seed, the staff deployed at the shop said, Seeds are currently unavailable, although the sowing season has already begun.What else is making news:The state agriculture department has no control over the seed prices of private companies, which enjoy monopoly in hybrid seed sale. Speaking to The Indian Express, Maheshinder Singh, a potato farmer who has started cultivation of watermelon this season after suffering losses in potato crop, said, I have purchased the hybrid watermelon seed for Rs 50,000/kg manufactured by a Bengaluru-based company. The government is not taking any step to check how private companies are looting farmers in selling hybrid seeds. After potato glut, I decided to sow watermelon before paddy to tide over the potato loss to some extent but even melon seeds are so expensive.Watermelon is mostly grown in the Doaba belt of the state with Kapurthala, Nakodar, Shahkot, Jalandhar pockets being dotted with most of the farms. Some pockets are also there in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and villages near Sutlej banks. With warm weather required for watermelon cultivation coming early in southern parts of the country, the fruit from Karnataka and other southern states also enter the markets of Punjab before farmers here can harvest.Watermelons from Bengaluru and Chennai are already available at shops in Punjab. In fact, they are available round the year now. So, farmers in Punjab are losing interest in watermelons. Seeds are too expensive and then, at mandis, non-hybrid varieties fetch Rs 5 per kg or even less only in peak summers, said Gurpreet Singh, another farmer from Amloh. The hybrid varieties still fetch Rs 50-15/kg for farmers at mandis, Rs 15 being the closing rate at the end of the season. Dilbag Singh, senior scientist, PAU vegetable department, said, PAU is working to develop hybrid variety seeds but it will still take a few years for seeds to reach farmers. Our non-hybrid variety Sugar Baby seeds cost Rs 300-400 per kg only. Since private companies have monopoly on hybrid as of now, their prices are skyrocketing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5929cea77be9e0138af8ed15,Cropping patterns: Diversification dilemma on the ground,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cropping-patterns-diversification-dilemma-on-the-ground-farmers-punjab-agriculture-4550138/,2017-03-01,"Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba Agnihotri Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba AgnihotriCrop diversification and moving away from the entrenched paddy-wheat cycle has been the buzzword among Punjabs policymakers for at least two decades now. It will remain so even when the next government takes over in a couple of weeks time. But on the ground, farmers are still planting paddy during kharif and wheat in the rabi season as before. Some have gone in for diversification, but not the way policymakers, both in the state government and the Centre, would want them to. Theres no better example of this diversification dilemma than spring season maize; and it should be an eye-opener for future policymaking.Spring maize is currently being grown in about 30,000 hectares of Punjab, especially in the Doaba region covering Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts that also constitutes the states potato belt. It is planted from mid-February to mid-March, just after harvesting of potato. Spring maizes popularity is precisely because it fits well into the potato cycle. A 95-110 day crop, it is harvested by June, well in time for planting of basmati/non-basmati paddy or even kharif maize. The latter crops are harvested in October, which is also potato planting time.The above cropping cycle, however, is not viewed favourably by the authorities, who feel it doesnt address the more fundamental problem of depleting water tables in the state. The Punjab government wants farmers to grow maize only in the kharif reason to replace water-guzzling paddy. We arent keen to promote spring season maize, as it also consumes too much water, says Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director of the state agriculture department.A senior scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, too, seconds this view: Temperatures start rising after March and hit 35-45 degrees Celsius level by May-June alongside sunshine duration of 9-9.5 hours. This necessitates frequent watering of the standing maize crop. As an alternative, the government is encouraging farmers to grow spring/summer moong (green gram), mah/urad (black gram), sunflower, vegetables (cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, gourds, beans, etc) and green fodder  which can all be planted in February.But there are no takers for this logic amongst farmers. Why should we grow maize during the kharif season when its yields are not even 25 quintals per acre? We get 36-39 quintals or more from spring maize hybrids. And with rates of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal, the returns are more than even from wheat, taking 24-25 quintal/acre yield, minimum support price of Rs 1,625/quintal and 145-day crop duration, points out Jagat Prakash Gill, secretary of the Potato Seed Growers Association who cultivates spring maize of 70 out of his 100 acres land at Thammanwal village in Jalandhars Phillaur tehsil.We prefer spring maize since it is high-yielding, has shorter duration and there is good demand in the market from poultry and animal feed makers. If the government wants us to grow kharif maize, why are PAU and others not developing hybrids that yield close to what we get from the spring-planted crop? Alternatively, why dont they breed spring maize hybrids requiring less water? asks Gurraj Singh. This farmer, who cultivates spring maize on 20 out of his 25-acre holding in Jugral village of Jalandhar tehsil, also points to the Indian Institute of Maize Research, which is being shifted from Delhi to Ladhowal, not far from Phillaur: What are the people there doing to help us?This disconnect between policymakers objectives and farmers preferences has meant that the market for spring maize hybrid seeds is today controlled by private firms. The most popular hybrids in Punjab include DKC 9108 and 9120 of Monsanto and Dupont-Pioneers P1844, P1855 and 31Y45. The biggest grouse of farmers has to do with their prices, which are totally unregulated. Till a couple of years ago, these branded seeds were being sold to farmers at Rs 150-200 per kg. This season, their rates were in the Rs 525-550 per kg range. At 8 kg seeds per acre, it translates into a cost of Rs 4,200-4,400.The distributors/dealers of the seed companies promised us a rate of Rs 1,300-1,400 per bag of 4 kg in early-January. But when sowing began, we ended up paying Rs 2,100-2,200, which was above even the maximum retail price mentioned in the bags. After much hue and cry, they reduced the rates to Rs 1,600-1,700. But by then, much of the seeds had already been sold, complains Arvinder Singh, a 50-acre farmer from Sofi Pind village of Jalandhar who grows spring maize on 40 acres. He further alleges that the dealers did not even provide bills or invoices against their sales.When asked about these seemingly anti-competitive pricing practices, the spokesperson of one of the multinational firms told The Indian Express that we made the seeds available to the dealers at Rs 1,525-1,550 per bag and there was no shortage of material supplied from our end. He, however, admitted that we have no control on our distributors. Equally interesting is the response of the government, which has chosen to be a mute spectator, conveniently citing that it is committed to regulate prices and supply of only kharif season maize seeds. Its another matter that farmers arent interested in growing kharif maize. As a result, they are left with no choice but to deal with private sector monopolies and unscrupulous dealers who have exploited the demand for seeds to jack up prices. The government wants us to grow pulses and sunflower. But we have seen the way moong prices have collapsed within the last one year. For maize, there is at least a market and no lack of buyers, notes Jagat Prakash Gill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
