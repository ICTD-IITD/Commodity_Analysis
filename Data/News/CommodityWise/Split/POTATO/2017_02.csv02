Compost Santhe , the weekly fair held by the BBMP in collaboration with civil society activists and environmentalists, is emerging as the cornerstone of the civic body's efforts to promote segregation at source and organic/eco-friendly waste-disposal solutions.The santhe held at Sri Ram Mandir Grounds, Rajajinagar, on Sunday was marked by a unique display of daily-use commodities made from recycled goods. The products made by artisans from across Karnataka covered a wide range -- pencils made of recycled newspapers, cutlery made of sugarcane waste and kitchen bags made of potato starch.Another initiative, 'Plant the paper', promoted the need for planting trees using handmade paper, with seeds embedded in it, which, on disposal, would sprout plants. The seeds included those of flowering plants, methi and dhaniya.Among the other attractions at the event were solar and terracota waste-composting units, and a large variety of handmade bags, envelopes and reusable sanitary napkins.By Samiha Nasir Ahmed & Aieman Zoha"

Sometimes we are told that they don't have any place to keep the potatoes. Other times, they tell us that the potatoes are not the shape, size and colour that is required,"" said Inderpal Singh, a farmer from Batipura who has brought 120 quintals of potatoes to the procurement centre and is being turned away each time over the past six days.This is despite the fact that on his recent visit to Meerut, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had raised this point during his public address and categorically mentioned that he had directed the procurement agency to buy all potatoes irrespective of shape and size.Trying to clear the confusion among farmers, potato and vegetable development officer in Meerut Vineet Kumar said the order to purchase potatoes was only till May 7 and since then no fresh order has been issued. ""The order to buy potatoes was only till May 7. Now, there has been no further order.

""When the government announced the procurement policy, I brought all my potatoes out from the cold storage. I thought finally I will be able to get some money for these potatoes. But now the government is not buying these potatoes and they are not even in a cold storage.

(REUTERS Photo)US President Donald Trump has thanked his defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton for attending his inauguration saying he was honoured by their presence, and urged the attendees to give them a standing ovation. At a Congressional luncheon held in his honour at the US Capitol soon after his inauguration, Trump said he was honoured by their presence.Ill tell you, there is something that I wanted to say because I was very honoured, very, very honoured when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton were coming today and I think its appropriate to say and Id like you to stand up, Trump said.In fact when Trump entered the room, he went out of his way to walk across the room to shake hands with Hillary, and said to her loudly, Thank you for being here. Clinton was among the more popular guests as people lined up to talk with her and in some cases get photos.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAnd honestly, theres nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people, Trump said.So thank you for being here and were going to have four great years hopefully of peace and prosperity and well be working very, very hard, he added.The 69-year-old former senator and secretary of state was defeated by Trump in November 8 elections.Earlier during the luncheon, 70-year-old Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were presented with gifts from the Congress.For the 8th consecutive Inauguration, Lenox Corporation created the official Inaugural gifts from the American people, given to the new President and Vice President of the US.Trump and Vice President Michael Pence were presented with custom-made, one-of-a-kind engraved crystal vases. The Presidential crystal bowl shows an image of the White House on one side overlooking the Jefferson Memorial on the opposite side. The Vice Presidential crystal bowl depicts the US Capitol building overlooking the Lincoln Memorial on the other side.Each bowl has a compass rose cut into the base with the points of the compass aligned correctly with the buildings etched into the crystal. The bowls are made of lead crystal and are 12 inches across, and will be placed on top of black cherry wood bases that bear an inscription of the date and occasion engraved into silver plaques. Presenting the gift to the First Lady, Senator Roy Blunt said the glass for it came from Slovenia.The other unique thing for the first lady and her parents that would never have been such an important thing before; the glass came from Slovenia, he said amidst applause.Blunt is Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.The designer thought that the blest glass in the world for this particular design, which he began to work on last summer was glass from Slovenia, maybe he knew something that none of us quite knew for sure at that time, he said amidst laughter.In his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the new President has surmounted formidable challenge getting to this moment.He has been underestimated often. But he never let it stop him from succeeding, he said.We are wishing him similar success as he turns to the charge of governing. We face many challenges, but weve been challenged before and emerged stronger. We live in changing times, yes, but some things endure and we celebrate one of them today, McConnell said.This inauguration is a reminder of our common story as Americans, and on this most uniquely American of occasions, I ask you to stand and join me in raising a glass. Mr President, may you find every success in the years ahead, may you unite our country behind a common vision, he said.We come to this sacred inauguration day united and respect for our Democracy and determined to make a difference in the lives of hardworking Americans, said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader in the US House of Representatives.She presented one of the flags that flew above the Capitol today to Pence.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump listens as British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared chummy as they faced a curious world together for the first time Friday, pledging allegiance to the special relationship between their countries while trying to mask stark differences on some major issues. It was Trumps first White House meeting with a foreign head of state, a hastily arranged confab held precisely one week after the businessman and reality TV star, who remains a largely unknown figure to European audiences, was sworn into office as president.Trump sought to charm May from the outset, showing her the bust of Prime Minister Winston Churchill that hes using to decorate the Oval Office. He then opened a joint news conference by noting that his late mother was born in Stornoway, which is serious Scotland. Scotland is part of Great Britain. Trump and May were seen briefly holding hands as they walked along the White House colonnade after leaving the Oval Office. Their talks continued in the State Dining Room over lunch of iceberg wedge salad, braised beef short ribs with potato puree and salted caramel crme brulee.For her part, May congratulated Trump on his stunning election victory, and announced that he had accepted the queens invitation for a state visit with his wife, first lady Melania Trump, later this year. But the attempts at mutual flattery didnt completely mask the leaders differences over some issues, including NATO and Russia.May tried to push Trump toward positions she supports, noting that he had assured her he was 100 percent behind NATO, a world body he has dismissed as obsolete. Trump did not contradict May as they stood together and answered journalists questions in the White House East Room. May also took a tougher stance on sanctions against Russia.When asked how close the U.S. is to lifting penalties that were imposed on Russia after its incursion into Ukraine, Trump said it was very early to be talking about that. May said sanctions should remain until a 2015 cease-fire agreement for Ukraine is fully implemented.Trump has been less critical of Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, than his predecessor and some lawmakers, including fellow Republicans. He has cast doubt on findings by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the presidential election to help him win the White House, and has praised Putins leadership. Trumps stance has fueled speculation that he could ease or remove the sanctions against Russia.Trump also reiterated his belief that torture works. Britain takes a vocal stand against it. The appearance alongside May was more amiable than Trumps most recent public appearance with a foreign leader: a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto last August. Trump was more staid and serious then, and read from lengthy prepared remarks.Coincidentally, Trump and May met a day after Pena Nieto canceled his own trip to Washington next week amid disagreement with Trump over which of their countries will pay for the wall Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump says Mexico will pay; Mexico says it wont. Trump is somewhat of a mystery to world leaders, many of whom expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election. They also dont know his administrations main interlocutors with foreign governments, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior adviser Steve Bannon, a conservative media executive.So May was on a bit of a scouting mission. She has strong reasons for wanting the relationship to work. Britain is set to leave the European Union and its 500 million-person single market, and is eager for a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. The United States is Britains biggest export market, and such a trade deal would be a major prize.Trump has drawn parallels between Britains choice to leave the EU and his own success, using the Brexit vote last June to bolster his derision of the 28-nation bloc and his preference for striking bilateral agreements. Often combative in the presence of journalists, Trump seemed relaxed and humorous alongside May. At one point, after a British journalist asked whether people should be alarmed by his past statements, Trump joked: This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.He backed Mays determination to make Britain strong and prosperous once it leaves the European Union, saying he thought Brexit would be a tremendous asset and not a tremendous liability. And when asked whether the two very different leaders had found common ground, Trump said they had. I think were going to get along very well, he said. I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

But farmers alone cannot do anything as government support is required post-demonetisation, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary JS Sangha.Small farmers said they cannot even afford to keep potatoes in cold storage which costs more than the price of the crop.At mandis, we are forced to sell potatoes for Rs 3 per kilo while in the retail market, it is Rs 9-10 per kg, said Jagtar Singh, another farmer, from Jandhusinga village.Sangha said keeping potatoes in cold stores is a burden on big farmers, too, as the rate of the crop is less than the cost of keeping it in cold stores.Demonetisation was announced during the sowing season and several traders left without buying the seed which is the best in the country, said Sangha, adding, A large amount of our potato seeds went to waste as buyers from other states had no money.There is a huge demand for potatoes in Russia and Middle-East but farmers alone cannot do anything, said JPGA president Raghbir Singh.We have exported potatoes at Rs 900-1,000 per ql to Russia a couple of years ago on our own. Now, if the government helps us to sell potatoes in Russia and Middle-East, then government and potato growers can earn four times more than at present, said Sangha. By sea, it takes three-four weeks to send potatoes to Russia and the government should arrange for export via Pakistan as it will reach there much early, but no heed is being paid to that, he added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The admiration for the elephant would become manifold if it happens to be a mother with her calf, the baby elephant enjoying freedom to move within the reach of the superintending mothers long trunk.And so it happened that my daughter and son were looking with wide open eyes at the mother-kid duo in theforecourt of the Kamakshi temple in Kanchipuram. Can we give these bananas to the young elephant? my plucky daughter asked the wiry minder, taking a bold step towards the pachyderm. Alarmed, my son, the younger one, took a few steps backwards and clung to his mother.The mahout was emphatic. No, no bananas or coconuts for the junior. He has a digestion issue. My daughter was puzzled. What do you mean, no bananas and coconuts? Arent they the favourite snacks of elephants? What can we give instead? Pop corn? Potato chips? Roasted peanuts? Or candies?I thought I saw a twinkle in the eyes of the mother jumbo. Since she would not be able to ask what she wanted for the son, the mahout said with a broad grin, Both like biscuits. Yes, you wont believe, biscuits. That too, Marie. And nothing else.We quickly went out of the temple and bought from the shop outside two big packets of Marie. My daughter gave both the packets to the mahout. He opened one and strewed the circular biscuits near the baby elephants forelegs. Without any ado, or a formal nod of thanks, the frisky calf began to make short work of the biscuits, swishing her little tail in happiness. The mother elephant seemed to apologise, Pardon him, folks. He is too young to know he should say thanks.Before long, the mother put her foot down and stopped her kid from eating any more. But the growing young one would not listen, having an elephantine craving for snacks. The mother nudged him away firmly from the biscuit heap. And let out a curt monosyllabic command that made the calf perceive its mothers ire on its disobedience.Though the big one also adores biscuits, she will not touch them when her kid is nearby fearing she will set a bad example, the mahout said and added. Mothers will be mothers, whether bipeds or quadrupeds. My daughter nodded and asked. What about a drink to wash down the biscuits? I bet they would not prefer water but maybe a Pepsi or a Coke? The mahout grinned broadly and said, Neither. They guzzle Mirinda. You are welcome to get it from the same shop. But not ice cold, please."

For this to be true, our dishes need to be prepared using hand-ground masalas and mud pot.I began cooking when I was seven. I used to help my mother with cooking and that's when I decided to take this as my profession. It was hard to accept when people addressed me as cook while I wanted to be called 'chef'. I had to earn the title. So, I spent 20 years to carve my identity.Now, I hold three Guinness World Records, one for the longest cooking marathon by an individual. I cooked 617 dishes weighing 190 kg in 24 hours 30 minutes and 12 seconds, using 486 kg of raw material. The other one was for making a 48.2 ft dosa with the help of 22 dosa masters. We sold that dosa for `10 lakh via auction and we donated the amount to orphanages.I set another record by cooking 15.4 tonnes of curry which fed 1.4 lakh people. Now, I plan on making 275 kg of idlis that can feed around 7,000 people. I am working on this and should be doing this by August.I love to experiment. I like to cook different varieties of food such as bitter guard soup, chilly halwa, potato jamun, sepa kelangu sweet and so on. South Indian, Chinese, tandoori, continental, Japanese, German and Italian cuisines are my forte. You can experiment a lot in Italian and continental dishes.The first dish that brought me fame was Andhra Kodi Vepudu in 2006. I have written 2,925 recipes in 26 books (since 2004), cooked 3,250 recipes on TV shows and have 4,000 recipes in my heart that are yet to be showcased or published for the audience.My favourite is South Indian Karaikudi cuisine, in which I love yera pazhamolaga varuval (prawn and red chilly fry). I believe that people in rural India have the patience to cook using vegetables from their own gardens. Hand-ground masalas and mud pots play a major role in their health.My favourite snack is my own creation  fried cauliflower sauted with honey and sesame seeds.I have travelled to a lot of countries and also to a lot of villages in India. I grasp rural South Indian recipes better because of its traditional and medicinal value. I do not have any special secret to cooking but I believe cooking is a soulful art.

Vada pav, the most popular street food of Mumbai, is also equally famous in the financial capital of India. The popularity of the poor mans burger is slowly catching up. No wonder, vada pav is growing in demand and popularity as the foodstuff will turn 50 this year! Interestingly, it has crossed the shores and slowly making waves in the US and the UK.The liking for vada pav actually cuts across class and generations as it is savoured by common man to celebrities. And the story of Mumbai is incomplete without vada pav, its signature dish. Celebrities have endorsed vada pav as their best fast food. Seeing a vada pav being made is one of the finest aromatic experience. Vada Pav is fresh, available 24x7 and a fast-moving food item.Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar's love for vada pav has been well documented and he had narrated how he used to eat it at Shivaji Park-Dadar, where he got the lessons of cricketing. I and my son (Arjun) love to eat vada pav at Shivaji Park Gymkhana and there is nothing that can beat this snack, laced with chutney, he once said, talking about one of his favourite snacks.In fact, on August 23 every year, the Vada Pav Day is celebrated. Most of the well-known travel and cuisine writers have covered widely about vada pav.It's not very clear as to who and when vada pav was first sold. But most believe that it was sold first in public somewhere in the mill heartland of Mumbai in the mid-60s, catering to the workers of what was earlier known as Girangaon, where at one point of time there were over 100 textile mills. Subsequently it spread to other parts of Mumbai and soon became a hit.Another version is that it started at a small stall owned by Ashok Vaidya outside the platform No 1 of the Dadar station. My father started it around 1966-67 and slowly it evolved, said his son Narendra.Most of the cafes and restaurants serve vada pav in Mumbai and there are several stories and tales attached to vada pav and anecdotes of celebrities. Aaram, the iconic restaurant located at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, gives Aaram vada pav. A stall outside Dadars Kirti College, has been attracting customers and is popular among celebrities. This is very popular among the celebrities.Among office goers of the Fort-Flora Fountain area, one of the famous places, is the CTO vada pav located near the Central Telegraph Office. There are several stalls along the maidans of Mumbai-- Shivaji Park, Oval, Azad, Cross Maidan, among others and these are fast food for the players.One of popular vada pav stalls was the khidki vada pav in Kalyan in Thane district, which was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to sell vada pav from a window of their house facing the road. The Jai Maharashtra stall at Azad Nagar is another such place. Gajanan vada pav in Thane sticks to the traditional vada pav but what makes it different is their chutney.The vada pavs in inter-city trains like Deccan Queen (Mumbai-Pune), Flying Ranee (Mumbai-Surat) too have their own importance. Trains and food go hand in hand...and for trains arriving and departing from Mumbai it is about the taste of vada pav and how it changes from station to station, said foodie and independent journalist Ajit Joshi, one of the experts on Mumbai's business history. Vada pav in railway stations like Thane, Igatpuri, Karjat, Kasara, Khopoli and Virar are famous and people prefer it during their journeys as they go out of the city limits of Mumbai, added Joshi.The price ranges between Rs 10 and Rs 20 in street stalls and fast food joints.Vada pav has been part of the culture of this metropolis. People of Mumbai love it and it has now spread to most of the important cities of India, says veteran tourist guide Raj Suri, who also publishes tour guides and maps of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Nowhere across the world such a food item has been so popular,"" said Sanjeev Sabde, veteran culinary expert and food writer. The taste of vada pav also varies from stall to stall and shop to shop, restaurant to restaurant....the vada pav of Kirti College would be different from Aram vada pav, he said.If fact, there are aspects of social and political colour to it as well. The Shiv Sena used vada pav stalls and haath-gaadis (push carts)to promote itself, said Prakash Akolkar, who has penned Shiv Sena  Jai Maharashtra. When a factory or a mill laid-off workers, the Shiv Sena would help the jobless to set up vada pav stands outside the factory, he said.The party, of late, had been encouraging the Shiv vada pav stalls. However, some organisations have challenged the Sena taking advantage of food stuff in the Bombay High Court.The Marathi compound word batata vada means potato fritter. Pav which is a variant of Portuguese po is sweetened bread. As far as calories are concerned, it is close to ameal. A 200 gram vada pav would have 290 calories, 25 gram fat, 25 gram carbohydrates and 5 gram protein, said chef Hiralal Patel. The ingredients in a vada pav allows you to keep on working for hours, he said.There was a serious need for a filling, light, nutritious, easy-to-carry snack for the morchas of millworkers, shipping unions, Shiv Sena rallies, said Ashok Thakur of Kirti College vada pav.Today vada pav selling has become an organised business. Chains like Jumbo King and Goli Vada Pav are catering to not only Mumbaikars but also people in different parts of India. Vada pav is available in some places in the US and the UK. Now, there are samosa-pavs, bhajia-pavs, usal-pavs, misal-pavs, variants which are also equally popular, especially among youngsters."

Thousands of people took to various social networking sites to share stories of their attachment with pakhala, while many others shared pictures of feasts over the dish at their homes and outside. The dish was also among the top trending topics on micro-blogging site Twitter throughout the day with a number of well-known personalities talking about it. Popular television personality and chef Sanjeev Kapoor tweeted: ""I am sure if today I go to any house in Odisha (or an Odia living in any part of the world), I would get freshly made Pakhala."" Writer Ravinder Singh wrote on Twitter: ""Fermented rice to beat the heat. The haves would eat it with fried fish & veges. The have nots with onion & green-chillies."" Artist Sudarshan Patnaik created a sand art on the theme with a bowl of fermented rice in the middle and a number of popular side-dishes alongside. He posted a picture of his creation on Twitter that was shared by international chefs such as Vikas Khanna and Ranveer Brar and hundreds of people from around the world. Pakhala is an Odia term for cooked rice washed or fermented in water. Depending on the palette, a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian accompaniments are served with it to spice up the taste. It was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath in the Puri temple since it was built in the 12th century. The dish has a number of variations, including jeera pakhala, dahi pakhala, basi pakhala, sajja pakhala and chaiin pakhala. Rourkela resident Monalisa Routray added a twist to her pakhala. She said: ""Instead of rice, I tried rice-stuffed dumplings immersed in curd. As side dishes, I had potato patties and fried drumstick. My family members all appreciated my unique spin to the dish."" Odia film-maker Biswananth Rath, who lives in Chennai, said: ""The day is an attempt to preserve the tradition of this Odia cuisine. The Odia association here got together and had a hearty pakhala meal. We also invited a number of non-Odia people."" Akshaya Mohanty, who lives in Rhode Island, US, said: ""I have invited my non-Odia friends here so that they can get a taste of the popular dish."" Lately, a number of hotels and restaurants have included pakhala in their menus. A vegetarian pakhala meal is available at Rs 350 and a non-vegetarian one comes for a princely Rs 400. There are budget eateries as well, which are offering the dish at Rs 70. ""A dish that hydrates the body is advised as a remedy against sunstroke. We have pakhala at home almost daily during the summer. But today, my friends and I wanted to celebrate the occasion in a special manner,"" said Manisha Dash, who visited the Dalma restaurant here."

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.
