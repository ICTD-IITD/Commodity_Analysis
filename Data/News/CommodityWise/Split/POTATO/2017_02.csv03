One day I was experimenting by hollowing out the potato and filling it with spices and lemon juice, he says. It tasted nice and I started selling it along with our other items. We named it after kulhar, the earthen vessel we traditionally use to drink tea in. Our customers appreciated the new recipe. Later, I added boiled chickpeas. That made it more popular. To make the chaat colourful and tasty, I later also introduced pomegranate seeds into the filling.The eatery is named after Mr Kushwahas father but it was founded by his grandfather, Rati Ram, who had moved to Delhi many, many years ago from Najibabad, a town near the Himalayan foothills. The former farmer began his life in this city by selling fruit on the pavements of Chawri Bazar. Today, Mr Kushwaha, assisted by his two brothers, is carrying forward the legacy.Although the stall serves classics such as golgappas and paav bhaji, you need to focus only on these scooped eye-catchers  they stand out thanks to the juicy pomegranate seeds glistening like pink diamonds. As you pop a kuliya in your mouth, it explodes, leaving you reeling under a multitude of flavours. And then you pop in another one, and another."

It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later. Most of the onion growers do not have the financial capability to spend such a huge amount, official sources said."

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is likely to visit the spot on Wednesday. Curfew is clamped across the district.Angry farmers have said they will not cremate the five bodies unless chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited the district, and have called for a strike supported by the opposition Congress. Many farmers have blocked the Neemuch-Mahu highway with the body of one deceased farmer.Last night police caned farmers who gathered at the mortuary. However, they allowed the bodies to be taken away in the wee hours. But we continue to stick to our demand that until and unless the CM visits the district, the cremation will not take place, said Patidar Samaj, Neemuch president Mahesh Patidar.

They dumped onions on roads as prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss."

In a reply to a question in the Assembly on May 9 2016, the CM had informed that 11.09 lakh hectares were covered under assured irrigation in 2015-16 kharif season. This is only 18 per cent of the total agricultural land of the State, BJP MLA Pradip Purohit told reporters here.Though many farmers in the State committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden, the Government refused to accept the fact to cover up its failure. Nothing could be more unfortunate than to claim that farmers of Odisha do not commit suicide. This shows the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the BJD Government, Purohit said.What happened to the State Potato Mission after three years of its launching? the BJP legislator sought to know from the Government.As per the Mission target, the State was supposed to be self sufficient in potato production. With its annual requirement of about 12 lakh tonnes of potato, Odisha had produced 2.68 lakh tonnes last year. Purohit attributed the failure to lack of storage capacity in the State.Quoting a reply of Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout in the Assembly, Purohit said only five cold stores of the Cooperation Department are functional while 13 have remained defunct. The Government has failed to revive a single cold store during the last 17 years.Even as the State has achieved self sufficiency in onion production, the farmers are selling their produce at throw away price due to lack of institutional support from the Government, he rued.Similarly, the State is way behind the national average in egg and milk production, Purohit added."

Apart from the religious sentiments involved, the fact remains that such cattle are treated extremely cruelly during and of course after such sales. Those who feel that the government is interfering with their eating habits should keep in mind that this law does not prevent the sale of cattle to government registered slaughterhouses, where quality and other issues can be better monitored.However, the government should have considered the impact this will have not just on the export of beef, but also the leather industry, which earns around $6 billion in exports annually. Mounting protests from the leather industry is snowballing into a hot potato and the Centre may be forced to remove buffaloes from the ban-on-sale list. Since most of the cattle trade for slaughter takes place through markets, the new rules make it difficult for farmers to dispose off their aged cattle.Traders usually buy buffaloes from cattle markets and then transport them to slaughter houses. State governments including Kerala, Bengal and Karnataka have termed the order a violation of the spirit of federalism, and it appears the issue is headed to the courts, with the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday staying the notification.The other aspect is the increasing number of cow vigilantes running amok, even in states where cow slaughter is not an issue. The manner in which a group of self-appointed gau rakhshaks beat up two men of a New Delhi-based firm which was legally transporting milch cows at the Bhubaneswar Railway Station last week is just one example. While Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu insists that cow vigilantism is neither a policy of the government, nor the BJP, the state governments need to back that up by taking strict action against any such acts."

However, the Opposition has rejected the argument and accused the government of coming up with absurd theories to hide its failure to meet the requirements of the people and justify the shortage. BJP vice-president Pratap Sarangi said: ""It exposes the lack of sincerity of the state government. How many urban centres are there in Odisha? Mostly the people in rural areas depend on the potatoes, which is an essential vegetable for them. It is never interested to boost potato production and its marketing in the state."" Director horticulture Srikanta Prusty in a letter to the state government cited that the demand for potato has gone up due to change in food habits. ""Due to gradual change in food habit the demand for potato consumption is increasing especially in urban areas for snacks and fast food where potatoes play a significant role in way of value addition in the processing sector,"" said Prusty. Prusty said the state requires 12 lakh MT potatoes per annum to meet its need. ""As it is unable to produce the required potatoes, most of the state's shortfall is met by neighbouring states such as Bengal,"" he said. In 2016-17, potato was cultivated over an area of 25,218 hectares and the production was 3 lakh MT. ""At present, the state produces around 20-25 per cent of its requirement,"" he said. He said the potato mission was a success in the state. Before starting the potato mission, he said, there were 27 functional cold storages in the state with a storage capacity of 1.37 lakh MT. After completion of the mission, the number of cold storages has increased to 35 with a storage capacity of 1.68 lakh MT of potatoes. On the price regulation of potatoes, he said: ""The wholesale market price of potatoes depends on the all-India mandi prices and the real market price is fixed accordingly."" At present, the potato is currently being sold at Rs 12 per kg."

Picture by Animesh Sengupta N-Road in elite Bistupur is paradoxically Jamshedpur's dark underbelly, where hooch is sold and gambling is routine a stone's throw from the local police station. That this half-a-kilometre stretch is a den of illegal activities came to the fore after a 28-year-old bank intern was found murdered in an under-construction building along the road last week. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Ankush Thakurta, a native of Rourkela, Odisha, was killed over a drunken brawl with employees of a beer bar, which was open beyond designated hours. Also, the beer bar in question is allegedly an umbrella for several unauthorised hooch outlets in the vicinity, according to local vendors. ""People who come to buy vegetables here think N-Road is the safest stretch of Bistupur, with a thana within a kilometre and routine patrolling. Very few know what goes on here after sundown. Hookah bars mushroom to offer ganja (marijuana) and matka (organised gambling with links to cities like Calcutta, Mumbai and Nagpur) is run openly. Roadside eateries sell hooch; sometimes even foreign liquor at a premium. Licensed hotels help them for a cut,"" said a potato vendor, not willing to be named. Don't the police know? ""Of course, they do. It happens right under their nose. In fact, local fruit vendors had complained against gamblers and tipplers who create nuisance, but police do nothing,"" another vegetable seller on N-Road told this correspondent on the condition of anonymity. Sources said matka is played using special cards through a local agent who has links with the main operator in Mumbai or Calcutta. The minimum investment is Rs 100. There are two forms of the game - one that draws a profit of nine times and another promises a big bonanza of 100 times of the invested amount. Assistant excise commissioner, East Singhbhum, Manoj Kumar conceded that several eateries along a 200-metre stretch of N-Road served liquor despite not being authorised to do so. ""Following a tip-off, we had conducted raids in February. The owner of one such eatery, Shakti Hotel, was caught red-handed and sent to jail. It is difficult to say if the grey market for booze continues to boom on N-Road,"" Kumar said, but expressed his ignorance about ganja dens in the area. ""We shall, however, keep tabs and bust gangs involved in illegal activities."" DSP (crime control) Sudhir Kumar did not respond to calls. Bistupur thana OC Srineewash claimed they had stopped matka rounds on N-Road two months ago. ""It may have resumed. We will find out,"" he said. How can security of N-Road be beefed up?

And it is the Knights who have come to the rescue of cricket's paradise. The Kolkata Knight Riders have tied up with the South Asian Forum for Environment (SAFE) for a clean drive. Since the first IPL 10 match at Eden on April 13, SAFE has been overseeing the collection, segregation and separation of the 900-odd kg of waste that a typical IPL match at the stadium generates. The efforts have borne fruit but more needs to be done to ensure that the stadium remains spick and span and attains the waste management credentials of other renowned sports venues, several of which use state-of-the-art technologies to harvest rainwater and produce energy from waste. Metro takes stock at the Eden Gardens a day after the season's final match in the city. Clean-up From May 4, the day after the penultimate IPL 10 match at Eden, to today, a day after the last match between KKR and Mumbai - the change was evident. Below the galleries, where the food courts are situated, the difference was stark. On May 4, the entire area had been littered with leftover noodles and bits of pizza. Everything from luchi-alur dum to paper plates, aluminium foil containers and plastic packets lay strewn on the floor around the walkway. The entire place had been reeking of rotten food. In stark contrast, only the stray paper plate or water pouch could be spotted in the food court area today. The state of the stands, however, told a different story. Empty water pouches, potato wafer packets and cola glasses had been pushed under the chairs, just like on earlier occasions. Bin 'n' bag Before the season's last match between KKR and Mumbai yesterday, 60 new 150ml dustbins were placed across all blocks of Eden, in addition to the 50 existing ones. ""We have asked the vendors to request customers to dump waste in the dustbins,"" said Amrita Chatterjee, a part of the Eden waste management project named Trash to Cash. Yesterday's match also saw water pouches being handed out in bags made out of recycled cloth instead of plastic packets. Vendor Rahul Kumar Shaw had to shell out around Rs 32,000 to make the switch. Nearly half the amount was paid by KKR, he said. Result: no sign of plastics packets strewn across the stadium and beyond. Missing link Trash cans have to be placed somewhere near the seating area if spectators are to throw their food packets and glasses into them, agree all stakeholders, but the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) allegedly won't allow bins to be placed in the stands. ""You can't expect people to remember to pick up their paper plates and glasses at the end of the match, carry them to the food stalls and dump them,"" Kashi Mali, who was overseeing the cleaning of blocks B to F, said. A senior CAB official confirmed that SAFE had not been allowed to place trashcans in the galleries. ""What if someone hurls the bins at players?"" he asked. When reminded about the eight-feet-high perimeter wall around the stadium, he expressed fear that spectators could throw the bins down and hurt other spectators seated below. But can't the bins be chained to pillars? ""We don't want to take any risk,"" the official responded. In the face of resistance, SAFE and KKR are mulling hanging paper bags to substitute for trashcans from next year. The one area where Eden's cleanliness should improve is... Tell [email protected]"
593ba70f7be9e0066b6f5d0e,Bihar wish-list for Mr Jaitley,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170201/jsp/bihar/story_133304.jsp,2017-02-01,"What does Bihar expect for itself when Arun Jaitley rises to present the budget on Wednesday? Before every budget, there is hope in states that specific doles would be offered to them. But the Union budget is not for any particular state. Its for all the states. However, if funds are increased for departments, Bihar will also benefit, remarked former state finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi even as the current finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui expressed the hope that Bihar would be given major concessions. The Telegraph finds out what the wish-list of some key sectors is. ROADPromises and more promises but precious little has been done. The Centre has failed to fulfil the promises made to the state regarding the road sector despite repeated meetings. Union minister in charge of roads, Nitin Gadkari, had promised that Bihar would get Rs 50,000 crore for road projects, which did not take off. The state sent a proposal of upgrading 3,600km of roads to national highways; in response, the union ministry agreed to upgrade just 13 state highways covering a total of 910km. Promises made by the Centre to construct 53 road over bridges too have not been fulfilled. Several national highways are in need of urgent repair. All that the Centre has approved is a new link between Sahibganj bypass in Jharkhand to Manihari bypass in Bihar, including four-lane bridges over the Ganga, and Rs 1,742.01 crore for the rehabilitation of Patnas Gandhi Setu. Bihar road construction minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said: The promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on spending Rs 55000 crore on roads in Bihar are yet to be met. I hope that in this budget, the state gets the funds to repair the national highways and the amount he had promised. RAILWAYThe state expects funds for ongoing projects and betterment in passenger services. Money is required for ongoing projects which include an electric loco manufacturing unit at Madehpura, a wagon workshop at Garhara in Begusarai, a workshop at Jamalpur, and a rail bogie factory at Dalmianagar. ECR officials said a request for capacity augmentation has been sent to the railways for a coach maintenance workshop at Harnaut. Bihar Daily Passengers Association secretary Shoaib Quraishi said: The railways need to work on issues like safety of passengers, punctuality of trains, confirmed berths, improvement in on-board services and emphasis on the cleanliness inside trains and station premises. We are expecting that the railway will also work on improving the quality of food. HEALTHHealth experts are hoping that the total expenditure on the healthcare sector will increase. As per the last budget, the total expenditure for health was only 1.62 per cent of the whole budget out of which the National Health Mission had a share of less than one per cent. We are expecting an increase in the total expenditure on the healthcare sector this time. Increasing the budgetary allocation of the National Health Mission would give a boost to healthcare. The finance ministry should also focus on human resource. In 2015, the National Rural Health Mission had recommended formation of a special empowerment recruitment cell in states where there has been a delay in the recruitment of manpower in hospitals. There is a huge scarcity of doctors in state-run hospitals because the Bihar government had failed to fill vacancies in government hospitals, said Dr Ranjit Kumar, general secretary of Bihar Health Services Association. Sunil Kumar Singh, a member of the governing body of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, said the government should waive customs duty on high-end instruments that are being imported. This will ensure availability of high-end equipment in all hospitals. Besides, subsidies and incentives should be provided to the pharma industries for initiating research work. This will help in creation of new medicines of the same molecule and will ultimately bring down prices of medicines, said Singh. INDUSTRYThe focus of the government is on sectors like leather, textile, food processing to expedite industrial development and job creation. Industrialist Satyajit Singh said the finance minister should focus on increasing domestic consumption, public and private investment, exports and job creation. We feel the Union government should bring down corporate tax to a maximum 25 per cent from the current levels. The rebate on interest paid on housing loan should be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh, as it would boost the demand in the real estate sector and make a positive impact on fiscal sentiments. The GST peak rate should be limited to 20% and the focus should be on developing micro, small and medium enterprises, Singh said. AGRICULTUREAround 80% of Bihars population depends on agriculture and allied activities for a living, but the sector contributes only 25% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). Progressive farmer and chairman of the marketing wing of Nalanda Organic Vegetable Grower Federation, Rakesh Kumar, said it was time agriculture and horticulture were made profitable ventures, else people would be forced to leave farming. A minimum support price (MSP) should be declared for potato and onion to provide fiscal protection to farmers. Data show that the price of potato and onion has been almost static over the last 20 years, while cost of inputs like fertiliser and pesticide has multiplied several times. The Union budget should declare MSP for potato and onion and provision free electricity for farmers, Rakesh said. TOURISMBihar lacks basic infrastructure in attracting more tourists despite having the potential. Though the flow of tourists to Bihar has increased manifold but soon after their arrival, tourists start thinking about their return. It is due to the lack of proper communication linkage and infrastructure, said an official of the tourism department. Bihar is well known for its heritage sites like Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali, besides, historical sites linked with Jainism. But sadly these sites are just that  well known. We hope the budget provides some budgetary incentives to bring these tourist sites on a par with other popular tourist destinations of the country. Again, with certain other measures like converting Bodh Gaya into an international religious city with access without visa (based on passport of respective country) would go a long way in making it an international spiritual destination, the official said. There is still a shortage of budget hotel rooms. The government should make one, two, and three star hotels a priority, because hotel owners do not patronise building budget hotels as they think they wont make any money. The government should come forward and take initiative, the official said. REAL ESTATEThe realty sector has pinned high hopes on the budget with experts hoping to get industry status for housing sector. Sachin Chandra, honorary secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI)Bihar, said: The housing sector has not yet been given the status of industry because of which finance from banks is costlier right now. Once it gets the industry status, loans would become cheaper as well as it will be easily available giving a boost to the realty sector. Also, he added, the government should increase the interest limit on housing loan exemption from the current Rs 2 lakh to either Rs 2.5 lakh or Rs 3 lakh. CIVIL AVIATIONBihar hopes the budget will allocate funds for the modernisation of Patna airport, which has seen a surge in air traffic over the past few years. Passenger flow at the city airport increased from 14.5% in 2014-15 to 32.4% in 2015-16 necessitating the much needed expansion of the airport. We are expecting the budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore to be used for the first phase of expansion work to be carried out with regard to the construction of the terminal building along with other operational requirements, said Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria."

Elaborating on the project, he said it would come up across 130 acres and have primary processing centres, dry warehouse, sorting and grading facilities, multi-chamber cold storage, aseptic (sterile) packaging, potato cold storage, food testing lab, among others. He added that investors would get the cost of stamp duty on the purchase cost of land, power under agricultural tariffs, tax-free market for agricultural produce and capital subsidy corresponding to the amount of investment. ""We would like to request local entrepreneurs to invest in the food park and help develop the state,"" Pandey stressed, adding talks with well-known players in the food processing sector were on.

The total production is estimated at 295 million tonnes, 3.2% higher than in 2015-16.The estimate shows that 2016-17 will be the fifth straight year when India's horticulture production will outstrip that of foodgrains. The foodgrain production for 2016-17 is estimated at 273.38 million tonnes.The agriculture ministry released on Tuesday the second advance estimate for horticulture production, noting that even the area under horticulture crops had recorded an increase  from 245 lakh hectares in 2015-16 to 249 lakh hectares in 2016-17. The second advance estimate has, in fact, revised the production figure upward from the first, which had put the figure at 287 million tonnes in February. The higher production this year is attributed to a good monsoon in 2016.According to the ministry's estimate, based on information provided by states and Union territories, fruit production for 2016-17 is estimated at 93 million tonnes, 2.9% higher than the previous year, and vegetable yield at 175 million tonnes, 3.5% higher than the 2015-16 production.Most vegetables, including onions, potatoes and tomatoes, will record an increased production this year.

Officials at Nabanna pointed out that though cold stores in Bengal are owned by private agencies, their rent is fixed by the state government. The investors will be eligible for the subsidy only if the state withdraws the policy. ""The policy framed during the Left Front tenure is still continuing. It is posing a barrier for fresh investments in the cold store sector,"" an official said. The officials said the range of central subsidy for cold stores depended on the type of the structure and their store capacity. A Bengal government minister said it was not ready to reconsider the rent control policy as that would hurt the interest of small and marginal farmers. ""Store owners can demand any rent. Farmers may not be able to afford that,"" he said. A delegation of businessmen today met Cooch Behar district magistrate P. Ulganathan and demanded subsidy for those interested in setting up cold stores in the district. The businessmen pointed out that if more storage facilities came up in the district, farmers, particularly those facing losses from a bumper potato crop and lack of space to store the produce, would benefit. Officials said similar demands had been made earlier by the state-level body of cold store owners, but to no avail. ""Cold stores might not ideally be industrial units but such facilities largely help the agricultural and food processing sector. As of now, 10 to 12 investors here are ready to set up such stores but are feeling discouraged because of the lack of subsidy,"" said Rajendra Kumar Baid, the general secretary of the Cooch Behar District Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Sources in the agriculture department said more cold stores were needed in Cooch Behar, which has 12 such facilities with a total storage capacity of around 1.5 lakh tonnes. ""The district produces a little over 8 lakh tonnes of potato annually. Considering the production, Cooch Behar needs more cold stores,"" an official said. Businessmen in the district rued the lack of cold stores. ""Potato farmers who could not find space in the existing 12 cold stores have suffered losses. If 10 to 12 more cold stores come up, this problem can be resolved to a considerable extent. This will also create direct and indirect employment,"" a businessman said. The district magistrate said he would speak about the demand with the agriculture department.

An allocation of Rs 30,729 crore will be made by the state government for this purpose, said health minister Sidharth Nath Singh, announcing the decision. He told a news conference that Rs 5,630 crore worth of loans of seven lakh farmers in the state that had been categorised as NPA (non-performing assets) had also been waived. ""These loans had been taken from all banks,"" Singh said. Bankers are already grappling with bad loans worth over Rs 9.5 lakh crore on their books mainly because of loan defaults by several large corporate houses. The Uttar Pradesh government's decision, which fulfils an election promise of the BJP, has triggered fears of copycat demands from elsewhere in the country. In Maharashtra, the government is already under pressure to announce a complete farm loan waiver. Health minister Singh said there were 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers, out of a total of about 2.3 crore farmers in Uttar Pradesh. But sources said there were 86 lakh farmers with harvest loan dues of up to Rs 1 lakh. About 1.29 crore farmers would be disappointed by the first cabinet decision of the BJP government, the sources added. Former chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav tweeted that the state government had ditched poor farmers. ""The promise was to waive total loan, not up to a limit. Crores of farmers feel cheated because of the limit of Rs 1 lakh. The poor farmers have been betrayed,"" he wrote. But BJP chief Amit Shah tweeted: ""Congratulation to Yogi Adityanath and cabinet for historic decision of loan waiver of 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers...."" Singh said it was a coincidence that the first cabinet took nine decisions on the occasion of Ram Navami, celebrated today. The cabinet reaffirmed its March 19 decision of closing ""all illegal slaughterhouses"". ""So far we have closed only 26 illegal slaughterhouses. But it has been resolved that no illegal units would be allowed to continue. Those interested may renew their licence,"" the minister said. Buffalo and goat slaughterhouse owners had alleged that the government was forcing all of them to shut their units. Srikant Sharma, the power minister who jointly addressed the news conference with Singh, said the cabinet had also decided to continue with the anti-Romeo squad. ""It is doing a very good job. But some political parties are trying to malign it. Police officers have been warned that action will be taken against them if the squad demanded identity cards from couples sitting in parks and roaming anywhere else. The innocent would not be harassed and the guilty must not be spared,"" Sharma said. The cabinet also decided to buy 80 lakh MT of wheat at the minimum support price this year and formed a three-member committee under deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato growers could get better price for their produce. Maurya will head one more committee of three members to report within a week how to check illegal mining. A five-member panel under deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma will study how to attract industrial investment in the heartland state through a single-window system. The other cabinet decisions include a sports complex in Ghazipur and a proposal to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for forming and giving constitutional status to the National Commission for OBCs."

In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

His audience, a group of college students, listens closely.On the far side of the cafe, two women sit together picking at potato wedges and making awkward first-date small talk.Anywhere else, they would have looked incongruous, but at Chez Jerome  Q, said to be Delhis first LGBTQ cafe, no one blinks an eye. The so-called abnormal is normal here, and judgment is meant to be left at the door.Since Chez Jerome opened, its hosted speed dating events for straight and queer couples, ladies and trans mens nights, discussions about LGBTQ issues, and meetings with queer artistes.Waiters swish by, taking orders and placing empty glasses on a counter over which a large rainbow flag is draped. Behind the counter, on the door of the bathroom, the usual stick figure of a man or a woman has been replaced by a figure thats half-man, half-woman. It is labelled WE DONT CARE.The sun sets and all of a sudden theres music. The Qutub Minar glows in the night sky. The students break into dance. One of the young men is wearing a long embroidered purple skirt. A glittering rhinestone necklace peeks out from below the collar of another boys checked shirt. A huge neon green turban is perched precariously on the head of a young woman. They sway joyously, unselfconsciously to the beats of megahit Hindi pop song Kala Chashma.A man with a big tray of drinks and a bigger smile ambles towards the customers, takes their orders, and introduces himself. His name is Sambhav Dehlavi and he is owner, head chef and matre d all rolled into one. If you seem to want company, hell sit down with you, share a cigarette and tell you how he set up Chez Jerome last year to create a safe public space for the LGBTQ community.Are there not already places in Delhi where queer people can hold hands or dress the way they want? Theres difference between being tolerated and being welcomed, Dehlavi says, between feeling like an outsider and feeling at home.When you enter, you realise that youre free here, says 18-year-old Nitish Anand, who defines himself as gender-fluid and asexual. Your choices of being different are okay.Pulkit Sharma, a 19-year-old Delhi University student who identifies as queer, says the cafe serves as a safe haven and represents a giant leap for the city.Its an idea that took shape as Dehlavi backpacked across Europe a few years ago and worked as a chef to pay his way. Every city he visited boasted a vibrant queer culture with at least one public space for the community.In India, where sex between people of the same gender is outlawed and where queerness is normally shunned, Dehlavi feels the need for spaces such as Chez Jerome is even greater.He is quick to point out that exclusion is not his aim. I want this to be a safe space for women, too, Dehlavi says, for anyone who wants to be part of an inclusive culture.A version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes. (Facebook/ Chez Jerome - Q Caf)Even Dehlavis menu is a study in unconventionality. Its a free-wheeling assortment of foods from across Europe: Frances famous croque monsieur; a version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes; Greek omelettes with feta cheese, baby spinach leaves and chopped red onions; and a white Italian pizza with Dehlavis personal twist  a layer of potato chips and cream cheese.And theres more left off the menu that Dehlavi will whip up for you if you fall into conversation with him. Like its customers, Chez Jerome offers more than meets the eye."
593bab077be9e0066b6f6384,Old loyalties test note 'demon' anger,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170218/jsp/nation/story_136448.jsp,2017-02-18,"Workers at a potato farm in Kanpur Farrukhabad, Feb. 17: Sushil Kumar Dikshit says the demonetisation has wounded potato farmers like him but he and his fellow Brahmins would still vote for the BJP on Sunday. Yadav farmers see the November note recall as a ""demon"" but say they would have supported the Samajwadi Party even if the demonetisation never happened. Across central Uttar Pradesh constituencies that vote in the third phase on February 19, people seem agreed that the ""note bandi"" has hurt livelihoods. But how it might affect the Assembly polls is harder to assess, with caste and community leanings appearing to trump economic logic for many. Among the few dissenters is Mehboob Alam, a small-time building contractor from Kanpur district. He insists the note recall has changed the minds of many who would ordinarily have backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Had the note ban not happened, Modi would have formed the government in Uttar Pradesh. The demonetisation has upended his game,"" Alam, 52, said at Belaur market. Dikshit said he had lost a couple of lakhs of rupees this season because the note recall had left people without cash, worsening the effects of a bumper crop. ""Last season, I sold a sack of potato (weighing 52-55kg) for Rs 600-700; this season the price fell to Rs 150-200. I couldn't recover my input cost,"" the resident of Salempur, a village of ""Pandits"" in Farrukhabad, said. But he insisted that this would have no impact on votes. ""This time, all the Brahmins will vote for the BJP,"" Dikshit said, drawing vigorous nods all around. ""We had voted for Mayawati in 2007 and for the Samajwadis in 2012. But not this time, after the way Akhilesh has neglected Brahmins."" Most upper caste voters said they would support the BJP, as did most non-Yadav backward caste farmers, while acknowledging the distress caused by the demonetisation. ""We have suffered; we couldn't recover even the labour cost. But the note bandi will prove good for the country and for everybody in future,"" claimed Sujit Kumar Katiyar, a potato farmer. A rare exception was Anil Kumar Rajput, a landowning upper caste resident of Pasningpur village in Farrukhabad. His choice of Akhilesh, however, was driven more by the chief minister's performance than any anger at the demonetisation. ""Most members of our caste say they will vote for the BJP but I'll vote for Akhilesh. He has performed,"" Anil said. Akhilesh is banking on voters like Anil with his poll slogan of "" Kaam bolta hai (work talks)"". Most Rajputs and Thakurs, though, argued that while Akhilesh may be a good man, his party's district and block-level functionaries were knee deep in crime and corruption. The Rajputs and Brahmins see the BJP as their ""natural party"" that would serve their interests if it comes to power. Reminded that the BJP under Modi was trying to transform itself into a party of the poor and backward castes, Dharmnath Dubey of Naglabag village was dismissive: ""These things have to be done to win elections."" Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are regarded as Samajwadi pocket boroughs but the Brahmins there are hopeful of ""our party"" coming to power after a long ""exile"". They are banking on the Muslim vote splitting between Mayawati and the Akhilesh-Rahul combine. ""In Farrukhabad, for instance, Mayawati has fielded a Muslim and the Samajwadis a Hindu. This should split Muslim votes. This is happening across the state,"" said Bhupendra Dwivedi in Farrukhabad town. The BJP vote too risks a division in Farrukhabad, though. Manoj Agrawal, a trader whom the BJP had denied a ticket, is contesting as an Independent. Many in the BJP feel that faulty candidate selection might cost the party."

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Leaving their farms behind at Rajoke village, Amritsar. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)THE FARMERS of Punjab, who have been facing one crisis after the other for the past few years, are now facing indiscriminate increase in the rate of seeds of spring maize (February to May) and sunflower crops. In the absence of checks by any government agency, they are ending up paying double the amount to buy seeds for these crops. And, farmers have to depend only on dealers for the spring maize seed because the agriculture department provides the seed for Kharif season maize (June to October) only.Watch What Else Is Making NewsFarmers said that to increase rates, false shortage is being created by the seed dealers. Even some farmers groups have complained to the district administration and the agriculture department, which has issued instructions to check the availability of seed. Sunflower and spring maize crops are sown in February and March and harvested in June. We got an agreement with the dealers for getting the spring maize seed at the rate of Rs 1,200-1,400 per 4-kg bag (Rs 300-350 per kg) but farmers are being forced to pay Rs 2,100-2,200 (Rs 550 per kg) for the same quantity now as this will double our production amount, said farmer Jagat Parkash Singh Gill, secretary of Potato Seed Growers Association (PSGA), adding that they have lodged a complaint with the district administration, too.He also mentioned that dealers cartlised themselves to create a false shortage of the seed to charge hefty amount from the farmers. Prithpal Singh, another farmer and general secretary of PSGA, said that even the bills and invoice number are not provided by these dealers against the purchase of seed from them. He added that mostly hybrid seed is used for spring maize and that even the rates of the Cucurbit (Musakmelon, Watermelon etc.) has been hiked by the dealers. The rate of sunflower seed has also been increased from Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,600-3,000 per bag of four kilos, said farmers while making a representation.According to the agriculture department, around 30,000 hectares are ued for the cultivation of spring maize every year mostly in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and part of Ludhiana districts. Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director in the agriculture department, informed that they have asked the officials of these districts to check the stock available with the dealers. They have also been asked to send a report on seed availability with the dealers, he added.Chief Agriculture Officer, Jalandhar, Jugraj Singh, said that according to their report, there is no shortage of seeds of these crops in the market and they have informed their higher-ups about it. In Jalandhar alone, spring maize is cultivated over 10,000 hectares and sunflower on nearly 1,000 hectares.The farmers said that most of the potato growers of Doaba region, after harvesting the crop in February-March, switch to cultivating spring maize and sunflower crops, which are three-four months crops only.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593bc9317be9e04956d788b0,Let a billion ‘uttam santatis’ bloom,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/let-a-billion-uttam-santatis-bloom/article18449895.ece,2017-05-14,"Last week, on the very day a new entertainment channel was being launched, I was trying to feed my baby. I dipped his baby spoon in the baby bowl and shovelled into his mouth a spoonful of the amorphous white goop that babies eat.He chewed on it for a bit, made a face, and said, farrago.When I didnt react, he shook his head, and looked at me sadly. As I moved closer to wipe his dripping chin, he ejected the entire contents of his mouth into my face, saying once more, farrago.I had assumed it was baby talk. But, thanks to the great Shashi Tharoors tweeted description of a programme on the aforementioned entertainment channel, I realised, belatedly, that my infant son had been trying to tell me not to feed him a confused mixture of banana, dosa, potato and Cerelac.Speaking farragoNormal babies start speaking simple words when they are 18-24 months old. This little fellow is all of ten months old. And his first-ever spoken word was not amma or appa or poda but farrago. A word I didnt even recognise, despite being a self-proclaimed man of letters. A word no one in our extended family or clan or neighbourhood had ever heard of. So how come his vocabulary is so advanced? You probably know the answer: garbh sanskar .Frankly, Im appalled at the recent brouhaha over efforts to revive the ancient Indian tradition of garbh sanskar . Some have even branded it as some sort of racist quackery inspired by Nazi Germany.But garbh sanskar , as the website of the organisation promoting it states, is a scientifically proven fact and an amazing way of teaching/educating and bonding with unborn baby in womb during pregnancy. Its objective is to produce uttam santati who would help build a Samarth Bharat .The benefits of garbh sanska r are well-documented in the Vedas. To mention just a few: Your uttam santati super-baby would cross development milestones such as crawling, speaking, and opening a Facebook account much sooner than ordinary babies.It would be more creative, less stubborn, and do potty at regular intervals between 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. only on weekdays and alternate Saturdays. And, it would fall asleep the minute you want it to. I promise to transfer Rs. 15 lakh to the savings account of anyone who can point to one thing thats objectionable in any of this.The science behind garbh sanskar is quite simple. The ether is full of jobless divine souls who are like venture capitalists (or angels) looking for investment opportunities. If you, as a couple, are planning to engage in conjugal activity with some kind of tangible output in mind, you must convince these investor souls to invest in your combined gene pool.Do your mathTrust me, this isnt as difficult as it sounds. All you need to do is spend three months purifying your sperm (or egg) by eating the right ayurvedic herbs, doing surya namaskar and restricting your carnal engagements to the time prescribed by planetary configurations.In addition, if you can demonstrate sustainable growth in your good karma at a CAGR of 18%-20% or above, not only would your bursts of coition turn more productive, they would also be more likely to entrap a divine soul, which would, in due course, materialise as a high-performing super-baby.Fine-tuning neededTo my mind, there is only one flaw in the super-babies programme. Take my own case, for instance.I am counting on my son to pay off my home loan, sponsor my post-retirement world tour, and finance the publication of my controversial autobiography.Thanks to garbh sanskar , I am certain that he will grow up to be taller, fairer, and, unlike me, intelligent enough to clear IIT-JEE by the age of 13 and become Director (Global Operations) at Goldman Sachs by 21. But there is no guarantee that he wont quit his job to become a human rights activist, or worse, live in sin with an anti-national.In other words, the baby customisation process needs fine-tuning. I therefore urge the government of India to scrap the MGNREGA and invest the money saved in modernising Indias super-babies programme.As for the deluded souls who cant stop criticising garbh sanskar , Im sure they either dont have kids or dont plan to have them or are such terrible parents that their offspring, once they grow up, would waste no time in despatching them to a geriatric home after diddling them out of their gold, property, and biometrics."
593be9737be9e04956d795d0,Tamil Nadu Nutrition Alliance launched,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-nutrition-alliance-launched/article18499459.ece,2017-05-19,"The M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) and the UNICEF came together on Thursday to launch the Tamil Nadu Nutrition Alliance.The alliance will attempt to bring together multiple stakeholders for an all-hands-on-deck approach to tackle malnutrition. Thursdays meeting at the MSSRF in Taramani saw the participation of representatives from various government departments, NGOs and academics, among others.Speakers at the event pointed out that all is not rosy when it comes to the nutrition levels of the people of the State. The fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), for example, says that 55.4% of non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years are anaemic. In NFHS-3, this figure stood at 53.1%. At the same time, the all-India figure for this category dropped from 55.2% in NFHS-3 to 53.1% in NFHS-4.Job Zachariah, Chief of UNICEFs Office for Tamil Nadu and Kerala, said that the alliance was necessary as factors like sanitation, child marriage and women empowerment  which have a greater say in nutrition than conventionally thought factors  are usually overlooked. The newest evidence shows that nutrition-specific interventions only have a 20% say in reducing malnutrition. The other 80% is decided by nutrition-sensitive or social determinant interventions, he said.Triangular relationshipMSSRF founder M.S. Swaminathan said that nutrition literacy should be a priority for the alliance.Many nutritional problems were considered medical problems. Even in our country, the National Institute of Nutrition is with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Nothing wrong with that. But the idea was that it was a medical problem. Today, we realise that the triangular relationship between agriculture, nutrition and health is extremely important, he said.In Africa, a new variety of sweet potato with a high degree of Vitamin A has helped overcome Vitamin A deficiency...This is an agricultural pathway to a nutritional problem....An agricultural remedy for a nutritional malady, Mr. Swaminathan said.Darez Ahamed, mission director of the National Health Mission in Tamil Nadu, participated."
