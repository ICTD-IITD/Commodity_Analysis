Government health officials participated in the meeting.Outlawing momos, however, would accomplish little.The substance at the root of Aroras claims, monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as the brand name Ajinomoto, is frequently used in the preparation of dishes with East Asian flavouring such as noodles, fried rice, chilly paneer, and chilly chicken.The flavour enhancer is also naturally found in vegetables such as potato, tomato, and mushroom, as well as several fruits and wheat and dairy products. It is added into a variety of grocery items.MSG came to the limelight in 2015 when samples of Nestles Maggi were found to include the flavour enhancer despite Nestles claims to the contrary. Maggi was also shown to have higher than permissible quantities of lead.India does not stipulate a maximum limit of MSG in food. The Food and Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) requires that it should be used in accordance with a general set of good manufacturing practices and only in certain types of food.To help people make an informed choice about what they eat, the FSSAI also says that food items that do contain MSG must announce its presence on their packaging.What is MSG? Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavour enhancerIt is commonly found in Chinese food, soy sauce, parmesan cheese, potato chips, and frozen foodsIt also occurs naturally in items such as potatoes, tomatoes, milk, mushrooms, and wheatThough consumption in large quantities may cause headaches, numbness, chest pain and sweating, and eventually lead to elevated blood pressure, it is still basically safeCan it really cause cancer?It is popularly believed that MSG causes sluggishness, headaches, nausea, increased thirst, skin rashes or excessive sweating. Scientific studies around the world, however, have failed to establish any negative health impact associated with MSG, let alone cancer. The Food and Drug Administration, the premier regulatory body of its kind in the United States, categorises MSG as generally recognized as safe.If consumed in higher quantities or regularly, it is also known to have caused palpitations and chest pain in some people, said Ritika Samaddar, chief dietician at Max Super Speciality Hospital. It is an approved flavour enhancer; even the US allows its use. We just suggest that as a precaution, pregnant women and infants not consume it.It definitely does not cause cancer, she adds."

One day, just a few days ago, one part of my memory suddenly went blink-blink, emitting a warm and happy light. I dont know what triggered it, but a picture popped up in my mind of a small, nondescript shop in Old Delhi. And I recalled that it sold the most delicious bedmi sabzi.Theres an old Chinese saying which states that when memory calls, you must respond. So I responded and rushed off to Purani Dilli one sunny day. I took the Metro, got off at Chawri Bazaar, and then started walking towards Bazaar Sitaram, for, as I recalled, the bedmi shop was there.I found it to my left after walking down the lane for a while. It is still small and nondescript and, as I discovered in the next 10 minutes, it still sells the most delicious bedmi sabzi.The name of the shop is Ram Swarup Halwai. The address is 3294, Bazaar Sitaram, near Lal Darwaza. The phone numbers are 9210040054 and 9310804526. It is not a very well-known shop, but the local people know all about it. And, as I saw, quite a few people stop there for a morning meal.The shop, run by brothers Ajit Kumar and Anil Kumar, was set up 80 years ago by their grandfather. There is a small counter which holds a few different kinds of sweets  chamcham, gulab jamun, rasgulla and barfi.But the shop is really known for its bedmi sabzi and nagori halwa. In a kadhai on the side, you can see bedmis being fried. There is a runny and reddish potato sabzi in a large utensil. In a paraat on the counter you will find small nagoris, and in a huge paraat next to it, theres halwa.Let me tell you whats so special about Ram Swarup Halwais fare. One, the food is excellent. The bedmis are small but crisp, and the potato curry is spicy and mildly tart. The brothers carefully put a slit green chilli in the potato sabzi, so that makes it nicely hot. The small nagoris, again, are delightfully crisp. You pierce it with your thumb, stuff it with a good helping of halwa and pop it into your mouth. Life really looks up after that.The nagori is prepared with maida, or flour, mixed with suji, or semolina, which adds to its crispness. The halwa is excellent, and I thought the suji had been really well roasted  which to my mind is the test of a good halwa.I have always believed that nagori halwa is one of the best breakfast meals you can ever have. You can also dunk your nagori in some sabzi and eat it, if you like to alternate between sweet and savoury tastes.The second important point is that prices havent really gone up much at Ram Swarup Halwais little shop. A plate of two bedmis with potato sabzi comes for Rs. 15, while two pieces of nagori with halwa are for Rs. 10. The rate in the bigger shops in Old Delhi is five or six time higher. Of course, the better known bedmi sellers enhance their bedmis with side dishes, such as chholey, fenugreek chutney and pickled vegetables. Ram Swarups fare is simple  but finger licking good.I ate some bedmis and nagori halwa, packed some to be consumed later and made my way home. I gave my memory cells a little pat on their backs and urged them to carry on with the good work. The next time they go blink-blink, I am sure there will be another happy memory to be revisited."

He directed the officials concerned to ensure that only 33 approved varieties of seeds are sold at monitored prices to prevent loss of crop on this account and also coordinate with neighbouring Haryana to ensure that the same quality seeds are sown in the region.Chairing a meeting of the agriculture department here, Amarinder said he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking price support to compensate the farmers for the loss incurred due to the difference between maizes market price of Rs 1,100 and the governments Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 1,300.Though the central government declares MSP for maize, it does not directly buy the produce, he said.The Chief Minister directed the agriculture department to explore the possibility of tying up with a commodities exchange or set up an exchange for trading of commodities like potato and cotton to ensure guaranteed sale and save farmers from distress selling, an official spokesperson said here.Amarinder expressed concern over declining cotton yields in the state due to whitefly infestation and told the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to explore possibilities of introducing better quality Egyptian and Australian cotton varieties to increase profits.Referring to cotton as white gold of southern Malwa region, he underlined the need to educate farmers on the use of less insecticides and pesticides.Directing the officials concerned to ensure sale and use of only PAU-approved pesticides and recognised seeds, the Chief Minister said the agriculture department would need to reach out to 1,500 villages to educate the farmers and create awareness about the threat of whitefly.At the meeting, the agriculture department informed that it has sufficient quantities of seeds, pesticides and fertilizers for the coming crop season.Amarinder also directed the irrigation and power department to ensure regular supply of canal water and electricity supply from April 15.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav) CM Yogi Adityanath arrives at Lucknows Lok Bhawan to chair the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)THE STATE Cabinet on Tuesday decided to allow central audit agencies such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to audit development authorities in the state, which included the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). The previous Akhilesh government had denied permission to the CAG to audit GDA.In the second Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the government decided that if the CAG seeks permission to audit any development authority in UP, the government will not object, Minister Sidharth Nath Singh said.Additional Chief secretary (Housing and Urban Planning) Sadakant said that in all, 29 authorities had been set up under the UP Urban Planning and Development Act, which provides for the audit of these authorities. A state government agency, Sthaniya Nidhi Lekha Pariksha in Allahabad, also audits these development authorities and its report is presented in the state Assembly, he told mediapersons.The CAG had requested the state government to audit some authorities Their communication was especially regarding Ghaziabad but then the (previous) state government had the view not to grant permission because UP has its own system of audit. The Governor too had intervened and had written letters in this connection. Last year, Governor Ram Naik had written to the PM and the President about denial of permission to CAG by the UP government for conducting audit of Ghaziabad Development Authority, said Sadakant.The Cabinet on Tuesday decided that if CAG requests for audit, the state government should not have any objection. I have issued the order that like Ghaziabad, CAG can audit anywhere it wants to, he added.The Cabinet, meanwhile, also decided that consumers will have to pay only the principal amount of their electricity bills, as surcharge would be waived for domestic and commercial consumers belonging to lower and middle classes. Small scale industries, both in urban and rural areas, would also be able to avail the same benefit.Moreover, farmers could now pay electricity bills in four installments in a year, if the amount is above Rs 10,000, Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma said.He added that during summer, the government will ensure that villages get power for 18 hours, tehsil headquarters and Bundelkhand area for 20 hours each and district headquarters for 24 hours. An official said power supply during evenings will be ensured in villages from April 6 and the state was purchasing electricity worth several crores every day.The previous governments too had decided to roster power supply for villages, tehsil and district headquarters but the decisions were not implemented at ground level Poor villagers are VIPs for the current government thus, the state government has decided that any laxity in implementation of the roster at the ground level will not be tolerated and action would be taken against officials responsible, said Sharma.Admitting that rural areas were not getting power at night, Sharma said the government was working to ensure 24-hour power supply in villages by October, 2018. He added that defective or burnt transformers of tubewells will be replaced within 48 hours in rural areas.Other Decisions* To sign a pact with the Centre under Power for All mission. The pact, to be signed on April 14, will help in supplying power to every village before 2019.* Purchase one lakh metric tonnes of potato from farmers in the current crop season to ensure that they at least recover their production cost.

(Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav) Yogi Adityanath held the first cabinet meeting on Tuesday. (Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)KEEPING A key poll promise of the BJP, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, at the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, announced his governments decision to waive loans of Rs 36,359 crore taken by about 94 lakh small and marginal farmers in the state. The waiver amount includes Rs 5,630 crore loans of 7 lakh farmers whose accounts were declared non-performing assets (NPAs) by banks. In its Lok Kalyan Sankalp document 2017 for the assembly elections, the BJP had promised to waive crop loans of small and marginal farmers. During the poll campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had promised loan waiver of farmers if his party were to come to power in the state.According to government records, out of 2.30 crore farmers in the state, 1.85 crore are marginal and 0.30 crore are small farmers. The cabinet on Tuesday decided to waive outstanding crop loans adding up to Rs 30,729 crore taken by about 86.68 lakh small and marginal farmers till March 31, 2016, up to a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh per farmer. In addition, the state government will also settle the dues of 7 lakh farmers with NPAs under a one time settlement scheme.All farmers with land holdings of less than one hectare, or 2.5 acres, will be considered marginal farmers, while those with land holdings of 1-2 hectares will be considered small farmers. The farmers were unable to repay the loans due to crop failure caused by hailstorm, drought and floods. Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state government would bear the cost of the loan waiver and no financial support would be sought from the Centre. He said the state would raise the funds through the Kisan Raahat Bond.Finance Minister Rajesh Agrawal said farmers who have paid their loans will not benefit from the scheme. An eight-member committee, under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, has been set up to finalise the modalities of the scheme. Meanwhile, the cabinet also decided that illegal slaughterhouses would not be allowed to operate. Singh said the cabinet was informed that 26 such slaughterhouses had been shut down so far. The cabinet also approved the proposal regarding formation of anti-Romeo squads at police stations.The government also decided to draft a new industrial policy to increase investment in the state. A group of ministers led by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma will visit several states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharahstra to study their industrial policies. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya will head another committee of ministers to look into illegal mining. The committee is expected to hand in its report within a week.With the state recording a bumper wheat crop, the cabinet decided to open 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state. While about 40 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will be procured in the first stage, the total target will be about 80 lakh metric tonnes. Along with the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,625, farmers will be paid Rs 10 per quintal for transportation and loading. The cabinet also decided to set up a three-member committee to look into the steps that need to be taken to provide relief to potato farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593c8de07be9e00e964d2e6d,"Direct transfer, 2 lakh sale points: Big fertiliser subsidy reform rollout in June",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/direct-transfer-2-lakh-sale-points-big-fertiliser-subsidy-reform-rollout-in-june-4581320/,2017-03-22,"The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In a state with the highest rate of crimes against SCs, with three recent attacks on Dalit weddings, it took a funeral for this wedding to happen.Its a happy day for the Bairwa household in Mehndipur village, around 100 km from Jaipur. The walls of Ranjeet Bairwas modest house sparkle with fresh white paint, and a heart drawn in red paint, enclosing the names of the bride and groom, Pooran and Khushi, adorns the entrance.Pooran is a graduate who went on to do certificate courses in teaching and library management. At 27, he is older than most Dalit grooms in this area. Pooran says he got a little late waiting for a job, and is now preparing for the Rajasthan governments recruitment exam for sub-inspectors.Pooran sits patiently as a group of women perform wedding rituals, placing dhania (coriander) seeds in his hand, while singing traditional folk songs.There have been several instances recently of Dalit weddings being disrupted by upper and dominant castes in Rajasthan and in other states, but the Bairwas are not worried about that today.Khushi walks out to welcome him in what will be their first meeting(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Khushi walks out to welcome him in what will be their first meeting(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)It is a funeral, instead, that everyone talks about; a funeral two years ago that led to a Dalit protest, which eventually made the Rajputs of the village relent, and made wedding celebrations like Poorans possible.How can we forget? says Santram, Poorans 47-year-old cousin. It happened on March 14, 2015. Jaise hi unhone hamein arthi le jaate dekha, hum par hamla kar diya aur arthi ko dhakka diya. Murda zameen pe gira diya. Hum sabko bada gussa aaya (The moment they saw us carrying the body on a bier, they attacked and pushed it. The body fell. We were furious), he says.In the violence that followed, Santram and 15 other Dalits were assaulted by Rajput members of the village. There had been clashes before but this time, Santram decided not to let go and filed an FIR. Eighteen persons were booked and five arrested.It was then, he says, that the Rajputs relented. They called me and said you do whatever you want, we will not bother you anymore, says Santram, the relief still showing through the triumph in his voice.The same year, Santram contested the 2015 panchayat elections but could not win, though the Bairwas constitute the majority by far, with 150 households compared to 20 Rajput and three Jogi homes. They didnt even let Kanshi Ram (the late BSP founder) win. Who am I? he says with a wry smile.According to the National Crime Records Bureaus Crime In India report 2015, Rajasthan has the highest rate of crimes against Scheduled Castes in the country (57.2, calculated per lakh population). However, says Karauli DSP Prakash Chand, under whom Mehndipur falls, the incidents have come down significantly in the past few years. It is chiefly due to education and awareness about legal provisions. We usually try to solve such situations by talking to both parties, and it works most of the time. Two months ago, we received a complaint from Mehndipur so we sent some forces in plainclothes.Baraatis dancing to a local band, which was also once denied to Dalits by upper castes Baraatis dancing to a local band, which was also once denied to Dalits by upper castesRajkumar Bairwa, sarpanch of Sankarwada, under which Mehndipur falls, says, There have been practically no incidents since the 2015 funeral. The Rajputs also know that the legal provisions in such cases dont even allow bail. That has proved to be a major deterrent, besides education.Since 2015, the village has seen 8-10 weddings without any disruption, including Deendayals. Last year, the 33-year-olds baraat was taken out under heavy police protection. Baraatiyon se zyaada khaki vardi wale they. Aisa lag raha tha jaise kisi VIP ki shaadi hai (There were more policemen than baraatis, like it was a VIP wedding), he laughs. Police say they deployed the force more as a precaution.That was the last wedding in the village that required such protection.Today, as Poorans baraat wades through the Rajput area, children come out on the rooftops to watch. Pooran is riding a horse, wearing a turban and carrying a sword, all traditionally upper caste symbols, and unthinkable at a Dalit wedding until recently.The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh. If swords cant be had, the Dalits use a stick to hit the toran (auspicious decoration) while entering the brides residence, as part of a wedding ritual.The wedding will cost Poorans father Ranjeet Singh Bairwa, a construction contractor based in Delhi, around Rs 2 lakh. The horse and the DJ/band cost Rs 15,000. A wedding band is also a newly acquired indulgence for the Dalits. The Bairwas have paid Rs 10,000 for a local band, which includes a small pick-up truck with a music player and large speakers loaded in the back.Pooran in the Tavera hired for the wedding, with cars a safe mode of travel(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Pooran in the Tavera hired for the wedding, with cars a safe mode of travel(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)While he studied only till Class V, Ranjeet has managed some amount of financial security for his family. Among the achievements he is most proud of is the small Vaishno Devi temple he has got constructed near their house. Pooran stops here to pray before getting on the horse.Poorans mother Rampati and eldest sister Guddi smile, as a village woman comments, Forget the turban. Earlier, we had to carry our jutis (shoes) on our heads before upper castes. But now there is no problem. Now we have a band, a horse, everything.While Guddi did not study, Poorans three younger sisters studied up to Class 12.Yahin giraya tha murda us din (This is where the body fell that day), says Ranjeet, as they cross the family temple, shouting to make himself heard over the auto-tuned songs set to electronic beats being played by the DJ.The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh. The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh.As the baraat sets out, a mild dust-storm rises. The overcast sky mutes the evening sun and a strong breeze brings some respite to the wedding party.The wedding band is playing the songs of local favourites Raju Rawal and Shambhu Meena, which encompass everything from the timeless love of Radha and Krishna to demonetisation. The two singers have been creating waves across East Rajasthan, in the faultlines between its rural and urban areas, with their paeans to the Prime Minister.Tonight, the hundred-odd baraatis burst into a brisk dance to the beats of Waah re Mhara Modiji. Achha achha kanjoosa ki neend uda di re/ waah re mhara Modiji ka lehar chala di re; Paanch sau, hazaar upar rok laga di re/ kaala dhan ki tijori ki vaat laga di re; Ek raat mein paaso paltyo koi samajh ni paayo/ arre suntan hi TV mein news ghano paseeno aayo; Surgical strike se Pakistan hilayo/ greeban ki samajh bhavna dukh mein saath nibhayo; Arre kerosene ki kaala bazari band karwa di re/ waah re mhara Modiji kai lehar chala di re (Modiji has made the stingy sweat, sent the black marketeers running, turned the tables in a night, stunned Pakistan, heard the poor, ended the black market in kerosene).Bemused at the choice of song, Poornas cousin Suresh Bairwa says the band culture has only taken off in the last eight-10 years among Dalits. Before that, it used to be quiet. The groom would leave with women singing auspicious songs, and stop at homes of elders for blessings.Despite the song, the demonetisation cash crunch is itself a thing of the past. Pooran flaunts a three-layer garland of the new Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes, placed around his neck by relatives.The baraat waits for the bride to get ready at Khushis home(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The baraat waits for the bride to get ready at Khushis home(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Poorans brother Ram Singh, who is with the Army Medical Corps, has come for the wedding from his posting in Manipur. The 35-year-old says one major driver of the change in caste equations in the village are government jobs, preferably ones that come with a uniform, providing the Dalits a level playing field and social privilege.That is perhaps why the three young Dalits with jobs in the Army, BSF and CRPF in the village are role models for the community. Vardi vale ko haath lagane se pehle dus baar sochega koi (One will think ten times before laying a finger on a person in uniform), says 21-year-old Sanjay, who wants to join the Army.While most elder Dalits have had partial or no education, they are keen that their children study. However, though several young men want to join the forces, only a few make it. The preparation for the exams, the books, the coaching etc cost money.Sanjay is apprehensive about his chances. Mushkil hoti hai, coaching ke bina nahin ho paata. Maine physical clear kar liya tha, lekin merit list mein nahin aa paaya (It is difficult without coaching. I had cleared physical but couldnt make it to the merit list), he says.After riding around 40 minutes on the horse, Pooran disembarks and gets into a rented Chevrolet Tavera, decorated with artificial flowers and strips of satin. He rides with a young nephew and three relatives, who are coming along to take care of logistics that might arise on the way.The vehicle has been hired for Rs 3,100. The family has also hired 10 Jeeps to ferry guests to the brides village. Some relatives use their own cars while most others cover the 12-km distance on their bikes.There are 8-10 families in Poorans village that own a car. They are well-to-do. Some are contractors. We couldnt afford to buy one because we had to marry off four daughters, says Ranjeet.Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation. Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation.It is cars that have truly liberated Dalit weddings. Non-traditional, they have become a standard since riding a horse could invite trouble from upper castes.In 20 minutes, the baraat reaches Darjapur Patti, the brides village. Darjapur Patti lies adjacent to a Meena-dominated village and some guests mistakenly stop at a wedding there. We just had water, clarifies a baraati later.The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities. The Meena caste panchayat took that decision. Since we dont have a direct approach road to our settlement, we have to go through their area. That means we cant play any band music either, says a Dalit villager, not wishing to be named.A carpet is laid on the road outside for the groom party to sit on, while waiting for the bride to get ready. Younger family members burst crackers while the baraatis are served rose-flavoured milk.Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation. It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.With some moments to spare for the rituals to begin, Nanakram, 70, from nearby Pakhar village, is in a pensive mood. We dont want any of this the mare, the band. Why should the community waste time and money on these things when all they lead to is conflict? he says.However, says Sanjay, its not as simple as that. The older generation doesnt want to change anything. But we have decided to challenge them (the upper castes). Why cant we do what we want? Its our country too. Everyone understands the language of the fist Only then will our condition improve, he says, taking a walk through the village lanes bathed blue in the moonlight.The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Interestingly, unlike the other upper castes, the Dalits find Brahmins more than willing to pitch in for their weddings. Most of them come from the Mehndipur Balaji temple area, and can earn around Rs 1,100 in dakshina at a wedding like this. We have no issue with them. They dont discriminate, says Suresh Bairwa.If Brahmins are not available, a relative with basic knowledge of Sanskrit fills in. Pooran and Khushis wedding will be conducted by his fathers brother Gulab Chand.The Bairwas say they would have liked their upper caste neighbours to attend. We do invite them but they dont come since they dont want to eat with us. They will accept uncooked stuff but wont share a cooked meal, says Suresh. In the city, my upper-caste friends eat with me, at weddings etc. But when theyre back in the village, they stay away, he says.Dalits, in turn, are almost never invited to Rajput weddings.Pooran and Khushi exchange garlands.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Pooran and Khushi exchange garlands.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)There is some restlessness among the guests now. Its a hot, humid night with barely any breeze and they have been waiting outside Khushis house for two hours. There is some problem with the toran. They are trying to fix it, says Ranjeet.Paper plates loaded with sweet halwa made of coconut and lauki (bottle gourd) along with deep-fried potato snacks are passed around among the guests by the brides side. The naashta pacifies the restive baraatis for a while.Many, including the young and old, light up, puffing on bidis and cigarettes. There is no alcohol though. This is one upper caste convention they dont want to emulate, the Bairwas insist. We dont have alcohol or non-vegetarian food at our weddings. But those who want to drink make their arrangements anyway, says Sanjay, with a twinkle in his eyes suggesting his own little arrangement.The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)At about quarter to 11, Pooran and his baraatis enter the arched gateway erected to welcome the guests. The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.Khushis father Ram Khiladi, a Grade III government schoolteacher earning around Rs 5 lakh a year, has got their three-room house painted in light-green pistachio hue  Khushis favourite colour  for the wedding. The railing of the roof is adorned with lights, with two electric lotuses flanking the palace-style decoration on each side.You cant upset the baraatis, Ram Khiladi says. I have already spent Rs 5 lakh. Her dress alone cost Rs 20,000.After a couple of minutes, Khushi arrives, dressed in a purple lehnga with a transparent dupatta covering her face. Girls in the village have started going to parlours to get ready, but Khushi has got dressed on her own. Pooran and she exchange garlands.The baraat passes a Meena village along way(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The baraat passes a Meena village along way(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)As the women from the brides side sing songs welcoming the groom, everyone moves to the open area where dinner has been laid out. While Khushi goes back inside the house, Pooran heads towards the reception area with his friends.At about midnight, Khushi again emerges. Women from her family surround her under the mandap and help her put on jewellery gifted by the grooms side  a mor for her hair, a rakhdi for her forehead, and an intricate necklace.She then comes to sit on the stage along with Pooran, and a wedding photographer takes their pictures, dictating various poses.Ram Khiladi says he wasnt worried about any upper caste interference at the wedding at their village. Education has changed the attitude of upper castes and more so us. Besides, there are legal provisions safeguarding us. So people want to avoid getting into trouble, says the 49-year-old.Khushis village is dominated by Meenas, who have about 200 households. There are only 20 Dalit families.Ram Khiladis son Rakesh (22) too got married this February without any trouble. We went with a ghodi, band etc, he says.It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Left to himself, like other community elders, he too would go for simpler, less expensive weddings, he adds. We have been trying to bring down unnecessary expenses, like serving alcohol or other extravagant practices. But the girls side inevitably has to spend more.Vishnu Singh Sisodiya, the up-sarpanch of Gharoli village nearby and a Rajput himself, says they have also been trying to get community members to rise above symbolic and contentious matters. Earlier these symbols were claimed exclusively by the Rajputs because it was a matter of prestige for the bigger gharanas. It still happens in Rajput-dominated villages. In Mehndipur too, there was an issue related to a funeral. But times have changed. Im a Rajput myself but personally I feel these things should not happen. Whats the point? Cases are filed, people go to jail.Those who arent queuing up to get their pictures clicked with Pooran and Khushi have begun digging into the vegetarian spread: pooris, aalu ki sabzi, salad, raita and sweets. Most of the baraatis leave after dinner, with only those closest to the family sticking around till the pheras. That will be a while. It will probably be morning by then, sighs Ram Khiladi.Around 5 am, Khushi and Pooran finally leave for his home, in the rented car. It has been the grandest day of their lives.Santram says when they look back, thats what would matter, and not as much what all they could do despite the upper castes. Everyone realises these things, band, turban, horse, cost a lot, he says. Given a choice, we would not even want to follow these rituals. But the point is how can we not be allowed to follow them?Band, baaja, banApril 4, 2017Sanjay Kumar was beaten up reportedly for riding a mare in his wedding procession, in Sanjarwas village of Charkhi Dadri district in Haryana. Kumar required treatment along with other members of the wedding party. The ceremony was later performed under police protection. The Dalits named 21 Rajputs as being behind the attack, and alleged they also took away the mare.

Two of the accused were arrested, including under the SC/ST Act, but are out on bail. Two others are absconding.May 6 , 2017Champalal Meghwal was attacked in Udaipur, allegedly by upper caste men, for taking out his wedding procession with pomp and celebrations.

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

Her clothes were found here. Express Photo by Gopal Kateshiya The trench in which the girl spent 34 days. Her clothes were found here. Express Photo by Gopal KateshiyaThe pit, partially shaded by babool trees and on the edge of a cotton farm, is lined with saris and other womens clothes, empty wrappers of potato wafers, snacks and biscuits, broken bangles, and tin sheets stripped from cans of edible oil and sticks which were used to cover the trench. Some distance away, visible from the pit, is a clearing in the fields, strewn with polythene bags of the kind used to pack illegal country liquor, and more clothes, as well as firewood, a blackened oil tin that may have been used to heat water, a toothbrush, and a toothpaste.It was in this pit  around 5 ft deep, 7 ft long and 4 ft wide  in a village in Morbi districts Wankaner taluka that a 15-year-old was kept confined for more than a month. If she stood up and craned her neck, she could see the clearing where she was taken to and allegedly raped most nights.Eight people have been arrested since the girl was rescued, including the 18-year-old accused of raping her and his father and other relatives. Last month, she underwent an abortion. On December 29, the girls family left their home and are now living by the roadside, claiming threats from the accused.The two families are neighbours and distant relatives from the same community, Devipujaks, who are mostly landless labourers. The girls family is better off of the two.Watch What Else Is Making NewsIn their defence, the accuseds family is calling it an affair gone wrong. In her statement, the girl has told police, Naresh forced himself on me inside the pit the same night that I was kidnapped. Later, he would pull me out of the pit at night, rape me and push me back in the pit before daybreak. He would tie my hands and legs, gag me and threaten me with a knife, asking me not to yell or to try escape.Before leaving, he would allegedly cover the pit with the tin sheets, leaving just a small gap for her to breathe.The eldest among six siblings, the girl has studied till Class VII and would help her parents till their 12-bigha land. Her mother says she dropped out since there werent many girls in her class.The girl says she had gone out of her home to relieve herself late on the night of November 10 when Naresh kidnapped her. She told police that eight men pushed her into a rickshaw, took her to the isolated farm taken on lease by Nareshs family, around 2 km away, and shoved her in the trench. Nareshs father, who usually drives a rickshaw, had taken the field on an annual lease of Rs 5,000 and planted cotton.The land belonging to the girls family is located close by. They searched for her for five days before registering a police complaint on November 25.A dupatta finally gave away the pit. Nareshs younger brother Pavlo spotted it in the field and told his father Jayanti it was mine. He knew I was missing. Naresh and Jayanti feared that being a child, Pavlo would spread the word. Therefore, they had no option but to inform my family that I was in their field, says the girl, her voice cracking.The date was December 13  34 days after she went missing  remembers her grandfather.Naresh was booked for kidnapping, rape, illegal confinement and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act as the victim is a minor. Police also arrested his elder brother Haresh, 20, father Jayanti, 45, uncles Chatur and Devkaran, and three other relatives, Avcharan, Chana and Kishor, after the girl said they had helped Naresh kidnap her. The clothes the girl was wearing on the day of her kidnapping were among the items seized from the pit.After a medical examination showed she was pregnant, the POCSO court allowed an abortion. Police have taken samples of the foetus and sent them for DNA tests.The grandfather says that due to the long confinement, the girl has suffered physically and mentally. When we rescued her, her eyes had sunk in. She was so gaunt She cant sleep well even now, she is afraid still, he says.The grandmother accuses the 18-year-olds family of being bootleggers prone to violence, and says they threatened to abduct two more girls of the family following the police case. We are terrified to go back to our village, she says. The family has handed over their land to a fellow villager to till, and has written to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani seeking aid.While police took nine more people into preventive custody following the girls familys complaint of threats, they are out on bail.Morbi SP Jaypalsinh Rathore says they are ready to offer all help. There is a witness protection system. If the girls family approaches us, we shall provide them protection. But we are hearing about threats to them through the media.In his statement to police, Naresh has said he and the girl were involved in an affair for three years. On the night of the incident, she told me on the phone that she would die if I did not elope with her. I agreed.The 18-year-old, who was taking computer lessons in Rajkot after failing in his Class XII examinations, claims he had bought her a phone and it was through this that they stayed in touch.While the girls family denies this, and police say they have not recovered any such phone, Nareshs mother Radha shows a mobile with 2G connection, claiming it was the phone her son had given the girl. Radha says he confessed to her about the affair and gave the phone before his arrest.The girl was besotted with my son and that is why he failed his Class XII exam last year There is a bagful of love letters she wrote to my son, Radha says, showing a smart phone reportedly belonging to her son with photos of the two.She also questions the girls claim that she had gone out of her home to relieve herself when she was kidnapped. There is a toilet at her home. Why did she go out at night? The toilet is located adjacent to the girls house, and can only be accessed from outside.Nareshs sister Neeta claims the girls family was aware of their affair. The younger sister delivered her love letters to Naresh. Her aunt knew about the phone calls between them, she says.Radha adds that they too fear reprisal from the girls side as all the men in the family are now behind bars.However, she admits that none of it absolves Nareshs crime, and says they had no idea about it. For a month, he kept her in the trench and we all were in the dark.Naresh would spend the day at home and leave for our field in the evening, saying he would guard the crop against nilgai at night. Since we were all busy with the wedding of my elder son Haresh, nobody went to the field for weeks. His father went there two days after the wedding and found the girl there. Immediately, he called up her grandfather, Radha says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593d6da47be9e00dabcc0779,BBMP turns into farmer’s best friend,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-turns-into-farmers-best-friend/article18402854.ece,2017-05-07,"Stocked up:Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike set up six waste processing plants two years ago, it has failed to market the compost generated there.If you have agricultural land near Bengaluru, you can now get compost derived from the citys waste delivered to your farm. Whats more, the Agriculture Department will bear half the cost as subsidy, making the compost available at throwaway prices.Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) set up six waste processing plants two years ago, it has failed to market the compost generated there. Today, the plants have a stock of more than 30,000 tonnes of compost of various grades. Officials said this is taking up all the available space and has rendered the plants non-operational, leaving the BBMP with no choice but to launch a special drive to sell the compost.The civic body has already delivered 1,542 tonnes of fine compost (less than 4 mm) to farmers in Chickballapur, Tumakuru and Kanakapura in the past week. While it has set the price at Rs. 1,600 a tonne, farmers need to pay only Rs. 800 as the Agriculture Department will bear the remaining amount. Taking the transportation cost into account, farmers get the compost at an effective price of Rs. 300 a tonne, said N. Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner of BBMP.C.N. Chandru, a farmer from Chickballapur who grows capsicum and potato on 20 acres, has bought 60 tonnes of compost. Delivering it to the farm is a good initiative. The quality is very good, he said.B.Y. Srinivas, director of the Department of Agriculture, said the response has been overwhelming; in the open market, a tonne of compost would cost more than Rs. 3,000 a tonne.Different sizesApart from the fine-grade compost, the BBMP has over 12,000 tonnes of compost of medium lumps (16-35 mm) and over 10,000 tonnes of larger lumps (above 35 mm). Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda recently visited some of the plants and cleared sale of the remaining compost, said officials. However, they are yet to work out the modalities.Leading organic farmer L. Narayana Reddy said even the compost lumps can be used for agriculture as they act as good manure. Lumps have to be broken into finer particles before use, as they will not disintegrate easily in the soil. It would be better if the civic body breaks the lumps before offering them to farmers, he said. He also said farmers need to be educated on avoiding excess usage. I would recommend that farmers not use more than three tonnes for an acre, he said."

593de4267be9e00dabcc5ed2,Sowing season at Vattavada,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sowing-season-at-vattavada/article18417767.ece,2017-05-10,"The land cleared for sowing in Vattavada in Idukki district for the main harvesting season in August/September.The long wait is over. Vattavada, the largest cool-season vegetable cultivating village in the State has started sowing seeds for another season thanks to the rains. The village in the rain-shadow area was undergoing a severe drought delaying the sowing for the prime season of harvest in August/September. Rainfall last week prompted the farmers to sow the seeds.The main vegetables cultivated in Vattavada are potato, cabbage, carrot, beetroot, garlic and beans varieties.The cultivation is dependent on the rainfall with the shrinkage in cultivation in two seasons followed by the prime season.As per the Agriculture Department estimate 1,530 ha of land in Vattavada is under cultivation in the main season.Farmers confine the area of cultivation in the next two seasons to the low-lying areas where water sources are available,This time, the sowing was delayed due to the rains, said Gunasekharan, a farmer.The traditional way of cultivation is followed and the sowing is done when the farmers feel that the rains will sustain to germinate and help the growth of plants.The normal sowing season is April. However, this time the summer rains were poor and it was a long wait for them to start farming activities.A few farmers who had sown beans suffered losses as there were no rainfall after two days of drizzle.For beans, 60 days of growth is enough for harvesting the crops. However, three months of growth is required for all other vegetables. According to Horticulture Mission field assistant Shanavas T.B., the government move to bring more land in Vattavada under cultivation is showing good results.Large areas could also be brought under cultivation and potato is the main crop there.Farmers say that the large-scale cultivation of grandis was the main reason for shortage of water on the upland areas.The perennial streams started drying up and as it is in the rain-shadow area, the impact was severe. The delay in rainfall often happened in the past too and there is not much decline in the level of rainfall, said Mr. Gunasekharan and added that the main problem was the drop in the groundwater level.The Onam market is the main focus of farmers and the cool climate and fertile soil is enough for a good crop and pesticides and fertilizers are avoided.This make the quality of Vattavada vegetables better than those arriving from outside the State."
593dede67be9e00dabcc679d,"Making news, again!",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/making-news-again/article18444037.ece,2017-05-13,"There was a time in my life when I lived on canteen food. The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."
