(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The Indian Express had earlier highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district. The situation was almost the same elsewhere in the state, too, as there was no mechanism to support the farmers  who were forced to opt for distress sale  even after a bumper potato crop.Khattar claimed that the government has fulfilled almost all the promises made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls. Transparency in recruitment for government jobs has been stated as one of his top achievements. It was painful when the youths had to look for sifarish for government jobs. We have changed that pattern to ensure jobs on merit, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI Photo) Ahmednagar: Farmers spilling milk on the road during their state-wide strike over various demands at a village in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra on Thursday. (Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution. Rayate and other Kisan Kranti members, however, refuted Khots charges.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A few months back, the state government had formed a special committee to study possible electoral reforms in wholesale markets.In what is seen as the phase two of market reforms, the state government has decided to from a special committee to give suggestions for the formation of a new board of directors of Mumbai wholesale market. The committee, headed by marketing director Sunil Pawar, has been asked to submit its report in a months time.The trade in agricultural commodities in the terminal wholesale market of Vashi in Navi Mumbai is carried out mostly between traders. With an annual turnover of around Rs 18-20,000 crore, the market sees the arrival of agricultural commodities from across the state as well from other parts of the country. Vashi market is one of the few markets whose catchment area has little or no agricultural activities.Subhash Mane, the then marketing director, had suspended the board of director of Vashi market on charges of corruption in 2014. At present, a board of administrator is running the market and talks are on for appointing an IAS officer as the chairman of the market. Other than Pawar, the new committee has representatives from Solapur and the deputy secretary of the Mumbai market.Wholesale markets, which have been traditionally controlled by either the NCP or the Congress, has been on the radar of the Devendra Fadnavis government. Delisting of fruits and vegetables and changing the manner of election of directors for the market committees have been two major reforms carried out by the present government. Traders in the Mumbai market were at the forefront of the protest against delisting of fruits and vegetables last year.Earlier this year, the state government had given in-principle nod to allow for elections of directors from gram panchyats in the catchment areas of the wholesale markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the onion and potato traders and commission agents union, said the new body should ensure the directors should know about the functioning of the markets. The committee should be balanced and work without political interference, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"
5a0387a89855b76bf13b7aed,Delicious Sounding Descriptions Can Make You Favour Vegetables,http://www.ndtv.com/food/trick-or-treat-delicious-sounding-descriptions-can-make-you-favour-vegetables-1711764,2017-06-13,"Crispy broccoli with sweet, caramelized onions or would you prefer grilled, sizzling beans? You're tempted, aren't you? According to new research conducted by Stanford scholars and published in the Journal JAMA Internal Medicine, you are more likely to choose and favour vegetables if they are labelled with exciting and indulgent descriptions. For instance, adding words like 'caramelized' , 'dynamite' or 'sizzling' may make them sound more delicious and tempt you to eat them.To test the impact of labelling on the consumption of healthier food, researchers collaborated with the Stanford Residential & Dining Enterprises and conducted their study in a large dining hall on campus. They changed the labels for certain vegetables and made them sound more enticing using four types of descriptions: basic, healthy restrictive, healthy positive or indulgent. For example, beetroots were labelled as 'lighter choice beets with no added sugar' (healthy restrictive), green beans were simply called 'green beans' (basic), carrots were described as 'smart-choice vitamin C citrus carrots' (healthy positive) and they were not just sweet potatoes but 'zesty ginger-turmeric sweet potatoes' (indulgent).They made sure there was enough variety with a choice of vegetables like beetroot, butternut squash, carrot, corn, courgette, green beans and sweet potato that were rotated weekly. Researchers monitored the number of diners who chose the particular vegetable and how much of it was consumed for lunch over a period of 46 days (an academic quarter). No changes were made to the way the food was cooked and presented. They were only labelled differently but the diners were not aware of the fact that different sounding choices were the exact same item.It was found that vegetables with indulgent labels were preferred 25 percent more than basic labelling, 35 percent more than healthy positive and 41 percent more than healthy restrictive labels. In terms of per day consumption, vegetables with indulgent labelling were consumed 16 percent more than those labelled healthy positive, 23 percent more than basic and 33 more than healthy restrictive labels. It is believed that people consider healthy food to be less tasty and therefore, using delicious sounding descriptions and names can change their perspective and impact their sensory experience.The results of the study provide insights on how to encourage people to eat well by making healthy food more appealing. This simple strategy of changing the descriptions and making healthy food sound more indulgent and drool-worthy could have a significant impact on the food choices we make."

In all five instances, the families of those who killed themselves said the farmers were under heavy debt - from government institutions and private money lenders. Two of the suicides have happened in Kanpur district, and one each in Mahoba, Banda and Kaushambhi. The government has ordered inquiries into the suicides.The spate of suicides come after the state's BJP government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, waived off loans to the tune of Rs 35,000 crores in April. The waiver was part of the BJP's promises in the run-up to the state assembly elections. However, there is confusion among farmers over which loans are covered by the scheme, and which are not.""This government does not have a framework. They did not say whether there would be a limit or a condition to the waiver"", said Samajwadi Party's Basudev Yadav, who was sent by former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to visit the Dwivedi family in Kaushambhi.The state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit back at the Samajwadi Party.""SP is doing vendetta politics. We are committed towards working for the farmers and the loan was waived in the first cabinet meeting,"" the minister said.At Kaushambhi's Bakhtiyara village, 60-year-old Ram Babu Dwivedi committed suicide on Wednesday morning. The potato farmer recently received a loan recovery notice from a local cooperative. He had accumulated over seven lakh rupees as loan from government banks and crop worth 300 quintal rotted away in his fields.""I used to ask him about the loans but he would always say that he would take care of it,"" said Devendra, Ram Babu's son.Yesterday, a farmer in Kanpur, Shiv Kumar, died at a Kanpur hospital. He had consumed pesticide three days ago.His family has said Mr Kumar had lost money on a substandard crop after taking a loan of a loan of 70,000 rupees.

The protests abated this week after the government announced some relief this week and paid a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the families of each of the six farmers killed in Mandsaur on June 6. Prohibitory orders have been lifted from Ratlam today - a day after they were lifted from the epicentre of the protests in Mandsaur."
