Express Photo by A Aggarwal Farmers block the NH-1 (GT Road) at Ambala Cantt Friday. Express Photo by A AggarwalAFTER BLOCKING national highways for two to three hours in Haryana on Friday, farmers have threatened to gherao New Delhi with tractor trolleys if their demands for loan waiver and profitable prices were not met.It may happen that a bigger agitation can be announced. We can go for an indefinite jam of roads, gherao of Delhi with tractor-trolleys and jail bharo agitation, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Haryana, while addressing hundreds of farmers, who had blocked the National Highway-1, which connects New Delhi with Chandigarh, near Ambala.As part of the call for nationwide agitation on Friday, the farmers blocked national highways in different parts of Haryana apart from blockage of roads at four other places. And, to avoid confrontation with the farmers, police did not stop them from blocking roads, making it a smooth affair for the agitators. The authorities, though, diverted traffic routes to avoid long jams on the national highways.We had coordinated even with the authorities of Patiala, Karnal and Panchkula to divert routes of heavy vehicles far way from Ambala, said Prabhjot Singh, Deputy Commissioner, Ambala, who kept monitoring security arrangements for hours when the farmers were sitting on the national highway. Despite that, there was a near traffic jam in Ambala when traffic was not being allowed on the national highway because of the farmers stir. The farmers also blocked National Highway 71A which connects Panipat-Rohtak near village Rukhi (Sonepat) with another highway, which connects Chandigarh and Hisar, near Barwala town. Haryana DGP BS Sandhu said the agitation was completely peaceful throughout the state.A senior officer said Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was taking feedback about the agitation from the district authorities every five minutes. In support of farmers, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda held a panchayat at Pipli (Kurukshetra) while INLD held protests at district headquarters in support of the agitating farmers.Farmers, who had reached the protest site in Ambala district on their tractor-trolleys, were perturbed over the manner in which their crops were not purchased at reasonable prices. Harbhajan Singh (52), a farmer from Nalvi village in Kurukshetra, said, We opted for sunflower and potato hoping good prices as the government keeps stressing on crop diversification. But, lack of appropriate arrangement for better procurement dashed our hopes.Explaining in depth, Jogender Singh, an owner of five acres of land at Mamumajra village in Kurukshetra, said, Last year, we had paddy but we were offered Rs 200 per quintal less than the minimum support price for it. Then, we opted for potatoes but we were offered just Rs 1 per kg in the market while its production cost was Rs 7 per kg. Now, the government has announced Rs 3,950 per quintal MSP of sunflower. But, the government says it will buy only 25 per cent of the production of farmers at the rate of MSP. Where can we sell our rest of the crop now?Another sunflower farmer, Rajbir Singh, who has 4.5 acres of land, said, The government is ready to buy only 25 per cent of the sunflower crops at MSP and to sell rest of the crop, the farmers have to depend on traders, who offer only Rs 2,500 per quintal for this crop in the open market.Echoing similar sentiments, farmer Jasbir Singh said, If we sell the sunflower crop at the rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal, then we will be able to meet just our expenditure and there would not be any saving for us.Chaduni said, We will hold a panchayat in Shahbad on Saturday to demand MSP for the entire crop of sunflower.Haryana police, meanwhile, have filed FIRs against hundreds of farmers in connection with the blockage of roads by them in different parts of the state on Friday. The police in Rohtak district have filed two FIRs in connection with the blocking of highways  Rohtak-Panipat and Rohtak-Jind. Rohtak SP Pankaj Nain said 42 farmers have been named from about 120 others in two cases lodged in this connection.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a039cd99855b76bf13b8744,Haryana farmers forced to sell potatoes at 20 paisa/kg,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/haryana-farmers-forced-to-sell-potatoes-at-20-paisakg-4709585/,2017-06-18,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)Haryana farmers have been selling their potatoes for as low as 20 paisa per kg in the grain market of Pipli in Kurukshetra district this year. And if market labour charges are deducted, their net earning is just 9 paisa per kg. This is not just an allegation by farmers but a fact verified by a Market Committee of the Haryana government. Documents accessed by The Indian Express show that Sukhpal Singh, a resident of village Mangoli (Kurukshetra), sold 43.20 quintal potatoes for Rs 900 at grain market at Pipli on May 25.He paid Rs 520 as labour charges in the grain market for cleaning and unloading of the potatoes. The arthiya (commission agent) paid him just Rs 380, which means he earned just 9 paisa per kg, mentioned the document. The commission agent in this case, Ram Kumar Saini, told The Indian Express there could be many cases like of Sukhpal. Sukhpals potatoes were not good in quality. But even the good potatoes were purchased at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg. This time, there was no demand of potatoes from Bihar. Probably, they (Bihar farmers) had cultivated enough potatoes this year, said Saini.A farmer from village Mamumajra in Kurukshetra, Jasbir Singh, said, I also sold my potatoes for Rs 20 paisa per kg. There was no buyer in the market. In fact, it was an outcome of notebandi. The traders had no money. But ultimately the farmers are being forced to bear the brunt of notebandi. I had cultivated potatoes in 40 acres of land. We were forced to sell even the early variety potatoes at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg in December and January. I agree potato produce this time was a little high in comparison to the previous year. But where is the government which keeps saying it will facilitate export of potatoes and other products.Why was there no arrangement to export potatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka? questioned Jasbir Singh.Another farmer from the same village, Jogender Singh, said, The potatoes are bought at throwaway prices from farmers. We fail to understand how the same potatoes are sold by rehriwalas to the people in urban areas at the rate of Rs 15 per kg. The cultivation of potatoes proved a business of huge loss this year for farmers as the average production cost of potatoes was Rs 7 per kg, he said. Bhartiya Kisan Unions Haryana unit president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, The farmers blocked national highways on Friday to demand profitable prices of their crops. Now, we will discuss the next strategy on June 19.Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who along with other Congress MLAs met Haryana Governor to seek his intervention to solve problems of farmers on Saturday, said, This is an anti-farmer government. BJP leaders who used to stage half-naked protests to demand implementation of recommendations of Swaminathan Commission report to ensure 50% profit on the cost input of crops are now MLAs and ministers in the Haryana government. But now they have nothing to do with the farmers.However, Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu said, Hooda, who is now protesting (for) the report of Swaminathan Commission, should tell the people of the state what he had done regarding this report. He has forgotten how, apart from forced acquisition of the land of farmers, they were offered cheques for Rs 2 or Rs 3 as compensation for losses due to crop damage during his regime, which just served to rub salt into their wounds. Abhimanyu said the present government was taking consistent action on the report of the Swaminathan Commission report, which had been appreciated by Chairman of the Commission, Prof. M S Swaminathan himself.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Few are comfortable with track pants or the stretchable joggers or shorts. A runners group in south Bengaluru has therefore come up with an interesting solution  run in whatever, even sarees, just get running.Jayanagar Jaguars or JJ is one of the oldest running groups in the city has been organising various fitness events, such as marathons and workshops here. Started about nine years ago, this group has evolved and grown into one of the largest running groups. The motto of the group is fitness is fun.Their next event, titled Breaking Stereotypes, allows a fun saree/ traditional attire run for women to overcome social discomfort in embracing fitness.Anjana Mohan, the organiser, says, What stops a woman who wants to run is two things. One is that they consider taking time off for themselves as a luxury. And second is they dont think fitness is necessary. She wants women to realise that fitness is a necessity not a luxury.JJ has held many workshops and orientation programmes to bust myths around womens fitness. They discuss food and exercises during their sessions.Periods and thigh chaffing too keep women off running. JJs organises workshops to address these issues, says Anjana.The JJs have tied up with the Sports Authority of India.The Olympic team runners have been a part of their earlier events and encouraged the cause. Coach Pramod Deshpande, who trains the JJs emphatically adds, Everybody can run. Women make more enduring runners than men.Got familys backingVani Rajendra started running about a year and half ago. She runs with her daughter Preksha. I and my daughter run together. My mom who is 73 years old will be joining us for the next event. If you have to run your house, you have to run to keep yourself fit, says Vani.Most women do not take up running as they are not comfortable wearing the runners gear. Because of the outfits, many women dont take to running, unlike other forms of exercise, adds Anjana.Jayashree Mudaliar, who started running two years ago says,Most women use their social obligations as an excuse. I have been a couch potato all my life and took to running just two years ago. I wanted to get some time for myself. When asked about her familys opinion about her participation in marathons she says,My husband was always supportive, my 13-year-old son is super proud that I can run faster than him and play football with him.Shesin, another runner who has participated in many other saree runs, says, We were just seven to eight members when we started running and now its great to see 62 women who will be running in saree and salwar.Anjana says, One woman who said she cannot get permission to run is now running ultra marathons.

5a03a8159855b76bf13b8df1,Secrecy must for automatic info exchange: Swiss banks to India,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/618025/secrecy-must-automatic-info-exchange.html,2017-06-18,"Secrecy must for automatic info exchange: Swiss banks to IndiaPress Trust of India, New Delhi, Jun 18 2017, 14:29 ISTBankers in Switzerland said this rollout plan will give them enough time to study the implementation by other global financial centres and the adherence to confidentiality and data protection requirements by India and other recipients. Reuters File PhotoIndia will have to ensure strict confidentiality of information about its citizens' Swiss bank accounts received through the new automatic exchange window, failing which the Alpine nation will stop sharing the data.Switzerland and its banks will also keep a close watch on the data protection measures taken by India regarding the details received from other jurisdictions and want all other global financial centres to implement the global framework for automatic exchange of information (AEOI) on financial matters.On Friday, the Swiss Federal Council ratified the AEOI with India and 40 other jurisdictions to facilitate immediate sharing of details about suspected black money.The pact with India would not be subject to referendum and is planned for implementation in 2018, with the first set of data to be exchanged in 2019.Bankers in Switzerland said this rollout plan will give them enough time to study the implementation by other global financial centres and the adherence to confidentiality and data protection requirements by India and other recipients.They also clarified this exercise would be followed not just for India, but all countries with which Switzerland will share banking information under the automatic route.Switzerland competes with Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, London and New York among the major global financial hubs.Black money issue has been a political hot potato for long and the Indian government has stepped up its efforts in recent years to clamp down on this menace. These efforts have included hectic parleys with the Swiss authorities.With its long-standing banking secrecy walls crumbling in under global pressure, Switzerland has finally agreed to share tax information on automatic basis with several countries including India, but wants adherence to strict data protection and privacy requirements.Officials from the Switzerland government and leading groupings of Swiss banks told PTI that data protection and a level playing field need to be ensured by India and other jurisdictions with whom the AEOI regime would be implemented.The Association of Swiss Private Banks said the main concerns with respect to AEOI relate to data protection and level playing field.""We would like to ensure that bank data that will be transmitted in 2019 is used for tax verification purposes only... if data received from another country has been misused in a jurisdiction, Switzerland is unlikely to send data to that jurisdiction,"" the grouping's manager Jan Langlo told PTI from Geneva.The Geneva-based association has nine member banks employing around 7,500 people worldwide, as per its website.On whether there are any particular concerns related to India with respect to privacy and protection of data, Lango replied in the negative.""We have no particular concern over India, where the rule of law seems to be properly upheld,"" Lango added.Further, the association said that since Switzerland would start exchanging data one year later than most other countries, the banks would be able to verify that the other financial centres also exchange with India and the 40 other jurisdictions.A Swiss government official said that if states do not meet certain requirements of the standard, then the Federal Council would suspend AEOI.While emphasising that banks agreed to the plan of the government, SIF (State Secretariat for International Financial Matters) spokesperson Frank Wettstein from Berne said banks there only had concerns about the way the AEOI is activated and wanted to do so only only with jurisdictions that are sure to fulfil the requirements of the standard.""The Swiss authorities will make sure that the partner states meet the requirements of the standard. If not, the Federal Council will suspend the AEOI according to the MCAA,"" Wettstein told PTI.The exchange of information would be based on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on AEOI, which is in turn based on the international standard for the exchange of information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Asserting that the banks in Switzerland are fully committed to implement AEOI, Swiss Bankers' Association (SBA) said the banks have suggested a specific clause for data protection, security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness.SBA's Head of Public Relations Sindy Schmiegel told PTI from Basel that for reasons of data protection and data security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness, the banks have suggested a specific clause which demands that the federal council verifies that these two factors are considered.""This clause will be integrated in Swiss legal provisions to implement the AEOI. India is one of many other countries and not addressed in particular,"" Schmiegel said.SBA has around 296 institutional members and thousands of individual members.The Swiss Federal Council would soon notify India about the exact date from which the automatic exchange would begin.Besides, the council would prepare a situation report before the first exchange of data with India and other jurisdictions.The Association of Swiss Private Banks is also in ""close contact"" with Swiss authorities to better understand how the standard must be implemented and to ensure consistency with the other financial centres.""Of particular concern is the reluctance of the United States to apply the OECD standard, since their FATCA agreements provide other countries with far less information,"" Lango noted.The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is aimed at ensuring that details of financial assets of American citizens are available to the US authorities."
5a03b1219855b76bf13b9315,"In a UP village, after the loan-waiver, preparing for the next loan",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-up-village-after-the-loan-waiver-preparing-for-the-next-loan/story-9gpdOlMVlnqxa6WxTkDhdM.html,2017-06-21,"Hori Lal is worried. At 70, he is old and frail. He speaks, but is not easy to always comprehend. He walks slowly. But it is not just about himself that he is anxious. He is more concerned about the well-being of his family comprising three sons, their wives and 10 grand children.If one person falls sick, we are in trouble. There is no money, says Lal, a farmer in Barabankis Tindwani village. Though just 20 kilometres from Lucknow, if you go by the lack of infrastructure and housing, the state of roads and power, the village could be anywhere in the remote interiors of UP.Lal has a loan of Rs 70,000, taken in 2015, and displays his Kisan Credit Card. He is also a potential beneficiary of the UP governments loan waiver. Even as he waits to see whether his loan will indeed get written off as assured by Yogi Adityanath, the states new chief minister, he is already thinking of the next loan that he will likely be forced to take.The fact that he may have to take another loan underlines the limitations of a loan waiver: it at best can be a temporary relief and is not a solution to the problem of low income farmers plagued by recurrent losses.The economics of investmentLal, for example, has 6 bighas, an acre and a half, of land. The single-most important challenge for him, every season, is finding the resources to invest.Take the economics of potato farming.For an acre of land, Lal - like other potato farmers in Tindwani and elsewhere - has to first buy 20 sacks of seeds, with each sack containing 50 kg. Each kg costs around Rs 24. And so the total cost for seeds is Rs 24,000.He then has to buy fertilisers of different kinds - a 5 kilo pack of zinc sulphate for Rs 300, two packs of urea for Rs 330 each, and five sacks of DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) for Rs 1150 each. The total cost of fertilisers comes to Rs 6710.Lal then has to till and level the land, for which he hires a tractor for Rs 500 per hour. Ten times, for two hours each, the tractor works on preparing the soil and land. Lal shells out another Rs 10,000 for it.He then sows the seeds, for which he has to hire the tractor again, which costs him Rs 2000.The farmers of Tindwani depend on pumps, run on diesel, for irrigation. Engines (which includes diesel rates) can be rented at  150 per hour; every acre requires at least four hours of irrigation; and it has to be irrigated seven times. The total cost for Lal on this head works out to Rs 4200.The next step is the use of pesticides. Along with labour, which can be hired at Rs 250 per day, the costs of this would come to Rs 1500.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The final step in the cycle is harvesting. A tractor is hired, at Rs 2000 per acre. Ten labourers are hired for the day, which costs Rs 2500. And 250 sacks have to be bought, at Rs 20 each. Together, the entire harvesting exercise costs about Rs 9500.But the cycle is not yet complete, for the farmers have to now transport and store their produce. Each sack is now packed in with 50 kgs of potato. The total produce from an acre, if all goes well, for Lal is about 125 quintals. The total cost of transporting and storing is close to Rs 30,000.And so what constitutes for Lal his basic investment, in one crop cycle, for an acre of land, from the stage of seeds to storing the produce, is approximately Rs 87,910. With miscellaneous costs, this would go up to around Rs 90,000.Potato farmer Kishan at his field in Bandi ka Purva village in Barabanki. (Deepak Gupta/HT Photo)The lose-lose ventureAnd then how much does Lal - or any other farmer of his kind - earn?Till Yogi government came to power in March in UP, there was no Minimum Support Price for potato. In the last season, prices had fluctuated. Local Tindwani farmers told HT that it varied between Rs 120 per sack of 50 kgs to Rs 750 per sack. On an average, this would mean about Rs 4.85 per kg of potato. At 125 quintals, this would mean a return of Rs 60, 625 for an acre of potato produce.But it was erratic. Sometimes, we just left our produce at the storage because it cost more to pay them storage fees than what we would have recovered. So we got no money, says Lal.To offset this problem of wild fluctuation in prices, the Yogi government has introduced an MSP of Rs 487 per quintal. But even if all his produce was acquired at this rate, it would give a farmer like Lal for an acre of his produce Rs 60,875.But remember his investment. It is close to Rs 90,000. And so every acre of potato he cultivates, Lal is actually losing Rs 30,000.The vicious cycleIt is because of this gross mismatch between investment and income that farmers such as Lal end up taking loans. They do not have money for the seeds, the fertilisers, the irrigation, the pesticides, the sowing, the harvesting, the transport and storage because they have actually lost money.Weddings in the family and emergencies like illnesses force them to sell part of their land holdings. Novembers demonetisation did not help. It left even lesser money for investment and so the crop produce for some of the potato farmers of Tindwani went down.The Yogi governments decision to waive off loans up to Rs 1 lakh, for small and marginal farmers with less than a hectare of land, may benefit Lal. But it wont solve his problem.Where would he get the money to make a fresh investment? I will take a loan again. What else can I do?Why did he then cultivate potatoes in the first place?Lal says he has no other option. What else can we do? This is what my family has always done. This is all we know. At least, it gets us some vegetables for the home. Lal says sending his sons out to work is not a solution: they were unskilled and would get Rs 250 as labour charges for a day, which they could get in the village too. At least we are together.It is this underlying driver of despair - limited cash reservoir to make investments, losses on produce because of low price, and thus a further push into deprivation - which is causing despair. The UP governments decision to waive off loans has triggered a nation-wide demand for the same, but Lal knows it is only a matter of time before he is back, standing in the queue for another loan.This is Part 3 of our series, #BeingAFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh while Part 2 examined how big-ticket projects cheat farmers out of their land."

Keep lying and mislead people. Make good gimmicks. (They say) Sab ka sath sab ka vikas. Now, it is sab ka sath sab ka satyanash, he said. Aiyar was speaking at a symposium organised by the Telangana Congress on Indian Agriculture  Contribution of Smt Indira Gandhi and a review of present scenario as part of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhis birth centenary celebrations.The minimum support price (MSP) for farmers this year has come down compared to last year, Aiyar claimed. Sixty per cent of Indias population is in agriculture. What is their condition? I will tell you the condition. Indiraji started Minimum Support Price.That means, you (farmer) should get more than this. If that is not available, we will support you. Arhar  MSP is Rs 5,050 per quintal. It is being sold at Rs 2,700, he said. Giving out figures, he claimed that other crops like garlic, onion, potato are also being sold at a price less than last years price.The input costs in agriculture have increased substantially thus offsetting any rise in price for the produce, he said. They say we will get (farmers) income doubled. How will you double? This helpless man goes to market and sees that his expenditure is rising. Somebody told me that there is a 700 per cent rise in expenditure of inputs compared to 1991, Aiyar said.Recalling that Rajiv Gandhi, when he was Prime Minister in the 1980s, personally visited villages during a crisis in agriculture, he alleged that the present government spoke only rhetoric.Hailing the leadership of Indira Gandhi in improving agriculture in the country, the Congress leader said she was instrumental in the success of Green Revolution. C Subramaniam (Agriculture Minister), MS Swaminathan (scientist) and Sivaraman (bureaucrat) made stellar contributions to green revolution then, but incumbent Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh suggested doing Yoga as a way to address distress in agriculture, he said.Under the present NDA regime, situation in Kashmir worsened and Indias relations with neighbouring countries like Pakistan, China, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have suffered, Aiyar claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Besides, the government will also waive over 7 lakh NPAs, incurring a total expenditure of Rs 36,359 crore.UP has around 2.30 crore farmers of which 92.5 per cent (2.15 crore) are small and marginal who will stand benefitted with the cabinet decision. The state government will have to bear a burden over around Rs 36,000 crore to repay these loans on farmers behalf to various banks including cooperative.We will raise the waived amount through the States own resources by floating Kisan Rahat Bonds in the wake of the provisions of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, said government spokesman Siddharth Nath Singh while addressing mediapersons after the States first Cabinet meeting.As per the FRBM Act provisions, the States fiscal deficit cannot be more than three per cent of its GDP. So we have tried to balance the fiscal deficit by raising the money through Kisan Rahat bonds, Singh maintained.He, however, clarified that the decision would be implemented immediately after getting it passed in the upcoming budget session of the State Assembly. The other major proposal to get the Cabinets approval was setting up of 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the State.Fulfilling its other poll promise, the Yogi cabinet moved to set the wheat procurement target of 80 lakh tonne in the current fiscal of which the government aims at purchasing 40 lakh tonne in the first phase. The State government has made the provision of giving Rs 10 per quintal as loading charge over the MSP of Rs 1625 per quintal to the farmers. It has been made clear that at the procurement centres, all the purchases will be done by the farmers themselves instead of the involvement of any middleman.The money will directly be credited to the bank accounts of the farmers on the basis of their Aadhar Card, said the government spokesman. Prominent among other major proposals approved by Yogi cabinet, included cabinets stamp on regularisation of illegal slaughterhouses. The state government claimed that it had closed down only 26 illegal slaughterhouses across the state so far. While it decided to redress the issues related to licensing process and renewal of expired licences of meat sellers, the cabinet reiterated its resolve to implement SC order and the recommendations of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in letter and spirit in curb the illegal meat trade in the state. Apart from approving the phenomenon of anti-romeo Squads for the safety of women, the Cabinet also set up a three-member ministerial committee to take care of the interest of potato growers."

By nominating Kumar the Opposition has presented a logic which Kumar cannot dismiss: That Meira Kumar, the daughter of Jagjivan Ram, who is as accomplished in governance as Kovind and more so a Bihari, was much more worthy of the CMs support.Read the story hereOpinion: Presidential election: BJPs strategy to divide Dalits receives boostHas the Opposition walked into the BJP trap by fielding former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar against Ram Nath Kovind? Their presidential candidate is a Jatav and the NDAs a non-Jatav Dalit. In the recent assembly polls in UP, the saffron party had gained immensely by drawing a wedge between non-Jatavs and the dominant Jatav sub-caste aligned with the Bahujan Samaj Party. The other OBCs and most backward communities were similarly mobilized against the Yadavs broadly committed to the Samajwadi PartyWhat gave Kovinds candidature an extra-edge in the BJPs scheme was the Koli communitys substantial presence in Maharashtra and Gujarat.Read the story hereISROs PSLV-C38, carrying 31 satellites, lifts off from SriharikotaISROs workhorse rocket PSLV-38 blasted off on Friday from the spaceport at Sriharikota carrying the Cartosat-2 series satellite - a dedicated satellite for the defence forces - along with 30 co-passenger satellites.

Gurmukh Singh, 44, is one of better-to-do farmers of Pandrali, a quiet, well-groomed village in Fatehgarh Sahib district with several newly-built houses, smooth streets and girls on scooters. Its a picture that could well be captioned prosperous Punjab. But the genteel faade hides the struggles of the states farming community.I am a farmer, have never done anything else, but its not sustainable any longer, Gurmukh clears his throat. A former village head, he is clearly uneasy about sharing his troubles with strangers. The price of potato, the crop he grew on part of the land hes leased, has crashed. It means more debt for he has to pay a rent of Rs 40,000 for an acre though his potato crop has fetched him only Rs 25,000. This is what happens when you diversify, he fumes.This week, the Punjab government announced a waiver of crop loans up to Rs 2 lakh for small and marginal farmers (up to five acres). Gurmukh is relieved that he falls in this bracket but wishes the government had announced a complete loan waiver. I know the state has limited funds, but the Centre should rescue farmers, he opines.Like most farmers in the state, this matriculate grows wheat and paddy, the two crops with a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP). Paddy has leached the land of water leading to fears of desertificationthe water table at Pandrali has breached 70 feet, and is falling at the rate of three feet a yearyet farmers refuse to grow other crops. I have tried turmeric, sugarcane, maize and vegetables, but marketing is a problem. The sugarcane mills dont pay us for months and prices of other crops are erratic, explains Gurmukh.RISING COST OF PRODUCTIONBut now even the MSP of the two main crops, he rues, is becoming unviable due to the spiralling cost of inputs. Its simple maths. In 1992, says Gurmukh, diesel cost Rs 4-5 a litre, a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) Rs 200, while wheat cost Rs 5 a kilo. Now while diesel is pegged at Rs 58 a litre and DAP is 1100 for a sack, but wheat has failed to keep pace at Rs 16 a kilo. Add to it the cost of boring tubewells every year due to the dipping water level, the steeply priced pesticides scarcely used in the past, and the cost of labour from UP and Bihar in the absence of local helping hands, says Gurmukh, explaining the high cost of production. A bore costs anywhere between Rs 10,000 and 1 lakh.Watch | Farmers have to borrow money to farmGroundwater irrigates over 73% of land in the state. This has led to a sharp decline in the water table. According to the Central Ground Water Board, of the 138 administrative blocks in Punjab, 110 blocks are overexploited, four are critical and two are semi-critical. Only 22 blocks are safe, but they have other problems such as arsenic, fluoride and uranium contamination.One reason for the indiscriminate use of groundwater is free electricity for farmers introduced in 1999. Also, the Punjab government hasnt placed any restriction on the depth of tubewells. Nor does one need any permission to dig up a well.Inadequate rainfall in the last few years is only increasing the general dependence on groundwater. The year 2014 was very rough on us, so was 2015, recounts Gurmukh. In 2015, Punjab received only 50% of the monsoon rainfall, and the next year it was 36%.Little wonder then that any mention of digging up Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal to provide water to Haryana raises hackles. The Bhakra canal flows 1.5 km from here; the Sirhind feeder and Narwana branch are also close but all the water flows to Haryana and Rajasthan, gripes a friend of Gurmukh.Haryana, he claims, also has the job advantage as it borders both Chandigarh and Delhi. They have benefited from industrialisation and the Gurgaon boom, says Gurmukh, adding how a working man drawing a salary of 35,000 a month is better off than a farmer who owns 10 acres.Haryana also offers a better market price for alternative crops such as sunflower. It fetches Rs 25,000 per quintal in Punjab while in Haryana it gets Rs 35,000, says Gurmukh.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The crop prices show no signs of increasing but land rental rates are going through the roof and range between 40,000 and 45,000 an acre in the district. With farming becoming unviable, more and more small farmers are leasing out their land instead of toiling on it. These landlords seek a rise of 10% every year regardless of any natural calamity or price crash, grouses Gurmukh. He recalls 2015 when he was forced to sell his export-grade Basmati (PB 1509) to the Food Corporation of India after the prices crashed from Rs 4,500 a quintal in 2014 to 1700 in 2015.Ask Gurmukh why he takes so much land on lease, and he points to his machinery. I have a tractor, a seed sower, a land leveler, a roller et al. I need land to make the most of them. Also, there is the lure of a good crop and the pressure of repaying the debt.Demonetisation dealt a heavy blow to Gurmukh who wanted to repay a crop loan. I had just sold my crop and deposited two lakh in my bank but I could only withdraw 5,000 a week. Somehow the little sums of money I took out were spent elsewhere while the interest on my loan piled up.Gurmukh Singh with daughter Gurpreet Kaur and wife Ranjeet Kaur in his House in Pandriali village in Sirhind district, Punjab. (Ravi Kumar/HT Photo)THE DEBT TRAPIn 2007, Gurmukh took a loan of Rs 5 lakh to build his house. While the house loan was from a bank, most of his other loans are from commission agents (arhtiya or the middlemen) who charge a higher rate of interest than banks. But Gurmukh appears resigned to working with them. Here is the reason: In Punjab, a farmer cannot sell his produce in the open market at the prevailing price. He can only sell it to commission agents under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act, 1961. A few days back, the Congress government passed an amendment to the act, allowing private players to set up mandis to purchase farm produce. But Gurmukh is yet to learn about it.As of now, the middleman also doubles up as a dealer of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers. So farmers not only sell their produce to him, but also purchase their inputs from him, often on credit.Milked dry Farmers in the grain bowl of the country, Punjab, are a distressed lot Rs 69,335 crore Rural debt Rs 5.5 lakh Per capita rural household debt 98% Area under irrigation 110 out of 138 blocks are water dark zones (water table dangerously low) 1.6% Rate of agri growth in Punjab from 2004-05 to 2014-15 1.5% Punjabs share of Indias total area FARMER SUICIDES6,926 No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*1,309 Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016Despite being a farmers daughter and wife, Ranjeet doesnt think highly of farming.

The young woman, who stitches her clothes herself, may not be sure about her career path, but she is clear that her husband will not be a farmer. No way, she declares. Its too risky. No matter how hard you work, there is no guarantee of profit.Youngsters in the village, she claims, want to either get a job or go abroad. Farming is an option only for the uneducated.Jagtar Singh, Gurmukhs man Friday who works on his land for Rs 1 lakh a year, agrees. In farming, you throw money for six months and then dont know whether you will get it back or not. A salaried job is better.The only person who appears contented in the fields is Harendra Kumar from Motihari district in Bihar, who is here with his team of 10 labourers. We will sow paddy, he explains as he arranges ladoos for a pooja before they begin work. He explains, We pray for a bumper crop, our wellbeing and that of sardar ji.Amen to that."

DH PhotoI hit the crocodile with all my might to save myself, said a cheerful Mudit Dandwate, who survived a crocodile attack on Sunday morning at Thattakere lake in Anekal, 38 km from the city.Recollecting the incident, the 26-year-old said it was around 7.45 am and everything (the combat) was over in a few a seconds. I had gone with my friend and my two dogs Potato and Pi to the lake. I had a very busy week and wanted to de-stress. So my friend and I decided to go on a trip. We would normally go cycling, trekking or driving around Bengaluru. But this one was not planned, he said.As Dandwate and his friend entered the lake, a crocodile chewed off his left hand.The road to the lake was partially tarred. We parked the car two kilometres away from the temple and started walking. As soon as Potato (his black Labrador) saw water, he ran to take a plunge. Worried about his safety, I went behind him. I did not realise that the lake had crocodiles in it. When I was playing with Potato and trying to bring him out of the lake, the crocodile caught hold my arm.Initially, I did not realise what had happened. But when its teeth started piercing my hand, I got scared and I started to fight back. I punched the crocodile with my right hand on its jaw as hard as I could. I was angry, hurt and scared. I wanted to be alive. As soon its grip loosened slightly, I ran out of the lake as fast as I could, he said. He said he did see some boards at the lake but they were in Kannada and had no visuals.Dandwate, a mechanical engineer and head of Turtle Child Technology, a healthcare startup, added that he took off his shirt and tied it tightly around his hand to prevent blood loss and to remain conscious.My friend and I then sought the help of forest officials. I gave them my car keys and asked them to drive us out of there. They took care of Potato, Pi and my friend. They rushed me to Sagar Hospital. After getting initial treatment, I contacted my friend Dr Anjana Reddy in Hosmat Hospital. I was then shifted to Hosmat, he said.I will start going to office once I am out of here, he added.Family, friends happyDandwates parents, sister and friends had a big smile on their faces as they saw him narrate the incident cheerfully. My son survived a crocodile attack because of the blessings of the Almighty and his dear ones. I am very proud of my brave boy. He did not panic and has been smiling all through, said Rekha Dandwate, his mother. Dandwates parents S P Dandwate, Rekha and his sister Manali rushed to Bengaluru on Sunday evening when they learnt of the incident. His friends recollect that they have been on many trips together. They are planning their next trip after Dandwate is discharged.Friend designing prosthetic armGaurav Parchani, Dandwates friend and colleague said he was working on creating a prosthetic arm for his friend. Though Mudit himself is designing one for himself, I too am designing one which will be as close to a normal human hand as possible. I want to ensure Mudit has no problem and can carry on with his daily chores as comfortably as possible. With him designing one, he will have two, he said. Help from doctors and other experts will also be taken, Parchani said.Doctor speaksDr Ajit Benedict Royan, medical director, Hosmat Hospital said Dandwate will be discharged by Saturday if his tissue culture and other reports come out positive. We want to ensure that he has no other ailment or infection and the swelling reduces. The prosthetic arm will be attached after three weeks when his wounds have completely healed and swelling is not there, he said. The doctors said he was walking around and had also started working from the hospital."

The issue of Central contribution to the revolving fund created to support market interventions for price stabilisation of perishable agricultural commodities was raised during the meeting of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister SN Patro with Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi.The Centre has been allocating food grains to Odisha based on the 2011 Census. Meanwhile, population of the State has grown by four to five per cent during the last six years as is evident from the trends of decadal growth rate in Odisha from the Census report.I requested the Union Minister to increase the upper ceiling of Odisha by 15 lakh individuals for coverage of left out eligible population into NFSA fold keeping in view the projected population growth from 2011 to 2017 and more importantly, the backwardness of the State with higher density of Scheduled category people, Patro told this paper after the meeting.The State has been allotted rice for 3,26,41,800 out of States total population of 4,19,74,218 under NFSA in priority household, Annapurna Anna Yojana and Antyodaya Anna Yojana, Patro said.The upper ceiling for the State has been determined at 82.17 per cent of rural population and 55.77 per cent of urban population with reference to the NSS household consumption survey data for 2011-12 available with Planning Commission.Projecting the population figure of the State at 436.50 lakh, Patro urged the Union Minister to fix the upper ceiling for the State at Rs 340.49 lakh against Rs 326.41 lakh fixed by the Centre.Since there is no provision of auto inclusion under NFSA, Paswan said his Ministry is planning to bring an amendment in the Act in next session of the Parliament.Patro further requested Paswan to release the Central share of Rs 50 crore to the States revolving fund created for market intervention to save farmers from distress sale of perishable agri-horticultural commodities, like potato and onion.The State has created a corpus of Rs 100 crore under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) scheme of the Centre for the purpose.

While earlier forms of adulteration, including mixing sand, marble chips, stones, chalk powder and brick powder with spice and food grain were harmful to the digestive system, doctors warn plastic rice can increase risk of cancer by 15-20 per cent, apart from wreaking havoc on digestive and reproductive system. If consumed regularly, plastic rice can choke the intestine, leading to bloating and acute stomach ache. This will require surgical intervention too, doctors said.Plastic rice can either be made from potato carved in shape of rice grain and covered with a coating of cheap plastic or made in shape of rice granules carved out of plastic sheets. In either case, consumption can trigger havoc in the digestive system. ""While other forms of adulteration like mixing sand or crushed stones are easier to spot and sift, plastic rice is not only difficult to differentiate from real rice, but also affects digestive enzymes.It can even cause changes in the hormonal system and affect the entire reproductive system,"" said Dr Sudarshan Reddy , general physician at Continental Hospital.Worse, diagnose is delayed as doctors fail to pinpoint the cause of gastritis. It's only when patients don't respond to antibiotics that adulteration and poisoning is suspected as cause ,"" said Dr Reddy.Doctors, meanwhile, point out how plastic rice is the worst form of food adulteration as it is present in hard granular form of plastic, which is difficult to cook.""It's in fact worse than thin plastic bags consumed by stray animals as thick plastic in the shape of rice is very difficult to digest. When mixed with rice, it effectively contaminates rice and decreases nutrient value. It is also very tough on the digestive system and even the gastric juices can only digest 5-10%,"" said Dr B Prabhakar, gastroenterologist, Apollo Hospital."

Both are thugs,"" said Vivek Sharma, state convenor of the farmers' body staging the dharna.The agitating farmers also took a dig at Nitish for organising Kisan Samagam programme at S K Memorial by ignoring their plight. ""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme. Such programmes are just aimed at deceiving the common people and ignoring serious issues,"" said Awadhesh Nandan Sharma , district president of the farmers' outfit.Earlier this week, Nitish had slammed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to resolve the nationwide farmers' protest. ""Farmers are in a bad condition, but the central government is indifferent to them. The government's failure to enforce MSP for farm produces has forced the farmers to protest. The country has been facing an agrarian crisis due to the low price of farm produces,"" Nitish had said on the sidelines of his Lok Samvad programme on Monday.In Friday's protest, the farmers demanded minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre for milk, Rs 100 per kilogram for pulses, Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy and Rs 4,000 per quintal for wheat.""RJD chief Lalu Prasad never fails to term himself garibo ka neta, but he never supports milkmen, his traditional vote base,"" said Vivek."

Farmers say there is no point selling the produce as they are not even able to get back their investment due to the low price. It is estimated that around 6 crore sacks of 50 kg each, totaling 30 lakh ton, are stored in Agra region alone. State horticulture department has now appealed to farmers not to hoard the tuber. Recently government determined minimum support price for procurement of potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal, but farmers said it is too low to benefit them.There are around 240 cold storage units in Agra. All of them are completely filled with potatoes, with farmers refusing to take them out till the prices become better.According to horticulture department officials, In August the potato crop of Karnataka will hit the market. This may result in a sudden fall in the price of the stored potatoes. Therefore farmers in the state have been advised to continue selling the stored produce to avoid even worse losses.Potato is a major crop in the district, cultivated in around 72,000 hectares of land. Agra division, which includes Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri, is one of the major producers of the tuber, which is supplied to states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.District horticulture officer Anita Singh said, ""The current potato prices are much lower than in previous years. In the near future, there is no significant scope for increase in potato prices. To avoid major losses, farmers should slowly continue to sell their produce. Depending on quality, the present market rate of potato is Rs 300 to 600 per quintal whereas it should be between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per quintal.""According to department officials, increased in production of potato and a stop on supply to Pakistan and some other neigbouring countries is one of the reasons behind the drop in prices.Rakesh Goyal, secretary of Agra Cold Storage Association said, ""Compared to previous years, this time around 12% more potato came for storage. But due to low prices, few farmers are taking away their produce.""According to market experts, till June 20 around 25% of the produce should have been sold. But business has witnessed fall of 12%.Khandoli farmer Sharvan Singh said, ""Government has turned farmers into a joke. The minimum support price is not reasonable at all. It doesn't even pay for the investment we made in the crop.""Agra Potato Business Association general secretary Aamir Bhai said, ""Ever since demonetization, business has continued to be derailed. Farmers will be forced to throw their produce on the roads, but the government does not seem to be concerned.""Farmer Gyan Singh Sikarwar said, ""Next year I will not produce potato at any cost. I am thinking of sowing some other crop but that needs money too. I already have a pending loan of Rs 5,000 and banks have told us we will not get further loan till the previous ones are waived by the government."""

Though potato dealers are not sure about the exact GST, which will imposed, they apprehend that it could be between 20%-28%. Nijjar said presently there was no VAT or duty on farm machinery, but they apprehend that the government could impose 28% GST on farm implements used for potato cultivation.Stating that presently there was nil duty on agriculture implements, Nijjar said that if the tax structure of GST was not corrected it could destroy the future of lakhs of people directly and indirectly involved in the potato industry.""First it was demonetization that took a toll on the farmers and dealers, and now the GST,"" said J P Singh Gill , another office-bearer of JPGA. He said that in Punjab more than 25 lakh tonnes of potato seed was used annually, especially in Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and a few districts of Malwa ""It's strange that the government gives 25% subsidy on setting up cold chain, cold storage and tissue culture labs but it has proposed to levy 28% GST,"" said Gill. Nijjar added that they had urged the Centre to exempt the industry from the GST. ""If at all the government is keen to impose the GST, it shouldn't be more than 5%,"" he maintained."

These efforts have included hectic parleys with the Swiss authorities.With its long-standing banking secrecy walls crumbling under global pressure, Switzerland has finally agreed to share tax information on automatic basis with several countries including India, but wants adherence to strict data protection and privacy requirements.Officials from the Switzerland government and leading groupings of Swiss banks told PTI that data protection and a level playing field need to be ensured by India and other jurisdictions with whom the AEOI regime would be implemented.The Association of Swiss Private Banks said the main concerns with respect to AEOI relate to data protection and level playing field.""We would like to ensure that bank data that will be transmitted in 2019 is used for tax verification purposes only... if data received from another country has been misused in a jurisdiction, Switzerland is unlikely to send data to that jurisdiction,"" the grouping's manager Jan Langlo told PTI from Geneva.The Geneva-based association has nine member banks employing around 7,500 people worldwide, as per its website.On whether there are any particular concerns related to India with respect to privacy and protection of data, Lango replied in the negative.""We have no particular concern over India, where the rule of law seems to be properly upheld,"" Lango added.Further, the association said that since Switzerland would start exchanging data one year later than most other countries, the banks would be able to verify that the other financial centres also exchange with India and the 40 other jurisdictions.A Swiss government official said that if states do not meet certain requirements of the standard, then the Federal Council would suspend AEOI.While emphasising that banks agreed to the plan of the government, SIF (State Secretariat for International Financial Matters) spokesperson Frank Wettstein from Berne said banks there only had concerns about the way the AEOI is activated and wanted to do so only only with jurisdictions that are sure to fulfil the requirements of the standard.""The Swiss authorities will make sure that the partner states meet the requirements of the standard. If not, the Federal Council will suspend the AEOI according to the MCAA,"" Wettstein told PTI.The exchange of information would be based on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on AEOI, which is in turn based on the international standard for the exchange of information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Asserting that the banks in Switzerland are fully committed to implement AEOI, Swiss Bankers' Association (SBA) said the banks have suggested a specific clause for data protection, security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness.SBA's Head of Public Relations Sindy Schmiegel told PTI from Basel that for reasons of data protection and data security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness, the banks have suggested a specific clause which demands that the federal council verifies that these two factors are considered.""This clause will be integrated in Swiss legal provisions to implement the AEOI. India is one of many other countries and not addressed in particular,"" Schmiegel said.SBA has around 296 institutional members and thousands of individual members.The Swiss Federal Council would soon notify India about the exact date from which the automatic exchange would begin.Besides, the council would prepare a situation report before the first exchange of data with India and other jurisdictions.The Association of Swiss Private Banks is also in ""close contact"" with Swiss authorities to better understand how the standard must be implemented and to ensure consistency with the other financial centres.""Of particular concern is the reluctance of the United States to apply the OECD standard, since their FATCA agreements provide other countries with far less information,"" Lango noted.The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is aimed at ensuring that details of financial assets of American citizens are available to the US authorities."

5a0494419855b76bf13bdf22,Farmers’ ire not about loans alone,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-ire-not-about-loans-alone/articleshow/59078066.cms,2017-06-09,"The farmers'agitation in MP, and before that in Maharashtra, has pushed a simmering agrarian crisis into the spotlight.Earlier, the newly elected UP government announced a loan waver for small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra government said it was exploring the possibility. The Centre itself had announced that it would strive to double farmers' incomes by 2022. All these were raising expectations of farmers, especially after enjoying a good monsoon and record harvest in 2016-17, after two consecutive years of drought.Yet why are farmers - the lifeline of India - angry and resentful?One of the key factors fuelling agrarian anger is that good year or bad year, they are unable to earn enough. There is always a mismatch between their cost of production and what they get in the mandis. A quick comparison of cost of production and farm harvest prices as data collected by the agriculture ministry reveals the mismatch for 2014-15, the last year for which such information is available.In several states, for several widely cultivated produce like paddy and wheat, prices at which farmers are selling their harvest are actually lower than what they spent in cultivating the crop. In Madhya Pradesh, the epicenter of current agitation, paddy was fetching 15% less than cost of production while wheat was giving them just 2% profit.MP has emerged as a major player on the national scene exhibiting an agricultural growth rate of 9.7% between 2005-06 and 2014-15 compared to 3.6% for India as a whole. Share of agriculture in MP's gross state domestic product has increased from 25% to over 30% in this period. Area under vegetables and fruits has increased by 78% since 2010-11. According to a study done by Ashok Gulati and his colleagues at ICRIER, expanded irrigation, strong procurement system for wheat and bonus over its minimum support price and expansion of all-weather roads to connect farmers to markets have led to this boom in agriculture.Yet, after enjoying the boom for several years, the state's farmers have ended up in the same trap that has been haunting their brethren in other states. The reason why farmers don't get suitable margins is because of their input costs  water, diesel, fertiliser, etc. For cultivating wheat in MP, Rs 1,241.34 were spent on fertilisers per hectare in 2004-05 which has more than doubled to Rs 2,695.27 per hectare in 2014-15. Similarly, cost of seeds used in one hectare increased from Rs 998 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,653 in 2014-15. Even cost of irrigation has jumped from Rs 1,961.50 to Rs 2,599.55 in this period. These and other costs like labour, agricultural machinery hiring charges, pesticides, rents, have all gone up while prices that farmers get have lagged behind.As recently reported, support prices may be higher than what farmers get but getting payments is so difficult that farmers often have to sell to traders at lower prices. This dire situation is also causing mounting indebtedness of farmers with over half of agricultural households in debt as per an NSSO survey for 2012-13. MP was reported to have 46% debt ridden farmers.Should farmers diversify to get more value for their crops? This would appear to be a way out except that even in those cases, farmers' margins plummet after some time. UP's potato farmers were getting a measly 5% profit, while in Punjab, cotton farmers have suffered enormous losses of as much as 20%."
