Food costs around 30% more in AC restaurants.Now that AC restaurants will have 18% GST , even those seated in non-AC sections, which is common among 60% restaurants in Mumbai region, will also have to pay 18%, hoteliers said on Wednesday.Taxation on tentative average pricing in city restaurants in the GST regime suggests that average Mumbaikars eating in non-AC sections will have to pay a lot, leaving not much of a difference in pricing between them and those in AC restaurants.The hotel industry is angry over basic differentiation being made between AC and non-AC, arguing that AC is a necessity and not a luxury in Mumbai, as even local trains are going AC. GST is applicable only on food, and not liquor.Adarsh Shetty, president of Ahar, an association of over 8,000 restaurants in Mumbai, want a uniform 12% tax on all restaurants/bars to avoid disparity. In non-AC restaurants only, the benefit of 12% GST will be passed on, but there are only 20% such restaurants.""Manmohan Singh, as Union finance minister, had announced in his budget speech withdrawal of hotel expenditure tax, citing that in a city like Mumbai, AC was a necessity due to humid conditions. We have moved back in time now even after almost 25 years of development, when Metros are coming up all over the country with AC comfort,"" said Adarsh.""The same facility is not considered a luxury in other businesses, such as pharmacy. This is a legacy of the past wherein the government, unable to define restaurant sales as a service, surreptitiously decide to levy a service tax on AC restaurants,"" said another hotelier and former Ahar secretary Sukesh Shetty.Sukesh said a uniform 12% will avoid complications and make compliance easier. He said an additional 6% tax would be a pinch on commoners, who avoid AC sections. Adarsh said in most restaurants, non-AC sections have more seats.'Chakna to take a hit'Chakna' (snacks) during liquor consumption will cost you more. The GST Council announced a 12% rate for Indian traditional namkeen, savories, farsan, potato chips and banana chips. The rate should be reduced to 5% to maintain uniformity with the rate for sweets, the Snack Food Association of Maharashtra has demanded. The rate for namkeen is double the present tax but industry hardly receives any input credit as its raw materials are agro-based. There is no tax on raw materials like potato, banana, maida, besan, salt and pulses. There is only a marginal tax on masala. Namkeen and sweets are sold from the same shop and are inter-related products for the common man. With 12% GST, the effective prices of all products will increase by 6-8%, the association said."

This is the second type of assistance announced by the state government. The government had earlier announced a transport subsidy for potato farmers Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, while speaking to reporters, said that the state government has implemented a new scheme and has allocated Rs 100 crore to provide assistance of Rs 1 per kg and Rs 50 per 50-kg gunny bag to farmers growing potatoes or onions.In Gujarat, the total potato produce is about 39 lakh metric tons and that of onions is about 10 lakh metric tons. Patel said that a committee headed by him had been formed to assist farmers growing potato and onion. The committee also has the agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya, health minister Shankar Chaudhary, minister of state for agriculture Vallabh Vaghasiya and irrigation minister Nanu Vanani.Patel said the committee decided that the government should also provide assistance to farmers who have restored their potato and onion produce in cold storages. Apart from this, the farmer will get Rs 1 per kg for exporting the produce from the state.Officials said that if a farmer sells 300 quintals of the crop in Gujarat he will get Rs 30,000 as subsidy. If he sells the same amount outside Gujarat, he will get an additional export subsidy of Rs 30,000.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association, said, ""This subsidy will be come as a major relief for farmers who decided to stock their crop for lack of a good price. This subsidy will help farmers to at least make good their storage cost.Sources said that the subside was announced keeping in view the election scheduled for later this year. Many farmers who had failed to get remunerative prices for their crops had earlier this month thrown their produce on the streets."

After a hectic week at work, he was headed towards Anekal for the weekend getaway.""I parked my car and began walking with a friend and his pets. I didn't know that it was a protected forest area, and I didn't mean to go there. I don't remember seeing any board there signaling that to be a protected area. I may have walked about 2 kilometres when this lake opened up before us. This place was gated, but the gate was open because of the temple inside it,"" he recalls.The horror that followed lasted less than two minutes when Potato and Pi ran into the water and Mudit rushed behind them. ""I was concerned about them and tried to get them out of water. That's when I sensed that something had attacked my left hand. I soon noticed a crocodile ripping away at my hand and tried to push its teeth and jaw away with my right hand,"" he says. Mudit was only in 3-ft deep water and on the edge of the lake. Within seconds, he was out of the water as the crocodile retreated. ""I sat on the banks. Realizing that blood was dripping out of my arm, I tore my shirt and tied up the wounded portion with it,"" he says.Mudit called Dr Anjana Reddy, a resident doctor at Hosmat and family friend. She advised Mudit to go to a private hospital near Bannerghatta Road and get first aid before coming to Hosmat.""Two forest guards, who rushed there, helped me. I gave them the key of my car and they dropped me to a private hospital on Bannerghatta Road,"" recalls Mudit.Though the forest department has filed a case against Mudit on charges of trespassing the protected forest area, the family has not been communicated about the same.Mudit's mother Rekha Dandwate says she is proud of her son. ""Imagine he fought with a crocodile and survived. He himself called us at 11.15am and explained what he had gone through. He is positive, he is a fighter. I appreciate his presence of mind at that juncture,"" she says.Mudit's father Sadanand Dandwate, a central government employee, is all smiles as his son is on path to recovery. ""He is brave, he will rock,"" he says. Dr Ajit Benedict Royan, vice-president of Hosmat Hospital, said Mudit would be discharged in five days.Friend working on custom-made automated handBengaluru: Mudit Dandwate may soon be able to forget the havoc the crocodile wrecked. His partner in his healthcare startup, Gaurav Prachani, is already working on a custom-made prosthetic hand to be attached to his left hand that has been bitten off by the crocodile.The arm is likely to have buttons near the elbow, pressing which the prosthetic fingers can be moved unlike the conventional ones available.Mudit, a mechanical engineer from IIT Bombay, is looking for a detachable prosthetic hand.""I am thinking of a prototype that can function like a human hand, with the nerves connected to sensors. We are working on multiple solutions. The prosthetic hand can be put in only after 3-4 weeks,"" said Gaurav.According to Dr Priyadarshan K, senior plastic surgeon of Hosmat hospital, who operated on Mudit, there's a German product called Ottobok that works through high-end technology. ""In this bionic hand, electrodes are put inside the elbow muscles. When the muscles contract, the fingers get activated, as the brain senses the muscle movement in fore arm. To get used to this, he has to relearn the movements. This product is expensive, ranging from Rs 8-16 lakh depending on its characteristics. It is costly in terms of maintenance,"" he said."

Some had problems with online registration as the GSTN site kept crashing throughout the day while others had to contend with software changes. But none knew how, or how much, to charge?For sweet shop owners in the city, billing was arduous. The GST rates for milk sweets like rosgolla, rasmalai and ghee-roasted sweets like carrot halwa are quite different under the new structure.""We have checked with our tax consultant, but still it is confusing. For instance, milk sweets like basundi, sandesh are coming under 5% tax, but if we choose to coat them with silver foil we would have to pay a tax of 18-20%,"" said Vignesh Kaur of K C Das Sweets. ""Likewise, rosogolla, rasmallai should be at 5%, but if we add kesar it would go up to 18-20%. Then again any chocolate-coated item is taxed at 28%,"" he said.At supermarket chains like Sri Murugan Stores , confusion was more pronounced. ""Tax on snacks like aloo bhujia, potato chips, samosa, kachori is 12%. Now the tax rate for cashews is 5%, but I can't figure out if masala cashew is a snack or a standalone item,"" said Rajarathinam, owner, Sri Murugan Stores.Such problems pervaded all and sundry. For instance, at Landmark Group , which has more than 250 franchisees, billing has been stopped at smaller outlets.""We are yet to figure out the rates for many of the items on the inventory list. Many of our smaller outlets in Kerala and Tamil Nadu have stopped billing. We have advised our franchisees to convert to tally to avoid confusion -- some of them still use local software for billing,"" said CEO of Landmark Group Jerry Mathews.But sales have been excellent despite the problems. ""We have had bumper sales. Usually June is a busy month because of back-to-school sales. But this June, GST clearance sales were higher than New Year, Christmas and Onam sales,"" said Mathews.Heavy sales were also seen at Future Group chain Big Bazaar. ""We sold goods worth more than Rs 10 crore with 1.2 lakh footfalls at 40 outlets throughout India. GST will not be a deterrent to sales at least at the bigger outlets,"" said a spokesperson of Future Group."

5a0510f79855b76bf13bf739,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadership",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/618481/agri-sector-seeking-vigour-fresh.html,2017-06-21,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadershipDH News Service Jun 21 2017, 2:14 ISTIn January-February, as the election campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were picking up steam, Home Minister Rajnath Singh first broached the topic of farm loan waiver if the BJP came to power. Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."
5a05169b9855b76bf13bf9e6,Farm protest rages across India,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617965/farm-protest-rages-across-india.html,2017-06-18,"Devinder Sharma, Jun 18 2017, 1:06 ISTAgrarian crisis: Only a holistic, pragmatic policy can end the tragedy unfolding in rural areas since decadesFarmers anger is spilling over. The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"

Potato prices slipped more than 44% and onion too went down close to 13%.Protein items such as eggs, meat and fish also declined over 1% year-on-year in May. Only cereals in the food basket saw an uptick in prices. Pulses got cheaper.The new figures are based on the base year 2011-12. The base year was revised last month in order to reflect numbers more accurately.There was deflation in the fruit basket to the tune (-)0.73%.Commenting on the WPI based inflation numbers industry body Ficci said, the trend in inflation is in line with the broad expectations - both wholesale and retail prices remain benign. Food inflation has softened considerably over the past couple of months. Further, with global commodity prices remaining subdued and the monsoon this year expected to be normal, inflation should continue to be within RBIs comfort zone.The central bank has revised downwards its own projection for inflation in the months ahead. I think the case for supporting growth is getting stronger and we hope that RBI will take a relook into its monetary policy stance in the light of these new numbers. We need to boost investments and growth, which is so essential for employment generation across the economy."

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

5a05a8d19855b76bf13c0971,Pepsi spices up Bengal menu,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170610/jsp/business/story_156081.jsp,2017-06-10,"Niteen Pradhan (right) with Jagrut Kotecha in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta, June 9: Bengal has emerged as the first destination for PepsiCo to churn out its entire range of snacks in India with the launch of the nacho chips line at its Sankrail factory in Howrah. The company has invested Rs 100 crore to manufacture Doritos - one of the billion-dollar brands of the American food and beverage giant - from the Bengal unit that produces all the other snacks Pepsi sells in India. The installed capacity of the new line, tucked inside the factory located on National Highway 6, will be 3,000 tonnes per annum - enough to meet the initial demand of the product. Explaining the rational of the fresh investment in the plant, Niteen Pradhan, vice-president (supply chain & operation) of PepsiCo India, said it was logical for Pepsi to choose Sankrail. ""It is one of the best we have globally in terms of capabilities. Close proximity to the source of corn also helped,"" Pradhan said after the launch of Doritos in Calcutta today. Pepsi, which works with 12,000 potato farmers in Bengal to manufacture Lays potato chips, is sourcing two special varieties of corn from Bihar's Purnea. Going forward, the company may procure from West Dinajpur district in north Bengal. ""We are always keen to procure raw material close to the plant. As volume picks up, we hope to start procuring from Bengal too as it would bring down the logistic cost,"" he said. The Sankrail plant, which came up in 2004 at Sudha Ras food park of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, also produces Kurkure and Cheetos - two other snacks from the PepsiCo stable available in India. PepsiCo has 62 manufacturing facilities in India, 43 for beverages and 19 for snacks. However, only a handful of them are owned and operated by the company, the majority being contract manufacturers. Roll-out plans PepsiCo started test marketing imported Doritos in select markets before it started producing from the Bengal plant. Available in two varieties - cheese and sweet chilli - the company plans to leverage its distribution network to reach out to traditional and modern trade in 40 cities, apart from offering online. Jagrut Kotecha, vice-president (snacks) of PepsiCo India, said nachos is the fastest growing category in the Indian salty snacks segment. ""The market size is Rs 200 crore (about 4,000 tonne in terms of volume) and growing by 40-45 per cent,"" he said. Doritos would be the third master brand from PepsiCo in India. ""We have come with three pack sizes, targeting the 18-24 age category in urban and semi-urban localities,"" Kotecha added. Cornitos of Greendot Health Food is the market leader in tortilla corn chips, popularly known as nachos."

VenkatachalapathyBuying vegetables has turned expensive in the Fort city. Vegetable prices are on the rise, as traders say the yield was less, while the demand was more due to auspicious days this month.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the prices would continue to be high for at least the next two months.As of now, the production is less. The prices are shooting up as the demand is high as there are muhurtham days this month. We will have to wait for fresh yield and supply of vegetables to see if the prices dip, he said.On Tuesday, the cost of a few vegetables offered some consolation. Tomato, carrot and beetroot were priced less when compared to other vegetables, he added.A kilo of tomato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while earlier the previous rate was Rs. 20 to Rs. 22. Carrot costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, while beetroot costs Rs. 20. He pointed out that most of the other vegetables were dearer.A kilo of onion cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18, while small onion cost Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 and potato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20. Brinjal (thorny variety) cost Rs. 50 a kilo, while drumstick cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30.Beans were priced high at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 due to poor yield during summer. Green chillies cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 40 a kg due to poor supply this week, he said.The prices of ladys finger was Rs. 25, cauliflower  Rs. 10Rs. 20 per piece, cabbage Rs. 20, radish Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, yam Rs. 40, snake gourd Rs. 15, bitter gourd Rs. 20 and ginger Rs. 30."
5a05fe7b9855b76bf13c2ab8,Adulteration provides food for thought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adulteration-provides-food-for-thought/article19097316.ece,2017-06-18,"Last week, the city witnessed a video of MTC staff purporting to show plastic rice being served in their canteen. The clip, showing men in khaki bouncing small balls of rice off the walls and tables at the canteen of the Ayanavaram bus depot, spread like wildfire on social media. The footage also came close on the heels of information shared on WhatsApp regarding the seizure of alleged plastic rice in other parts of the country.In a State where its own Dairy Development Minister came out with the shocking allegation that private milk producers were adding chemicals to their products, similar claims pertaining to adulteration of rice with plastic seemed ever more probable. So, is there really plastic in rice and sugar, and are there chemicals in milk? Could eggs be made of plastic? Was there any truth to the messages circulating on WhatsApp or were they merely old wives tales that no one in the position of authority was prepared to debunk?As one scare story after another finds prominence through social media platforms, questions are asked, and sometimes answered, with knee-jerk reactions. As adulteration has long remained a tool of choice for unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick buck, only the adulterants have varied with time. Consumer activists point to the need for a proper system capable of answering these questions in a scientific manner, and wherever necessary, allaying rumours and suspicions about food safety that arise periodically among the public.The term plastic rice came into being after a scandal was exposed in China in 2010, in which pellets were made by mixing sweet potato powder with poor quality rice. A resin was found to have been used for the bonding. But this was banned.But in India, although there have been several complaints and allegations of rice being mixed with plastic, tests conducted on so-called plastic rice have conclusively proved that there had been no plastic element in such rice samples, said A. C. Mohan, secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners and Paddy-Rice Dealers Associations.As regards the clips showing rice balls being bounced off the walls, Mr. Mohan said that gelatine, which is found naturally in rice, could make it bouncy if rolled into balls. Boiled rice has more of gelatine, which retains more of its germinal matter. While raw rice varieties including Basmati are not sticky, varieties grown in Tamil Nadu such as Ponni , ADT 36 and Adhisiya Ponni are more sticky than the usual boiled rice. Rubber samba and Maappilai samba are rare varieties that have even more starch and gelatin and are suitable to make kall dosai . These varieties take longer to grow (in some cases six months) and are more healthy, he explained.Federation president D. Thulasingam said that rice merchants were also consumers in the first place, and that they will not sell such adulterated products. Various government agencies had taken samples and conducted tests but so far, no plastic has been found in rice anywhere in the country. Plastic cannot be cooked, it will only melt in the heat. Rice will sink in water, whereas plastic will float. Any home-maker can differentiate between boiled and raw rice by mere feel, smell and sight, he said.It also does not make economic sense to mix plastic with rice, he said. Plastic pellets available in the market are costlier than rice. A kilo of plastic costs anywhere between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100, whereas rice costs Rs. 30-Rs. 60 a kilo. How can someone use a costlier item to make something cheaper? Also, we have at least six months worth of stocks of rice and there is no need for importing rice, let alone plastic rice, Mr. Thulasingam added.R. Kathiravan, designated officer, Food Safety department, Chennai, said that 20 samples of rice were collected and sent for analysis. While 16 of them were sent to the food analysis lab at the King Institute campus in Chennai, four samples were sent to a lab in Thanjavur . Of the 15 results received till date, there has been no evidence of any plastic content in the rice in Chennai, he said.Chemicals in milkUntil a few days ago, milk vendors too had to ward off such queries from consumers after State Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji levelled allegations against certain private milk brands, saying they were adding chemicals to milk.In the wake of the controversy, district administrations stepped in at places such as Madurai and Coimbatore and tested milk samples submitted by the residents. In Madurai, the electronic milk adulteration tests showed that out of 217 samples taken on three different dates in the city and two other locations in the suburbs, 25 samples were found to be of sub-standard quality, while another was found to be unsafe for consumption. District Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that awareness was high among rural people as well.Maheswari of Jawahar Nagar, Thirumangalam, in Madurai, said she purchased milk from a vendor who supplied it in quantities of 100 ml and 150 ml. Since it was not branded, we decided to provide a sample of it for testing and found that it was safe to consume, she added.Madurai-based consumer activist Andrews pointed out that the government officials carried out tests only after the Minister for Dairy Development raised the issue of adulteration, adding that such tests should be conducted on a regular basis. Not just milk, the officials should also carry out periodic tests on all items including oil and rice as there have been complaints of sub-standard goods coming in, he added.Adulteration of milk is being monitored on a monthly basis, said a senior Food Safety department official. Of the samples we collected, only one from Madurai was found to be unsafe, as soap oil had been mixed with it. With regard to the other samples, some were found to be sub-standard  containing water, for instance, in milk, but they were not unsafe in terms of health, he said. While sub-standard milk can attract a penalty, unsafe milk can lead to a case in court, a fine and imprisonment, he noted.A milk industry expert said that so far, in samples lifted by the Food Safety department, only samples of unpackaged milk have been found to contain traces of detergent or soap oil.The soap element may have even been due to improper cleansing of utensils at homes. Private milk producers know that their customers are brand-conscious and loyal to their brands due to certain factors, the most important being quality. At times, when it comes to favoured brands, consumers wont even bother about the cost. Companies will not compromise on quality and end up losing the loyalty of such consumers, he said.However, the Milk Commissionerate has stopped taking samples of milk ever since the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) stepped in and began collecting samples.Plastic eggs scareIn the wake of the recent plastic eggs scare, acting on a State-wide directive and complaints from consumers, checks were conducted on eggs in Coimbatore district. All of the 161 samples collected in April this year were found to be safe. Samples of popular White Leghorn were tested at the government laboratory in Madurai, said O.L.S. Vijay, designated officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.Adulteration not newWith plastics and chemicals prevalent in pretty much everything we use, the adulteration scare is here to stay. In the 1980s food adulteration was something that people had just begun hearing about  it used to mean stones in rice, water in milk, sawdust in tea and brick powder in chilli powder. But all that is pass now.Adulteration has taken on a new avatar. It now comes in the form of non-permitted colours being added to snacks like bhajji and pakoda sold on the roadsides, maida bleached with chemicals, oil-soluble red colour added to chilli powder and cheap palm oil mixed with other cooking oils to reduce the price, says G. Santhanarajan of the Consumer Association of India (CAI).Even the word adulteration is not to be found in the Food Safety and Standards Act. The Act talks about safe foods, sub-standard and unsafe foods. You can simply pay a fine and get off the hook unless the product is deemed unsafe. We now have to be afraid of plastics, especially those that come in the form of food packaging. Packing hot food items in plastic bags is bad for health as the heat causes the plastic to react. Everything from oil to water to pulses that we buy comes in plastic packs. But since nobody has time for anything, people dont even bother to carry their own bags to department stores to avoid plastic bags, he rued.Enforcement failureAfter the Food Safety and Standards Act came into force, though a separate set-up came into being to check food standards, the very same officials of various local bodies have been implementing the norms. Consumer activists feel that the department is failing at enforcement.Nirmala Desikan, chairman and managing trustee, CAI, said that the new Act was a detailed and more comprehensive one than the one that it replaced. There are so many things that are adulterated, but the problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rules. We also dont know how many complaints it (Food Safety department) receives or how many are dealt with. The department is not transparent, she said.Food Safety officials have refused to provide the exact data on adulteration of milk in the State to The Hindu . Only rough figures of complaints and samples collected were provided. Each laboratory gets around 500 samples a month. Just 100 samples are collected from milk products, said a source.Many residents have registered complaints with the Food Safety department through its WhatsApp number 9444042322. We will increase random sampling to study the trends. The analysis is done in three days. Samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints, said an official.But activist T. Sadagopan is far less optimistic. The very few checks that are done hardy matter since very few people are penalised. And those who adulterate will continue to do so. For the consumer, this would only mean unchecked adulteration leading to an adverse impact on their health.( With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez and Zubeda Hamid in Chennai, L. Srikrishna in Madurai and Wilson Thomas in Coimbatore)Food samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints.Food safety officialThe problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rulesNirmala DesikanConsumer Association of India"

The prices of several vegetables have spiralled this month, as a result. Even a bunch of mint and coriander leaves costs Rs. 40 due to the severe water crisis in places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the plants are grown.Traders at the Koyambedu market said the market now receives only up to 250 truck loads of vegetables daily compared to the usual 350-400 trucks. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State. Vegetable prices have been increasing for three months. But Ramzan has helped to keep sales up, he said."
