Most farmers in the district are dependent on this short-time crop (three-month) for quick money.In the recent years, the income from potato fields had decreased substantially owing to late blight and decrease in rainfall.All these years, poor quality uncertified seeds were blamed for the fungal infection. In the last two years, the Horticulture Department made special efforts to bring certified seeds and provided them for the select farmers. This year, 2,700 tonnes of certified seeds have been distributed in the district.Jayalakshmi, a farmer at Markuli in Shantigrama hobli, said: The growth of the plant is below normal. We are already noticing symptoms of late blight, where leaves get brown.The growth of the tuber is also not on the expected pace, pointed out Papanna, another grower.Those who purchased the certified seeds have also noticed a similar trend in their fields.Kottur Srinivas, district president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, on Thursday, told presspersons: The farmers who spent thousands of rupees on seeds and fertilizers are worried about the loss. Those purchased certified seeds have also experienced the same.The Horticulture Department has also noticed poor germination in some parts because of loss of rainfall.A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu , By and large, germination has been poor this year, because of a dip in rainfall. The department had sent teams of experts to study the causes for poor germination last week. However, as of now, there are no symptoms of late blight as pointed out by some farmers. As the name itself suggests, the fungal infection is normally found only after 50 days.This year potato has been cultivated in 13,500 hectares. In some parts, growers have removed the potato, following poor germination, and have cultivated other crops.We are suggesting them some alternative crops for those who have already lost hopes of good yield this year, he said."

Owing to poor rainfall, there has been no germination leaving him disappointed. His wife said he had been to his farm on Tuesday night and did not return. When his relatives went in search of him, he was found lying on the field with a bottle of poison. They took him to a hospital, where he died later."
5a06422a9855b76bf13c4c4c,Maximum creativity,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/jul/03/maximum-creativity-1623772.html,2017-07-04,"KOCHI: The whole world knows that the legendary Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh cut off his own ear, in a fit of madness, on December 23, 1888. But author MK Harikumar, in his third Malayalam novel, Vangoginu (Surya Books), gives a different angle. According to my research, the painter Paul Gauguin, who was staying with him, had a fight with Vincent over a painting, which one of them had done, says Harikumar. Paul had a sword. He was intoxicated. He swung his sword and cut off Vincents ear. That is what I have written in the novel.What is interesting is that, according to history, Paul left the house the night of the incident and the duo never met again. Adds Harikumar, I dont think Vincent was so abnormal that he would cut off his own ear. Look at his work at that time: he was doing realistic paintings. I dont think a mad man could paint with so much of logic and clarity.Asked how he got the idea to write a novel on Van Gogh, Harikumar says, I like his paintings a lot. He was a realistic painter, yet each of his works repeatedly speaks to us no matter how many times we view it. The painting is an object, yet, it is a living, breathing presence, with an underlying power.Harikumar is especially enamoured of The Potato Eaters. It is a group of peasants sitting inside a wooden house, eating a bowl of potatoes. It is a night scene, but their mood is communicated very powerfully to us, says Harikumar.Another painting which affected Harikumar was called Three pairs of shoes. Each pair represents life, says Harikumar. In one pair, it seems life is still. In another, turned to one side, it indicates a withdrawal from life, while the third pair, of which one shoe is overturned, could mean that the person who wears them has thoughts of suicide.Asked about the qualities of Van Gogh, Harikumar says, Vincent was strongly creative, but weak in other aspects of his life. He had an affair with a prostitute. Then she left him. Thereafter, he became an alcoholic. He was a loner by instinct. In fact, the only sustained relationship he had was with his brother Theo.And it was Theo who bought one work, even though Vincent had an output of 2100 paintings. It is a tragic story, says Harikumar. And to think that his works sells in the millions of dollars these days. (Examples: the painting Irises sold for $53.9 million, while Portrait of Dr. Gachet fetched $82.5 million).Interestingly, in the novel, Harikumar, who has published several books of criticism, writes it like a journalist doing reports about the life and death of Vincent. So, there are interviews with Van Gogh as well as his friends, and a prostitute called Rachel, says Harikumar Meanwhile, when asked about whether Malayalam readers are aware of Vincent, he says, Definitely. In fact, the cutting of his ear is part of a lesson in schools.His birthdays are celebrated with write-ups in the newspapers. And serious readers are all aware of his greatness. Finally, in a clever marketing gimmick, there are ten covers. But it happened by accident. Artist Sabu Puthuparamban showed Harikumar four covers. I said I wanted all four, says Harikumar, the editor of Surya Books. In the end we decided to make 10 different covers. This is a celebration of the greatness of Vincent Van Gogh."

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

With shops and markets closed since last Sunday and supply chains cut off, people are being forced to choose between hunger and an artificial inflation.Supplies are dwindling and prices of vegetable, chicken, egg, fish, mutton and other perishable items are heading north.While fish, chicken and mutton have almost vanished from some of the markets, certain vegetables and eggs are still available but their prices however have touched a point that not many can afford for long.With prohibitory orders in the entire area and vehicles staying off the roads, supply of essential commodities in the area was badly hit. (Samir Jana)Ruma Mandal, a homemaker from the Chapapara area near Basirhat town is serving only potato curries to her family for the last few days. It is the only vegetable available in the local markets ever since tension gripped this area on Monday, she said. But potato is selling at a premium. Last week I paid Rs 8 for a kilo and today I bought two kilos for Rs 24, she complained.Price of onion is skyrocketing as well. Srinath Ghosh, a resident of the Bhyabla area, said onion used to sell for Rs 20 a kilo before a Facebook post he didnt even see changed his life. Now we are paying anything between Rs 30 and 32. Most of the shops are closed and there is an acute shortage of supply. Whatever little is coming to the markets is flying off the shelves before you can bat your eyelids. Most of the shopkeepers are taking the advantage of the situation, said Ghosh.A Trinamool Congress party office that was ransacked by locals at Mailakhola in Basirhat on Thursday. (Samir Jana)The humble egg is not far behind in the race. Price of a pair of poultry chicken eggs has increased from Rs 10 to Rs 16, said Rintu Sahana, a resident of Mailakhali area.Not willing to be quoted, a district administration official explained the real reason behind the shortage in food at Basirhat. The difference in the demographic character of Basirhat town and that of the adjoining villages is responsible for this inflation, he said.The town population comprises mostly Hindus while most of the villagers are Muslims. Markets in and around the town are heavily dependent on these villages for their daily supply of vegetable, mutton, fish, chicken and eggs. Ever since the violence started, the villagers have stopped supplying farm and animal products to the town people, he said."

It is strange that political parties in Punjab as well as Haryana shout a lot about this issue, but none talks about efforts to recharge ground water and rain water which are the main source of irrigation. (Representative Image)AMID INLD protest on SYL canal issue in Haryana, farmer unions in Punjab accused political parties in both states of milking the issue for votes. Farmers also questioned work done in both states on rain water harvesting and ground water recharge. Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of Bharti Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said, Nearly 28 per cent of Punjab is irrigated by canal water, while rest of the area is irrigated by ground water. It is strange that political parties in Punjab as well as Haryana shout a lot about this issue, but none talks about efforts to recharge ground water and rain water which are the main source of irrigation.Accusing parties of double speak, he added: paddy cultivation is a major contributor (to water shortage). However, farmers were given free demonstrations, seeds etc during green revolution to grow paddy, and now it has affected ground water. But all talk is about SYL causing water shortage. So in a way, it is double speak by political parties to cause tension among farmers of Haryana and Punjab. He went on to say that the his union believed that Haryana can be given little more water than the existing share from the already flowing canals and hence there is no need for SYL.However, Buta Singh Burjgill, president of Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda), disagreed. Punjab is short of water and we cannot share even a drop of water with the neighbouring state. We agree with this statement of Punjab political parties. However, they need to work on ways to reduce this water shortage.We are ready to shift to basmati crop which needs 25 per cent of the water needed by paddy crop and at the same time, we can also grow potato in between. However, we need MSP for both crops so as to switch. This will solve Punjabs water shortage and even the water war can be solved.He too said that SYL issue was being used to make farmers in both states fight among each other. Shingaara Singh Maan, president of BKU(Ugrahan) added, At the moment talk is about 28 per cent canal water and not about 72 per cent of ground water as source of irrigation. The topic needs to be widened beyond SYL canal politics, so as to end this water shortage in the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But more importantly, where do you think you are going to raise the Rs 36,000 crore required for loan waiver because you claim to have inherited empty coffers from the previous government?As you would have noticed, this government has cut down on wasteful expenditure. We are going to save every penny that was wasted before. You would get a sense from our first budget.But as far as bad economics goes, the per capita income of farmers in UP was amongst the lowest. Hit by vagaries of nature and penury, they required this help. I understand loan waiver may not be a permanent solution. A lasting benefit can come to farmers when they become financially secure. Thats why PM Modi has already talked of doubling farm incomes by 2022.Would you be able to raise the mammoth amount required for the loan waiver just by cutting down on wasteful expenses?Thats one of the ways. You would have noticed how the previous government wasted public money as the cost of various projects kept on escalating beyond reasonable limits. The Gomti River Front Development project is a case in point. We have stopped all such frivolous expenses.There is a view that instead of loan waiver, you could have given assistance to farmers more by helping them tap technology for better gains?UP is an agrarian state where 78% of the people live in rural areas that have about 2.33 crore farmers. Thats a huge number. Along with the waiver, we are also trying to provide them better seeds and fertilisers. You would have noticed that this year a record 37 lakh metric tonne potato procurement was done and Rs 5900 crore directly transferred to the bank account of farmers. This is unprecedented.But hasnt loan waiver created problems for other BJP-ruled states from where demands to waive off loans are now being raised? More importantly, the Centre has now said it wont foot the loan waiver bills and the states would have to raise the amount itself.The Centre had made its stand clear from day one. It would be unfair to compare UPs situation with other states where farmers are much better off. This loan waiver was required under special circumstances for UP farmers whose per capita income was much below the national average.By when do you think would your government be able to roll out its loan waiver promise?A. Within this year itself. A three-layered committee to execute the loan waiver project has been set up. After verification from banks and revenue department, we would be in a position to roll out the waiver.What do you make of the criticism that Rs 1 lakh cap on waiver cheated many farmers with bigger farm loans?We did the best under limitations.Tell us about things that we are going to see over the next three months?A lot is happening. But if you want quick list here it is. We intend to open 20 more Krishi Vigyan Kendras or Agriculture Science Centres for which in principal clearance has been obtained from the Centre. Forty-three soil testing laboratories too would come up in different districts. Our aim is that by March 2018 all farmers should have a soil health card, which we have reworked to ensure that average farmer is able to understand it better."

This led to a banter in the House and even the chief minister was seen smiling.SP member Shailendra Yadav, however, found the reply absurd. Yadav claimed that out of the 325 legislators of the BJP and Apna Dal, 200 were turncoats who shifted loyalties during polls and such persons were giving absurd replies.In his reply later, the minister said that in UP there were 1,708 cold storages having a capacity of 130.26 lakh MT, which can accommodate 84 per cent of the potato produced.

A lot, feels Nainital MLA Sanjeev Arya who wants change in the names of some weird-sounding tourist points in the Lake City: Suicide Point, Phansi Gadhera (hangmans bay in English) and Sadiya Taal (decaying lake).Arya plans to send a proposal to the state government for changing these tourist hubs names that evoke an uneasy feeling among tourists.We dont think these names give out a good message to lakhs of tourists who visit Nainital every year. I have sought suggestions from people (regarding new names for these spots) and also asked local activists to apprise me if there are more such (awkward) names in region that need to be changed, Arya told Hindustan Times.The BJP lawmaker said apart from Sadiya Taal, the others were not even registered names. For instance, the name Suicide Point was coined by guides and horse ride operators in the area just to attract tourists. Wed rather promote the spot for its huge potential for adventure tourism, he said.In fact, a few years ago, beautification work of Sadiya Taal took place after which it was decided to name it as Sarita Taal, but it continues to be known as Sadiya Taal among locals and tourists.The MLA has asked the local body to provide municipal records regarding the registered names of these places. I will then pursue the matter with the urban development ministry and (chief minister Trivendra Singh) Rawat ji to change the names, he said.Historian-activist Ajay Singh Rawat of Nainital said apart from the Suicide Point, a place that never existed, the other two spots have immense historical significance and hence their names shouldnt be changed.The name Phansi Gadhera symbolises our freedom struggle as the Rohillas -- who attacked Haldwani during the First War of Independence in 1857 -- were hanged by the British there. If they change the name, they will change history, Rawat asserted.Similarly, Sadiya Taal was called so by locals because it was originally a wetland and associated with the traditional water management system of the hills. Moreover, it is historically important as (the then Kumaon commissioner) Sir Henry Ramsay had introduced potato cultivation at Sadiya Taal for the first time in the region in 1856, so this name, too, should stay, Rawat said.Last year, residents of Chorgaliya (lane of thieves in English), a village panchayat in Nainital district, had launched a campaign to change the embarrassing name of their area."

But what if you found an option where the more you drank, the less you paid? Thats exactly what Bar Bar in Phoenix Marketcity, Whitefield, has to offer. The concept works like this, the more people on the table, the lesser your bill gets. As you order more drinks, the price of each drink goes down - this applies to Indian and imported liquor.While this concept has been tried, tested and succeeded in Pune and Mumbai, it is relatively new in Bengaluru, as the outlet is less than a month old. Whats more, they even have an E-Savings Calculator App, which the team has been working on for 8 months now, and they are finally launching this patented software only in Bengaluru to begin with.The focus is to ensure that the customer is be able to see his savings at every step of the way during the ordering process.Coming to the decor, Bar Bar boasts of rustic interiors, mostly woodwork, a lot of barrels and some dim lighting to set the mood. The outdoor seating area is perfect for a chilly Bengaluru evening out with your friends.The food is better than what one would expect at a watering hole. We were spoilt for choice, and were not disappointed with anything we tried. The chicken wings, though a small portion, were flavourful and cooked just right - we tried the Bourbon Barbeque wings, and licked our fingers till every last bit of sauce came off.The Zucchini Parmesana, rings of zucchini and parmesan cheese fried and served with a dip, is an excellent option for vegetarians and cheese lovers. The seafood is excellent at Bar Bar. We tried the Butter Garlic Chilli Shrimp and the Baked Cheesy Masala Crab - both were fresh, very well spiced and cooked to perfection. For those coming in groups, the platters are the best option.Available in vegetarian, chicken, seafood and pork, these are large and can easily be shared by a group of four. We tried the pork platter, called the Oink Oink Platter, which came with pork made in at least five different ways, and is served with potato wedges and coleslaw. The highlight, for us, was the pizza. Made in a wood fire oven, the crust is thin and crunchy, with a generous doze of mozzarella. We tried different toppings on the same pizza, and can say that this is one of the better pizzas in town. For dessert, we tried the Salted Caramel and Expresso Tart - it was large, soft and sinful. And while dessert and drinks dont always go together, just visiting Bar Bar for a meal alone is also a good option.Coming to the drinks, we loved everything we tried. Bar Bar offers a 750 ml cocktail along with bar snacks for just `750 - ideal for one or two people. Under this, we tried Fruit Loops - a cocktail of tequila, cranberry juice, apple juice, candy and plenty of cut fruit, which was pink, pretty and quite potent. We also tried The Lynchburg - a cocktail made from orange whiskey, Vodka, Triple Sec and Ginger Ale  perfect for those whiskey lovers. The Grapejito  a mojito but with grape juice - is ideal for dark rum fans who are willing to experiment a little. With a wide range of drinks to offer and the stellar deals on offer, drinking at Bar Bar is a really fun experience, which is also not hard on your wallets. The music is lively, mostly pop, hip hop and rock numbers from the 1990s and the 2000s, but they also have the space for live gigs. The staff is courteous and polite, and the service is much quicker than expected.All in all, travelling to Whitefield just to visit Bar Bar, is definitely worth it.Cost for two: Rs 1,200"
5a071ea09855b76bf13c7d34,A homely pack,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2017/jul/20/a-homely-pack-1631342.html,2017-07-22,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Once upon a time there was a food pouch that made its way to schools, colleges and offices. A simple ethnic spread wrapped in broiled banana leaf, pothichoru could easily whip up a wave of nostalgia in every Malayali. Yes, there are city restaurants that provide Kerala meals or a full-blown sadya for that matter, but they lack that homely vibe.And if you crave that familiar aroma wafting out of the organic, green package, there are a handful of homemakers in the city who provide exactly that. It was during my study leave that I came across an online forum discussing pothichoru. I hesitantly ordered a lunch, fully convinced it will be a primped-up version of what restaurants offer. But the food turned out to be totally delightful with traditional dishes like mampazha pulissery and injipuli. And that heavenly smell when you open the banana leaf wrap... now I order it regularly, says Anjali, a student.The demandJaya had no clue of the market when she started making Kerala meal packets. It was her daughter Athira, a techie, who gave her the idea of home-cooked meals at your doorsteps. We put the details on facebook and the very same day I got a volley of orders. Next day, a couple of hours after delivery, I received a string of calls from happy customers. To be frank I was overwhelmed by the response, she says. Its the ever-growing demand that prompted Swapna Rakesh, an established home chef, to offer a few meals daily.With a solid number of followers for her blog and facebook page, she is a known name in the culinary circles. Homemade food is available in mobile apps like pinstove, but its a bit difficult for elderly people to order it through smart phones. I found there is a steady demand for traditional Kerala meals and thats how I started offering it. As of now I have a strong clientele, she says.Wrapped in nostalgiaThe banana leaf imparts a unique flavour, giving it a comfort food edge over meals wrapped in aluminum foil or parchment paper. Jaya believes in preparing the whole meal herself, just the way I cook for my family as she puts it. I chop the veggies the day before and wake up at 4 am to start cooking. There are people who want the food by 11, mostly for long trips. I dont have any helpers in kitchen and I always make a couple of extra meals for the homeless and the hungry, she says. Swapna says you cant fool the customers with homely tag if you are not providing exactly that. There is always a difference between home-cooked and mass produced food, she adds.The spreadCustomers who order pothichoru opt for simple meal packets, the traditional ones, without any fancy dishes. This is what you order when you are homesick. Adding some exotic side-dish will ruin the whole idea, says Hima, a government employee. Jayas meals, priced Rs 100, includes brown rice, tapioca, pickle, chammandi, thoran, avial, fish fry and fish curry. In addition to that there will be either sambar, pulissery, parippu, or theeyal. She charges an extra 30 rupees for delivery and usually customers call and place their orders a day in advance.If my daughter is at home she drives me around for home deliveries. Otherwise I hire an auto and if the place is too far I ask them to come and pick it, she says. Swapnas packets are couple combos, meals that are sufficient for two individuals. Each packet weighs more than 2 kilos. Brown rice, fish fry, thoran, potato roast, chammandi, inji curry, pickle, papad, fried mulaku and omelette are the regular dishes. Thoran keeps changing and then there will be pulissery or sambar. I charge Rs 185 for this, she says. The highlight of Gokuls homely meals is the range of seafood specials he offers. Orders come through the foodie groups online. Our pothichoru is veg and we usually add extra non-veg items including egg. Fish, mussels, prawns, karimeen and crab are offered according to availability, he says.Homely and healthyAll the home chefs insist that they dont add taste enhancers or colouring agents in the food. I use only good quality coconut oil and never reuse it. I also see to it that minimal oil is used to prepare the curries so that the meal is healthy, says Jaya. They usually make around 20 meals a day and dont take bulk orders. I dont advertise much as I cant really meet the demand. People want this because they are convinced of its quality. For me more than a business its an attempt to provide healthy and tasty food, adds Swapna."

Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers is kept low and the claims are fully settled.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Singh said the settlement of claims during the two years preceding 2016-17 remained higher because of bad weather (drought). But claims in 2016-17 were less on account of good rains.""If States feel they are burdened to pay their share of premium to private insurers (during good monsoon period when claims are normally less), then we have asked them to set up their own insurance firms to implement the scheme,"" he said, adding that Punjab and Gujarat have evinced interest in this.Replying to another query on the coverage of the PMFBY, the Minister said efforts were being made to bring more farmers under the scheme. Earlier, only loanee farmers were eligible for the crop insurance, now non-loanee farmers are also allowed. Last year, the crop insurance coverage was 30 per cent and it will be increased to 40 per cent this year, he added.Replying to another question on action taken to improve farmers' plight and reduce the number of farmers' suicide, the Minister said the government has revamped the old farm schemes and launched some new initiatives to reduce the cost of production and increase income.Admitting that farmers are in distress because of good production year, the Minister said the government is lending support to farmers through various market interventions to ensure support price to their produce. Farm produce like tur and potato are being procured under the central schemes -- Price Support Scheme (PPS) and the Price Stablisation Fund (PSF) to protect the interest of farmers, he added."
5a0720849855b76bf13c7ea9,More than food on the menu at Delhi's first queer cafe,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2017/jul/23/more-than-food-on-the-menu-at-delhis-first-queer-cafe-1632463.html,2017-07-23,"NEW DELHI: The capital's heritage Mehrauli zone, home to many a hip bar and designer store, is where Sambhav Sharma decided to locate Q Caf, Delhi's first LGBTQ restaurant that provides food, drink  and sustenance  for the city's rainbow queer community.With the Qutub Minar providing the perfect backdrop, Q Caf hopes to provide a safe haven for those who fall outside the man-woman binary and struggle to find spaces accepting of their 'other' status. It started in October when Delhi-based queer rights activist Sharma tied up with Chez Jerome, an expert in French and Indian cuisines. The French chef later stepped down and handed the reins of control to Sharma and his Italian partner Roberto.For Sharma running the cafe comes with a responsibility. ""I have to make sure that this cafe is not specifically for gay men because they already have many spaces in the city where they can hang out. They are dominating queer spaces all around the city,"" he said.With a small dance floor under an open sky and seating for around 30 people, the cafe usually opens in the evening. The menu, inspired by French, Greek and Italian cuisines, could compete with any eatery in the city.On offer are a variety of salads, omelettes, pastas as well as thin crust pizzas with traditional toppings and dips. Specialties of the house include Greek chicken potato salad, a delicate mix of potatoes, onions, tomatoes and chicken salami, Parisian salad dressed with fresh lettuce and fresh parmesan and freshly baked breads.But it's not all about food. With events like book reading sessions and trans nights, Sharma wants to sensitise his customers about queer rights beyond Section 377  the Indian Penal Code section that criminalises sexual acts ""against the order of nature"".""Obviously, the cafe is not any NGO but it also not a place where people should only come to enjoy. I want to utilise this space to revolutionise the struggle we are going through in India. The transgenders, lesbians and hijra folks of our community need more such spaces,"" said Sharma.Despite falling under the broader queer umbrella, gay men stand out from others in the trans community. As a result, transgenders don't feel safe even in those places where they should be welcome, he said.Delhi is amongst the few cities in the country where late night parties in five-star hotels welcome people from the queer community. But few trans people make it inside the elite doors. Simran Shaikh, a transgender and senior programme officer at Sexuality Gender and Rights at Alliance India, echoes Sharma and welcomes safer places for the community but associates the profound segregation more with ""class"" than ""gender"".""The segregation among the LGBTQ is only of class and not of gender. The discrimination happens when you are not associated with a particular class of a party. ""I don't foresee any such changes with these cafes and bars. There will still be class differences in particular parties where there might not be trans identified individuals,"" she said.According to LGBTQ activist Harish Iyer, homophobia within homosexuals is ""rampant"". ""It is sad but true. Just because one belongs to an oppressed community (queer) doesn't make them sensitive to everyone else. Gay men rule the roost in many spaces.""I think some gay men have an issue with effeminacy. It is just another form of misogyny that runs deep in our society. Some do so, so that they don't get noticed as gay, in the company of those who look gay,"" the Mumbai-based activist said. Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.The question of orientation is usually hidden. With workshops we are trying to tell people from the community to not be bothered by their orientation. ""Usually MNCs have a diversity and Inclusion unit where gender issues are addressed, but in smaller companies they may not have such a facility,"" he said.""Through workshops we want to educate even trans people about company structures and how they can contribute in starting small scale businesses. We are also trying to facilitate information of people within the community so that they can connect to each other,"" he added. More spaces like the Q Cafe, they hope, will help in strengthening this connect."
5a0722609855b76bf13c8037,"Eat, drink & be merry? No, it’s time to worry",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jul/23/eat-drink--be-merry-no-its-time-to-worry-1632299.html,2017-07-23,"CHENNAI: Cigarette smoking is injurious to health but so is the sweetened soft drink, processed foods like noodles and chips with loads of salt and fried snacks that are part of any normal evening. Over the years, the harmful effects of consuming tobacco in any form have become clear to the masses and there has been a fall in the number of people taking up smoking. However, there is an alarming lack of awareness about the effects of fat, sugar and salt on the body, or the addiction that they lead to.We thus have parents who are mortally scared of their children getting addicted to smoking due to peer pressure, but do not hesitate before putting on an extra spoonful of chocolate spread on their toasts; buying them another bottle of cola or its supposedly healthier alternative, packaged fruit juice; or packing noodles and chips for lunch. This high intake of fat, sugar and salt  FSS, as the deliciously deadly trio is commonly referred to  has a significant long-term impact on public health, but there has not yet been any study or survey conducted on the Indian population in this regard.There are, however, enough indicators that reveal worrying details. According to the World Health Organisation, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are estimated to account for 60% of total deaths across all age groups in India. Now, the country has one of the largest number of people with diabetes, figures that shot up from 11.9 million persons in 1980 to 64.5 million in 2015 (study by Lancet released in 2016). Experts say the excess intake of fat, sugar and salt are the main causes for the rising incidence of NCDs like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension  these three alone cause an alarming 40% of deaths in India. Much of these are preventable. For instance, the WHO says that as many as 1.7 million deaths worldwide could be prevented every single year if salt consumption is reduced to the recommended level of fewer than 5 grammes a day.From a health perspective, salt, doctors say, is a needless ingredient, as sodium is present in almost everything that we eat. From vegetables to meat and fish, sodium is there in everything we eat. We may add a little for enhancing flavour but most people add a lot more than required. For instance, salt is added while cooking rice in Tamil Nadu, said Dr Milly Mathew, senior consultant nephrologist, Madras Medical Mission Hospital. This extra sodium can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, stroke, diabetes and many other complications, she said. Diet plays a major role in preventing NCDs, added Dr Mathew.This excess is at its worst when it comes to processed food. In most cases in the West, says WHO, the excess quantity of sodium comes from salt in processed food. This could be true in the case of most in urban India as well. A few food items that Express checked left little for doubt. The smallest packet of instant noodles has 1.424g of sodium. That is about 60% or a third of the daily allowance from just one tiny, 79g packet of noodles that can be termed single-serving only. Similarly, a 100gm pack of potato chips has 0.742g of sodium, while it is 0.946g in the case of another popular potato based snack, aloo bhujia.Processed food, savouries, pappad, pickles, nuts, pizza and other bakery foods are also packed with a high content of sodium, said Meenakshi Bajaj, head dietician at Government Multi Super-Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate, Chennai, pointing out how most people end up consuming much more than a days allowance of sodium by eating these foods.The WHO strongly recommends that sodium intake should not exceed 2g (equivalent to 5g of salt a day). Remember that this quantity is for an adult; it is correspondingly less for children based on energy requirement. That is where a small pack of noodles pumps enough sodium into your child, making even the natural sodium in regular food excess. Put another way, this is the equivalent of nicotine tar inside the lungs but without the dark and sticky poisons repulsiveness.Equally dangerous is sugar. There are no studies here to prove that high consumption of sugar has a direct effect on diabetes. However, sugar, both in the form of plain sugar and mixed in food, is harmful to those in pre-diabetic stage and children, said Dr V Mohan, director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. The normal diet  vegetables, fruits, milk, and carbohydrates in chapati, rice etc  have the necessary amount of sugar required for the body. Anything above that could be excess, more so in the case of aerated drinks.One cup of coffee or tea will not harm anyone, but consuming soft drinks that are loaded with sugar is dangerous. A 330ml drink of the popular cola contains 33g of sugar. This is one of the leading causes of obesity in children, added Dr Mohan, who is also the chairman of Dr Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre in Chennai.This is particularly significant in Tamil Nadu where the incidence of diabetes is alarming. In the State, 10% of adults in the rural population are diabetic. It is higher  15%  in urban areas excluding Chennai. In Chennai, 25% of adults above the age of 20 years are diabetic, and about 40% of diabetics are under 50 years old, said Dr Mohan, adding that the number of pre-diabetic persons would be double these numbers.The prescribed limit as per the basic calculation is that a person should consume about 30 calories for each kg of body weight, explained Dr K Kannan, president, Chennai Chapter Cardiology Society of India. A teaspoon of sugar is about 5g, which would give you 20 calories.It thus is no wonder that the bottles of cola that you drink are firmly deposited around the belly, leading to obesity, diabetes and heart diseases before long. Among the FSS trio, fat is an exceptional one as recent research has shown. There have been studies about the dangers of fat, and there is also better awareness when compared to sugar and salt. But what research has proven now goes beyond this layman understanding.When researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle added sugar to different types of dairy products ranging from skimmed to heavy cream mixed with safflower oil, the test subjects preferred the skimmed one the least. It had little or no fat. When mixed in the right measure with sugar and/or salt, fat becomes the X factor that takes the combination to the next level, the bliss point, the palate version of hitting the spot. It also creates an effect similar to any narcotic addiction.Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country. While there is a ban on advertising tobacco and liquor, there is no such restriction on advertising these FSS-rich foods that primarily target children.There is enough anecdotal information as well as direct conjunctures that raise concerns. But in the absence of scientific data, a policy decision cannot be taken, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).We in India lack good data on the dietary pattern of consumption of fat, salt and sugar, and there is no data available on trans-fat consumption or its level in the blood. This is really a risk, she added. The council is moving towards surveying the dietary pattern of the population for a better understanding of the effect of FSS. That would be the starting point.Death by fats Death by fats Death by fats Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country.

Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka during his meeting with the chief minister said that his group was keenly interested in promoting electric vehicles in Punjab.He suggested a scheme to bring in electric taxis to propagate green energy and generate employment in the state. Amrinder said that his government was keen to explore electric vehicles as a replacement for the traditional, more polluting petrol and diesel run vehicles in the state.He pointed out that Chinese energy major Yinlong also recently discussed with him the possibility of launching electric cars and buses in the state. The government was also in talks with Ola for electric taxis, he added.An official spokesperson said that a proposal to launch an Uber-like app for tractors, called Tringo, was also discussed at the meeting. The app would enable owners to rent out their tractors, said the spokesperson. The chief minister responded favourably to Goenkas request for expansion of their tractor units in Punjab and asked the company to submit a proposal.Urging the company to support the states efforts to provide employment to youth, the chief minister offered help to Tech Mahindra in setting up a BPO in Mohali after Goenka said there was huge potential for IT sector jobs. Mahindra & Mahindra was also interested in potato seed development for exports, according to Goenka.The chief minister also reminded Goenka of his suggestion, made to Anand Mahindra in Mumbai, for setting up a defence project in Abohar. Goenka, according to the spokesperson, said the company was exploring the same. The chief minister said the government was also considering the companys proposal to develop the Ranjit Sagar dam resort.Taking forward from their Mumbai talks, the two sides also discussed an Uttar Pradesh-like Dial 100 emergency response system for Punjab to provide prompt integrated emergency services to ensure public safety for all, including those with special needs. The chief minister said the Home and Police departments were studying the proposal.Mahindra groups plans to set up Mahindra world university in Ludhiana also came up for discussion. Mahindra & Mahindra, which employs about 6,000 people directly and another 30,000 indirectly in Punjab, currently earns Rs 6,000 crore revenue from the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Farmers are unable to reap the benefits and consumers are feeling the pinch.As farmers cant sit for an entire day in the market to sell their produce, they sell the harvest in wholesale market at a price demanded by the middlemen.Middlemen get a maximum of 70% and minimum of 50% profit for the tomatoes brought by farmers. Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables. We hardly get `50 to `60 profit a basket, they said.Potato farmers in Hassan a worried lotHassan: Potato farmers in Hassan are a worried lot as they incurred crop loss consecutively for five years. Moreover, the growing area of potato by small and medium farmers has been drastically decreased from 61,000 hectares to 10,087 in 10 years. Statistics available with Express show that small farmers who cultivate on less than five acres have switched over to alternative crops like maize and ginger due to crop loss. On the other hand, the farmers who are cultivating on more than five acres have leased out their land to Ginger growers. Horticulture officials are anxious as the certified seeds supplied by the department in 1,266 hectares were damaged due to dry spell. The department had brought the certified seeds from Punjab and supplied it to 2,094 farmers at a subsidised rate.The officials had promised compensation if crop loss was reported, but no action has been initiated so far.Dilemma of Tomato GrowersEvery acre approximately needs 50 gram tomato seeds and after seeds start sprouting, they will be planted.

(File) The accused had received 20 king cobras in two prior shipments but all of those snakes had died in transit. (File)A Los Angeles man was arrested on Tuesday after federal prosecutors said he arranged to smuggle into the United States three live, highly venomous king cobra snakes hidden in potato chip canisters. Rodrigo Franco, 34, was charged with illegally importing merchandise into the country in connection with a parcel from Hong Kong that was intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents on March 2 containing the 2-foot (0.61 metre)-long snakes concealed inside the canisters. Three albino Chinese soft-shelled turtles were also found in the package, prosecutors said, adding that Franco on that same day mailed a box to Hong Kong with six protected turtles inside.According to a criminal complaint filed in the case, Franco admitted during an interview with authorities that he had previously received a total of 20 king cobras in two prior shipments but that all of those snakes had died in transit.He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted, although federal sentencing guidelines typically call for less time behind bars.According to the National Geographic website, the king cobra, also known as Ophiophagus hannah, is the longest venomous snake, reaching up to 18 feet (5.5 metres) in length. When confronted, king cobras can raise up to one-third of their bodies off the ground, flare out their hoods and emit a bone-chilling hiss before attacking.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

When it rains, for instance, I instantly think of ghevar. Now thats a sweet I have often written about. Its eaten mostly in the north in the rainy season. I am greatly fond of it, though I find that not too many share my view on this.So, the moment the sky turned grey a few days ago, I went looking for ghevar. The closest stop was Kaleva, which used to be my favourite sweet-and-savoury eatery at some point of time. I used to be a regular there, but hadnt been to the sweet shop in Gole Market for quite a while. So I decided I would buy my ghevar there, and have a quick lunch of bedmi sabzi (Rs. 62 for a plate with two bedmis) and dahi vada (Rs. 75).This is a great place for a 15-minute lunch if you are in a hurry. Though the place is always crowded, especially at lunch time, food comes in minutes. And you cant linger in any case to contemplate life because Kaleva  unlike similar eateries in places such as Bengali Market  has no seating area; you have to stand at a counter and eat.I enjoyed my bedmi sabzi. The freshly fried bedmis were large and fluffy, and the potato curry it came with was spicy and nicely mashed. What disappointed me was the dahi vada, which I used to love once upon a time. Either my taste buds have changed since then, or their cook has, for I found the vada so hard that I had to leave half of it uneaten.They have the usual lunch menu that you find in north Indian vegetarian fast-food eateries  puri sabzi, chholey bhaturey, chaat, pao bhaji, special thhalis  consisting of dal makhni, shahi paneer, mixed vegetable rice, raita, sweet, salad and pickle  and rice combos (with chholey, sambhar, dal makhni or shahi paneer). There is a small south Indian section, with dosa and vada served with sambar, and you also get the usual vegetable chowmein, hakka noodles and chilli paneer gravy and so on. Their snacks have always been good. You get various kinds of kachoris (khasta, with peas and so on), pakoras, including green chilly ones, and dhoklas.Deliciously crispWhat I really enjoyed was the ghevar, which had just come off the stove. It had a soft malai layer, which added style and substance to the poor old ghevar. Actually, the dish  essentially a mix of ghee, maida and sugar  has to be prepared with great care for the right thickness and its honeycomb-like form. The ghevar that I carried back with me  and it was demolished before I could say rain  was deliciously crisp, despite the humid weather and the malai.Kaleva is essentially known for its sweets. I used to love their fruit kulfis  creamy kulfis frozen in fruits such as mangoes and apples. We were also very fond of a sweet called chak-a-chak  a light, lemon-coloured rasmalai, with tiny rasgullas in it.Despite all these years, Kaleva remains more or less the same (if you forget about the dahi vada).
