This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

The protest is against the government's decision to reallocate tomato sheds with a section of traders blaming another group of illegal occupation of these facilities.""About 85-90% of the mandi is likely to be shut. Some commission agents may continue to operate but almost everyone has promised to join in. We informed growers about Monday's strike last week. Trucks that were due to arrive at the mandi on Sunday night or early Monday won't come,"" said Metha Ram Kriplani, a vegetable trader.Last week, after meeting both groups that have been blaming each other of encroachment, development minister Gopal Rai had announced that the reallocation would be done based on the market fees submitted by traders over the past three years.""There is a cartel that needs to be broken. The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,"" said a senior official. As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon."

Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying ""it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from APMC Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association"". The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds. We stand by our decision to go on a strike from Monday because we believe that vested interests have prevailed upon the government to take this decision,"" said Metharam Kriplani , a trader.The notice issued by the government, after meetings with both sets of traders on Tuesday, says that fresh allotments of tomato sheds will be made on the basis of the market fee received from individual commission agents in the past three financial years  2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. ""This will be done on the pattern of allotment made for potato and onion trade,"" said a senior government official."

Based on central government norms, we have decided to distribute Rs 205 crore among farmers in 11 districts, including Burdwan, the worst affected. Nearly 2 lakh marginal farmers will be benefited. The file has been sent to the CM and we hope the compensation will arrive soon,"" said state agriculture minister Purnendu Basu . The beneficiary will be those farmers who have lost 33% and more of their crop to inclement weather.The announcement was made on the day when knives were out for the BJP government over the farmers' killings in alleged police firing at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.Doling out of compensation isn't new in Bengal given that back in March 2015, to ease a crisis in potato cultivation, the state announced that 50,000 metric tonne of the crop would be directly procured from farmers in eight major potato-producing districts at the rate of Rs 5,500 per metric tonne and Rs 550 a quintal.The government then distributed them to schools for mid-day meals and ICDS beneficiaries at the rate of 1 kg per head per week.Till April 21, 2015, 20,000 metric tonne potatoes were procured and farmers were paid. The same year chief minister Mamata Banerjee requested the Centre to waive the crop loans to potato growers for the 2014-15 season and to arrange for fresh loans for the ensuing Kharif season.Since 2011, the Mamata Banerjee government, said sources, had been distributing agricultural input subsidy worth Rs 1,336.43 crore among 32.83 lakh farmers for damage of crops due to natural calamities under State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).Faced with disquiet in their states, the governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and now, Uttar Pradesh, have also adopted the route, though they have apparently not been able to reign in the crisis yet."

Other vegetables are also drilling a hole in the pocket, with prices rising over the past 15 days. Prices are likely to increase further in coming days, said vegetable traders, adding that monsoon arrived late this year which led to poor crop of seasonal vegetables, while heavy rains later damaged the produce. Tomato was worst hit by rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Seasonal vegetables hit by unfavourable weather conditions include brinjal, ladyfinger, bitter gourd, colocasia and potatoes. Cost of bottle guard, pumpkin, pointed guard and cauliflower has dropped up to 40%.Wholesale dealer Shahikant Singh said, ""Rains damaged the tomato crop in Karnataka and also affected its transport."" Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down. Also, these vegetables don't have a long shelf life, so vendors are selling them for less.Housewife Pooja Rastogi said, ""The hike in prices of tomato and potato is pinching most as there is hardly any dish one can make without these two. I have started using readymade tomato puree, 1kg of which costs between Rs 70-90, whereas raw tomato is at over Rs 100 per kg."" Another housewife Anuradha Bhatt, buying vegetables from Narhi market said she had started making dishes with ladyfinger and pumpkin which don't require tomato.Private sector employee Alisha Asif, buying vegetables at Nishatganj market said tomato prices were already high but now other vegetables had become unaffordable too. A Mahanagar provision store owner Radhey Lala said demand for tomato puree and ketchup has gone up.(With inputs from Aarooshy Srivastava and Himanshi Shukla)"
5a0b16be9855b76bf13ccb7b,Tomatoes make Kolkata see red,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tomatoes-make-kolkata-see-red/articleshow/59791479.cms,2017-07-28,"It's been pouring heavily in Kolkata and among the first casualties of monsoon is a vital kitchen ingredient  tomatoes. With prices hovering around Rs 100/kg since about a fortnight now, the humble tomato  which is scientifically a fruit but commonly known as a vegetable owing to its rampant use in cooking savoury rather than sweet meals  is giving a fright to the common man. While vendors at some of the local markets claim that the price hike is due to interrupted supply because of the rains, those in the food business are among the worst hit. With tomato prices going through the roof, many are resorting to substitutes like canned puree and ketchup, leading to their dwindling stocks at various departmental stores.Gurleen Singh, owner of Hindusthan Dhaba , said they are bearing a loss of 3-4% at the moment. ""We are hoping that the situation will get better in the coming weeks. If the crisis persists, we will be forced to increase the price of our dishes by `5-`10 on an average,"" he said, explaining that gravy items, especially makhnis, are cooked with fresh tomatoes. However, Rahul Arora, proprietor of Paranthe Wali Galli , said their business remains unaffected as they don't use fresh tomatoes and cook with tomato puree instead.""We get our stock of canned tomato puree and since the price of that has not increased, we are not feeling the pinch,"" he told us. Chef Rangan Niyogi seconded Rahul as he said tomato puree is indeed a preferred ingredient in Indian kitchens. ""Readymade tomato puree is a great help in times of crisis. It can be used for churning out a variety of dishes. Generally, we use fresh tomatoes in numerous Indian dishes, like chicken butter masala, dal makhni, methi saag, aloo dum etc. But, currently I am using tinned tomato puree in place of fresh tomatoes and Kashmiri mirch in place of red chilli powder to make them taste close to tomato. However, in case of tomato chutney, it's not possible to substitute fresh tomatoes. For making tomato or minestrone soup, I am using carrot and tomato puree in place of fresh tomato. While carrot lends the vegetable flavour, tomato puree helps in getting the right taste and colour of the soup,"" he said.According to local vendors, tomato prices shooting up during this season is a common occurrence as rains spoil the stock. Tomatoes that have a shelf life of 3-4 days are hard to stock up at a time not many farmers have access to cold storage. Chef Joymalya Banerjee , however, feels the crisis is ""created"". ""Monsoon comes every year and it's not believable that the entire stock got ruined due to exceptional rains. Yet, there's a dearth in supply. So, if I ask vendors to deliver 5 kilos, they are giving only 2 kilos. This has been happening for the past two weeks,"" he said. The chef added that he doesn't believe in passing the burden on to the consumers. ""Everyone in the restaurant business keeps a buffer. For example, if the making cost of a dish is `10, it's sold at `30. For the loss of a rupee or so, it's not feasible to hike the price of a dish. There was a time when potato prices were hiked to an extent that some biryani makers dropped the aloo from the dish. That was juvenile, as it's not fair to victimise consumers all the time. I will hike the prices only when I can't bear the burden anymore,"" he reasoned.Though tomato prices started coming down on Wednesday and were available at `80 a kilo at some places, online grocery platforms such as Big Basket and Grofers continued to sell the kitchen must at over `100 a kilo. It was `109 a kilo at Big Basket and `110 a kilo at Grofers on Thursday. Cherry tomatoes and the organic variety came at `280 and `172.50 a kilo respectively."
5a0b2cdd9855b76bf13cd14e,The GoT Trail in Northern Ireland,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/the-got-trail-in-northern-ireland/,2017-07-20,"The Game of Thrones (GoT) is back with Season Seven and if you feel left out and wish to join in, it might be useful to first understand the geography. The world of GoT is divided into four landmasses; the focus is on two of them  Westeros and Essos. Everybody is fighting everyone else to gain control of the entire landmass of Westeros, 3,000 miles long starting at the very cold north pole, and stretching all the way down a varied mixture of terrain and ending at the desert-like south. The land is separated physically into three main parts: the icy-cold North, the mid-region, and the hot southern desert. It is politically divided into two  the land Beyond the Wall and the Seven Kingdoms.I had to fill a GoT-sized hole before embarking to Northern Ireland with 16 other journalists the plots and subplots, characters, twists and turns were too many to try and cram before the trip, but one catches on, with the help of the internet. Looking at the trails popularity, I was thinking: Cricket and football are religion to their respective fans; Woodstock draws devotees of rock music and counter culture . Many such destinations have achieved cult status, and vistors here are no less devout than those who undertake yatras to conventional religious sacred spots.This is why special interst trails evoke so much interest in the traveller who is eager to experience something new, something he can relate to.The trail brings alive the story of dragons and queens, princes and villains, a make-believe of epic proportions set in a magical but grisly world that cocks a snook at logic and history. Its a mega tale that grows wild, demanding a huge suspension of disbelief.I wake today to a grey, rainy and cold day in Belfast, the starting point. But even as our coach winds its way along Northern Irelands famous Antrim and Causeway Coastal Route the skies clear up to make way for another bright day  just in time for us to savour the GoT filming locations en route.At the 17th century Ballygally Castle Hotel, we come face-to-face with GOT Door No: 9 (that opens into a restaurant  that depicts the famous battle between House Stark and House Bolton in the penultimate episode of Season 6. This beautiful carved door displays the House crests, Ramsey Boltons hungry dogs and Winterfell Castle.Cakes & GhostsThe afternoon Tea Menu at Ballygally Castle Hotel is a GoT junkies delight  you can order a Jon Snow cake or Winterfell Jaffa cake, Lannister rolls and other GoT-inspired dishes, before you experience the Ghost Room that is up a narrow, wooden spiral staircase. This is where Lady Isabella was confined by her angry husband  when she gave birth to a girl and not a boy  and trying to escape, she falls to her death from the tower window! Her ghost, they say, still hovers around here, a friendly ghost!On to Carnlough harbour where visitors photograph themselves at the harbour where Arya Stark gets stabbed by the Waif in Season 6, episode 7. Who is it who dramatically crawls up those cobbled steps from the sea..? Does that person survive?We move on to Cushendun Caves, in the Stormlands at the mouth of the River Dun. This is where the Red Priestess, gives birth to the Shadow in Season 2, episode 4, Garden of Bones. Mary McBrides bar  the smallest in Ireland  has Door No: 8,  that opens to the toilet!  depicting the Faceless Man, and tells the story of Aryas journey so far.The highlight today, is The Dark Hedges  an avenue of beech trees made famous by GoT as The Kingsroad, where, following the death of her father, Ned Stark, Arya escapes Kings Landing disguised as a boy. Travelling on Kingsroad in the back of a cart with Yoren, Gendry and Hot Pie, all new recruits for the Nights Watch, Arya starts her long and arduous journey north.The beech trees, planted by the Stuart family, in the 18th century, is the approach to the entrance to Gracehill House (that is now being converted to a hotel). At the Dark Hedges at dusk, you will not be alone. The ghost of the Grey lady  a lost spirit from a neighbouring graveyard  will keep you company!Two trees felled in a recent storm here were salvaged and made into ten beautiful doors that are displayed at different location in the area  featuring aspects of the GOT series  that are turning out to be major attractions. But that does not bode well for the surviving trees, whose roots are getting weak with all the newfound traffic on this avenue, and tourists wanting to photograph themselves here. So this will be made into a pedestrian-only avenue, to protect any danger to the legendary beech trees.Medieval FinaleThe next day, we are headed for the undulating County Down, with its little green hills (Drumlins), deer farm, sheep and the Quoile River, also touching a Christian heritage trail passing through Inch Abbey, dedicated to the patron saint of Ireland, St Patrick.Interestingly, corporate groups  including an IT group from India that won the trip in a contest  come here to bond and engage in confidence building activity, including learning to wield the bow and arrow (very useful, post nukedom). Were told the only challenge with the Indian group was controlling their selfie-taking sprees, including one that involved clicking selfies in front of an approaching helicopter! Imagine, getting decapitated at Winterfell, not by the sword but by a helicopter blade!Winterfell aka Castle WardForty minutes by road from Belfast, is the 1,000-acre Castle Ward, overlooking Strangford Lough, now better known as Winterfell of GoT fame, capital of Westeros, the seat of the ruler of the North and the traditional home of House Stark. We are welcomed and given oversized robes with fur collars that envelop you like a tent. How did they stay agile under such a bulbous garment?Ah, the Tower. The backdrop of many an episode, but hey, it looks rather different. Thats because GoT used Castle Ward and its Tower as props that were in turn propped by extensive computer generated imagery (CGI), completely transforming the place into a living, breathing, medieval scene.William, who runs Winterfell Tours, takes us around, reliving certain scenes, playing relevant clips on his ipad even as he explains how the imagery was done.Archery & DecapitationNext, we all have a go at shooting arrows at targets  and losers (who are far off the mark) undergo decapitation by winners, as they place their heads on a log of wood! Shooting an arrow looks very easy indeed but when one actually tries to do it, it is very difficult, having to coordinate vision, arm, aim and what not  it obviously requires a great deal of dedicated practice (Mahabharatas Arjuna, we are told, was an expert archer and his skill is recounted as being illustrative of the art of focus, dedication and practice).This is where the characters Bran, Rob and Robb practice archery in the courtyard with their father, Ned Stark  and Arya, bored with her sewing lesson, abandons her sewing, grabs a bow and annoys Bran by out-shooting him.Audleys Field & CastleRobb Starks Camp, Oxcross, was filmed here at Lecale, bordered by Strangford Lough and the Irish Sea on the north, east and south coasts. The castle originally belonged to a Norman family that came here in 1210.On the grassy clearing before the Castle (or what remains of it) and overlooking the beautiful Irish Sea, all 17 of us in the group are encouraged to fight,  were given (rubber) swords and of course, were already wearing our medieval cloaks, so theres no stopping us as we fly at each other, raging and screaming, pushing and stabbing.Inch AbbeyBack to the coach and on our way to Tollymore Forest we pass through Inch Abbey and Downpatrick Cathedral, the final resting place of St Patrick. The Cistercian Abbey ruins here formed part of the location of GoT and many scenes of GoTs Season 1, Episode 10, Fire and Blood, used Inch Abbey as Robb Starks camp at Riverrun.Tollymore ForestWe drive to the ancient forest where by a brook, Ned Stark and his sons find a dead stag which has gored to death a female Direwolf that has given birth to pups. The Stark children take the pups home. Next, comes the clearing in the forest where the deserter from the Nights Watch finds those dismembered Wilding bodies.We also take a look at the Vampire Tree, a gnarled, ancient tree with its limbs spreading out in crooked directions. Parts of the film Dracula and Frankenstein were shot here, too, were told. The 800-acre forest once belonged to one family, but is now with the government. The forest inspired C S Lewis to write the Chronicles of Narnia; he is said to have spent a lot of time here at the Mourne Mountains and Tallymore Forest, shaping the plot to his story.Banquet & WhodunnitThe action-packed day that began at 8:30 am culminates in an extraordinary dinner, with theatre actors chipping in at The Cuan, a charming Guest Inn run by Caroline and Peter. We are welcomed at the entrance by actors role-playing Jon Snow, King of the North and Tormumd Giantsbane, leader of a band of Wildings and trusted lieutenant of The King Beyond The Wall.Inside, the dimly-lit hall has tables with medieval earthen goblets and stone plates and serving dishes straight out of GOT. As the only vegetarian there, I get a special menu that is simply delicious, potato and blue cheese cutlets with veggies and rich, nut-filled bread slices.All through the dinner, the actors weave in and out, around the tables, mouthing dialogues from GoT, and finally, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister, falls down suddenly, gasping, clutching her throat, and  dies. Who killed her?GoT storyline has many similarities with that of the Mahabharata, and so too, Bahubali the movie seems to have borrowed liberally from Got characters.The GoT plot thickens at every turn, no less complicated with all its palace intrigues, not unlike Greek and Indic epics, that are rich in not just the unbelievable but also in revealing the inticate maze of faith and deception, generosity and greed, compassion and cruelty that are all a part of each ones internal universe. No wonder sages say, truth is often stranger than fiction!"

For years while the price of the aloo went up and down, Lalu survived the ups and downs of political life. He led the Bihar revolution, sending the caste elite to the political guillotine and promising equality for all Biharis. But some became more equal than others and began to sing saala main toh saheb ban gaya.He was always cheeky; like when he declared he would make Bihars roads as smooth as Hema Malinis cheeks. Now Lalus fortunes have run into those erstwhile bad roads of Bihar as investigators accuse him and his family of accumulating benami property. The Yadav patriarch has been the Bihari voters darling shepherd but the voting public no longer offers sheep-like loyalty.His supporters say that under the comic act, Lalu is a political genius, the joker who always aces the political poker game. He was the cowherd prince long before the Sanghs recent gau raksha drive, but now as CBI and ED investigate him, have the cows finally come home for Lalu? For Indian netas, politics is a family business and Lalu seems no exception. Thats why its always appeared that Indias social justice parties were only dispensing family-based injustice. Remember how Lalu once nominated his wife Rabri Devi as CM even as he administered his jagir from jail? That was a case of Bihar being imprisoned in family law.Investigators say Lalu and his children acquired vast amounts of land. Even though he was once son of the soil, and always had happy landings, now it looks as if the ground has shifted under his feet. Lalus tenure as railway minister was hailed by Harvard but it was that very tenure that appears to have derailed the Yadav wagon.Lalu named his daughter Misa after the notorious Emergency era law but is now suffering a family emergency even as son Tejashwi who played cricket for Delhi Daredevils could be caught and bowled. Its the agencies that are pressing charges, but Tejashwis supporters are attacking the press. Lalus most famous photo-op was the picture of him milking cows but hes now accused of milking the system. Even if Lalu survives this latest round of allegations, its time there was an image makeover for the Secular Undivided Family."

Mr. Modi seemed to have found eternal bliss on literally, the chest of Big Bro Donald Trump. But did anything of clear benefit to India come out of all this bonhomie?Mr. Trump issued nary a word in favour of Indias striving for a UN permanent seat. His woman at the UN is issuing threat after threat to mediate between India and Pakistan. Nor did he address the contentious H-1B visa issue. Nor did Mr. Modi bring up any of these issues, at least in public.Instead, both leaders resolved to tackle radical Islamic extremism, longhand for Islamic terrorism. But even with close to 200 million Muslims back at home, Mr. Modi is not facing any substantive terrorism from them.Mr. Trump, with a much smaller number of Muslims in his country, is surprisingly, no matter all the noise and fireworks, not facing much terrorism from them either. Almost every week, there is a homegrown white or black gunman who blows up a few people, but for Mr. Trump, as well as for most America, that is simply and perfectly par for the course.Any suggestion of gun control is met with a virulently negative response for Mr. Trump himself.But let a Muslim be involved in any violent act, and the whole country explodes in outraged indignation.Mr. Trump does not realize that it is his own policies as well as those of his predecessor, George W. Bush, that have contributed wildly to the growth of Islamic jihadism in the world. It was George W.s excursion into Iraq, primarily to teach Muslims a lesson for 9/11, which he thought would be a walk in the park, that has resulted in the emergence of ISIS and other jihadi outfits.Hush, dont say it out loud, but people say, now very quietly though, that Mr. Modi has his own alleged chequered past vis--vis Muslims. As PM, he has tried hard to correct that image. Then why he is undoing all his efforts now.Consider the Taliban. Can they be considered radical Islamic extremists? From past and current experience, yes. But the US is desperate to deal with them. The Taliban instead is the one spurning the US. Sooner or later, they are expected by almost everyone, including the US, to take Kabul. It is a resigned fact of life.India too then will have to deal with the Taliban or lose any influence in Afghanistan. What is India doing to deal with the Taliban? By painting itself as a country against radical Islamic extremism, is it helping its cause in Afghanistan, an absolutely critical country for its own peaceful existence, or hurting it?The point is why should Mr. Modi get involved in Mr. Trumps battles, when all the latter offers is empty rhetoric. The American Pivot to Asia is practically dead, what with Mr. Trump kowtowing to Xi Jinping of China. Kim Jong-un is least deterred by Mr. Trumps huff and bluster. North Korea has thrown an open secret wide openthat America is a fading superpower, and China an ascending one.Mr. Modi has his own battles to fightwith China, with Pakistan, with Afghanistan. Even if Mr. Trump offers him any assistance, it is practically of no avail because Mr. Trump finds himself in a weak position with respect to China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Why then consider teaming up with a loser. India has to forge its own path to secure itself.Mr. Trump asked Mr. Modi to further open Indias markets. What is a colony? A country that exports raw materials and imports finished goods. We, who so rebelled against colonization, seem to have become a colony again. I am not exactly sure what India exports, but the country is flooded today with foreign goods and services, many of them Americanfrom potato chips and cars to arms and universities.The Indian elite and upper middle class is about 100 million adults, roughly the size of America. The American market is almost saturated. Another America opening up is a delirious prospect for Mr. Trump. And Indians love all things American. Soon even Rooh Afza and Tandoori chicken, already displaced by competing American goods, will be offered by American companies.Mr. Trump also wanted less exposure to liability for his nuclear companiesWestinghouse and GE. But Westinghouse is in the toilet, and pretty much so is GEs nuclear division. Fukushima had GEs reactors, but even though GE promises a newer generation of reactors, who would want to lower liability for companies with such a record.In the meantime, the French and the Russians are forging ahead with building reactors in India. The argument goes that the governments of France and Russia offer insurance to their companies if things go wrong, while American companies are private and have to assume liability for themselves. Why then does Mr. Trump refuse to emulate the French and the Russians and offer support to his companies from his own substantial coffers, instead of bullying a poor county like India into assuming more risk?Frankly, Mr. Modi came away empty-handed from his outing to Washington. If any secret deals in favour of India were struck, it was apparent to none. To his credit, other than the empty anti-radical Islamic rhetoric, Mr. Modi too gave away nothing. Nothing lost, nothing gained then.Indo-US relations have been beset by lip service, lots of of lip and little service, and little else. The Modi-Trump bear hug seems to be a continuation of that fine tradition. The lesson for India: keep your best interests in mind and chart your own destiny. No point in being a junior partner of a country already on the fade, and which only promises to fade more with time."

Our two-inch tongue rules our six-feet body. And the stomach takes on the role of a garbage bag, says the restaurateur. While Shettys two aforementioned eateries have been the go-to place for greasy dosas and cheesy pizzas, his new mission is to change the way we eat with his latest offering: Aharveda, located inside Golden Chariot.Aharveda has been decorated in warm shades of yellow with verses from the Gita and vedas painted on the wall and copper chandeliers above each table. The server welcomes us with a Red Roar (Rs 150) drink comprising carrot, beetroot, tomato, mint, betel leaves, coriander and gooseberries. Served at room temperature, the taste is of a Bloody Mary without the alcohol, we joke.Shetty, who started Aharveda, a food science company that conducts sessions of the importance of healthy eating, and using food to treat imbalances, shares an anecdote. We have gone to the moon, in the bargain we have lost our own powers. We understand everything other than ourselves. Picture this, theres a water tank with a faulty hole through which dirty water seeps in. This water goes to all the houses in the building. Every family, sends the sample for checking, pumps it with pesticide and insecticide to clean the water and uses it for consumption. Wouldnt it be wiser if we repaired that hole? says Shetty, who has created recipes that are an extension of his philosophy.Ahar means food in Sanskrit and it is really our medicine shop, says Shetty, offering us a cream of mushroom soup thats light on the palate, but not on flavours. Garnished with mushroom slices and a drizzle of coconut milk, we dont miss the usual onion, garlic or cream. The surprise is the pizza, with its crisp base of tapioca flour and a cheesy topping of cashew nut dust. It has everything and more a vegetarian pizza would have  olives, tomato paste and capsicums. Our eyebrows remain raised as we dig into the Mexican platter (Rs 350) of tacos, made with rajgira seeds and corn, and nachos served with a spicy salsa, guacamole, and a walnut and cashew nut sauce that replaces cheese.The Ahar Veda thali served on silverware has rice rotis, a roasted potato and corn cutlet, besan chura, rasam, cauliflower sabzi and sukka suran (elephant yam) and a serving of kheer. The offering is complete with pickled carrots (dried in-house by Shettys team and made in small batches so it doesnt need oil). The chaas (Rs 90) made from coconut milk is frothy and creamy.Shettys diversion into healthycooking began 10 years ago, when the teetotaller and non-smoker went to the doctor gasping for breath. All my parameters were abnormal, I had high blood pressure, uric acid, blood pressure, diabetes. What does health mean, I asked myself? recalls Shetty, who went on to study naturopathy. I am a second-generation restaurateur and I started working in the kitchen when I was in the seventh standard. So, I understand human emotions when it comes to food. I want my customers to believe that they can counter imbalances by choosing the right food, he asserts.If you head out to Aharveda, do remember, that their last order is at 8 p.m., as according to naturopathy rules, you shouldnt be eating later than that.Aharveda , Andheri West; 40722211/40722212"
5a0b55769855b76bf13ce4cc,Refreshing twist and taste,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/refreshing-twist-and-taste/article19282329.ece,2017-07-15,"I knocked at quite a few doors in Meharchand Market one afternoon last week, in search of an elusive eatery called CJs Fresh. I had stumbled upon the name while surfing the net. It sounded good, for on the menu were all kinds of interesting sandwiches and pasta dishes. But the problem was that I just couldnt find it.The address was 39 Meharchand Market. I found No. 39, but that was not an eatery. I walked up the stairs and knocked at a door, and found it locked. I came down, asked some peoplemost of whom were clueless. Then a good Samaritan asked me to try the back entry through a small lane behind the shops lining the main market. I followed the directions, and luckily found a small sticker that told me I was on the right track. I followed the sign, walked up a steep flight of stairsand finally I was in CJs Fresh.Interesting menuCJs Fresh is a take-away which does deliveries (Phone: 9910501234; email: fresh@cjsfresh.com). Run by a young lady called Chahat Jain, it has an interesting menuwith sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, burgers, fries, milkshakes and desserts. I had done my research, so I knew what I wanted even before I landed up there. I had seen a picture of a bowl of pasta with juicy pieces of bacon on it, so that was on top of my list. Then we had decided to have a vegetable sandwich, and a meaty one.The formercalled Getting Grilled (Rs. 280), comprised eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, rocket leaves, smoked cheese, herbs and CJs secret sauce. The Ham and Cheddar Affiliation (Rs. 349 ) had roasted ham and melted cheddar cheese with aioli and herbs. The Carbonara Crewfor Rs. 349was a bacon, cheese and pasta dish.I got talking to a lady at the counter, and heard that the place was started by her daughter just four months ago. She had studied in the US, and had returned to India full of food plans. She now wants to start an outlet near Chhattarpur.It should prosper, for the sandwiches were excellent. The pasta was superb, creamy and cheesy, as Carbonara is meant to be, and the bacon pieces were juicy and plump and fried just right. I had asked for a wheat pasta preparation, so I felt quite healthydespite all the rich bits that had gone in itwhen I was done with it.Secret sauceThe sandwiches (grilled panini, focaccia or multigrain) were soft and full of goodies. The fillings were fresh, and the cheese had oozed nicely into the ham-and-cheddar sandwich. The veggie one had a burst of flavourswith rockets and cherry tomatoes complementing the smoothness of the smoked cheese. I dont know what their secret sauce is (its secret, so I didnt ask), but it certainly gave a zing to the sandwich.I am quite a burger fiend, so I want to try out CJs burgers one of these days. The descriptions sound good: Twisty Aloo Burger (Rs. 279) has a potato filling with mint mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, sauted onions and cheddar cheese; the Pork Pack (Rs. 379) consists of pulled pork tossed in sweet chipotle, pickled black olives and mozzarella and Gangsta Lamb (Rs. 399) has a lamb patty topped with a three cheese blend, pine nuts, caramelised onions, lettuce and herbs, in a special hung curd dip.The lady insisted that I try out a slice of their fresh cheesecake. I agreed, and found it delicious, though I thought it was somewhere in between a cheesecake and a souffl. The Cheesecake Monopoly is for Rs. 210, and they have, among other things, a peanut butter and white chocolate cookie coalition (Rs. 120 for two) and Mos Nutella Fried Oreos (Rs. 150 for 5 pieces).I like young people with big dreams, and hope their dreams all come to true. The secret sauce should do its bit."
5a0b56b99855b76bf13ce59a,Alarmist? Not at all,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/strategic-insights/alarmist-not-at-all/,2017-08-04,"India finds itself at a crossroads. Bullied by the Dragon on the east, who constantly threatens war on the flimsiest of grounds. Pestered by the eternal enemy to the west, who is emboldened by the support it receives from the Dragon as well as by its impending victory in Afghanistan.India has a friend in Israel. Other than that, it really doesnt have a friend in the world. But Israel has its own constraints. It is too small. It makes great arms, but of the bits-and-pieces kind. Befriending Israel has allowed India to get on the right side of the influential American Jewish community.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia may not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.But Americas Jews have been unable to prevent America from dumping Israel for Iran. Israel became livid with Obama. But Trump is honouring the Iran deal. And then Israel craves recognition from its enemies, many Muslim nations. Already the Saudis are buddies with Israel. What happens if they recognize Israel, and then Pakistan follows suit?In any case, Israel is too small, too besieged, too far away from India to come to our aid in any substantive fashion in case of a conflict with the Dragon.If the conflict with the Dragon explodes into anything more than a mere skirmish, expect the eternal enemy to jump into the fray. Pakistans media is eerily silent on the friction between us and the Dragon. Now that the generals are fully in charge of the country, they are not going to sit idle in opening a second front. It would represent a dream opportunity for them.So what should we do? Just follow what the expert of realpolitik, Indira Gandhi, did. Kiss and make up with the Russians. Boris Yeltsin admittedly was openly derisive of India. That made Messrs. Rao, Vajpayee, and Manmohan, turn by turn, spurn the Russians for the allure of the US.But what has true friendship with the US got us? Empty platitudes such as natural allies, strategic partners, and little else. Sure we got the nuclear deal, but the Americans, just because their own reactors are defunct and outdated, keep pushing more and more liability down our throats.Trump came to power promising to curb H-1Bs and launch a trade war with China. He has done none of the latter, but has gone after H-1Bs with full force. H-1Bs constitute our major export to the US. Today we have Heinz tomato sauce instead of the earlier-perfectly delicious Kisan, Lays potato chips instead of Indian versions, and Coca Cola and Pepsi instead of Thums Up and Campa Cola.American goods have flooded India, and keep flooding in more and more. India has an upper middle and elite class of 150 million which can afford anything that the 100 million American middle and upper class can. America is saturated as a market. India represents a new America to the Americans. Thats why they drool all over us with idle lip-service.America has not got us what we want  a UN permanent seat. Nor have the British and the French. Yet we keep buying major arms and goods from them. We should close our markets to them unless and until they get us the UN seat. Even so, they will not come to our aid in case of conflict with our neighbours.Thats where Vladimir Putin and Indira Gandhi come in. Putin has been cold to India. He is miffed at us for abandoning him for the West. But Leonid Brezhnev was no easy customer. And Indira was able to bear hug him to save us from the Americans.Our first port of call for any major arms supply should be the Russians. We should consider signing a treaty of friendship and eternal cooperation with them just as Indira did. The effect on the Chinese will be immediatethey will back off. We should buy arms from the West only if the Russians cannot supply them to us.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia made not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.Lets just do what Indira did in 1971 and made India proud of her. By doing so, we will make her proud of us."

5a0b64479855b76bf13ceecf,A taste of two cities,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-taste-of-two-cities/article19291984.ece,2017-07-17,"The gastronomy of a city hotel can let you in to some wonderful secrets. Of a citys past and its imminent future, of its local flavour and its global mix. On my recent European sojourn, I discovered how contemporary epicurean trends of two cities defined its new ethos. London has finally become a firm Mecca of global epicureanism. A city that was scoffed at for knowing little aside from bangers and mash, fish n chips and, perhaps, chicken tikka masala, has a few surprises under its hat.On arriving at the The Shangri-La London, I was greeted by a swanky gold Bentley, then whisked to the 35th floor of Renzo Pianos looming Shard, the wind vigorously trying to break through the windows.Perched 128 metres high in the tallest building in Europe, with the moon by your knees and all of London at your feet, this was the perfect place to call my own little Shangri La.Yin, yang and LondonWith infinite views of the city, I finally got what its food really stood for  Brexit or not, its one that captures global spirit in the most generous way. The gastronomy at the Shangri-La Londons Tng was the perfect metaphor for the city  featuring its hottest modern European menu with a subtle Asian touch.Much like a performance, the meal began with salmon: beetroot, avocado, wasabi and ponzu paired with a blushing medium-bodied Chateau Plaisance Ros 2016 from Fronton in south west France, a blend of Negrette, Gamay and Syrah  the match complemented the fattiness and texture of the robust fish and ponzu. A prelude to my East-meets-West story of London.As did the wonderfully generous pork: barbecue carrot, barley, basil, potato and dashi paired with the aromatic medium-bodied Gewurztraminer Hugel Classic 2013, a white wine from Alsace, with low acidity diluting the natural salt in the meat and the fruity bouquet simmering the spice in the dish  a balance that can only come from the yin and yang.The very delicate halibut: kohlrabi, miso, chives, parmesan, orange was a multi-ingredient extravaganza, a sweet and sour sensorial experience complemented by the very clean and straightforward Chenin Blanc, Premier Rendez Vous, Jousset 2013 from Loire valley, full of oak and ripe stone fruit.As the sommelier-par-excellence Leonardo Barlondi whispered, the wine pairing is done keeping in mind every single ingredient on the plate and the cooking method. The Chocolate Delice Arctic Roll a humoristic ode to the erstwhile cassata paired firmly with a Hennessy XO.London brings globally-inspired gastronomy (with a nod to the East) to the forefront with all its mysticism and perfect harmony. It recognises the millennial need to be multi-cultural at the whim of a bite. At the cutting edge of creativity with the most magical view of the city, Tng is also possibly the most romantic dining experience in London.Discipline meets decadenceThe Shangri-La Hotel in Paris is perhaps its best kept secret. Tucked away in the quiet, historic 16th Arrondissement, in the erstwhile private mansion of Napoleons great-nephew Roland Bonaparte, it stands up to the classic hotels of the city with the best views of the Eiffel Tower. It is traditional French classical luxury redefined with Eastern hospitality.In a city that scores a high number of Michelin stars , the Shangri-La Hotel Paris extends deep reverence to mixology and gastronomy, the traditional French way with an Eastern discipline. The result  haute cuisine and mixology that endorses Frances deep-rooted tradition of food and wine in contemporary and au courant spirit.Roland Bonaparte was flora-obsessed and had the worlds largest private plant collection with over 25,00,000 specimens, and Le Bar Botaniste is the perfect ode to this legacy. Clment Emery, head mixologist, crafts the most bespoke and artisanal cocktails with plants and herbs. Think Sichuan peppers, tonka beans, even pine cones. On my little whim of tasting a Parisian summer, he created a blend of fresh apricots, mezcal del maguey vida (a distilled spirit made of agave), agave syrup topped with fresh organic lemon juice and lavender bitters. One sip (and a glass later), I had arrived at my destination. Next up, the Bumble Bee, a rosemary-infused cognac with organic lemon juice, honey from Provence topped with Fentimans tonic (the first botanically brewed light tonic water), absinthe and egg-white.Tradition meets modernityIt is an experiment in sheer decadence, but then Emerys cocktails are artisanal and intelligent, much like him. (His degrees in philosophy and french literature may have something to do with it.) I was high on just his clarity of vision of mixology  unusual flavours with balance, exciting and always lip-smacking, with the perfectionism of, well, a botanist. A wonderful tribute to Monsieur Bonaparte. And so French; playing with legacies to perfection.This was followed by a meal at the two-Michelin-starred LAbeille, helmed by iconic Chef Christophe Moret, giving a firm nod to the Napoleonic emblem of the bee (in design) and haute French gastronomy.Ensconced in a beautiful dining room across a secret garden, under the watchful eye of the sommelier, Matthias Meynard, we began our contemporary French odyssey with a delicate royal sea urchin and gold caviar glistening on the palate with Veuve Clicquot Vintage 2008. To heaven and back is perhaps the quickest way to describe the first course. The Cotentin Spider Crab with cucumber, almonds and caviar raised the momentum with a crisp Mosel Riesling Kabinett Josephshfer Von Kesselstatt 2008.The hero of the evening was the John Dory with sauted abalone,kachaand Le Croisic seaweed and salsa verde  crunchy, like spring in your mouth. Aided generously by the Meursault premier Cru Genvrires Michel Bouzereau 2011, you wish this course would last forever. The texture is full of surprises going from crispy to soft to more mature and glazed.A 36-month-old Comt from Haut-Doubs ended the two hour-long foodgasm along with French Alps cherries and Sakura tea, cured sheep cheese, clafoutis and fresh almonds culminating with the Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise 2015. Trained under Alain Ducasse, Chef Moret sees life bursting in fresh produce, and he breathes a new culinary artistry into it. And it makes me want to sing my own little rendition of Edith Pilaf. With a culture that likes to hold on to its tradition while embracing modernity, LAbeille is what Paris is all about. And perhaps also the ultimate act of creation in France today.The writer is Managing Director Sothebys India and also a gastronome and oenophile. Follow him on @champagneboy75"

""The workers were given a day off to cool down and we arranged a mediation between the contractor , the workers and officials from the labour department. However, no FIR has been registered in the matter,"" said ACP Manish Sehgal.Around 2,000 workers are employed by Leighton India Contractors Private Limited that is constructing the condominium. A construction worker told TOI on condition of anonymity that their basic needs were being long ignored by the contractor and their repeated complaints to Leighton India's management had only fallen on deaf ears. ""The contractor earlier deducted Rs 600 a month from our salaries for meal, which was recently raised to Rs 900 a month. But we are still served the same menu, including a potato curry, everyday. The contractor never offers us even a single non-vegetarian dish,"" said the worker.The workers also alleged that there weren't enough buses to transport them to their camps, despite deduction of transportation charges from their wages. ""Moreover, the contractor only allots overtime duties to their favourite ones,"" said the worker.""We have asked the contractor to provide a non-vegetarian dish to workers at least once a week. Also, the workers said due to the shortage of vehicles, they had to wait after their shifts to go home. So, we have asked the contractor to increase the number of buses from 15 to 20,"" said Dinesh Kumar, deputy labour commissioner, Gurgaon.""We have also instructed the construction company to set up a grievance cell for all labour-related issues and resolve the complaints within 48 hours,"" said SDM Bharat Bhushan Gogia.However, when contacted, Leighton India denied any labour unrest at the construction site. ""There have been some queries with regard to altercations between the workers and their supervisors at the site. We would like to put it on record that those were minor in nature stemming from some misunderstanding and have been amicably resolved between the two parties,"" it said."

The only source for villagers, who mainly depend on jowar (sorghum) cultivation, is the rainwater flowing down from the hills around. Even the hill stream slowed down due to a dry spell three years ago.A change in the matrix introduced by a 29-year-old college dropout saved the parched village from a crisis. Nasri Chavan suggested that the crops be grown in rows instead of columns. Earlier, when the lines were straight, water from hills could not be retained in the fields. With horizontal plantations the water stayed and the dry spell could be managed.All farms in the village are right at the foothills. Outlets were dug to let water flow from one field to another. Chavan bagged the state government's Krushi Bhushan award for innovative farming. The prize was handed by chief ministerDevendra Fadnavis over last week.""Today as much as 1,800 hectares farms have adopted the practice. Earlier, we could hardly manage to earn Rs50,000 a year, nothing could be saved. Now we get around Rs1.5 lakh purely from jowar cultivation,"" Chavan told TOI.Chavan came up with her own formula of organic fertilizers, adding cow urine, dung, neem leaves and other similar ingredients. ""If horizontal lines saved water, the fertilizers helped increasing the output. I shared the formula with others and some have now shifted to the organic manure. A majority still use chemical fertilizers though,"" she said.""With little income from farming, buying costly chemical fertilizers hardly left any savings in hand. This prompted me to search for an alternative. Using the organic manure doubled the output at 10 quintals an acre,"" said Chavan who tills a five-acre plot along with her father.She is among the seven from Amravati division to have got the awards last week. The division covers Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana districts.After Sachin Sarde's father underwent a heart surgery, there was no one else in the family to look after the farms. ""My elder brother is physically challenged so I had to discontinue studies and take up farming. Water is scarce in our area and soyabean is the main crop. I took a risk and started cultivating bananas which is a water intensive crop, and succeeded,"" he said. Sarde is also a college dropout from Shirpurjain village of Washim district.Apart from using a sprinkler system through a bore well dug in his farm, Sarde used a select combination of seed sand fertilizers which gave a higher output.Ravindra Metkar of Masla village in Amravati had only one acre of land on which he ran a poultry farm. Using the profits he increased the holding and chicken waste generated from the poultry farm was used as fertilizers. ""I could gradually increase the holding to 35 acres, for a yearly turnover of Rs15 lakh,"" he said.""When I first started farming, I used the fertilizers made out of chicken waste on an experimental basis. The results were evident in the size of plants. I began with cotton and have now diversified to fruits and spices also,"" added Metkar.Cotton and soyabean are the main crop of large part of Vidarbha. Himmat Tappe, tried to venture out in potato and ginger cultivation apart from horticulture. This earned him a yearly profit of Rs15 lakh from 20 acres of land. ""Even during lean times, the profit is as much as Rs10 lakh,"" he said.Laxmi Parvekar from Savana village in Yavatmal shifted to surgarcane, rose and banana farming in this otherwise cotton belt. Banana trees were grown using tissue culture roots. ""The plants bear fruits in 10 months instead of 18 month time taken in other varieties,"" she said.(With inputs from Viraj Deshpande)"

""The prices of paddy have crashed but the prices of rice have not come down, the prices of cotton have crashed but the prices of clothes have not come down, the prices of poplar have crashed but the prices of plywood continue to remain high, the prices of potatoes have crashed but the prices of potato chips continue to go up, prices of tomatoes have crashed while the prices of tomato sauce continue to rise,"" Hooda said.There are around 433 villages in Mewat and farming is one of the primary occupations in these villages. Being a backward district, the farmers have been battling poverty here.""The Union government has imposed 18% goods and services tax on pesticides, which is a cause of worry for farmers as it increases the cost of the final produce,"" said Sulaiman, a farmer.The farmers also said that they were not paid the full price of their produces. ""While the tomato is being sold for Rs 90 a kilo in the retail market, a farmer only gets 50 paise a kilo in the mandi. Similarly, they sell onion for Re 1 a kilo, while consumers buy it for Rs 60 a kilo. Why is there no profit for the farmers,"" questioned a farmer, who was present at the mahapanchayat."

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

We sample flinty Basque txacolis at ostentatiously trendy pintxo bars. Drink tall, chilled glasses of Mahou, the capitals popular pilsner, with crackly bags of potato crisps. Then, we discover vermouth, heady, herbaceous and deliciously pungent, served with a bright tangle of orange peels. Were hooked.Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankees Spanish song Despacito is the countrys current soundtrack, blasting with equal fervour in clubs and supermarkets, and vermouth is its contemporary drink of choice. Despacito, an essentially Spanish track, has been sexed-up, glossed and accessorised so skilfully that it has become the worlds most streamed music track in just six months, with about 4.6 billion plays across streaming platforms, according to Universal Music. Similarly, vermouth, once proudly provincial, is being downed in bars from London to San Francisco, in its current slick, urbane, updated avatar.At a traditional bodega, sweltering with packed crowds, in Madrids arty Lavapies district, we drink it at the bar standing up, along with Patitas de Calamar, freshly fried squid feet. In the citys cavernous indoor markets, filled with raucous families, we hurriedly down a glass (or three) between buying bushels of juicy cherries, sticky pista nougat and paper-thin slices of Jamn ibrico.From grannys closetAt the immensely Instagrammable Mercado de San Miguel  a glamorous bartender serves it on tap, sliding our glasses across the bar along with a bowl of addictively tart green olives.This used to be the drink of our grandmothers, she says, before attending to a group of excitable Japanese tourists, who attempt to order everything off the menu. The options are sweet and dry. If youre a first-timer, she suggests you go with the sweet version. Served with a splash of soda and twist of orange peel, the drink is bright with an alluring chorus of synchronised flavours. Im familiar with it as a cocktail ingredient  it is essential in Martinis, Negronis and Manhattans  but really comes into its own when treated as the headliner instead of just another spot boy.This is an aromatised, fortified wine, flavoured with botanicals. Manufacturers start with a neutral grape wine, then add alcohol and a signature blend of about 40 or more, often bitter, botanicals, which include herbs, roots, barks, flowers, seeds and spices. The most notorious of these is wormwood, also present in absinthe. (Incidentally, vermouth is derived from the German word for wormwood, which is wermut).Italian originsThe drink was first produced in Turin, Italy, in the mid-18th Century, according to liquor historians (and what a fun job that must be!). Italian and French blends have defined the drink internationally, some of the best known brands are Italian Martini and Rossi, Cinzano and French Noilly Prat. Spain, however, has some very high quality versions. There are those made by established companies, usually in Reus, like Yzaguirre and Miro. There are also seasonal, hyper-local producers making Spanish vermouth, which is lighter and sweeter than the Italian and French versions.You can order yours extra-dry white, sweet white, red, amber and even as a ros. Admittedly, the extra-dry versions take some getting used to; theyre sharp and austere. Dry has a touch more flavour; think of an arid land in spring time. Then comes the sweet variety, reminiscent of a lush, moist, tropical forest.In America, the Quady winery makes Vya, an artisanal version that uses botanicals from India, Albania, Russia, Spain and Morocco. Australian Regal Rogue range marries a Hunter Valley Semillon with native lemon myrtle, desert limes, thyme and elderflower. The Ethicurean restaurant in Somerset has a house vermouth called The Collector, which incorporates 20 botanicals grown in their garden, including bay, rosemary, and yarrow. In London, Mele e Pere, which has been making its own version for five years, even has a vermouthier-in-chief called Ed, who teaches customers how to blend their own for 25 a night.Guide to vermouthAt a bookstore in San Sebastian, I stumble upon Ester Bachs Romagueras Gua del vermut (Vermouth Guide). The lady who runs the bookstore spots me flipping through the Spanish book, and insists I visit Bar Roberto for a drink. This is where I finally learn how to make the perfect cocktail: and it stars vermouth, of course.In the tiny wooden bar, which is standing room only, the friendly proprietor hands me a complimentary gilda, comprising deftly skewered mellow guindilla chillies, anchovies and olive, then pours out a sweet vermouth with a flourish. His bar blackboard lists about 20 varieties, and the shelves behind him groan with bottles from all over the world. He adds ice cubes, bitters, netted orange zest and an olive-laced toothpick. I take a sip: Its like rain in a jungle on a warm summer day.A loyal Roberto customer smiles and says, I have eaten a smoked sardine and drunk a vermouth that has lifted my beret. (Or at least thats what Google Translate Spanish to English says.) Honestly, I couldnt have put it better.Incidentally, vermouthis derived from the German word for wormwood, whichis wermutmost expensive MartiniLast year, a Scottish distillery created a Martini worth 50,000.

KarthikeyanAcute drought owing to failure of the southwest monsoon has left thousands of potato growers on upper Kodaikanal hill in distress.With no rain till July end, potato growers in Gundupatti, Mannavanur, Klavarai and nearby villages on the hill have left their land barren. This has led to a sharp decline in the total area under potato cultivation.A few traditional potato growers, who have little ground water source, have shifted to garlic, which requires less water and maintenance. But they too are struggling to protect the standing crop.The district received 3.06 mm rain in July, 90% less than the normal rainfall of 30.6 mm. The situation was the same in June.Rain water is a must to energise potato crop, which grows on slopes. We should have sown the seeds after the first showers of this monsoon, said S. Sivakumar of Gundupatti village, 45 km away from Kodaikanal town. Periodical showers since sowing are also essential to protect the crop. Shortage of rain will affect size and quality of the potato.Potato cultivation is a costly affair, he added. We had to invest heavily. Seeds are imported from Mettupalayam. The price of a seed bag cost Rs. 5,000. At least, we need 10 bags to raise the crop in one acre.Farmers had a better yield two years ago, with the procurement price at Rs. 25 a kg. We hired trucks and mini lorries in Kodaikanal town to transport potato to the market, he recalled.Sivakumar suffered a huge loss of Rs. 9 lakh last year because of drought. Each farmer had to shell out at least Rs. 1 lakh to raise potato crop. The yield should have been at least 400 bags, each 45 kg, to get reasonable returns. But it was less than 20 kg. The crops withered completely. By this time, sowing should have been over. But it is barren now, he rued.Several acres of land, traditionally under potato cultivation, in Gundupatti remain barren. Not even 10% of the potato growers have raised the crop this year. Similar situation prevails in other potato growing centres on Upper Kodaikanal. The hill station has been reeling under drought for the second consecutive year. Scanty rain haunts Kaunji, another major potato production centre.However, farmers, who have little ground water source in Kookal panchayat, have shifted to garlic. Despite the drought, those who had managed to harvest garlic last year enjoyed good returns. They too are struggling to protect the standing crop today.Talking to The Hindu , Horticulture Officer Shiny Divya said: Farmers may go for sowing till September or even October. Sharp showers in the last 48 hours may cheer them to sow. But delay in rain will affect quality of crop."

RamakrishnaG._RamakrishnaVegetable prices in the city have soared owing to poor rainfall last month and late arrival of loads from other states and districts. While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains. And then with rains, transportation and storage became a problem, said N. Nagamani, a vegetable seller in Mehdipatnam.Due to fall in prices at the procurement end, several farmers had to dump their produce including rich harvest of tomatoes last month, she said.As the month progresses, the prices are expected to dip as more produce will come from other states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, agriculturists predicted.Usually the month of August is when the prices dip with fresh harvest coming in. It has not happened so far but soon there will be a fall, said Sarampally Mallareddy from Communist Party of Indias farmers collective."
