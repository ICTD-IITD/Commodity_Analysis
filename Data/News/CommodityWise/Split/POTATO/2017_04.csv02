All the girls were rushed to the area hospital for treatment. Three girls were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital as their condition was serious. All the students are said to be stable now.The girls who consumed hostel food in the evening started vomiting around midnight and they were immediately shifted in 108 ambulances to area hospital by the hostel authorities. It is learnt that they reportedly consumed potato and tomato curry with rice for dinner in the hostel mess after which they began to show signs of uneasiness.Parents of the girls, who reached the hospital after learning about the incident, alleged that the students had been complaining about the hostel mess' poor quality of food for a long time but the management ignored their complaints.According to sources, the students of the gurukul are not happy with the hostel mess food and in the past too such incidents have taken place, but of a lesser magnitude, and the matter was kept a secret. Students told reporters that though they have been complaining about the poor quality of food to the school principal, no action was taken to improve the quality.""Worms are found in the food often. We complained about it to the principal many times but he did nothing. The cook always makes unhygienic food,"" a student said.Though the students were rushed to the area hospital for treatment there were not enough doctors to attend them. The hospital superintendent had to request Bayyaram government hospital doctors to rush immediately to help them in treating the girls.Local MLA Shankar Naik, who rushed to hospital after learning about the incident, fumed at hospital authorities as doctors were not available to treat the girls. Joint collector and DEO, who also reached the hospital to take stock of the situation, expressed displeasure over the way the hospital was functioning. They pulled up the hospital superintendent for non-availability of doctors in the hospital during night hours.Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari, who also holds education minister's portfolio, expressed anger over the incident and directed his department officials to immediately cancel the contract of the caterers. He directed district collector Preeti Meena to take steps to provide proper treatment to the girls.The deputy chief minister, who is touring Warangal rural district, also spoke to the hospital superintendent, who informed him that the condition of all the girls was stable and that they would be discharged by evening. He also directed the collector to take stringent action against the persons responsible for the incident.Meanwhile, Congress, CPI and students' union activists gathered in front of the hospital and demanded that the government take stringent action against the gurukul warden, principal and cook. They also wanted the collector to take action against the doctors for staying away from duty.The police have registered a case and are investigating. Food inspectors have collected samples consumed by the students for testing them in labs."

Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"
5a0dbd7b9855b76bf13d136b,What to blame for your stomach bug?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/622010/what-blame-your-stomach-bug.html,2017-07-10,"What to blame for your stomach bug?Kate Murphy, International New York Times, Jul 11 2017, 0:03 IST'People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but it's probably the thing before the last thing they ate.'gut feeling: Most of us experience an ""acute gastrointestinal event"" at least once a year. While such an event may not need any medication, it tends to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. Reading the clues might reduce risk in the future. NYTIt happens like a bolt out of the blue. One minute youre fine, and the next you begin to sweat as crippling cramps move wavelike through your belly. You vomit or have diarrhoea, or both, fearing you wont live to see another day. And then it goes away. Youre back to your old self, maybe after a day or two of binge-watching Netflix, chasing dry crackers with ginger ale.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this scenario, known as an acute gastrointestinal event, happens to all of us at least once a year. The bouts, while extremely unpleasant, usually dont occasion a trip to the doctor or require any medication.But such events tend to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. While its hard to know for sure, there are clues that might help you determine the source and reduce your risk in the future. People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but its probably the thing before the last thing they ate, said Dr Deborah Fisher, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine.It takes the stomach around four to six hours to empty a full meal, and then the small intestine takes about six to eight hours to squeeze out all the nutrients and empty into the colon. The remains linger there for another one to three days, fermenting and being formed into what ultimately is flushed down the toilet. The so-called bowel transit time varies significantly from person to person, but gastroenterologists said you can easily find out whats normal for you by eating corn and watching for when the indigestible kernels appear in your stool.Gross, perhaps, but with that baseline, the next time you get sick, youll be better able to estimate when you might have eaten the offending meal. For example, if you throw up something and dont have diarrhoea or roiling further down, it could be that what made you ill was something you ate within the last four to six hours. If you wake up in the middle of the night with cramps and diarrhoea, its more likely something you consumed a good 18 to 48 hours earlier, depending on the results of your corn test.Most food-borne illnesses are caused by viruses or bacteria, such as norovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter, salmonella, E coli and Bacillus cereus. So in addition to figuring out the correct time-frame of consumption, also consider what foods are more likely to be contaminated. Items cited frequently on the Food and Drug Administrations food recall list include leafy greens, culinary herbs, melons with textured surfaces like cantaloupe, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, jalapeo peppers, nut butters, shellfish, frozen peas, cheese and ice cream.Also suspicious are any foods left out for several hours, like the classic potato salad at the family picnic or fried rice at a Chinese buffet.Restaurant food tends to be riskier in general not only because more hands are involved in the preparation but also because the ingredients are ordered in bulk. A fast-food hamburger could have meat from a hundred different cows, Fisher said, and it takes only one with a pathogen to make you sick. The eggs in your two-egg omelette were poured out of a carton so it could have come from 50 different chickens, she said.Similarly suspect are freshly made juices and smoothies which are extracted from pounds and pounds of produce. Just one speck of contaminated dirt in your detox drink could upend your gut. And think of all the hands that necessarily touched the produce from the time it was picked in the field to when it was chopped and crammed into the Vitamix.Lets not forget about germs on your own hands if youre not diligent about washing them with soap and water. Did you eat or otherwise put your fingers in your mouth after gripping the pole on the subway or after throwing a slobbery ball for your dog? Did you put your mobile phone down on the table at a coffee shop  or on top of the toilet-paper dispenser in a public restroom  and then put it up to your mouth to take a call? Germs that make it into your digestive tract dont always come from food.And sometimes your gut distress isnt caused by a germ at all. It could be an overdose of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, known in public health circles as Fodmaps. These are essentially carbohydrates that, eaten in excess, are not well absorbed in the small intestine and then make their way into your colon to cause all kinds of trouble. They include myriad things were encouraged to eat including broccoli, brussels sprouts, radicchio, asparagus, avocados, mushrooms, peaches, whole grains and legumes.People are trying to eat so healthy these days, but a lot of those things are high in Fodmaps, said Dr Scott Gabbard, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. You could always eat a lot of salad, but on that certain day, that certain combination of fruits and vegetables in your salad was just high enough in Fodmaps that it overrode your systems capability to absorb those carbohydrates and you ended up with something almost like a purging.Gastrointestinal eventsDrugs are also a common source of acute gastrointestinal events. Fisher mentioned the story of an otherwise healthy and active patient who had bouts of GI distress every few months or so. After many tests came back negative, she finally determined it was the ACE inhibitor he was taking to control his blood pressure.A side effect of the drug is that it causes swelling in the intestines so he would get these temporary, partial obstructions, Fisher said. He would vomit and skip a meal and then the swelling would go down. It went on and on until we took him off that drug and now hes fine.Medications used to treat depression, allergies and gastrointestinal reflux can also make you more vulnerable to intense, short duration attacks of vomiting or diarrhoea, or both. Recreational drugs could also be the culprit. Were starting to see more cyclic vomiting syndrome called cannabis hyperemesis because THC content of marijuana now is so high, Gabbard said, referring to psychoactive component of marijuana.Finally, theres stress. Whats going on in your head has an enormous impact on your gut and vice versa. The human brain and nervous system is very intimately mixed with another nervous system that is present in the walls of the intestine, said D Santhi Swaroop Vege, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic.So instead of something that you ate, it could be youve swallowed your fear, anxiety, anger or sadness and its wreaking havoc on the nerves, chemical secretions and microbiota that keep your bowels operating smoothly. Gastroenterologists as well as psychiatrists said its not uncommon for acute gastrointestinal events to cease or become less frequent after a patient quits a bad job or leaves a bad relationship. Thats why, when making a difficult decision, you might just want to trust your gut."

Also, Mani Shankar Aiyar, senior Congress party leader joined the protest and blamed the union government for not addressing the demands of farmers. These poor people are wandering between Delhi and Chennai but not getting any decent answer, so they have again come here, Aiyar said.The children of famers who have committed suicide gathered again at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday and narrated their ordeal through a play. Describing their sufferings, Ashok Patil, one of the children said, A number of politicians have visited us in our Ashram and made a lot of promises. But all we get to see is a picture of the politician in the next days newspapers. Do they visit us to help us or to click selfies with us, he asked.On Wednesday farmers from Uttar Pradesh also raised their issues and said that government is unnecessarily putting financial burden on potato farmers asking them to keep the crop in cold storage without helping them financially. The government wants us to store our crop in cold storage. But the truth is that the price our crop fetches us is way less than the cost of keeping them in cold storage, Aamir, leader of potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh said.The protest was also addressed by a wife of a farmer from Tamil Nadu who committed suicide after he couldnt repay loan. She claimed that his husband committed suicide because he was harassed by the bank officials for not repaying the loan. The bank officials asked my husband how he was able to buy clothes for me if he was unable to repay his loans. Why is it always the poor who are humiliated, what about the rich that run away with crores of rupees? On Monday, at least a 100 farmers came back to the national capital for a second protest stint."

The restaurant has introduced a new menu that includes signature Italian dishes and exotic ingredients. For starters, we were served Fungi misti e Formaggi, Chicken crostini and Calamari, acciughe e fritti di Gamberi.Fungi misti e Formaggi is a platter of mushrooms mixed with fresh greens, walnuts, broccoli and cheese. It has the nutty flavour of walnuts, bitterness of blanched broccoli and the earthy flavour of grilled mushrooms, and comes with an Italian dressing. The Chicken crostini has grilled pesto chicken, olives, onions, bell peppers on a crunchy Tuscan bread served with mixed greens. The olives neutralises the cheese. Smothered in a creamy, basil pesto, it brings out the char-grilled taste of the chicken. It serves as a comfort food.The Calamari in Calamari acciughe e fritti di Gamberi is crunchy and chewy. The crispy soft prawns in the platter goes well with the dip. It is served with french fries and salad. To cleanse our palate, an intermediate course of fruit sorbets topped with mint leaves are served. Next comes the main course. The Risotto aifunghi misti e porri has mushrooms blended with leek risotto prepared with truffle oil. Warm and starchy, it is healthy and makes you feel good. It's a dish that you can have during the rains. The Chicken scaloppini has thinly sliced chicken breast with truffle-flavoured mushroom wine butter sauce, grilled mushroom, tomato and buttered creamy spinach.The platter has garlic mashed potatoes and rosemary grilled veggies that includes broccoli, beans and cauliflower.

It has a dominant pungent taste of garlic.The Burro di Dory e aranciapan is a fried polenta crusted John Dory fish with lemon couscous, spaghetti of vegetables, tomato salsa and orange butter sauce. The dish is not bad but it did not meet our expectations.The fish looks crunchy but is not. The vegetables in the noodles adds crunch to the dish. It has grainy Mediterranean khus khus. The desserts are the highlight. The Salted Vanilla Cheese Cake is the best of the lot. It looks so colourful and appealing that you don't want to disturb the presentation. Served with ice cream, the cheesecake platter also has strawberry sauce. Most Americans prefer to have the cheesecake topped with this sauce.But, people here might not take to it and, hence, it is served on the side. The Chocolate, Banana crepe is nice. The thin crepe is smooth. It is caramelised right. The chocolate sauce does not overpower the taste of the banana. It is served with almond Praline and Vanilla ice cream.

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

It is interesting because it is a country still recovering from a genocide and, this fictional account, is told through the eyes of a UN staffer Joseph.The book is an intimate sketch of a country and its people, and it weaves their history into this narrative seamlessly. For example, you meet the driver Tulong and know that his slowness in responding to answers could come from a cunning. He may not have forgotten that a wrong answer -- like confessing to having read a piece of stray paper or taking an extra serving of watery rice gruel -- once had resulted in days of lashing and being chained to a plank. But Tulongs kindness and capacity for affection have survived the horrors, and he like other Cambodians sees aid agencies as deliverers.Cambodia was one of UNs success stories, says the author. The agency was key in transforming the country, after the Paris Peace Accords in 1991.But Joseph does not deny the historic injustice done to the country by the very same agency, when it allowed Khmer Rouge to represent the country in the UN. The agencys policies where largely driven by the US, says Joseph, who served 20 years with the international agency. Since Cambodia was liberated from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese, arch enemies of US at that time, the UN sided with the genocidal group. As the saying goes, my enemys enemy is my friend.One observation the author makes is that none of the people he spoke to, during his decade in Cambodia, ever admitted to being part of the Khmer Rouge regime. They always spoke as victims, he says. But I got the sense that few of them were actually perpetrators of the horrors.There was a man who told Joseph about betraying friends to save yourself. They were served rice gruel twice every day and occasionally, like when there is an anniversary, they are given a piece of potato with it. A seven year old saw a piece of potato fall to the ground and picked it up. He was being watched and, before he could be caught, he dropped it into his neighours bowl. The other boy was locked up and beaten for a week. The author got the feeling that the narrator was the boy who betrayed the other.Knowing that they might have been the perpetrators did not change my attitude to them, he says, it changed my attitude to me. I realised that even you and I are capable of such evil. If we are asked to arm ourselves, and control and abuse our fellow men, we might do it to.The book is mostly written in a light-hearted tone and even has jokes about UN staffers making up mission reports even before boarding the flight to the destination. This is an exagerration, says Joseph, adding with a laugh, it does happen... but not as often.Joseph, who wrote the book to get people to know Cambodia, says that the toughest thing about writing ficiton is to make it interesting. I also keep taking lanes and bye-lanes (turning away from the main narrative) and then I have to keep coming back to the main road, he says. He does this effectively, without breaking away from the central theme. oseph is the son-in-law of former Kerala minister KM Mani. He was reported to have been dismissed from government service while on one of UNs missions. But he vehemently denies this. I was not dismissed, but I was deemed to have resigned... there is a world of difference, says Joseph. He says that he had referred a dated IAS manual (printed in 1988) and believed that he had a leave extension. But the government informed him, much later and abruptly, that his resignation has been noted. In 1992, the leave rules had changed. I was shocked, a tragedy of circumstances, he says."

Kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. The snack was conceived by a small restaurant named Nizams near Hogg Market, Kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.Initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. However, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. A large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. The trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. One of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. You can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.It is fascinating to see a Kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. Freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. For an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. The filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. Then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.In Hyderabad, the Kolkata style rolls have been popularised by Roll Call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in Madhapur from 2002. They now have roll centres all over the city. Jayeeta Majumdar Singhee, one of the partners at Roll Call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from Kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like Chicken and Paneer 65 rolls for the local Hyderabadi palate. Overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. Roll Durbar in Gachibowli, Amantran in Domalguda and Kolkata House in Kondapur are some other places to enjoy Kolkata style rolls."

They were joined by farmers from U.P., Tamil Nadu and Punjab.Shiv Kumar Pushpakar, ReutersI wish no parent does what my father did to me. At least think about your children before you decide to end your life, said 13-year-old Pallavi Pawar with an unmoved expression on her face and resolve in her voice.It was around a decade ago that Pallavis father, a farmer in Maharashtras Jalgaon, decided to commit suicide, leaving behind his wife and four children. Ever since, Pallavis mother has been working on other farms to make ends meet.Memories flash byI dont remember his face clearly, but there are moments that flash before my eyes. There are memories I have of my father when he was happy, when he didnt show the turmoil brewing inside him. Looking at my mother and sisters today, I think he should have discussed things with his family. There is always a way out, she said.Pallavi was one of the over 40 children and widows of farmers from drought-hit Maharashtra who had gathered at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. They had joined the ongoing Kisan Mukti Yatra, as part of which farmers have demanded loan waivers and fixing of standard prices for their produce.Children dressed in white narrated tales of personal grief as placards reading Suicide is not the answer, Save our farmers, Farmers, dont commit suicide stood tall.The stories of these families were a grim reminder of how farmer suicides in India might just be numbers for city dwellers, but are harsh reality for children and women living in the rural belt  something they see almost everyday because of government apathy.Dont bargainWhen you buy vegetables and fruits from a farmer, you are quick to bargain for even Rs. 1. What you dont realise is that this Rs. 1 can be the difference between his children eating dinner or going to bed hungry, said Pallavi as she broke down.She continued, You will never know how much the heart of a father pains when he has to disappoint his children everyday; till one day he cannot bear it any longer and decides to end everything.Many such children who have lost their fathers stay at an ashram in Nashik, away from their homes, because their families cannot afford their upbringing.Little did three-year-old Sanju, who was guarding an earthen pot covered with a red cloth and playing with other children around, realise that the pot contained the ashes of his father who had hung himself two weeks ago after local money lenders started threatening him to repay a loan of Rs. 50, 000.Farming is riskySanjus uncle Raghu Ram, who was accompanying him, said that he was too young to realise the gravity of the loss. He couldnt help but point out how Sanjus entire life would be affected by the death of his father, who was the sole breadwinner for their family of eight.Farming is becoming a risky job. We do not want our children to live the lives that we are living. The government should think about the children and their future and do something to save our lives, he added.Eight-year-old Hari from Solapur said that he wants to be an engineer and help his mother escape the life of poverty.My mother tells me that if I study well I can help our family build a big house and buy a car, he said.Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab had also joined the protest with sacks of potatoes, demanding fair prices for their produce.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes. How can we feed our families and afford a basic living with this? The government wants us to store our produce, but the cost of storing is much higher than the return, said Amir, who was leading the potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh.Former CM presentFormer Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh, who was also present at the protest, expressed his support for the farmers and their demands of remunerative crop prices and debt-free farming. This is the time to rise above party politics and support the farmers in their fight for justice, Mr. Singh said.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes.

5a0dfd419855b76bf13d32e2,Falling in love once again at Kolkata’s Anadi Cabin,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-chopping-board/falling-in-love-once-again-at-kolkatas-aanadi-cabin/,2017-08-18,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldnt care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shirazs and the Nizams, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.Lets take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from it is overrated to the quality is not the same. Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, its too touristy!Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a story. Id been wanting to go there for a while but hadnt been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, can we chill a little bit more before the day starts?.We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.Though the restaurant is called a cabin, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didnt actually have cabins in the past. Cabin refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared cold drinks (sic) is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when open kitchens were yet to be trendy.The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of distressed look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory salad, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.Was the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?To be honest, I dont know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I havent had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture  neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.The paratha at Anadi didnt have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then werent around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniskas wife, Manishita, who didnt want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."

Aamir, leader of the potato farmers, said: ""The government wants us to store our crop in cold storage. But the truth is that the price our crop fetches us is way less than the cost of keeping them in cold storage.""Yuduvir Singh, another farmer from Agra, said, ""We have been facing a loss for the last 3 years. Anyway we have to throw away our crops  so instead of throwing it there we are disposing them here to make the government understand how dire our situation has become.""Children of farmers who had committed suicide performed a play depicting the hardships that a farmer's family has to face. Pallavi, one of the children, said: ""If the Prime Minister can let the big people get away with debt, then why not us?""Addressing the protest, Rani, wife of a farmer from Tamil Nadu who had committed suicide after being humiliated by bank officials, said, ""The bank officials asked my husband how he was able to buy clothes for me if he was unable to repay his loans. Why is it always the poor who are humiliated?""Former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijaya Singh , who was also present at Jantar Mantar, talked about the economics of the movement. ""The latest policies of the government such as demonetisation have increased black markets that have affected the farmers' sales. They have also introduced plans like 0% import duty on wheat  destroying a major percentage of business for farmers."" He further said that ""This is the time to rise above party politics and support the farmers in their fight for justice.""Raju Shetty, farmers' leader and a member of Lok Sabha, on Wednesday raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report.

5a0ec0c59855b76bf13d3e99,Trial by taste,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/trial-by-taste/article19431393.ece,2017-08-05,"Its been raining biryani. Our friends had called us over, but I  down with a nasty bug  couldnt make it. So they packed for me a big consignment of biryani from Behrouz. You may recall that I wrote about Behrouzs biryani once. It had been delivered home even before we could say gosht, and I remember how I enjoyed their kofta biryani  peppered with little mince balls.The friends generous package carried us over the weekend. And it also reminded me of the biryani that I had eaten just a few days before that  at the Press Club of India.The Club had a biryani festival. And I had some exceptional biryani there. I discovered that the biryani had been catered especially for the club by the Corporate Master Chef of the Clarks Inn Group of Hotels, Sunil Soni, and his able assistant, Junaid, who comes from a bawarchi family of Aligarh.I know biryani lovers are the most quarrelsome group that you can ever find in India, perhaps even more than mango aficionados who can never agree on what could be crowned as the king of the fruit. Likewise, those who like their Hyderabadi kachchey gosht biryani have nothing but scorn for the Awadhi biryani fan club, which, in turn, thinks the Kolkata biryani lovers should get their heads examined. And then there are those who know and love their south Indian biryanis, and shrug and say, Oh these northerners.I think the time has come to judge the biryani not just by its origins, but by the taste. Not everybody who does kachchey gosht ki biryani does it well, and some of the so-called Kolkata biryani outlets in Chittaranjan Park should be told that one potato does not maketh a Kolkata biryani. The true test lies in how good the biryani tastes.And the ones that had been prepared by Soni, Junaid and their men were simply outstanding. I had some of the Hyderabadi gosht biryani and Awadhi chicken biryani. Both were finger-licking good, and that was the unanimous opinion of our four-member household.One reason, of course, was the rice, which was of exceptional quality  long-grained and aromatic, as well as cooked to perfection, which each grain occupying its own glistening space. The meat had been cooked and spiced just right. The rich flavours came from the yakhni  stock  that had been used while the rice was being cooked. And Chef Soni tells me that some stock was also used while the meat  chicken or lamb  was being marinated with spices.The flavours of the biryanis had been enhanced with a touch of pan ki jad, which is powdered and added to the dish, and ittar. And the mildly sweet flavour came from rose petals and plump raisins.I also had the most delicious dessert I have eaten in recent times. Its called gulatthi, and is prepared with thickened milk, khoya, nuts and a bit of saffron. Unlike phirni, it doesnt have rice in it. So the flavours and texture come from the nuts and the khoya. This is a dish that is especially popular in the Aligarh-Rampur area.The biryani at the club was offered at subsidised rates, but Chef Soni (9810380519) and his team can cater for large parties, where a plate of biryani may cost Rs. 400-500, depending on the number of people and other such factors.Now that in every corner of the city you have someone selling some kind of biryani, the dish has been losing its appeal because of the substandard offerings in many of these places. These days, for instance, the moment I see a sign that says Moradabadi Biryani, I am reminded of the flavour of pickle in the rice. And let me tell you its not a happy thought.But this biryani has strengthened my belief that there are unknown jewels still waiting to be discovered. Seek, and we shall find."

In a few areas in Pune, potatoes are being sold for over Rs 20 per kg, which is a far cry from the Rs10-15 per kg just a few days ago.Rain-fed potatoes are mostly used in the processed food industry, like potato chip manufacturers and others, and their output is expected to dip by 25% in the coming months. The production of the table variety of potatoes is also expected to take a 10-15% hit, according to sources from the Vegetable Growers' Association of India ( VGAI ).Nearly 10,000 hectares in Maharashtra yield 1 lakh metric tonnes of rain-fed potatoes annually.""There is major infestation of army worms on all types of potatoes in the last 10-15 days of the dry spell,"" said Santosh Sahane, VGAI technical director. ""The tuberization of rain-fed potatoes has also been affected due to the compaction of soil and low moisture availability. Production of potatoes  table and rain-fed  in the coming months may, therefore, be affected,"" Sahane added. Only Maharashtra and Karnataka produce Kharif season potatoes.Sahane said some diseases tend to affect vegetables during a dry spell. ""Cloudy skies with little rain and improper sunshine increase the incidence of fungal and bacterial infections in vegetables. We see a high incidence of sap-sucking pests in tomatoes, and army worms in almost all vegetables, especially tomatoes and potatoes,"" he added.An agro meteorological advisory issued by the India Meteorological Department suggested several measures that farmers can take against pests and diseases in crops. It said that cloudy and humid weather conditions can lead to various pests and diseases on crops, such as pink boll worm in cotton, sap-sucking pest in vegetables, stem girder beetle and oily spot disease, among others."

The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

The appeal will now be heard after two weeks.The sale of garlic through agents had been disputed since the past ten years after the state government's order in 2007 banning agents from selling the spice."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."

The GST Council, the highest policy making body on GST rates, has got representations from various stakeholders to tweak rates for more than 130 items.Helmets are necessary for skaters. A higher rate for helmets is not desirable and the government should reduce its rate from 18 per cent to 5 per cent, says Hari Om Gupta, a skating coach.The products that are pending for a review, according to sources in the GST Council, include granite slabs, hybrid cars, namkeen, potato chips, sweetmeats, kulfi, wet dates, Isabgol, peanut chikki, hair pin, LPG stoves, umbrella, writing instruments, wet grinders, weighing machines compressors, textile machinery parts, chewing tobacco, multi-function printers and handmade carpets, sanitary pads, dried fish, plastic scrap, furniture, fly-ash and fly-ash bricks, and bio fuel extracted from non-edible oilseeds.The demands for review include GST on IT products from 12 per cent from 18 per cent, on IT hardware a tax cut has been sought from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, for textiles from 5 per cent to zero, for tractors from 12 per cent to 5 per cent, and for granite slabs from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. According to the demands, namkeen, bhujias and potato chips should be levied only 5 per cent instead of 12 per cent. And, that for macaroni/ pasta/noodles has been sought to be reduced to 5 per cent from 18 per cent. GST on chutney power has been sought at 12 per cent from 18 per cent and on pickle to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.The preferred rate for packaged drinking water sold in small pouches and refill cans with 20-litre capacity is nil from 18 per cent currently. On motor cycles with engine capacity of more than 350 cc and up to 500 cc, the 3 per cent cess on top of 28 per cent tax rate has been sought to be removed. The cess is levied on top of the total tax rate of 28 per cent."

Growing up in the Sahel region, Ms. Andrade, a leading agronomist, has today succeeded in accomplishing her childhood dream with bio-fortified sweet potatoes.She won the World Food Prize, along with Robert Mwanga, Jan Low, and Howarth Bouis in 2016, for her contribution in developing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, which were bio-fortified with Vitamin A, that has helped address the challenge of micronutrient deficiency in Mozambique, primarily.One million farmers are reportedly growing the sweet potatoes she developed in Africa now. On Tuesday, she received the M.S. Swaminathan Award for Environmental Protection here, at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Madras-East. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Andrade said she had developed 15 drought-tolerant varieties of orange-fleshed sweet potato in February 2011, which addressed the nutrition deficiency and were also climate smart as Sahel region is often affected by severe droughts. Overall, she has developed over 40 varieties of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, of which eight are high yielding.I found farmers in the Sahel region growing mostly white-fleshed sweet potatoes. I crossed this native variety with the orange-fleshed sweet potato variety we imported from the U.S. for distributing to farmers, she said.The work was accomplished while she was working in association with other plant scientists at the International Potato Centre.Ms. Andrade is acutely aware of the malnutrition crisis threatening the world. Of the 7 billion world population, about 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiency.She stressed on the need to cut meat consumption if the world has to address this challenge.Given Indias own malnutrition crisis, with the countrys Global Hunger Index of 28.5 ranking close to Mozambiques 31.7, Ms. Andrade said the success of the orange-fleshed sweet potato could be replicated here too as these crops were easy to grow.When asked whether she owns any patent for the hybrid sweet potato she developed, Ms. Andrade vehemently says, No. My work is for the smallholder and poor farmers. This work is for the public to benefit from.Ms. Andrade plans to spend her prize money on training women farmers to grow bio-fortified crops as she thinks women are a crucial link to resolving the global malnutrition challenge."
