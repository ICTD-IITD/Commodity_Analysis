Growing up in the Sahel region, Ms. Andrade, a leading agronomist, has today succeeded in accomplishing her childhood dream with bio-fortified sweet potatoes.She won the World Food Prize, along with Robert Mwanga, Jan Low, and Howarth Bouis in 2016, for her contribution in developing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, which were bio-fortified with Vitamin A, that has helped address the challenge of micronutrient deficiency in Mozambique, primarily.One million farmers are reportedly growing the sweet potatoes she developed in Africa now. On Tuesday, she received the M.S. Swaminathan Award for Environmental Protection here, at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Madras-East. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Andrade said she had developed 15 drought-tolerant varieties of orange-fleshed sweet potato in February 2011, which addressed the nutrition deficiency and were also climate smart as Sahel region is often affected by severe droughts. Overall, she has developed over 40 varieties of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, of which eight are high yielding.I found farmers in the Sahel region growing mostly white-fleshed sweet potatoes. I crossed this native variety with the orange-fleshed sweet potato variety we imported from the U.S. for distributing to farmers, she said.Cut meat consumptionThe work was accomplished while she was working in association with other plant scientists at the International Potato Centre.Ms. Andrade is acutely aware of the malnutrition crisis threatening the world. Of the 7 billion world population, about 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiency. She stressed on the need to cut meat consumption if the world has to address this challenge.Given Indias own malnutrition crisis, with the countrys Global Hunger Index of 28.5 ranking close to Mozambiques 31.7, Ms. Andrade said the success of the orange-fleshed sweet potato could be replicated here too as these crops were easy to grow.When asked whether she owns any patent for the hybrid sweet potato she developed, Ms. Andrade vehemently says, No. My work is for the smallholder and poor farmers. This work is for the public to benefit from.Ms. Andrade plans to spend her prize money on training women farmers to grow bio-fortified crops as she thinks women are a crucial link to resolving the global malnutrition challenge."

Though July raised the prospects of the fertilizer company achieving normal targets for sale of Factamfos and ammonium sulphate, the failure of rain has held up sales, sources said here.Around 66,000 tonnes of Factamfos and 10,000 tonnes of ammonium sulphate were sold during July. However, sales have been dull during the current month, sources said, indicating that FACTs major sales during the rains took place in the neighbouring States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Considering the present trend, it may be difficult to achieve the target of 60,000 tonnes during the current month, the sources said. The whole of South India has seen a rain deficit of 30 per cent and this has badly affected demand for fertilizers. Usually, Karnataka sees sales peaking in August.The areas where FACT is strong in Karnataka include Hassan, Chikmanglur, Devanagere, Mandya, Tumkur, Mysore and Shimoga. Sources said that potato cultivation in Hassan was down substantially this season because of the weather conditions. July had seen sales of around 20,000 tonnes.Tamil Nadu had shown some promise in July with sales touching 6,000 tonnes. The area within 200 km radius of Chennai was a major area of sales for FACT with the nearest competitor for FACT trailing quite behind, sources said. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh accounted for the sale of 60,000 tonnes during August if the rains were good, the sources said."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Vegetables sold include those certified as produced using Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).'Onasamridhi' during the last Onam season had witnessed sale of around 4,800 metric tonnes of vegetables over five days, out of which 3,400 metric tonnes were state's own produce.The `Onathinu oru muram pachakkari' scheme which envisages mass cultivation of vegetables with the participation of 63 lakh families, would address the demand only partially. The department's calculation is that it might require 5,207 MT vegeta bles to run these stalls. To fill the gap, Horticorp has been entrusted to procure 940 MT of vegetables from neighbouring states.""For the mass cultivation scheme under which people could raise vegetables in their backyards, on terraces and in grow bags, we had distributed seeds or seedlings of only around five types of vegetables (ladies finger, spinach, snake gourd, brinjal, bitter gourd and chilli). It was meant to create awareness on safe-to-eat vegetables and to boost consumers' confidence,"" said agriculture director A M Sunil Kumar.Envisaged as part of the Haritha Kerala Mission and implemented with the cooperation of Kudumbashree units, homemakers, students, workers under the employment guarantee scheme, vegetable farmers' clusters, officials and various institutions, the scheme had witnessed distribution of 63 lakh packets of seeds, 45 lakh vegetable seedlings, and more than one lakh grow bags.Whether the scheme achieved its aim of cultivating a habit of us ing safe-to-eat vegetables is yet to be seen. However, the increase in the number of vegetable stalls this Onam is huge. The depart ment had run 1,365 outlets last year. This has been made possible by introducing sale of vegetables in cooperation department fairs, Supplyco fairs and Kudum bashree outlets, the director pointed out.Among the 1,500 stalls to be run directly by the department in association with Vegetables and Fruits Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and Horticorp are 51 eco-shops selling its own brand of organic vegetables 'Kerala Organic', which had hit the market last Vishu . ""All other outlets too will be selling organic or GAP-certified vegetables at a price that is bit higher,"" Sunil Kumar said.Locally grown vegetables will be procured from farmers by Hor ticorp at a 10% higher price, while the farmers will get 20% high price for GAP-cer tified products. At the stalls, the con sumers can buy them availing 30% and 10% discounts respectively. ""Be sides vegetables, the stalls will be selling the fa mous Marayoor jaggery, coconut oil and honey,"" the agriculture director said.The department is hoping to procure 150 tonnes of best qual ity garlic with great medicinal value from Kanthalloor-Vatta vada belt. The area famed for vegetable cultivation will provide a significant volume of cabbage, potato and cauliflower, for which the state has been depending heavily on neighbouring states.Majority of the vegetables to be purchased by Horticorp from other states are the ones not grown in the state. Kerala grows only around 15 types of vegeta bles out of 50 in demand. ""The cultivation of tomato, which was widespread in Palakkad district, has come down, and we need to procure it from outside,"" Sunil Kumar said."
5a0f7dac9855b76bf13d8b88,A glowing tribute to Nature’s bounty,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-glowing-tribute-to-natures-bounty/articleshow/60199186.cms,2017-08-24,"It is that time of the year when Goa's favourite deity is set to pay his devotees a visit. In celebrating Him, the Hindus of the state touch base with an ancient fecundity ritual, one that sees them venerate Lord Ganesha with the very produce of nature that He blessed them with. Food, thus, is one of the hallmarks of Ganesh Chaturthi, and is replete with associated fertility symbolisms.In the prelude to the festival, Lord Ganesha's parentsLord Shiva and Goddess Parvatiare worshipped a day before. Folklore paints a picture of Parvati pregnant with Lord Ganesha, yet another allusion to fertility. ""In Goa, the day is referred to as tay and involves womenfolk observing a fast. In Hindu priest and other such households, the hartalika puja is perfomed,"" noted Goan folklorist Jayanti Naik, says.Intriguing food symbolisms are seen right from this day. To begin with, the fasting diet includes only fruits and milk. Naik says the women eat nothing that is cultivated with a plough. ""This is the tradition pan-India,"" she adds, while explaining that the plough is perceived to be a symbol of masculinity.Lord Ganesha is born on the following day, called chavat, marking the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi. ""The birth of the benevolent god marks the most important day of the celebrations,"" says artist and culture enthusiast Naguesh Sardesai. And, understandably, food is cooked in plenty.Goddess Parvati or Gauri, who symbolises the Mother Goddess, is given a special nourishing diet to satisfy her 'duvalle' or cravings. It comprises varan, a preparation from at least five leafy vegetables, and moni patolleo. While patolleo are elongated rice dumplings of sorts with a sweet filling, those offered to Gauri have no filling and are therefore called moni.""The food offered to Parvati is bland,"" says Naguesh, adding that salt is added only to the food offered to Lord Mahadev and Lord Ganesha.The rest of the cuisine covers a plethora of Ganesha's favourites, including moongache gathi, khatkhate, ambadayache uddad methi, etc. ""Sweet dishes comprise stuffed patolleo, modakswhich may be fashioned from stuffings of chunna (coconut and jaggery) or punna (chana dal and jaggery)and neureos,"" says publisher and food writer Sapna Sardesai. A payasam is also prepared. ""To the payasam, five grains of tender rice grains taken from new sheaves, are added,"" Sardesai explains.""The tender grains are significant of the new harvest,"" says Naik, adding that this offering of the first sheaves is a thanksgiving for God's bounty. Explaining the fertility symbolism behind the neureos, Naik says, ""Neureos form the female symbol, which is why no matter how many are prepared, it is compulsory to prepare at least one modakthe male symbol.""The following day, pancham, which concludes one-and-a-half days of festivities and sees a majority of Goan Hindu households immersing their respective idols, has a greater variety of preparations in addition to those prepared on the main day. Only the leafy vegetable preparation is excluded.""In addition to gravy prepations like moongache gathi (prepared from sprouted moong) and ros, dry vegetarian dishes are also cooked on this day. For instance, bhendyachi bhaji is made from the local, seven-ridged ladyfingers and ghosalyachi bhaji is made from ridge gourd. A green chilli or bitter gourd raita is also prepared. Deep-fried potato kaapa and ambadayache uddad methi, a tangy gravy made from hogplums, more or less completes the spread,"" says Sardesai.Both Naik and Sardesai make special mention of heet a local version of idlis made in a casing of jackfruit leaves. ""While it is common belief that idlis are a south Indian preparation, Goa has always had its version of it,"" Naik says. Traditionally, heet is dipped in coconut milk sweetened with jaggery before it is consumed.In the evening, after the concluding puja, or uttar puja, is held, two large laddoos of lhayo (puffed rice) are made with jaggery, roasted chana dal, cashew nuts and coconut. One laddoo is offered to Lord Ganesha as a send-off food, and the other to the person who takes the idol for immersion. The puffed rice is, once again, a symbol of prosperity.Thus, the entire celebration, right from the decoration to the food, pays glowing tribute to Nature's abundance and diversity."

Whenever I need directions, I stop by a rickshaw. And I get perfect directions to my destination from one of the thousands of hard working men who have left their villages to make Delhi their home.That is why, when I was on my way to Lajpat Nagar in search of a chholey bhaturey wallah that I had not visited ever, I didnt worry. I took the Metro from Rajendra Prasad Road to Lajpat Nagar, and once I walked out of the station at the Lajpat Nagar Metro Station, I jumped on to a waiting rickshaw.I am looking for some special chholey bhaturey, I said to him. Oh, Anandji, he replied, and took me right there.Its nice to know that there are still some chholey bhaturey in Delhi that I have not tried out.Seeing is believingI had been hearing about Anandji for a while, but, as it happens sometimes, I had never gone there. Last week, I thought I couldnt call myself a chhole bhatura expert if there was a much talked of place that I had not been to. So, as I said, I took the Metro.This is a 22-year-old shop in Lajpat Nagar 1. The address is Shop No 3, Krishna Market (Tel nos 011-29817406 and 41326226; owner Bittus number: 9811301302). I was quite impressed by the place  it was spic and span, and had high tables for those who wanted to stand there and have a quick meal. I was there pretty early in the day, so it was not crowded either. There were a few people there, and I was happy to see that they were all eating chholey bhaturey.I asked for four plates  each for Rs 70. The bhatureys were not enormous, as some bhatureys are. This I thought was the right size  neither too large, nor too small. The chholey was superb  and what I really enjoyed was that it wasnt dripping oil, or overwhelmed with spices. It was almost like the good chholey that you get at home, with the perfect balance of spices. There was a nice juicy piece of potato in the chholey, which came with chutney, some pickle and onion rings.The service is smooth, too. I went in, placed my order, paid up, went to the counter where I presented my receipt, and within fifteen minutes, I was out of the place, where my friendly neighbour GPS-wallah was waiting.There are quite a few other items on the menu, too  chholey poori, rajma rice, kadi rice and dal makhni rice, all for Rs. 70 a plate. There is a thali (Rs. 100) and a special thali (Rs. 130). From 4 pm to 8 pm you get aloo samosa, paneer pakora, jalebi and break pakora. They also sell a dal samosa, which I must try out one day.Anandji is also known for its lassi  sweet and salted (Rs. 60/Rs. 40). I had heard about their creamy lassi, too, but I had to hurry back with my lunch. And the food packet in my hand smelled so good that I was dying to dig my teeth into it.I wouldnt like to do a listicle on chholey bhaturey shops  those hard-to-escape lists of the ten or five top chholey bhaturey outlets in town that you see on the Net. My favourites, of course, are those places that have made us happy for years with their fare  Nagpal on the other side of the road, Chacha in Kamla Nagar, Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar and Nand in Sadar Bazaar, to name a few. And I must say Bhatia in IP Extension isnt bad either.But Anandji is somewhere right there, too. I had his chholey bhaturey for lunch and thought this was a place I could go back to. Not just for the dal samosa and the lassi, but for an encore."

The garden would be inaugurated by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the coming weeks.Christened Siri Horticulture Garden, Fern Hill, Ooty, it was part of the late Maharajas Summer Palace. For decades, it was used as a parent potato garden that supplied seeds to farmers in Kolar, Hassan, Tumakuru and Bengaluru Rural.Over the last 10 years, under the care of botanists from Karnataka, it has been transformed into an oasis of sorts, with flowering plants such as Alstroemeria or Princess Lilies, Begonia, Orchids and Fuchsia.

Jagadeesh, Joint Director of Horticulture, Lalbagh.Temperate glasshouseThe garden also has a Nilgiri sheep forest and swans aplenty in the lakes and the walking paths. For phase two, the Horticulture Department plans to build a temperate glasshouse, hanging bridges, and chasing fountains.Horticulture expert M.H. Mari Gowda had in the 1940s requested the then Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar to make arrangements for potato germination and cultivation, as sourcing seeds from Shimla and Jalandhar was becoming increasingly difficult.

It is an alarming trend as most of our health indices are compared to those of the developed West. The rising incidence is basically due to Malayalees mindset.We think there is a pill for every ailment, said K R Thankappan, emeritus professor, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies and the surveys chief investigator.The major NCDs are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and clinical lung disorder, in that order.  The incidence of heart attacks among Malayalees is rising. If it was 1.3 per cent in 1993 it has jumped to 3.8 per cent in 2016. It is the lets see attitude whether it is a heart attack or accidents which is proving the bane, said Thankappan.The survey found 69 per cent of the population consumes salt in excess of the recommended5 gm daily. It is for the first time these statistics have come out. Mainly bakery products, especially banana, potato and tapioca chips, and pickles are to blame for the high salt intake, he said.More than three-fourth of the population (77.8 per cent) reported consumption of less than the recommended three servings of vegetables per day, while almost nine out of 10 participants (86 per cent) reported consumption of less than two servings of fruits per day. It also found one out of every four adults surveyed reported current use of tobacco in some form and over 30 per cent reported current alcohol use among males."

(File | Reuters)NEW DELHI: Wholesale inflation rose to a four-month high of 3.24 per cent in August as prices of food articles, led by onions and vegetables, soared.Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) was 1.88 per cent in July 2017 and 1.09 per cent in August 2016.The last such high level of inflation was witnessed in April when the rate of price rise was 3.85 per cent.The government data released today showed that prices of food articles went up by 5.75 per cent in August on a yearly basis, as against 2.15 per cent in July.Vegetable prices shot up by 44.91 per cent in August, as against 21.95 per cent in July.Onion prices witnessed a sharp surge at 88.46 per cent in August, as against a contraction of 9.50 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.45 per cent in August, against 2.18 per cent in July.In fuel and power segment, inflation saw a sharp surge to a near double digit inflation at 9.99 per cent, against 4.37 per cent in July.Fuel inflation shot up as petrol and diesel prices continued to remain high relentlessly on global crude oil rates, while power tariffs shot through the roof on lower domestic production.Apart from vegetables, the food articles that saw rise in prices include pulses, fruits (7.35 per cent), egg, meat and fish (3.93 per cent), cereals (0.21 per cent) and paddy (2.70 per cent).However, potato continued to see deflation at 43.82 per cent and pulses (-) 30.16 per cent.The final print of June WPI inflation remained unchanged from provisional estimate of 0.90 per cent.Data released earlier this week showed retail inflation rose to a five-month high of 3.36 per cent in August due to costlier vegetables and fruits.Also industrial production grew by just 1.2 per cent in July from 4.5 per cent a year ago, bearing the brunt of a dismal show of the manufacturing sector.Last month, the Reserve Bank cut policy repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low.The RBI said it will endeavour to keep retail inflation close to 4 per cent but in the near term, there might be some uptick on account of pay commission payouts and price adjustments post GST rollout from July 1."

In that way, the industry has a lot of offer. My husband and I visit different restaurants every weekend to try new dishes from different cuisines. It helps me in keeping myself updated on whats new.Whats your favourite cuisine?I love continental food, pastas and pizzas. Despite being a south India, I dont have the palette for typical south food. But, I can devour pizzas and pastas at any given time! (Quips)Dishes in your menu that you love?Since ours is a fusion restaurant, a lot of thought, research and trials went in, before we came up with the menu. The Chi-Ta  a mix of Chinese food and Pita bread, the Paan Panacotta and the potato paneer boat are some of my favourites. I am sure you wont find this anywhere.A mother, a wife and an entrepreneur  one thing you associate with each role?My baby is two years old now and shes growing along with my restaurant. For me, the last year has been baby time. But, I manage and love taking care of her and the business. I had an arranged marriage and have been married for five years now. But, my husband and I have a lot of common interests. One of which is our love for pizza and pasta! He also helps me with managing the business. This is one thing I have been extremely lucky with  a supportive husband, mother and in-laws.Do you have any childhood memories of the city?I live in Kodambakkam now but, as a child, I was in Tnagar. The locality has changed a lot now. Be it the ever crowded GN Chetty road or any road in Tnagar for that matter, I have seen them change. I studied in Holy Angels schools and used to travel by cycle through those roads. I have photographic memories of those days, which are very pleasant. If I ever plan to open another outlet to Kichee or for my bakery, I will definitely think of opening it in T Nagar. I love Chennai for everything that it is. If I were to relocate to a different city someday, it would be very difficult for me!Shopping or travelling?Shopping! I shop to unwind and relax. My picks are mostly clothes, accessories and anything that would make me happy. I do like travelling, but I dont travel very often. If theres a places I would like to go, it would be Paris, for the different variety of chocolates.Will Kichee become a multi-outlet brand?Well, thats the long term plan. But, I will be focusing on opening an outlet for the bakery soon. Opening another outlet for the restaurant, might take a couple of years. I am also keen on carving a niche when it comes to packaging - of pastries and chocolates.something out of the box and synonymous to Kichees."
