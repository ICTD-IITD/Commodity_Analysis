Here you can try baked, crispy dumplings and delicate crystal ones that are wrapped around fresh ingredients.Just when we thought that Yauatcha, a London-based dim sum restaurant, had served it all, they introduced four varieties on August 23. These will be accompanied by a potful of jasmine tea or premium beer.In the dimly lit romantic diner, Chicken and Water Chestut Dumpling is served first in a bamboo box. The aroma of minced meat with Thai sauce gives away the flavour even before tasting it.The dumpling, made from potato starch, is translucent and generous with the filling. It tastes mild and flavourful, with the fresh chicken cooked just right to a shade of pink. The dumpling, for want of a better phrase, melts in your mouth.The Olive Crystal Dumpling with yambean and fried tofu looks delightful. The skin of the dumpling is a shade of green from chive. The dumpling tastes of mixed vegetables and the sweet taste of pumpkin.Next comes the Roasted Duck Pumpkin Puff that resembles a miniature bright-orange pumpkin. There are leaves too, of sunflower crest. While other dumplings are soft, this one has a hard cover made from pumpkin paste.The crispy shell cracks easily and spills out duck meat, shitake mushrooms, yambean and black pepper sauce. Again, the meat retains its flavour and there is a thread of sweetness from the pumpkin.The fourth new dumpling is the Crispy Prawn Dumpling, which you could mistake for Adams familys Cousin Itt upside down, but we mean it in a good way. The deep fried prawn wears a unique garnish of vermicelli. The prawn is juicy and the texture crispy. Simply delicious.The restaurant serves their usual condiments of chilli flakes sauce and sweet sauce, and chilli flake sauce with a hint of spicy garlic goes well with the mild dumplings.Desserts are Yauatchas speciality. Red Fruit Fromage Frais, a pistachio biscuit with pistachio sponge mixed with red-fruit campote, served alongside raspberry sorbet and topped with cherries and blue berries is a creamy cheesecake that blends beautifully with the sourness of the fruits. It is a must-try for cheese, cream and fruit lovers.With the jasmine tea by the side, the dim sum fest is a treat."

But that is what I love doing.While creating a recipe, the most integral part is the choice of ingredients. During the initial days of my career when I was working with world's leading Indian chefs, they always advised me to talk with ingredients, to know what they convey in terms of flavours, understand their behaviour when they are being cooked. To know the ingredient, taste the ingredient, pair it with other ingredients and taste them together to know how they taste together. That is what I have been doing while creating recipes.I have a huge number of vegetarian viewers who follow me and one thing I know is their love for potatoes and paneer but often they arent clubbed together and are always tried in their generic forms like french fries or paneer tikka. I just wanted to make this fun and interesting with use of minimalistic ingredients. I gave it an oriental approach with the Indo-Chinese flavour by using two Sriracha sauce, a flaming hot Thai favourite and Garlic chilli dip and spread, giving a bite of garlic and kick of chilli.The recipe is all about bite sized crispy scoops of baby potatoes filled with the spicy tangy paneer, topped with the garlic chilli dip and spread. The sauces well blend with each other give a wholesome flavour to the recipe with tangy and spicy notes when you bite into the crispy potato and paneer. After the first trial, everyone in the studio loved the results and we finalised this recipe. Viewers have loved the recipe and the recipe has received more than a million views online.Creating recipes is all about instinct and the marriage of flavours in the ingredients. We have received amazing testimonials from our viewers who have tried the recipe. Also, I do recommend all the readers to go by their instinct and not treat recipes as the holy book to go with, always trust your instinct and do put in your views and tastes into the recipe for a much better experience.

When we finally arrived, we quickly realised that we were one of the only few groups of people to be there, despite it being a Saturday night.Irish Pub is quite large, and sports a rugged, vintage look. Although the interiors are are hard on the eyes, nothing exactly screams Irish about it. The music was mainly commercial tracks, which didnt seem to go with the rustic feel of the place.We began with some cocktails. The Inverted Bird, which has vodka, apple, juice, passion fruit extract and an inverted pint of beer, is quite strong with overwhelming liquory taste.If youre in the mood for something fresh and fruity, do give the French Red Head a try, which is a combination of vodka, watermelon and fresh basil. A personal favourite was the Jack Sparrow, which has a good dose of Jack Daniels, banana puree and pineapple juice. Although the combination sounds odd, this is actually a great cocktail with the perfect blend of flavours. The bar menu has a diverse set of drinks, along with all your staples.Coming to the food, we started the meal with Armagh Mushroom Bites, which were basically mini brioche buns with a creamy mushroom filling. Although tasty, it was nothing spectacular.The Mini Chicken Tacos were alright, and the taco shell was slightly stale. There were a few different kinds of fries, all of which looked appealing. We tried the Minced up Fries, that had fries topped with chicken bolognese, cheddar, boiled egg and crispy onion. This is something youd definitely want to try while drinking, although wed have liked a more amount of cheddar to cut through the strong flavour of the bolognese.We got the Sourdough Fondue Bowl next - hollow sourdough filled a three-cheese sauce, served with chargrilled broccoli, smoked sausage, grilled chicken bits and roasted sweet potato. Overall, a good dish, and the secret hero was the roasted sweet potato that went beautifully with the cheese sauce.We started our mains with the Beer Can Roast Chicken  stout flavoured grilled chicken served with roast potatoes and vegetables  and it was average, mainly due to the gamey chicken. The Portofino Grilled Fish had (slightly dry) pieces of fish with lumpy, flavourless mashed potatoes and string beans.The best part of the meal was the Irish House Burger. This tenderloin patty, topped with a jalapeno-cheese sauce, cheddar melts, a sunny-side up egg and caramelised onions served with fries and gherkins was what saved the meal for us. We also gave the Original Italian Spaghetti with prawns a try, which was a traditional tomoto, basil, garlic sauce pasta, but very on-point with the flavours.For desserts, we tried the Irish River Dance (purely for the sake of the name), for which we only had one word  overwhelming. Served in a massive beer glass, this mish-mash of brownie bits, dark chocolate, vanilla ice cream, chocolate truffles, nuts, caramel sauce and fresh lager beer - is for the one hoping to fall deep into a sugar coma. The Nutty Caramel Pie was actually quite good, as peanut butter, caramel and dark chocolate are a combination made in heaven for food.The Irish Pub in Bellandur is ideal for colleagues from the nearby offices to grab a post-work drink and snacks, because the rather unexciting food is perhaps not worth braving the journey for.Cost for two: Rs 700"

At least 100 pachyderms have died this way.On Monday, illegal electric fencing became the cause of death of a 25-30-year-old tusker. The animal was electrocuted near a farm at Nandibattlu Tandya village.Siddanayak, a farmer, had electrified the fencing around his farm to protect potato crops from elephants. The area falls under Tarikere local range of Bhadravathi territorial division and is adjacent to Tanigebailu wildlife range of Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. The young male elephant suffered serious injuries in its trunk, sustaining a severe shock. The farmer is absconding and a case has been registered by Lingadhalli Police and Tarikere Range officials. According to G Veeresh, wildlife activist, it was a single tusk elephant. He said, This is the fourth such incident in this region as elephants are electrocuted frequently. More than three leopards were also snared in this area. Even people have died by electrocution.Karnataka Chief Wildlife Warden C Jayaram told Express that seven deaths which occurred in Kodagu district were because of snapped cables. The deaths occurred in coffee estates during heavy rains when visibility was low. These were accidental deaths caused by electrocution. After this incident, we held discussions with ESCOMS so that all the sagging and snapped cables are repaired. Now there is regular monitoring and inspection by both forest and power officials, he said.In cases of deaths due to electric fencing, cases have been booked against offenders, Jayaram added. Compared to sagging power cables, deaths due to illegal electric fencing have come down and they are rare now, he said.However, conservationists disagree and add that the forest department, police and power companies should take strict action against offenders."

It was handed over by Sirajuddin Ajmal.The potato growers, in May this year, had to sell potatoes at Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg because of abundant produce and lack of cold storages. ""Potatoes remained dumped on the roadside for five months. Almost 80 per cent of the potatoes rotted. Not a single farmer was compensated,"" it said.This year, low rainfall in the winter helped potato production."

They have assured me that train services will be restored within 10 days as the flood situation is improving. Road connectivity is being restored now."" Warning traders who take advantage of floods and try to charge more for essential commodities, the minister said: ""We will take stern action against traders who try to fleece customers. I have already discussed it with all deputy commissioners and directed them to punish such traders as soon as possible. To regulate the market, directions have been issued to the Agriculture Marketing Board to ensure adequate supply of essential commodities.""

5a1140109855b76bf13de951,Harmu market a den of vice,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170824/jsp/jharkhand/story_168773.jsp,2017-08-24,"Harmu market in Ranchi bears tell-tale signs of neglect with garbage strewn all around and (below) vendors using allotted shops on the ground floor as godowns. Pictures by Hardeep Singh A Ranchi market with over 200 stalls and a community hall, inaugurated on the eve of Independence Day in 2014, is yet to serve its intended purpose with those living in the neighbourhood alleging that the Rs 3 crore building has now turned into a haunted house thronged by drunkards and drug addicts. Spread over 13,000sqft and located behind Harmu Panch Mandir, the triple-storey market complex has 212 shops on the ground and first floor. As many as 180 shops have been allotted to vendors, but they prefer to use them as godowns rather than a retail outlet, while continuing to do business from their old shanties on the roadside. The market, with its dirty walls and dusty floors, bears tell-tale signs of neglect. A local resident said the market had become a den of anti-socials. ""We don't venture anywhere near it after sunset as several drug addicts roam the place taking shelter under the cover of darkness since there are no lights,"" said a woman who lives close by. The market was built by Jharkhand State Housing Board, a government outfit set up to provide houses and shops to the needy on a no-profit no-loss basis. It is now under Ranchi Municipal Corporation. Local councillor (ward 37) Arun Kumar Jha admitted it was not being used, but said he was unable to help. ""The market was constructed after an anti-encroachment drive in the locality. The idea was to allot space to vegetable vendors and others who were displaced in the drive. After the market was conducted and most of the shops allotted, no one used them to sell their stuff. The vendors preferred to use the shops as their godowns,"" he said. Bablu Kumar, a potato seller, said he did not care whether the market was being maintained or not. ""We still run our shop on the roadside as we do not see better business prospects in the market. We use the space allotted by the housing board for storing potatoes,"" he said, adding that he managed by using a battery-operated torch in the absence of proper lighting. Housing board executive engineer Sanjeev Kumar claimed they were no longer in the picture. ""Once shops have been allotted, it is the duty of those who got them to take care of maintenance and lighting arrangements. Out of 212 shops, more than 180 shops have been allotted,"" Kumar said. Board MD Ashish Singhmar, however, said that he would look into the matter soon. ""We will allot the remaining shops soon. We will publish advertisements,"" he said, adding that the board was equally concerned about the prolonged misuse of the market, the foundation stone for which was laid by former deputy chief minister Hemant Soren on November 14, 2011. The market was finally inaugurated on August 14, 2014, by former minister Yogendra Sao."

Amid conflicting reports of whether the warden had called up sadar hospital at 2am today for an ambulance which did not arrive, Khunti DC Manish Ranjan claimed the woman had not called up the hospital at all. Instead, she called a local auto driver who refused to go. Deceased Champa Nag of Garamara village of Khunti thana area had enrolled at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya at Kalamati panchayat 17 days ago and was healthy right till last evening, when she played and danced with other girls. Champa complained of stomach ache and then chest pain a few hours after last night's dinner of rice, lentils and potato curry. Whether the hostel warden called up an auto driver or the sadar hospital for an ambulance is not clear as the employee could not be contacted personally. But, what is clear that Champa's condition deteriorated progressively and by early morning, the warden contacted the local mukhiya who took the ailing girl in his car to the nearby health centre, where the nurse on duty advised she be immediately rushed to a hospital. The mukhiya took her to sadar hospital where she died while being treated. Her post-mortem report said she died of cardiac arrest. Khunti civil surgeon Vinod Oraon could not provide any detail of the case, including the girl's age. DC Ranjan claimed they were not at fault as the warden called up an auto, who refused to go at the late hour. However, local sources claimed the warden had called up sadar hospital for an ambulance, which didn't arrive, claiming that drivers tended to steer clear of the hour-long drive through the forested rebel hub at night. However, this claim could not be substantiated. DC Ranjan added that he had ordered a senior nurse be deployed every night at each of the six Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas with immediate effect. The nurses will be given dinner by the respective schools. ""We have only two lady doctors in our district. It is practically not possible to provide ambulances and doctors to each school. There are nearly 260 girls' hostels in my district,"" he added."

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas. The MP said the government is taking a favourable stance towards Supplyco godowns. ""Supplyco should use these favourable conditions for the benefit of consumers,"" said Thomas. ""A new programme named Karshakamithram, mooted to attract more students towards agriculture, will be launched in schools soon. One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam.

5a114d1a9855b76bf13df304,Trump sees 'a lot of love' in Houston,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170903/jsp/foreign/story_170567.jsp,2017-09-03,"President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump (in blue shirt) with Hurricane Harvey survivors at a relief centre in Houston on Saturday. (Reuters) Houston, Sept. 2 (AP): President Donald Trump cupped a boy's face in his hands and then gave him a high-five. He lifted a girl into his arms to give her a kiss. He snapped on latex gloves to hand out boxed lunches of hot dogs and potato chips. On his visit to a shelter for storm victims today, the President declared he sees ""a lot of love"" in the wake of devastation left by Harvey. ""We saw a lot of happiness,"" he told reporters after he and First Lady Melania Trump greeted children in the kids' zone in NRG Centre, an emergency refuge for people who were forced out of their homes. ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing."" It was his second trip to Texas in a week, and this time his first order of business was to meet those affected by the record-setting rainfall and flooding. He is also set to survey some of the damage and head to Lake Charles, Louisiana, another hard-hit area. That interaction was missing from Tuesday's trip to Texas, which was criticised as being off-key for a presidential visit to discuss communities in crisis. In Corpus Christi and Austin, Trump sat with emergency responders and officials who were coordinating recovery efforts with his administration. The event was marked by Trump's impromptu speech to supporters outside a Corpus Christi firehouse - ""What a crowd, what a turnout,"" he said - instead of images of the President consoling victims or walking among the damage caused by the storm. Trump at that time kept his distance from the epicentre of the damage, in Houston, to avoid disrupting recovery operations. Still, critics said he failed to adequately express compassion for the families of those killed in the storm's path or those whose homes were flooded. He raised eyebrows when he predicted his approach would be a model for future Presidents to emulate. ""We want to do it better than ever before,"" he said. ""We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, 'This is the way to do it.'"" ""There was a lot of high-fiving about how well this disaster was being handled even as people were on their rooftops hoping to be rescued,"" said David Axelrod, a top adviser to President Barack Obama. ""People need to know that their President is emotionally engaged in their struggle, and part of the obligation or the responsibility of a President, particularly in a media age, is to make that human connection."" Trump later voiced more direct concern for those caught up in the storm. At the start of a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, he said the nation was praying for those in Harvey's path and ""we are here with you every single step of the way"". The President reiterated that support in a tweet as he rode to the NRG Centre in Houston today. At the site, he called the federal, state and local response to the disaster ""fantastic"". ""I think people appreciate what's been done,"" he said. ""It's been done very efficiently, very well. And that's what we want."" More than 17,000 people have sought refuge in Texas shelters, the American Red Cross said earlier this week. NRG Centre opened on Tuesday."
5a1150589855b76bf13df52c,Wholesale prices take retail cue,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170915/jsp/business/story_173280.jsp,2017-09-15,"New Delhi, Sept. 14: Wholesale prices have risen sharply in August as food articles, particularly onions and vegetables, turned costlier during the month.Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) rose to a four-month high of 3.24 per cent in August against 1.88 per cent in July and 1.09 per cent in August last year.The sharp rise in wholesale prices mirrored the retail trend - data released earlier this week showed the inflation rising to a five-month high of 3.36 per cent in August due to costlier vegetables and fruits.The last such high level of WPI-based inflation was seen in April when the rate of price rise was 3.85 per cent.The government data released today showed prices of food articles going up by 5.75 per cent in August on a yearly basis as against 2.15 per cent in July.Vegetable prices shot up by 44.91 per cent in August compared with 21.95 per cent in July. Onion prices surged a whopping 88.46 per cent in August as against a contraction of 9.50 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.45 per cent in August compared with 2.18 per cent in July.In the fuel and power segment, the WPI-based inflation saw a surge to a near double-digit level at 9.99 per cent against 4.37 per cent in July.Apart from vegetables, the food articles that saw a rise in prices include pulses, fruits (7.35 per cent), egg, meat and fish (3.93 per cent), cereals (0.21 per cent) and paddy (2.70 per cent).However, potato continued to see contraction at 43.82 per cent and pulses 30.16 per cent.The final print of June WPI inflation remained unchanged from the provisional estimate of 0.90 per cent.The sharp rise in wholesale and retail prices in August is likely to make the Reserve Bank of India ponder over the policy rate trajectory for the short- and medium-term. Last month, the RBI had cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low."

The police identified the deceased as Shive Gowda, 75. He is survived by his wife Siddamma and three sons.The farmer owned three acres of land and had borrowed over Rs. 4 lakh in loans from banks and private persons.

Ushakumari said on Friday that the weekly procurement of potato and cabbage was 90 tonnes and 70 tonnes respectively. Carrot was being procured at 15 tonnes per month. She said the procurement would go up further, as there would be 1,500 Onam markets in the State this year.The aim, she said, was to procure vegetables at 10% higher than the market rate and sell at 30% less than the market price. The Onam markets would have three sections of vegetables  organic, GAP (vegetables produced by the cluster units through Good Agriculture Practice), and those procured from outside the State.K. Jayaprakash, president, Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Producing Farmers Society, said an average of 50 tonnes of vegetables were being sent daily from Vattavada. Beans was mainly purchased by businessmen from Tamil Nadu. There was a slump in production, though more areas were brought under cultivation, he said. This was because of the long dry spell and delayed sowing. Some farmers lost their crops in cloudbursts. There were also complaints that farmers were not paid promptly after procuring vegetables.Buyers from TNO.K. Mohanraj, a farmer, said he was yet to get his July dues. Mr. Mohanraj said it was true that Horticorp procured vegetables at a price higher than those offered by businessmen.However, we need not wait for long for payment, he said, adding that it was the main reason for selling vegetables to Tamil Nadu businessmen.Earlier, the amount used to be credited to the account of the society in which all the farmers are members. Now the payment is made directly to the farmers account, said Mr. Jayaprakash. He said the Onam procurement would be a success only if the Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK) promptly paid dues."

Daddimani told presspersons here on Thursday that the Horticulture University and Nourish company representatives will sign a Memorandum of Understanding for setting up the unit on Saturday.This unit requires a minimum of 6 tonnes to a maximum of 20 tonnes on a daily basis. Considering this, the Horticulture Department has begun encouraging farmers to grow sweet potato. This year, the department set a target of engaging 1,000 farmers in cultivation of sweet potato. By the end of 2018, a total of 5,000 farmers are expected to be identified and brought under sweet potato cultivation.Sweet potato can be grown in red soil or even along with regular potatoes. This crop does not require more water. Besides, it is a good source of several vitamins. This root-vegetable has gained in more popularity in the world and the demand too is increasing. There is ample scope to opt for value-addition of sweet potato and the department is all set to provide advanced training to growers, he said.WorkshopThe programme to sign the Memorandum of Understanding will be followed by a one-day workshop-cum-training event for farmers from North Karnataka. The workshop will focus on scientific growing of sweet potato and its processing.Nourish company will enter into an understanding with sweet potato growers for a period of three years and all the produce will be purchased by the company itself. After purchasing, this root-vegetable would be processed at the new unit. This will solve the issue of marketing the crop. The department will hold regular demonstration on how to grow sweet potatoes, harvest them, and on other technical aspects. This project will increase the financial status of farmers, he noted.High demandHorticulture Scientist K. Ramchandra Naik said that sweet potatoes, which come to the market in different colours, are very healthy and will work as a protection shield in preventing diseases. The sweet potatoes grown in India have a huge demand across the world. The horticulture research unit has developed 125 new breeds of sweet potatoes. In the last two or three years, the demand for sweet potato has increased in the U.S. and the U.K. and the food processing companies there are in search of a region wherein sweet potato is being grown. The growing cost comes up to Rs. 10,000 per acre, but it may fetch him up to Rs. 80,000 per acre, he added."

Their contention was that the yard barely had any facilities to support trade.Members of the Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association said they had learnt through newspaper announcements that the allotees of the new yard and some traders at the Yeswantpur ward had been asked to shift to the Dasanapura yard from Friday morning. They also said farmers who had travelled from Hassan with their produce were asked to take gate passes from Dasanapura before coming to the Yeswantpur ward.Protesting against this, hundreds of farmers and traders slept on the road outside the APMC yard to prevent vehicle movement and even dumped onions and potatoes on the road while shouting slogans against the government. The protest continued for over two hours leaving motorists stranded.Hundreds of vehicles queued up on both sides of the busy Yeswantpur Road that connects the State highway. People who went to the Dasanapura market say there is nothing there. It is 5 km away from the main road and there is not even a police station. Who will go there? Let them put these facilities in place before asking anyone to shift there, said one of the traders.The police rushed to the spot to manage traffic and asked APMC officials to redress the grievances of the protesters. The traders and farmers decided to cancel their plan to call for a bandh on Saturday after talks with the government."

Fengs 2004 survey of 232 households found that 49% of Zhaba households still practised the tradition.Children in such families are raised by their mother and her siblings in large, six-storey communal houses of yellowed stone on the lush green hillsides, with cavernous rooms too large for much light to penetrate.Raised by womenFathers might provide some financial support.I dont have a husband. Their father lives somewhere else, said 60-year-old matriarch Dolma Lhamo after a breakfast of yak butter tea and tsampa, roasted flour eaten by hand, as she led two daughters out to tend the family potato field.Shopkeeper Pema Bazhu used to share a home with her mother, grandmother, sisters and uncles, but she recently chose to move out and live separately with her husband and two year-old son.Its much more common now to see families living on their own as a unit, she said. Its more convenient, and its better for raising children.Tsultrim Paldzone, 30, explained that when he and his friends were younger, they would snag tokens from girls they fancied on festival or market days, calling cards to be returned that evening during a nocturnal visit to her home.If shes willing, then shell run just a little bit less fast, he laughed.Urban growthCars were uncommon then. He had once walked over 10 kilometres to reach a lovers home, starting before sunset and arriving after midnight.Now no one in the small community  just some 13,624 people according to the latest 2010 census  lives more than a half hours motorbike trip away.Trysts are arranged ahead of time on the popular cellphone messaging app WeChat, and the coy game of token-grabbing has mostly disappeared.Government bureaucracy, too, is making it more difficult for the Zhabas walking marriages. Children born to parents without marriage certificates are not allowed hukou, all-important registration documents that allow them to access health care and schooling.Today, even those who wish to continue with walking marriage resort to paying unmarried acquaintances or strangers to apply for the certificate with them, said Tsultrim Paldzone.

The village is protected by the grand Dongurlem hill range and is traversed by the Calem river.The village has the famous water body called Vaigond (Tollem), the majestic Kalanath temple, and the Portuguese-built railway station. Kalanath temple is regarded by its residents as the gram devta (village deity). ""The origins of the village name is attributed to this place of worship. The sons and daughters of Calem believe that the village name has been derived from Kalanath temple,"" says Gokuldas Khutkar of Khutkar Wada.The tribal community, known as Dhangar Samaj, who live in the village, are famous as cultivators of banana, sweet potato and papaya.Calem, which admeasures 1.06 lakh sqm, is bordered by Sanvordem town and the villages of Collem and Dabal in Dharbandora taluka, and Uguem in Sanguem taluka.Calem has seven panchayat wards and 'vadde' (vaddo: singular, meaning traditional village ward) like Khutkar, Thorlemol, Devnamol, Bhat, Ducorkond, Dudhal, Karemol, Khamol, Kuinomol, Khodwamol, Vegregal, Kamdar, Voldem, Mauling, Bondel, Ambemol, Chanimol, etc.Since the past two decades, residents of the village, whose ancestors have been living here since Portuguese times, have been barred from making any renovation or alteration in their respective private properties. Since 1982, under central law, over 80% of the village was declared as a wildlife area. The rules became more stringent in 2004 when the state government's reserve area law came into force.""The rules about wildlife area and protected reserve area was imposed without taking the villagers into confidence as main stakeholders. This has made all construction or repair work impossible. For decades now, fetters have been put upon Calem's development in the name of reserve forest and wildlife protection,"" says Harshal Dessai, a resident of Bondel.Residents' Speak""Calem is blessed by the Almighty. The Vaigond (Tollem) has water even in the worst dry summers of May. The lush green hill, which measures around 3-4km in area, runs adjacent to the grand Kalanath Temple. The hill offers the best site for trekking and rock climbing in Goa. The state government should create employment opportunities by encouraging ecofriendly small scale industries and should also judiciously utilize the 1.5 lakh sqm of government agricultural farm for the benefit of Calem villagers.Krishnanath Naik, resident of Thorlemol WadaOur agricultural village is adorned with natural green cover throughout the year. Besides being a pollution-free village, Calem also prides in its fraternal camaraderie among religions and castes. The shigmo festival in Calem is popular and the festivities commence from Khutkar Wada. The Dessais and Khutkars are the two most important communities in the village.Sudhakar Dessai, resident of Thorlemol WadaSarpanch's Take""Development of Calem must include beautification of Vaigond (Tollem). We also need a modern sports playground. The construction of a railway overbridge near the government high school is essential. The rural medical centre, which has been constructed through MPLAD South Goa funds, will commence operations soon. The state government must denotify private properties classified as reserve forest. It will then boost self-employment as villagers will be able to avail subsidy for the first time.Kishor DessaiHeritage TrailCalem railway station: An important landmark in the village since the Portuguese era. Located at Thorlemol Wada, it showcases Calem to the outside world. The South Western Railway runs trains on this route, but villagers have a grievance that apart from local trains, including the Calem-Vasco train, not a single express train stops at the station. Before conversion from metre to broad guage tracks, the trains operating between Miraj and Vasco would halt here.Kalanath Temple: The centuries-old main temple of the village, situated at Thorlemol Wada, was renovated around a decade ago. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and it becomes the most frequented spot during the two days of its zatra in the month of January each year. Zalmi is the another temple in Calem.Our Lady of Fatima Chapel: This chapel is over 150 years old. Mass is celebrated here at 7am daily. It is located opposite the Calem railway station at Thorlemol Wada. It is affiliated to Our Lady of Piety parish church in Colem, Dharbandora.Vaigond (Tollem): Situated at Vegregal Wada, this water body is over 600 years old. It is a spiritual spot and the water is believed to have medicinal properties. It becomes a hotspot during the Mahashivratri puja (annual festival celebrated in honour of Lord Shiva).Tiger Waterfall: The scenic spot at Vegregal comes to life only in the monsoon. There is a place called Tiger's Cave adjacent to it, which is believed to measure around 3km and connects Calem to Costi village in Sanguem taluka.Government Primary School: Situated adjacent to the panchayat, the school was set up in the 1970s. It offers education in the Marathi medium.Government High School: The co-educational school from Class V to Class X at Khodwamol caters to around 220 students.Government Agricultural Farm: Admeasuring around 1.5 lakh sqm in area at Kuinomol, the farm caters to Goa's need for seeds and shrubs such as coconut, mango, cashew, jackfruit, vegetables, flowers, etc. While presenting the 2016-2017 state budget, former CM Laxmikant Parsekar had made a proposal to turn this farm into an organic facility. He also proposed using it as a training centre for farmers by using organic inputs for generating organic outputs.Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services: It caters to the needs of fodder supply as well as providing the services of veterinary doctors to the village cattle. Few years ago, the centre was in the news when stray cattle, which were caught in the state, were housed in its shed.Union Bank of India (UBI): This branch of UBI operates twice a week in the premises of the village panchayat. It is the only banking facility in the village.Renowned ResidentsLate Nevlo Varak: Freedom fighterLate Gango Misal: Freedom fighterSandesh Kalekar: Artist (fine arts)Pratap Kalekar: Singer (classical)Late Kalidas Dessai: Gold medalist volleyball player, who represented Goa in the nationalsShakil Dessai: Physically-challenged artiste in Marathi dramasKrishnanath Naik: Former cricketer, hiker and member of National Institute of Rock ClimbingDarshan Misal: A member of Goa cricket team since 2002Manthan Khutkar: A member of Goa cricket teamDr Pramod Kondo Lambor: DentistDr Damodar Gaunkar: General physicianDr Rohita Govind Gauns Dessai: Dentist"

The tobacco-to-FMCG-to-hotel-to-agri business major is likely to enter the market with fresh potato  a first-of-its-kind in India  followed by some more fresh vegetables. The company is also planning to launch fruit pulps and juices in order to become top food company in India.Devising the India First strategy for the future, CEO Sanjiv Puri (in pic) said: Currently, we rank No. 3 among the food companies in India with a total Rs 8,000-crore consumer spends and two Rs 3,000-crore plus brands  Aashirvaad and Sunfeast. ITC has always preferred to create indigenous brands for its new businesses that include foods, personal care products and stationary. The two Rs 3,000-crore plus food labels are also indigenous brands, which were created in the last decade.Puri pointed out that going forward, the focus will be on fruit, vegetables and sea foods because only 2%-3% of the perishables are now being processed in the country. We shall bring some food products in the fresh form or in shelf-life-enhancing form. Like, we are planning to introduce fresh potato soon, he added.The company is planning to launch low sugar potato and anti-oxidant potato soon. Besides potato, as indicated by Puri, ITC might come out with dehydrated onion later this year.The Kolkata-based company had created a brand called ITC Master Chef for prawn and blended spices earlier this year. The divisional chief executive of the agri business of ITC, S Sivakumar , said the dehydrated onion could come under the ITC Maser Chef brand. We are planning to launch more food products in fresh, semi-processed and in puree form. We are also launching mango pulp soon. This could be under B Natural brand, he added.The food brands of ITC include Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo, Yippee!, ITC Master chef B Natural, Aashirvaad Swasti Ghee, Mint O, Sunbean and Fabelle. Besides Sunfeast and Aashrvaad, the two other over Rs1000-crore brands are Bingo and Yippee!.Candyman has also crossed Rs 500crore mark in terms of consumer spends. Aashirvaad is alredy No. 1 in branded atta while Sunfest is among the leaders in biscuits.The ITC CEO argued that one of the main reasons to come out with semi-processed and fresh vegetables is to reduce colossal waste in fruits and vegetables in India. There is an annual loss of Rs 90,000 crore in perishables. This can be brought down by devising a proper strategy. Food is a very big opportunity for us. ITC has a very strong agro backend as well as trade marketing network, which is required for this, he added."

It was under these tasks that Tabarruk was distributed among the poor irrespective of religion and caste and sent to the descendants of the royal families once a day for the first 10 days of the month of mourning. The Nawab had left an amount of Rs 12 lakh in 1839 at an interest amounting to Rs 48,000 annually to fulfil all tasks under the Deed.Since then until last year, the traditional community kitchen at Chhota Imamabara would be abuzz with activities preparing khameeri roti, potato curry or dal and sheermal. This year, however, the district administration that has additional charge of HAT said that ""complaints about the curry and pulse starting to rot due to weather"" had brought forth suggestion to alter the menu.""Whatever will be convenient and of good quality will be distributed. There were several complaints about the curry and pulse, which is why it was thought of altering it...The sheermal as a better option is under consideration,"" said secretary of HAT and additional district magistrate (ADM) west, Santosh Kumar Vaish.However, this proposal has sought an angry response from common people as well as royal family descendants.""Not a slightest change will be accepted in tradition when the king had left money for customs to be followed. Who is the administration to change it? Why have they created a budget of Rs 27 lakh which is Rs 5 lakh more than last year and are still trying to cut costs by going for just sheermal?"" questioned Farhana Maliki, president of Begumat Royal Family of Awadh.""Every year, there used to be a meeting of HAT with us descendants 15 days before Muharram. This year, we were not involved and decisions were taken by the district magistrate, ADM west and the officer on special duty. What does this show?"" Maliki added.Vaish said, ""We will have a meeting with the families. A second tender has been put up which will be opened on September 13 for a final decision on the menu."""

There are hardly any buyers for our crop. Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in drop of bulk orders from big markets like Delhi and other major cities, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu.He said that potato growers have kept the eatables and seed potatoes in cold storage since the last crop season in anticipation of selling the produce at a better price later.But now there are fewer buyers and poor prices. The crop is still lying and now when the new season crop will hit the market (in next few months) the loss of growers would only aggravate, he added.Facing hardships due to demonetisation, the potato seed growers from Punjab have demanded an immediate freight subsidy so that the growers can transport their crop to other States and fetch some returns.Also, the growers have urged the State government to waive crop loans of potato growers besides asking the State agencies to intervene and generate markets at the national and international level.Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country including West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP , MP and Odisha. Potato seed is usually supplied from last week of October to mid-December every year."
