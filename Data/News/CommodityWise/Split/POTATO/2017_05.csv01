In Chennai, the lingering smell of Shiuli phool (night jasmine) and the arrival of the goddess seem to have equally mesmerised the Tamil community.As various Bengali associations gear up of the four-day carnival, Tamils in the city too are getting ready for a slice of the fest.Sarayan Ganesan, 50, a visitor to the SMCA Durga puja pandal for the past 14 years, says she remains spellbound by the evening aarti and the beauty of the Bengali women in their red-bordered saris. ""For people like us who haven't visited Kolkata during the pujo, this is a great replica. And we enjoy it to our heart's content, "" she says.The Bengal Association of T Nagar , which will celebrate its 84th year of puja, extends the celebrations to the local community.According to Moloy Roy, the secretary, the celebration here is home ly and inclusive. ""We have observed that with years, more Tamils have become part of this revelry ,"" he says. He adds that they are also crazy about rasgulla, luchi (puri) and aloor dum (a spicy potato gravy). ""They throng these stalls and the food gets over in no time, "" he says.It is not only the food that has won over the Tamil community; the rituals keep them as much in awe. ""Apart from enjoying the khichudi bhog, we have many Tamils who come forward to help us in or ganising the pujo, "" says Madhumita Chatterjee , an executive member of South Madras Cultural Association (SMCA), Besant Nagar.Like the other associations, Dakshini society , Anna Nagar, too has seen a rise in the participation of Tamils over the last 23 years.""Our USP is the diversity in our menu and the cultural programme we organise. It has drawn the praise of our Tamil friends,"" says a proud Vikram Pal Chaudhary , 35, the vice-president of the society .Bengalis love their meat and fish, and their consumption during pujo only goes up. One cannot imagine the lunch of Navami and Dashami without a sumptuous dish of fish or mutton.""Our inclusion of meat in the pujo feast does leave some of our Tamil friends puzzled, "" smiles Raja Mukherjee, 44, the founding member of Dakshin Chennai Probashi Cultural Association , which will celebrate its 4th Durga pujo this year. ""But we have a large number of Tamil participants sharing their enthusiasm and the spirit for the festival, "" he adds."

(Prashant Mitra) Ranchi, July 28: A day after a five-storey cold storage crumbled in Kanke block fanning speculation of flawed design and construction, VegFed Jharkhand today filed an FIR against Airtec Cooling Private Limited, the Faridabad agency that built the structure in 2010 and is currently raising an expansion wing. Jaidev Singh, managing director of state co-operative VegFed, said charges in the FIR ranged from negligent construction to possible use of substandard material. ""We have now asked National Farmers Club Co-operative Society (the Bihar agency running the cold storage since 2015) to clear the debris and salvage stocks (of potatoes and corn). As far as I know, they have arranged for a crane and gas cutters,"" he said, adding that the worker reported missing yesterday had been traced to a nearby area and was safe. Kanke thana OC Rajiv Ranjan said the FIR was filed under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), 420 (fraud) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. Asked who would cover the losses, Singh added that according to their agreement with NFCCSL, the latter should have insured the stocks, which was worth Rs 4 crore. State co-operatives registrar Vijoy Kumar Singh said to fix accountability for the loss, the probe team of the building construction department was expected to submit its report in a day or two. ""The probe will reveal the lapses to facilitate action,"" he said. After the 5,000sqft property on 20 decimal land at Arsande-Sarpanch Toli in Borio, 15km from the capital, collapsed around 2am yesterday, a district official, who had conducted a preliminary inspection of the spot, squarely blamed faulty design and use of substandard materials. ""Pillar thickness should be between 16mm and 20mm, but here it is not more than 10mm. Also, the pillars have no iron skeleton. Similarly, the roof is devoid of iron beams. A thorough probe may reveal more gaps,"" he had said. Chairman of NFCCSL Pawan Kumar, on the other hand, accused the state of dilly-dallying relief. ""The stocks of potato and corn are perishable. The government is neither salvaging the sacks from the debris nor allowing us to do so,"" he said, adding that they had sought help from the NDRF too, but were refused. A district official said the NDRF's job was to rescue lives and not remove vegetable stocks from debris. ""The NDRF was called to inspect the area. The administration has asked VegFed to clear the debris, which in turn has asked the NFCCSL to do the needful,"" he said, adding that guards had been deployed at the cold storage to prevent pilferage."

Especially for procrastinating writers, people who came into writing really late, and writers for whom the real world problem of procuring the daily bread has taken them away from writing. Mary Anne Shaffer is the inspiring writer they should read about. Shaffer wrote her first book when she was 73. It was a story which germinated during an idyllic vacation to a not-very-well-known island, nearly 40 years ago.Are you listening, Procrastination? Due to ill health, Shaffer could not complete her book, and her niece, the childrens writer Annie Barrows had to take her, and the book to the finishing line. Shaffer died before the book was published. That book was The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, the most joyful and uplifting book if there ever was one. Dear writer, trust yourself, you have your Guernsey Literary in you. And you are never too late to start.Elizabeth McKenna is dead, one thinks. She is lost to the war. The second big one. But she lives on in the hearts and minds of her friends and neighbors and the people whose lives she touched. She lived in Guernsey, an island along the English Channel which is part of the United Kingdom, and the only part of British soil that was occupied by the Germans.The war is over now, and the Allied forces have won. The Germans are not there anymore, normalcy is slowly returning to Guernsey and its quaint old-world folks, but things is not quite the same. This is an epistolatory novel, one that is written in the form of letters. The main letter writer of this novel is the lead character, Juliet Ashton. She is a young British writer, and was a war journalist previously. Now that the war is over, she is coming to terms with the aftermath.One day, she gets a letter from a pig farmer from Guernsey, a Dawsey Adams, who had found her address in a copy of a book by Charles and Mary Lamb, which was previously owned by Juliet. This starts a communication with the gentle, mellow folks of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a society formed on the spur of the moment by the aforementioned Elizabeth McKenna  and which saved the lives of a fair few of the islanders. How? Because Elizabeth and her friends, which included Dawsey, had inadvertently broken an evening curfew, which was imposed by the Germans on the German-occupied Island.An inadvertent-delay-due-to-literary-society-event was not as much frowned upon by the Germans as feast-and-revelry. Juliet exchanges letters with Dawsey and the other members of the society, and slowly integrates herself with the people, their island, their lives, their memories of Elizabeth, and their love of books. Until one day, she sets sail from London and lands up in the island. May all books have a soul like The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society."

Picture by Swapnaneel Bhattacharjee Silchar, Aug. 19: Karimganj deputy commissioner Pradip Kumar Talukdar today said teams would be sent to markets across the district to inspect whether uniformity is being maintained in prices of vegetables. The prices have shot up immensely following the recent waves of floods. A large number of citizens have alleged that some vendorsraders, taking advantage of the floods, are charging arbitrarily. Talukdar, who held a meeting with administration officials this afternoon on the issue, said a report would be submitted on the basis of the inspection and stern action would be taken against those found to have fleeced the public by overcharging them. Currently, the prices of some of the vegetables are - chilly (Rs 300/kg), brinjal (Rs 80/kg), string beans (Rs 80/kg), tomato (Rs 70/kg), ridge gourd (Rs 60/kg), cabbage, radish, eddoe (all Rs 50/kg), onion and sayote (Rs 40/kg) and potato (Rs 20/kg). These rates are prevalent in most markets, including Chantar Bazar, Nilambazar, Shanibari Bazar and Kaliganj. In some places, the prices fluctuate and are even higher, residents alleged. The general secretary of Chantar Bazar Byabsayi Samiti, Pijush Das, said crops have been damaged across the state because of floods this year, pushing up the prices of vegetables, and it would take some time for circumstances to return to normal. He added that vegetables are being sold at rates equal to other markets in Chantar Bazar market and that vendors here do not fleece customers. Narrating the plight of lower middle class and poor people because of unethical practices adopted by a section of vendors, Abdul Bakkar, a retired grade IV government employee, said people are already facing extreme financial troubles because of the floods and the skyrocketing prices of vegetables/commodities added insult to injury. crisis of having vegetables in the district In summer, farmers of Karimganj district grow vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and others. In winter, vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, carrot, capsicum and others are grown, he mentioned. Nearly 2,300 hectares of cultivable land, where vegetables are grown, have been damaged and more than 30,000 farmers have suffered losses because of floods this year. Sources said vegetables are being brought to Karimganj from Tripura, Shillong and Barpeta district, among others. However, since floods have affected those places too, the problem has been aggravated."

A flat screen TV lay smashed on the ground nearby.Daesh (IS) used to broadcast their productions here for residents to watch -- footage of their battles, punishments, and anasheeds (Islamic hymns), said Shoresh al-Raqqawi, a 25-year-old Raqqa native and Syrian Democratic Forces fighter.The SDF ousted the last remaining IS fighters from Raqqa on Tuesday and while most of the forces had withdrawn, Raqqawi stayed behind as part of a small unit helping to clear rubble from streets and remove mines.The only sign of movement on Saturday in the heavily-damaged neighbourhoods around Raqqas famous clock tower was by bulldozers and a handful of white SDF pickup trucks.Raqqawi recounted how IS members working at the kiosk would stop young men with cell phones and erase the songs on their devices, replacing them with Islamic anasheeds.Daesh also used to bring young children here, give them sweets, potato chips, and biscuits, and make them watch the videos and listen to their songs, he added.- Behemoth administration -For years, IS has operated a sophisticated and multilingual media machine, complete with online magazines, radio broadcasts, and social media campaigns highlighting its military prowess and gruesome tactics.It often used minors in its propaganda output to ratchet up the shock factor, boasting of child soldiers that it called Cubs of the Caliphate.While IS media continue to operate from elsewhere following Raqqas fall, there has been a shift in tone, with the narrative nostalgically recalling the caliphate.On Saturday the names and logos of ISs many outlets could be seen emblazoned on a tattered, greyish banner near the media kiosk in Clock Tower Square: Al-Bayan Radio, Al-Hayat, Al-Furqan, and Al-Naba pamphlet.The group used the channels to publish grisly footage online of the punishment and even execution of alleged opponents, including Western hostages or those accused of being spies.But while most of the world could look away, Raqqawi and fellow SDF fighter Khalid Abu Walid were often forced to watch these practices live.They would whip and hit people so hard, said Abu Walid, 21, telling AFP how shops and streets in the roundabout would shutter and residents would gather around to watch whatever punishment was being doled out.All roundabouts in Raqa had media points like this, Abu Walid said.Torn IS papers can be found on almost every damaged Raqa street, providing clues to the behemoth administration that the jihadist organisation once ran there.One dusty card features a table recording the number of times its owner received zakat, or charitable offers, from others.Another document details the handover of the hisba -- or police office -- from one manager to another.On Saturday, a unit of foreign intelligence officers dressed in military gear and thick neon orange gloves could be seen inspecting a home near Raqas infamous Al-Naim roundabout.They are searching suspected IS headquarters, which they heard about from residents who escaped the city, an SDF fighter accompanying them said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press.They are looking for bodies, identification cards, and other intelligence."

5a14c70b9855b76bf13e7c4f,Keeping it crisp,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/keeping-it-crisp/article19857808.ece,2017-10-14,"Everybody loves a good dish, if I may borrow the much-used title of a book written by an old friend. So, people I know and dont know, and who are fond of food, often give me tips about where to go for a particularly crispy kachori or juicy kabab. Some days ago, a young foodie who runs a cab service sent a message across  that I should try out Jung Bahadurs kachori.The name rang a bell but I couldnt place it right then. Later, I recalled that there was a Jung Bahadur kachori-wallah in Nai Sarak whose crispy kachoris I had eaten and enjoyed. But we called him Dinesh Kachoriwallah.I went back to Nai Sarak sometime last week  and found that the kachoris are still being sold from the roadside. I ate some, but was told that they have a main branch now in Maliwara.The address is 1104 Maliwara, Gali Paranthe Wali, Chandni Chowk (Phone numbers: 99114-01440 and 98916-98995). From the Chandni Chowk Metro Station, move towards Paranthe Wali Gali. At the T-junction turn right, and you will find the kachori shop on your left a hundred yards ahead.This is a very popular kachori place, so the turnover is high. That means the kachoris are freshly fried, which, of course, is what the dish is all about. Right in front of you, in bubbling hot oil in a huge kadhai, you will see the kachoris being fried. Then they are served with a potato curry, which is topped with a helping of kachaloo strips. One kachori is for Rs. 20, and two are for Rs. 35.The kachoris and the curry are transported to the Nai Sarak counter for those who find it easier to get there. This is at the mouth of Katra Jamun. If you move from the Town Hall towards Nai Sarak, you will see the kachori stall some 200 yards down the road.I enjoyed the kachori, even though it was a bit too hot for me. The kachori was fresh and crunchy, and what was nice was the fact that it had been well stuffed with a dal paste. The potatoes had been mashed well in the sabzi, and the kachaloo added a tangy taste to it. Some chutney was served with it, along with slivers of ginger and green chillies.Side helpingJang Bahadur  these days known as JB  serves you the kachoris with the potato sabzi on top of it. If you want, you can ask them to break open the kachori for you, and to then add the curry. Thats one way of eating it, allowing the potatoes to mix well with the kachori. I ate it like that, but I prefer to have my kachori whole  nice and crispy  and I enjoy biting into it with a side helping of potatoes or pumpkin, or whatever it is served with it.JB works well for those who like kachoris spicy and hot, for even the dal pithi stuffing has its share of chillies. I like an occasional hot kachori, and quite enjoy the different tastes that the kachoriwallahs excel in.It was nice to have gone back to an old friend. Hot or not, its a kachori."
5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

Family Nymphalidae was the most dominant among the five families with 22 species, followed by Lycaenidae, comprising of 19 species, the paper titled A study of butterfly diversity in Singur says.Five of the species found in Singur are rare and to be protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They include species like the Tree Flitter, Striped Albatross, Pea Blue, Common Indian Crow and Danaid Eggfly. The other interesting species found here include the Zebra Blue, the Common Banded Peacock and the Indian Skipper.The paper, authored by researchers Pritam K. Dey, Arajush Payra and Krishnendu Mondal, was published in June 2017 in the environmental journal e- planet . The study was carried out from March 2015 to November 2016, and most butterflies were observed between 8 a.m. and noon.Detailed study in futureThe presence of 69 species of butterflies in Singur points out that the butterfly diversity of the region is high. This is a preliminary study. More detailed studies in future can bring out more species. What is striking about Singur is that the area is not only rich in butterfly diversity but also in the diversity of frogs and birds, Mr. Dey said.Researchers found butterflies in the rice and vegetable fields of the area, as well as in bushes and shrubs along railway lines and National Highways.No forested landSingur has no forested land and the area is known for rice, potato and vegetable cultivation.Mr. Dey said that more intensive studies on different ecological parameters that can help access diversity of Singurs fauna are being planned.The presence of so many species of butterflies has provided a great deal of joy to the farmers who had waged a long battle against the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) led West Bengal government against the acquisition of 997 acres of agricultural land for Tata Motors Nano car plant in Singur.While our struggle was aimed at the return of the land acquired for the proposed car plant, we are happy that it has helped the environment of Singur. There would have not so many butterflies had the car plant been operational, said Mahabdeb Das, a farmer who was at the forefront of the land acquisition struggle. He was pleasantly surprised to learn about the butterfly diversity of the region.On August 30, 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the Left Front governments acquisition of 997 acres of land for the car plant in Singur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee returned the acquired land to farmers on September 14, 2016."

Borewells too have dried up. Three months ago, he sowed seeds of korale (browntop millets). I have invested hardly Rs. 2,000 to grow korale. The yield is expected to be around 4 quintals worth about Rs. 12,000, he said.As it was the first time he chose to cultivate millets, he limited it to only one acre. The millet is rich in fibre and many growers keep a major portion of it for personal consumption. When this correspondent visited Mr. Jayannas farm on Friday, Korale Raghu of Sira taluk, who is known for cultivation of korale millet in Tumakuru district, was interacting with local farmers on the importance of millets. Korale cultivation is cost effective. With minimum investment, farmers can register maximum returns, he said. He grows korale millet on 17 acres of land.Earlier, G.V. Raghu, project director of Organisation for Resource Development and Environment Rejuvenation, said: Farmers in the hobli were cultivating potato and maize. Owing to long-time mono-crop cultivation, the yield had come down. Now, hundreds of farmers have grown ragi and they are happy with the yield. His NGO has been engaged in educating farmers on the importance of millet cultivation. Similarly, many have grown foxtail millet, little millet and green gram.V.G. Bhat, District Development Manager (NABARD). said: With the view of holistic development, the bank is encouraging cultivation of minor millets in parts of drought-prone taluks. The bank is happy with the response from the farmers. The bank has spent over Rs. 9 lakh for starting farmer-producer organisations, besides expenses on training, providing seeds and fertilizers."
