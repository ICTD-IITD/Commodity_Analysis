Prices that shot up after recent rains continue to remain high, deterring customers, the sellers say.K.V.S. GiriK.V.S. GIRIVegetable prices in the city continue to remain perched at increased rates despite monsoon withdrawal from the State nearing completion.Prices in the city increased during the first few days of October even as supply was affected. Vendors attributed the poor quality and high price of some commonly consumed vegetables to rains. A check of prices in government retail as well as wholesale markets suggested prices continue to pinch the common man.High quantityThough the quality and quantity has improved, the prices continue to be high. Customers have cut down on their purchase, said Venu Naik, a vegetable seller in Sainikpuri. The effect of rains in grower regions continue to affect prices.For instance, at the Bowenpally vegetable market, the arrival of hybrid variant of tomato had nearly doubled since the start of the month, accompanied with a three-time price increase. The variant was selling for a maximum price of Rs. 48 per kilo in the wholesale market. In retail markets however, the price was about Rs. 75 per kilo.The local variant of tomato is selling over Rs. 65 per kilo while the wholesale price stands at about Rs. 32 per kilo.Different pricesWhile potato and onion prices did not register a high, the cost of carrot continue to remain higher than its price last month. A kilo at Bowenpally market was listed at Rs. 55 on Tuesday. Carrot price in Rythu Bazars was around Rs. 70 with the private retail market demanding about Rs. 5 higher.The price of French bean at around Rs. 100 in the local private market, also remains higher than that of last month."

Only potato is available for Rs 13 per kg, giving a sigh relief to consumers. Even coriander leaf has become dearer by Rs 32 while green chilly is being sold at Rs 30 per kg.""I was shocked to see the prices of vegetables at Rythu Bazaar. Tomatoes which were being sold at Rs 13 per kg a week ago is now priced at Rs 30. Brinjals, which were being sold at Rs 18 a kg a few days ago, is now being sold at Rs 34 per kg, said S Dhanalakshmi, a homemaker.The exorbitant prices will continue for another two or three weeks till the end of Karthika Masam, claim traders. Till then, people have to bear the brunt of sky-rocketing prices.The month is famous for Vanabhojanam and Deekshas and many other traditions in the Hindu calendar. People observe fast and consume only vegetables, said N Veerababu, a trader at Rythu Bazar. When contacted, Rythu Bazar officials said the market procures vegetables from the neighbouring villages of Krishna and Guntur district on a daily basis and all those areas have seen bumper productions.They claimed that vegetable farmers would not suffer much loss as vegetable crops are harvested in phases. After a fortnight, the prices would stabilise bringing relief to the growers, they said."

They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal)Her hair brushed back, a comb tucked in her bun, Gudiya (26) is at ease this Tuesday afternoon. People from the administration are hovering around her, while six policemen keep a vigil on visitors. Officials from Jaldega block in Jharkhands Simdega district, a Naxal-dominated area, have come to the house in Karimati village to help the family encash a cheque of Rs 50,000 given by the administration to Gudiyas mother, Koyli Devi (45). They escort her to the bank located at Jaldega, where Koyli is told she can withdraw the money next week.Breastfeeding the youngest of her children, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, half-an-hour later, Koyli talks of all she can buy with the money. Or could have bought for Santoshi. On September 28 night, her 11-year-old daughter died  Koyli says of starvation  seven months after the family stopped getting their rations as their Aadhaar wasnt linked to PDS. Later, the familys name was struck off the ration card list. Santoshi was the third child Koyli lost; the other two died of illness.Read | Santoshi died of starvationApart from the Rs 50,000 cheque and the Rs 15,000-odd in aid given by visiting leaders, Santoshis death has brought the family 75 kg of rice from the government and other benefactors, 20 kg of potatoes, two litres of edible oil, adequate kerosene oil, 10 soap bars, some green vegetables and tomatoes. Koyli is planning to stock up on more vegetables and pulses at the Wednesday haat.Then, once the cheque is encashed, Koyli will make other purchases. Family members are saying I should get a mobile phone. Also, we need things for the house. We will buy a box (suitcase), she says. The family, including Koyli, husband Tatya Naik, daughters Gudiya and Chando Kumari, and son Prakash, lives in a mud house, with mud-baked tiles for roof. The house comprises a large room, with a small area partitioned off as kitchen.The rest of the money she would keep in the bank, Koyli says, as saving  a new luxury for her.Earlier that day, Koyli indulged in another small luxury. When Chando, 8, asked for something to eat, she gave her Rs 10 to buy coconut biscuits. She likes fancy things to eat and was crying, Koyli says, with a faint smile.Santoshi was never fussy about food, the 45-year-old adds. She only kept asking for rice, but there was not a single grain at home.***************Rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for dinner. Thats been Hemanti Kumaris routine all 10 years of her life. She is in Class 5 of Upgraded Primary School, Karimati. Santoshi cleared Class 5 from here too early this year, but never went on to the middle school (Classes 6 to 8), in the nearby Pangur hamlet.A sprightly girl, barely over 3 ft in height in her slippers and school uniform, Hemanti is happy as today has been a special day. In the morning, she made herself two chappatis and boiled some potatoes  that will be her evening snack, a rare fourth meal.Read | After starvation death case: Jharkhand minister scraps top state officials order on Aadhaar-PDS linkHer mother Padma Devi sits next to an earthen chulha, dug in the verandah of their mud house. She has placed twigs as cooking fuel, and from time to time, stirs a potato curry with tomatoes on the chulha.Hemantis father Gurucharan Mahato works as a labourer, taking up odd jobs. Padma cant do much work as both her legs are amputated. They live at her brother Nareshs home, and are grateful they have only two children to raise. Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Farmland, the brand under which the firm will market fresh fruits and vegetables, has been initially introduced in New Delhi.For starters, four variants of potatoes have been launched under the brand. However, according to the firm, the brand will begin diversifying into other fruits and vegetables from the next quarter.ITC will also begin introducing the brand in other metro locations. The four introductory products are naturally low sugar potatoes, potatoes with natural antioxidants, baby potatoes for special dishes and French fry potatoes. The next product likely to be launched under the Farmland brand is branded apples.We are introducing potatoes in Delhi. It will be available in seven metros in the next 12 months, said S Sivakumar, group head - agri business and IT at ITC, adding that Farmland potatoes will be available in about 1,000 stores in Delhi over the next 2-3 months. The company will not rely only on large organised retailers and e-commerce but also focus on distributing Farmland products through neighbourhood stores.The total market for table potatoes in India in terms of consumer spend is valued at Rs 70,000 crore with consumption in metros and mini-metros alone close to Rs 5,000 crore, which is what ITCs Farmland potatoes range will address in the first phase, ITC said. Farmland products will be sold at 10-15 per cent premium over local prices.FMCG major Ruchi Soya (RSIL) has announced that it will offload a majority stake to global private equity firm Devonshire Capital.ITC plans to work with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research - Central Potato Research Institute to build the buzz of nutritional benefits of potatoes and dispel some of the myths around it, the company said in a statement. It claims that the value-added potatoes that they are launching are naturally low in fat and sugar with fat content below 0.2% and sugar level below 2% respectively"

(File | Reuters)NEW DELHI: Wholesale inflation fell to 2.60 per cent in September as prices of food articles, led by vegetables, softened.Inflation, based on the wholesale price index (WPI), had soared to a four-month high of 3.24 per cent in August 2017.It was 1.36 per cent in September 2016.The government data released today showed that inflation in food articles tapered to 2.04 per cent in September, as against 5.75 per cent in August on an yearly basis.Inflation in vegetable prices cooled to 15.48 per cent in September, as against a high of 44.91 per cent in the previous month.Onion prices, however, continued to rule high with 79.78 per cent increase in September. In egg, meat and fish segment the rate of price rise was 5.47 per cent.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.72 per cent, against 2.45 per cent in August.In fuel and power segment, inflation cooled to 9.01 per cent, against 9.99 per cent in August.Fuel inflation has remained high in the past two months as petrol and diesel prices continued to rule high relentlessly on global crude oil rates, while power tariffs shot through the roof on lower domestic production.Pulses continued to witness deflation at 24.26 per cent, likewise in potato at 46.52 per cent and wheat at 1.71 per cent.The final print of July WPI inflation remained unchanged from provisional estimate of 1.88 per cent.Data released earlier this week showed retail inflation at 3.28 per cent in September, unchanged from August, even as vegetable and cereal prices softened.Besides industrial production grew at a nine-month high of 4.3 per cent in August, mainly on account of robust performance of mining and power sectors coupled with higher capital goods output.Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank kept benchmark interest rate unchanged on fears of rising inflation while lowering growth forecast to 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal.It also raised its inflation forecast to a range of 4.2 to 4.6 per cent during remainder of current fiscal as against 4 to 4.5 per cent previously."
5a1515979855b76bf13eac8b,National Institute of Ocean Technology in Chennai's deep-sea mission  moving in top gear,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/17/national-institute-of-ocean-technology-in-chennais-deep-sea-mission--moving-in-top-gear-1676054.html,2017-10-17,"CHENNAI: Oil and natural gas have been extracted from the seas for decades, but ores and mineral deposits on the sea floor, which have the potential to change the face of economy, have still been elusive. But Indian scientists are making steady progress and an integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules (manganese nodules).The Government of India has an area of 75,000 sq km in the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) for carrying out survey and exploration of these potato-shaped, largely porous nodules, found in abundance carpeting the sea floor. A rough estimate says that polymetallic nodules in the site allotted to India by International Seabed Authority (ISA) is about 380 Million Metric Tonne (MMT), with 0.55 MMT of Cobalt, 4.7 MMT of Nickel, 4.29 MMT of Copper and 92.59 MMT of Manganese.NIOT-developed crawler to be usedfor deep-sea mining; (below)manganese nodules dredged fromCentral Indian Ocean BasinSpeaking to Express on the sidelines of a special thematic session on Deep Ocean Research, M Rajeevan, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said the Union government had signed a 15-year contract with ISA for exploration of polymetallic nodules, which expired this year. Now, another five-year extension has been given for India to develop and demonstrate a workable deep-sea mining technology.National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) in Chennai has demonstrated the technology on a pilot scale and further research is going on at full pace, he said. Rajeevan added it was the biggest ocean engineering challenge, considering these nodules are to be mined from a depth of 6 km in an ultra high-pressure environment.NIOT director Satheesh C Shenoy was confident that his team will crack the complex technology. Deep-sea Technologies and Ocean Mining Group of NIOT have already developed the crawler, which weighs 12 tonnes and a soil tester that will determine the characteristics of soil on the seabed where the crawler is deployed. Currently, our team is developing the pumping system. Different components are being tested and will be integrated shortly. We hope to realise the full technology a couple of years down the line, he said.The idea is to have an integrated mining system where a crawler-based mining machine collects, crushes and pumps nodules to the mother ship using a positive displacement pump through a flexible riser system. It is expected that multiple mining machines will cover the mining field during large scale commercial mining operations. The challenge is that the heavy crawler has to be lowered to a depth of 6 km using a conducting cable, which should transmit data as well as hold the crawler steady. Any mishap can sink the mother ship, Shenoy said.Rajeevan Nair clarified that India has permission to explore, but not commercially mine the minerals. No country has the license to do deep-sea mining, but when the time comes, India should be ready to take advantage. India already has the technology to separate the minerals from dredged nodules. The Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology in Bhubaneswar has done lot of work on it.Indias Test Mine Site (TMS) is about 6,000 km away from Indian coast deep inside CIOB. Initially, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa had done close grid bathymetric (study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors) surveys in 1.5 million sq km and identified manganese nodules deposits, of which 75,000 sq km was given to India for exploration and development of sustainable mining technology. NIOT director says what the scientists are developing may not be the final technology. We can only develop an operational product, but it is for the industry to fine tune further to suit their bill, he added.Who regulates sea floor mining?To regulate sea floor mining, in 1994 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea spawned the International Seabed Authority, an independent treaty organisation. It has jurisdiction over seabed outside exclusive economic zones that surround nations shorelinesWhat are polymetallic nodules?Manganese nodules are lumps of minerals ranging in size from a potato to a head of lettuce. They are composed mainly of manganese, iron, silicates and hydroxides. The greatest densities of nodules occur off the west coast of Mexico (in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone), in the Peru Basin, and the Indian OceanPotentialA rough estimate says that polymetallic nodules in the site allotted to India by International Seabed Authority (ISA) is about 380 Million Metric Tonne (MMT) with 0.55 MMT of Cobalt, 4.7 MMT of Nickel, 4.29 MMT of Copper and 92.59 MMT of Manganese"

The new interlocutor will be expected to find some headway towards finalising a solution before the Supreme Court hears the case again.The issue has come to the centre stage of controversy after the Supreme Court's indication that it may be dealt with by a five-judge constitution bench, to ascertain that, if Article 35A relating to special rights and privileges of the citizens of the Jammu and Kashmir is ultra vires of the Constitution or if there is any procedural lapse.The issue has triggered controversy after a plea was filed by Charu Wali Khanna, a lawyer and former member of the National Commission for Women, challenging Article 35A of the Constitution and Section 6 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution which deal with the ""permanent residents"" of the state.The plea has challenged certain provisions of the Constitution which deny property right to a woman who marries a person from outside the state.The provision, which makes such women from the state to lose rights over property, also applies to her son.The matter is a hot political potato in Jammu and Kashmir with the mainstream regional political parties, like ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), main opposition National Conference, and separatist leadership clearly warning that any change in status quo over Article 35A invite serious repercussions.While on the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre and as a coalition partner in Jammu and Kashmir, has been historically against any special provisions to Jammu and Kashmir."

But Chennai generates more than 5000 tonnes of domestic waste every day. Where will all the waste go?People love complaining about the ever-growing, towering landfills but dont do anything to stop the mess from growing bigger.Almost three weeks in, the waste segregation campaign launched by Chennai Corporation to bring down solid waste has failed to gain traction. Thirty-five-year-old Raja*, a conservancy worker from Zone 10 thought his work would become easier after the corporation launched it on October 2. However, he is yet to sift through remains of last nights sambar rice (a biodegradable waste) to retrieve an empty packet of potato chips (non-biodegradable).Very few people have started segregating waste. Most leave the unsegregated waste outside and arent available so we cant even tell them to start segregating waste, Raja tells Express. Even when segregation is done, it isnt done carefully. Lakshmi R, a resident of Guindy, has been taking down only the kitchen dustbin when bio-degradable waste is being collected. However, she admits that empty oil, masala and noodles packets also go into the dustbin. I think about disposing of them separately, but its inconvenient, she says.It is very clear the two dustbin system hasnt debuted in the majority of the households in the city and the most recent initiative taken by the corporation might fizzle out. Zonal officers have also been observing a lack of enthusiasm. We have given residents a three-month grace period. After that, we will stop taking waste from households which dont comply, said a senior official from Solid Waste Management (SWM) department.Signs of hopeJoseph Jagans kuppathotti.com, a doorstep service which collects recyclables, has managed to attract around 40,000 households who regularly segregate their waste. Going to the local scrap shops is an inconvenience for this time-crunched society. So that is where we come in, he says. The families which subscribe to kuppathotti.com have a two dustbin system which helps them easily send the non-biodegradable waste to be recycled.These 40,000 families might seem like a drop in the ocean of the city which has a population of 7.1 million but it shows that the system is sustainable. Kurien Joseph, a professor at the Centre For Environmental Studies, Anna University, deems the two-dustbin system essential. Around 80 per cent of the waste generated can be either composted or recycled, he says. With public cooperation, waste which reaches landfills every day can be brought down to around 1000 tonnes.In Manali, where waste segregation was first introduced as a pilot project, the number of public dustbins came down from 267 to 68. This clearly shows the amount of waste generated will comprehensively come down.Giant dump yardsThe Kodungaiyur and Perungudi landfills have been in existence for almost three decades. With a combined total area of more than 400 acres, these landfills are also more than 20 feet tall.A senior official from the SWM department says that incinerators are imminent and that waste would have to be burned to reclaim the land. We have been planning to reduce the area occupied by the two landfills and a sacrifice has to be made, he said.The two landfills have both been known to generate leachate, which pollutes the groundwater of nearby areas. The Corporation also plans to launch waste to energy plants in both landfills. The energy generation might not be great but something is better than nothing, said the senior official.Need for penaltyThe Corporation says the domestic waste of those who dont comply after the grace period will not be collected. However, activists believe people shouldnt be let off so easily. MB Nirmal, the founder of EXNORA, an organization that began talking about waste segregation almost three decades ago, believes in spreading awareness through local welfare bodies. However a penalty should be levied on defaulters, he says. Segregating waste just makes the job of the conservancy worker easier  is a common misconception which stops people from taking the initiative.However, in addition to saving Raja the trouble of sifting through last nights sambar rice, it can also stop the mounds at Perungudi and Kodungaiyur from growing bigger."

The houses promised by officials exist only on paper, and there are fears that children may drop out of school, choosing a life of drugs & violenceCHENNAI: For someone whose life is built around fish, 10-year-old Sanjay doesnt really like to have them for lunch. Hes a picky eater; he will not finish his food without potato or eggs, complained his mother, Kalaivani. On Thursday, however, Sanjay sat eating lemon rice  no potatoes or eggs, from an upturned orange frisbee, amidst the rubble that was only hours ago, his home.Sanjay lost his home at Nalla Thanni Odai Kuppam near Kasimedu to the recent eviction drive by revenue officials of Ambattur on Wednesday. Around 130 houses in the fishing hamlet were demolished on a single day and residents allege that they werent even given time to recover their belongings.Residents of NTO Kuppam had to sift through the rubble to recover their belongings | P jawaharExpress had earlier reported how the land on which these 130 houses were built is not exactly necessary for a proposed highway. Around 230 families had earlier been evicted in the first phase six months ago, to make way for the Ennore Expressway that was proposed in 2005. A senior official from Tamil Nadu Road Development Corporation (TNRDC) had told Express that the land cleared in the first phase is enough for the highway and this was one of the reasons the remaining residents of NTO Kuppam questioned the need to evict them.But none were ready to hear their arguments and after Wednesdays forced eviction, the hamlet looked as if it were rocked by an earthquake. Clothes, kitchen utensils, toothbrushes, mirrors, and almirahs lay buried under asbestos sheets and bricks.Residents with their prized possessions on the road after the eviction drive by revenue officials | p jawaharNothing. We were able to take nothing out; all my marksheets are buried inside, said 17-year-old Mercy, Sanjays neighbour. Sanjay and his brother Ajay also lost their textbooks in the debris. But I pulled the frisbee out, and some of my other toys, said a proud Sanjay.However, the 130 families have no place to take the broken, torn or bent remains. Land for resettlement of the residents of this hamlet was allocated but not a single brick was laid by the Slum Clearance Board so far at the site three kilometers away.It still hasnt been cleared of weeds and plants. We dont know when the government will begin the work, said Kalaivani. As per the State governments own statement on September 20, the government had only then decided to expedite the tender for construction of tenements.Classified as encroachers, these families cannot raise questions. But these families have been living in the hamlet for at least three generations and kept moving inward due to coastal erosion.Nothing prepared his family for what was to come. First came the oil spill, and now this. After the oil spill, business fell and it still hasnt recovered. We used to make a maximum of Rs 6000-Rs 7000 a month. Now it has halved, said his mother Kalaivani, who sold fish, like most other women in the hamlet, for a livelihood.So, when the government authorities handed them Rs 20,000 per family around six months ago during the first phase of evictions to find accommodation, they used it for food instead. What do we do when theres no income? Besides, how do they expect us to find accommodation for over six months with Rs 20,000? It wont even cover the advance,  said Kalaivani.After the eviction, none of the residents moved. They stayed the night in makeshift tents and some, in the temple, the only structure left standing. It was a bad night as it rained. The rain was heavy last night. We didnt have money to go anywhere else as all our relatives are here only. We took shelter in the temple but I still got wet. Look, I have running nose, said Sanjay. Many of the aayas were crying all night long.None of the nearly 50 students in NTO kuppam will go to school at least for a week or until the families manage to find another house. Around a kilometre away, Jonitha John, Sanjays favourite teacher at a corporation school in Washermanpet, was a worried woman.She had heard about the evictions. The students flocking around her had whispered that Sanjays house has been demolished. Jonitha described him as a street-smart kid brilliant at arithmetic. He loves outdoor activities, she said. She recollected the numerous butterfly cocoons he had brought to class so the entire class could watch it magically turn into a butterfly.However, Sanjay wasnt the perfect student. Ever since his father got arrested a few weeks ago for a petty crime, Sanjay had resorted to hitting his classmates and using violence to solve issues. He was a loner. So we started involving him in lots of group activities, said Jonitha. And things were looking up. She is worried that the break could hamper the progress. There was another boy, Adithya, in the other section. His family also belonged to NTO Kuppam and was evicted six months ago in the first phase. Hes dropped out since, lamented Jonitha.Sanjay said he wants to become a police officer when he grows up. With school no more the priority as he picks out his toys and books from the rubble, one can only hope the sudden tragedy will not further fuel the bouts of violence he exhibits and take him on the footsteps of his father.The rehabilitationAs reported by Express earlier, the State government had promised to build tenements for NTO Kuppams residents in the 2.28 acres of land belonging to Arulmigu Thiyagarajaswami Temple some 3 kms away. But construction has not started yet. There are fears that children from the area could drop out of school and choose a path of violenceThe roadOfficials say the H600-crore Ennore-Manali Road Improvement Project (EMRIP) project is nearing completionThe project road network of 30.1 km covers Ennore Expressway (5.9 km), Thiruvottiur Ponneri Pancheti Road (9 km), Manali Oil Refinery Road (5.4 km), Northern segment of Inner Ring Road (8.1 km) and Inside Fishing Harbour Road (1.6 km).

Cuphead released only two weeks back, by an indie developer  but the quality of the game and its difficulty made it instantly rise to success. Heres a description of Cuphead (and also why it is so great).A little like Mario: In that it is a platformer with a character who wears red clothes. Most of the enemies even resemble those in Mario. But unlike Mario, there are no power-ups to incentivise you on the way up.1930s graphics and music: Imagine this cartoon youve watched as a kid  with its background score, and violent graphics. Cuphead is exactly that  theyve excelled in bringing the old-world charm with meticulously hand-drawn backgrounds, characters, movements and reactions! The jazzy music inspired by greats perfectly fuse with the storyline, and theyve got the extra grainy effect to make it a completely immersive retro.No childs play: The graphics and music may appeal to kids, but this the toughest platformer Ive seen around. The main run-and-gun missions are so ludicrously fast-paced, that it would take extreme concentration and strategising to get past it (or local co-op).The side missions are no cakewalk either  they are all boss-fights with some imaginative enemies, making your constant failures a little less disappointing. The game is so demotivating, that when it gave me a D+ on my first mission, I was thrilled.Quirky: The choice lyrics of the in-game music are made to let us know whats happening in the story. The characters around the environment are very weird, a flower throws its petals to wear Cuphead down, there are frogs with boxing gloves, and a bouncy ball who wants to kill you by jumping on your head all the time, amongst others. In that aspect, the game is reminiscent of Earthbound (an old Gameboy game).Its clear from Cupheads success that this is what gamers are looking for now! It is painful to lose all the time with this degree of difficulty, but the experience is worth the agony and the keyboard-breaks.Anusha GanapathiTwitter @quaffle_waffle(This economics graduate spends her leisure time preparing for the zombie apocalypse)"

When it is de rigeur for engineering graduates to take the software route through campus interviews and land assignments abroad, Naveen Hegde, an engineering graduate from Sirsi, did an about-turn. Naveen decided to return to his village in Sirsi and set up a business that would offer direct and indirect employment to villagers, even if it was in a small way. And thats how his start-up iTOrFood was formed.Naveen HegdeIf returning to his village to do business was risky enough, starting a beverages company where he had practically no hands-on experience was even riskier. But Naveen had set out to do this even before he graduated. He did his own ground work on selling beverages, more specifically natural juices. He assessed the pulse of the market and trends.He also did a survey of the products available near Sirsi. And in 2015 at the age of 23, Naveen turned entrepreneur with iTOrFood, iTOr being an abbreviation for Idea to Reality. It pretty much sums up his own journey.Naveen says, I was not interested to leave my parents alone in the village and go to metros in search of a job. I kept thinking of starting an initiative in my village. I explained my idea to them and they were very supportive.With the backing of his parents, he invested nearly `15 lakh along with a partner and began to produce kokum, lemon, amla and tamarind juices without adding flavours, colours and preservatives at his village Hulgol, about 15 km from Sirsi on Yellapur road.Concentrating on the markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mangaluru, Naveen has been producing these juices under the brand name Hooglu. It was just meant to be a catchy word, derived from his village name Hulgol and making it sound similar to Google, that is Hulgol + Google = Hooglu.Life hasnt been without challenges. It was tough to initially carve a niche for his products in metro markets. But he managed to market it as a natural fruit juice and healthy drink by cashing in on the growing health consciousness among people.Hooglu products at a small outletWe got help from the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research in Bengaluru. They gave us a lot of technical support. We also got some discounts on machineries under the scheme of National Horticulture Mission and started our unit in a plot in my village. We constructed a 2000 sq ft building for manufacturing. We collect raw material from Sirsi and surrounding areas only to make the beverages, says Naveen.Today, Naveens company has given direct employment to 10 people while another 15 people are indirectly employed in sales through his start-up. The daily production is 2,000 units of juice packs.Recently the company also ventured into making 12 varieties of banana and potato chips. Naveen is focused on building the brand in the three big cities first. He says after that, he plans to expand his business in smaller cities, including Mysuru, Hubballi, Belagavi and others. He feels there is a huge market for natural organic products that are free from artificial flavours and colours. I want to gradually expand my business and become an example for other youngsters who want to go back to villages and tap their entrepreneurial spirit, says Naveen.It is a great initiative of a young boy from Sirsi region. Such entrepreneurs, who start their set-up in industrially backward regions, should be recognised by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and the ministry should promote their products Ramesh Patil, President of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, HubballiIn agriculture if processing happens at source, farmer can get highest price for his products.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi voided almost all of Indias cash last year, Kuldeep Mishras savings were turned into worthless paper. The vegetable wholesaler was forced to spend hours in bank queues and his business suffered for a month.Still, he voted for Modi in state elections soon after and plans to do so again in a national poll due 2019.Wealthy people had black money and it all came out, Mishra said in a market in Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh, one of Indias poorest states, using the local term for cash stashed away to avoid taxes. We have never had a better prime minister than Modi.Mishra, 49, says sales rebounded in a month, though official data show Indias expansion slowed to a three-year low in April-June, more than six months since the shock cash ban. Growth has also been affected by the disruptive roll out of a new sales tax, yet voters like Mishra are expected to vault Modi to power in his home state of Gujarat next month.Theres no single reason for Modis enduring popularity. While critics point to the Hindu nationalist agenda of his Bharatiya Janata Party as key to its electoral success, others say demonetisation fortified Modis reputation as an authoritative leader and undermined the oppositions attempt to paint him as a suit-boot government that favours the business elite over the poor by moving to make it easier to buy farmers land and hire and fire factory workers.While many accept that the move has dampened consumption, they believe it has dampened conspicuous consumption that was fuelled by black money and tax evasion, said Reshmi Khurana, Singapore-based South Asia head for Kroll Inc., a risk management firm that advises foreign investors. It did boost his image in the sense that hes being seen as decisive and willing to take bold action, even if it ruffles the feathers of entrenched stakeholders.The view is echoed by Vinod Kumar Gupta, a businessman in Uttar Pradeshs Ghaziabad district, who said Modi has the courage to take bold decisions. He has become a stronger leader, hes making India stronger, said Gupta, 73. His commitment to the nation is not doubted.Key testGujarat will be a key test, where voters will be called on to weigh Modis personal popularity against his policies, which have disrupted Indias vast informal economy that mainly deals in cash and creates the largest number of jobs. While India lacks adequate employment data, surveys suggest that Modis far from creating the 10 million jobs a year needed to keep up with his young and rapidly expanding workforce.The election in Gujarat, held on 9 and 18 December will follow the 9 December vote in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which Modi is expected to wrest from the main opposition Congress party. The positive opinion polls are partly flattered by the fact that the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi have failed to offer a compelling alternative.Rahul Gandhi is not very strong, he doesnt speak well and he lacks knowledge, said Shamshad Mohammed, a potato seller who said demonetisation pummeled the economy without stopping corruption.Though viewed as a landmark anti-graft move by the masses, many businesses viewed demonetization as an ineffective way to tackle endemic corruption, said Krolls Khurana. Modis also facing stinging criticism from within his own party, with a former BJP finance minister saying the government has made a mess of the economy.Aware of this change in mood, Modi has been countering with emotional and combative speeches, defending demonetization and himself as a champion of the poor. In a series of speeches last month, he said the Congress party tried to stall Gujarats growth during the years that he headed the state, from 2001 to 2014.He packaged demonetisation as a pro-poor and anti-rich move by projecting that he was going to take away black money from the rich and distribute it to the poor, said Arati Jerath, a New Delhi-based author and political analyst. As economic distress set in, his stature has diminished.She reckons Modi is benefiting from a lack of credible data to assess the full impact of demonetisation on the informal economy and the Gujarat elections will reveal sentiment on the ground.Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that any upside to demonetization will come only in the long-term, through greater digitization of the economy, shrinking of the informal sector, and a wider tax base.Back in Uttar Pradesh, several old men sitting in the shade near tethered water buffaloes said demonetisations harmful impact was over. Discussing the previous evenings news that India had moved up the World Banks ease of doing business ranking, they said they would continue voting for the BJP.Its not that all of Modis policies are good, said Mahendra Singh, 76, a retired factory worker. But well give him another chance in 2019. Bloomberg"

This type of potato is cultivated over 12,500 hectares in these districts, which produce around 1 lakh metric tonnes of tuber each Kharif. Heavy rainfall in September destroyed potatoes that were ready to be harvested but were still underground. It led to rotting of these tubers, rendering them unusable,"" said Sahane.Of the three types of potato varieties that hit the retail markets, one of them will be used by processed food manufacturers due to a dearth in potatoes used for processed foods like chips. ""This may result in rise in potato prices around Diwali in the retail market,"" said Sahane.Ashok Bajare, who heads a farmers' group in Satgaon Pathar, Ambegaon taluka, about 60 km from Pune, one of the regions that grows these potatoes, said, ""Processed food potato plantations dipped by 25% this year as farmers did not sow root vegetables like last few years. Of the 75% plantations carried out this Kharif, close to 30% of the produce, which was ready for harvest, rotted due to heavy rains in September. This means that of the 35,000 metric tonnes of potatoes ready for harvest, over 10,000 metric tonnes perished in heavy rains.""Mangesh Pawale, a potato grower in Satgaon Pathar, said that of the 100 tonne potatoes he was expecting to harvest this Kharif, heavy rains destroyed 50%-60% of the produce, leaving only 40 to 50 tonnes that could be sold.Meanwhile, Shriram Gadhave, president, VGAI, told TOI that spells of heavy rain in September resulted in a dip in yield of other vegetables as well, with farmers suffering 40% to 50% yield losses. ""Though farmers are suffering losses, markets have a regular supply because the area under vegetables has doubled in comparison to last year,"" said Gadhave."
