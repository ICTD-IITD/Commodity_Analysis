The late rains will benefit planting of rabi crops such as wheat and chana, Pattanayak said on Thursday.""We are expecting a very good rabi season, so that should make up for all the minuses which has been ascribed for kharif,"" he said. The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%. Some parts like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam and east Uttar Pradesh have also been impacted due to floods, where once the water receded farmers went for replanting,"" he said."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Inundation of several roads and bridges is threatening to snap the supply of essential commodities, including fruits and vegetables, to Ranchi and jack up prices in the wholesale and retail markets. Sources in the transport circuit said a bridge over Koel river in Basia, Gumla, went underwater on Wednesday, leaving 100trucks bound for the capital stranded at various locations. Similarly, rainwater flowing over a bridge near Bero in Mandar block has halted the supply of essentials coming from Lohardaga and Daltonganj (Palamau). ""The Ranchi-Simdega road, which extends till Odisha, is out of bounds for traffic since the Koel bridge was inundated. We have suspended all buses (around 30) to Simdega and beyond. At least 100trucks bringing supplies from different states are stranded,"" said Kishore Mantri, the general secretary of Ranchi Bus Owners' Association. Mantri added that vehicular movements on Ranchi-Lohardaga and Ranchi-Daltonganj routes were as badly hit. Suresh Kumar, who drives a bus on Ranchi-Daltonganj stretch, said a portion of a small bridge near Pakhria in Chanho on NH-75 was witnessing erosion. ""Portions of the bridge have become very narrow, leading to long snarls. More rain can snap this link too,"" he said. On Ranchi-Hazaribagh-Patna route (NH-33), a landslide threat has emerged near Chuttupalu valley in Ramgarh after heavy rain loosened boulders. The Ranchi-Bokaro road via Sikidiri and Ranchi-Silli road are also out of bounds owing to flooding of a bridge and road cave-in in Silli two days ago. Sunil Chauhan, vice-president of Ranchi Goods Transporters Association, said consignments from Bengal had remained affected for two-three days. ""Potatoes, vegetables and flowers come from Bengal and other states to Ranchi via Baharagora, and this link has taken a beating. Vegetable prices are likely to rise,"" Chauhan said, adding that roughly 100 trucks brought essential items to Ranchi and more than 50 were stranded. A senior official of a retail supermarket chain said for three days now, they were facing crisis of vegetables. ""Our stocks come from Silli and Gola, but many roads and bridges have been washed away along the route, and there is no supply. In Brambe (on Ranchi's outskirts), where we do bulk procurement, local markets are closed owing to incessant rain. We are somehow managing with vegetables bought from Pithoria,"" he said, adding that almost all their outlets in Ranchi and Jamshedpur were facing the crunch. ""For our 50-odd stores in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, we require 10 tonnes of vegetables a day, but are doing with less than half the stocks."" The humble potato will soon be too hot to handle, the supermarket official warned. ""Potatoes mostly come from Bengal. As per norms, they are first dried after being taken out of cold storage before being dispatched. Heavy rain in Bengal has hit stocks,"" he said. In retail markets, the price of tomato has shot up to Rs 120 notwithstanding the state food and civil supplies department's order to FJCCI to cap the rate at Rs 80. Green vegetables like beans and cauliflower are acting pricey too. Beans are selling at Rs 30 per 250gm while a small cauliflower also has a price tag of Rs 30.

As mathadi transporters, who supply vegetables and fruits from across Maharashtra, did not join the strike, prices of kitchen staples remained unchanged,"" said Balasaheb Badade, a vegetable wholesaler.But Sanjay Pansare, a fruit trader, said, ""There were fewer buyers in the wholesale market, fearing stone-pelting and violence.""Traders are, however, apprehensive that there could a slight shortfall in the supply of potato and garlic on Wednesday. ""As these items come from outside Maharashtra, the two-day strike is likely to affect their supply to the wholesale market,"" said Ashok Valunj, former APMC director and potato-onion trader.Bal Malkit Singh of All India Motor Transport Congress said the movement of trucks was affected in districts across Maharashtra. ""Nearly 12 lakh trucks came to a standstill in the state during the two-day agitation, which culminated in a meeting with the transport ministry in New Delhi,"" he added.Over 500 transporters took out a rally in Navi Mumbai from Vashi truck terminal to APMC grain and fruit market, and then from Turbhe MIDC to Kalamboli steel market and finally the JNPT area.

Picture by Pabitra DasOct. 9: Thanks to a difference of interpretation with the police about what the size of a ladies' handbag is, I was sent back from the gate of Salt Lake stadium on Sunday afternoon. According to the officers, ""purse"" means a bag for just the cash. My bag had my raincoat stashed in it. So it did not qualify for passage, so what if there were forecasts of a light shower. My friend had come armed with umbrellas and was promptly issued a retreat order. We did find a man who had started storing helmets, bags and suchlike in a heap for a price on the pavement near Gate 1, but he did not inspire confidence. So we trudged back to the parked car to deposit it all. This meant we were about 10 minutes late for the match. Truth be told, the entry was seamless and the seats (we were behind the goal at the north end) had more legspace than at the refurbished Eden Gardens. But even as England unleashed one attack after another at our end, we were frustrated at not seeing a single conversion. At half-time, my friend's son moped: ""So unfair! Couldn't they score at least one in the first half so we could see it up close?"" A fellow spectator seated in front turned and quipped: "" Ekta goal toh hoyechhey ekdom shurutey (They scored one at the start)."" Really? So Chile was trailing? How would we know? There was nothing where we were sitting to indicate what the status of the match was. When the second goal was scored (at the other end since the teams had swapped sides), we noticed youths rushing to the lowest steps on the aisle and looking up to the upper tier. I followed them and spotted a giant screen upstairs showing the live feed of the match. There was no other semblance of a scoreboard elsewhere. As an Eden regular, I could not help but contrast the experience. Eden has three scoreboards since 2011. One is the giant electronic score board at the High Court end which shows both the score and the live feed. Another is the old manual one over C Block, right of the clubhouse. There is a third scoreboard over J Block, left of the clubhouse, which was turned from manual to an electronic one with a smaller screen last year. So anyone seated at any corner of the stadium or walking in at anytime can easily grasp the match situation. It also helps that the Calcutta police allows binoculars. Even if a second giant screen cannot be installed at Salt Lake stadium, multiple digital score lines on the edge of the upper tier should be. A little more variety of food would also be welcome. All one gets are popcorn, potato chips, fruit cake slices and pizza (the stalls closest to us soon ran out of pizza) which is inadequate especially where there is a double header, like again on October 11 and 14. The gates open at 3pm and the second match ends close to 10pm. So spectators would need more than titbits. Realising this later in the evening, the food stall employees started to mix muri with sauce, sprinkled with peanuts and packed it off for a neat Rs 50 per container. It was so hot that I had to rush to buy a water bottle. Each ticket holder was entitled to a free water pouch which was long exhausted. Finally, a word on the washroom. While it was impressive to find sanitary fittings of a top-notch brand in the ladies' toilet, it would help if someone checks if the latches of all the doors can be fastened!"

All my concentration was only on clicking the photograph.The photograph taken on State Highway 9 in Jhargram district of West Bengal was awarded the Sanctuary Wildlife Photography Award 2017, felicitated by a Mumbai-based wildlife photography magazine Sanctuary Asia on Sunday.Titled 'Hell is Here', Sanctuary Asia, on its Facebook page, described the incident with a caption: ""In West Bengal, this sort of humiliation of pachyderms is routine, as it is in the other elephant-range states of Assam, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and more. India is the world's stronghold for the Asian elephant and boasts over 70 per cent of the global population of the species. But this achievement rings hollow as vital elephant habitats and routes continue to be ravaged, and human-elephant conflict escalates to a fatal degree. ""The award is an attempt to raise awareness about the treatment of pachyderms in the country, Sanctuary Asia editor Anirudh Nair told the New Indian Express. ""By awarding the photograph, we wanted to raise awareness on the practice of violence against elephants in West Bengal and in other parts of the country, he added.Human-elephant conflict is rife along the elephant corridor in Bankura and Jhargram districts of the state. While villagers complain that 40-50 strong herds of elephants destroy their ripe crops and smash their homes, their retaliation has traditionally been violent.Crackers are bursted and fires raged to ward off the herds but due to this practice, the elephants get more enraged and cause even more damage to the public.Hazra said, The calf may not have been intentionally set on fire by the villagers living in the vicinity of the elephant corridor that stretches from southwestern West Bengal up to Saranda forest in Jharkhand, but bursting crackers and throwing fireballs on elephant herds has been a common practice in this part of West Bengal.In a separates comment to the Sanctuary Asia Facebook post, Mainaz Mazumdar, from Baroja village of Bankura district in West Bengal said, Our village is frequently invaded by such wild and unruly animals that come all the way from dalma range of forests. The fault, of course, lies with us. Because of heavy habitat destructions (in this case the forest) the elephants are coming down onto the settlements. This has been a great problem over the years.When the horde of elephants comes near to a village the respective forest office hires people to drive them back to the Jungle. These people are locally known as Hulia Party. They use strong and loud firecrackers, big and bright lights, harpoons, tin drums to make noises to scare them off, torches and bow and arrow. There is no controversy that these poor creatures suffered greatly at our hands. But it is also true that they wrecked havoc on these poor peasants that are entirely dependent on agriculture. They wasted paddy fields, potato fields, fields of wheat and so on. Many farmers committed suicide because of these damages. But worse still, they killed innocent people too.The silver lining amongst all of this gloom is that now the forest department has reclaimed their senses and built deep trenches along the perimeter of the jungle fenced with electrical wire. That electrified fence won't kill them but it's strong enough to repel them. We left much of the worse behind us, Mazumdar added.a"
5a52f7be9855b770e037c29f,Value destruction: UP farmers gift potatoes to coldÂ stores,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/value-destruction-uttar-pradesh-farmers-gift-potatoes-to-cold-stores-4918275/,2017-11-02,"Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran) Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran)Pradeep Chaudhary alias Guddu has seen the potato trade going through periods of mandi (slack). But never has this 47-year-old witnessed bekadri (value destruction)  the term he uses to describe the situation in the last one year, since the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all Rs 500 and 1,000 denomination currency notes.For about a month before notebandi happened on November 8, potato was selling at Rs 500-700 per bag of 50 kg (or Rs 10-14/kg). By the month-end, prices had crashed to Rs 300-350 and further to Rs 175-225 during February-March, when the new crop was being harvested. And strangely, they havent recovered from those levels, even as the season is over and planting of the next crop is almost complete, says Guddu, owner of Om Sheet Grah Pvt Ltd, a cold storage unit at Sadabad town in Uttar Pradeshs Hathras districtFarmers in these parts  the stretch from Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Farrukhabad in southwest UP accounts for roughly a fifth of Indias total potato production  plant the tuber during mid-October and early November. Only 15-20 per cent of this crop is sold at the time of its harvesting towards February-March. Farmers keep the remaining 80-85 per cent in cold stores  where the potatoes are maintained at 4-5 degrees Celsius  and make staggered sales through the summer and monsoon months.This time round, probably 99 per cent of the potatoes were put into cold storage, given the low prices and lack of buyers during harvest time. Farmers thought they would realise better rates later in the season, notes Guddu. But it hasnt worked that way. Currently, the normal large (mota) potatoes are being sold from cold stores at Rs 200-225 per bag (Rs 4-4.5/kg). The medium gulla tubers are fetching just Rs 90-100 a bag (Rs 1.80-2/kg), while being even lower, at Rs 50-60 a bag (Rs 1/kg), for small kirri potatoes.But the farmer isnt the only loser. Guddus cold store can stock up to three lakh bags of potatoes. 90 per cent of this would normally have been disposed of by end-October, with the air-conditioning, too, shut with the winter arriving in the second half of November. This would allow for maintenance over the next two months and enable storing of the new crop from February.The current year, though, has been different. On October 31  when the season technically ends and cold stores cannot run without obtaining renewal licences from the state horticulture department  Guddus unit was saddled with unsold stocks of 80,000-odd bags. Most cold stores have anywhere between 25 to 35 per cent of last seasons potatoes that farmers have kept and are not re-claiming, adds Guddu.Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran) Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran)The reason for farmers not taking back their stored potatoes is simple. Cold stores charge around Rs 110 for every bag, whether it is kept for one month or eight months. Besides, they finance farmers to cover their cost of harvesting, grading and bagging (Rs 45-50), loading (Rs 3) and transport from the field to the store (Rs 20). In many cases, the credit  usually at 1.5 per cent interest per month  extends even to the bardana or jute bags costing Rs 22-23 each.If the borrowed money with interest is also included, we have to pay Rs 200 or more on every bag to the store owner. If the price we are getting does not cover even that, why take back the bag at all? asks Puran Singh. This 60-bigha (12-acre) farmer from Tambka village in Mathura districts Mahavan tehsil still has 700 out of his 2,000 bags harvested during March lying at Susheela Cold Storage in Agra. Even on the remaining 1,300 bags, the money realised from sales, at Rs 125 to Rs 225/bag, has gone entirely to pay the store owner, leaving him with nothing.The cold stores will eventually recover their Rs 110 charge and also much of what they have lent to farmers with interest. For the farmer, a price of Rs 200 per bag (Rs 4/kg) may pay his liabilities to the cold store, but will not even cover cultivation costs, contends Chaudhary Pushpendra Singh, president of Kisan Shakti Sangh, a farmer advocacy organisation.He reckons the total cost of cultivating potatoes at over Rs 10,000 a bigha, which, at an average 40 bags/bigha yield, translates into Rs 5 per kg. If to this, another Rs 4 is added towards harvesting, bagging, transport and cold storage costs, the farmer will just about start making money at a price of Rs 9/kg. The breakeven goes up further by Rs 2/kg if land is leased at the existing rates of Rs 4,000 per bigha. For potato cultivation to be profitable, the farmer has to get about Rs 15/kg. Right now, he cannot afford to even buy new seed potatoes. Most farmers this season have used their last years stored crop as seed, points out Singh.But why are prices continuing to rule low even now, when cash has supposedly returned with the Reserve Bank of India printing new notes? This is a business that always operated on cash. While the notes may be back, you are still not allowed to make daily withdrawals or deposits of more than Rs two lakh. These restrictions, plus the fear of being tracked by the income tax department, have made traders wary of buying and stocking up produce, explains Guddu.The effects of it are being felt in places such as Hathras. This district alone has about 150 operational cold stores, handling an average of two lakh bags each. At last years average realisation of Rs 400 per bag (Rs 8/kg) for all varieties  including gulla and kirri  the value of this entire produce would have been Rs 1,200 crore. But at Rs 150 per bag (Rs 3/kg), the same 3 crore bags from a single district would be worth Rs 450 crore.If this calculation is extended to other potato-belt districts, you can imagine how much value destruction has taken place in the last one year. And the loser is not just the farmer, but also those who sell and provide services to him, observes Pushpendra Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Annual wholesale price inflation was at 2.6 per cent in September. The food inflation quickened to 3.23 per cent in October from 1.99 per cent in September. Among the food items, prices of vegetables prices were up 36.61 per cent year-on-year, potato 44 per cent and onion 127 per cent.Data released on Monday showed retail inflation picking up in October to a seven-month high, driven by faster rises in prices of food and fuel products, dampening chances of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next month. Consumer inflation in October increased to 3.58 per cent from a year earlier.Some analysts expect the GST Council's decision on Friday to slash tax rates on 178 items could marginally lower retail inflation in coming months.The central bank holds a policy review on December 6.Prices pressures are building just as the RBI projected last month inflation to rise in October-March to 4.2-4.6 per cent, above its medium-target of 4 percent, while leaving rates unchanged.Crude prices have rallied, sending Brent crude to its highest since June 2015, a worry for policymakers given that India imports most of its energy needs.(With agency inputs)"

Britain has been increasingly grappling with its pending departure from the EU, and for Nim's, the impact of Brexit is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple. NYTBritain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim's Fruit Crisps, in Sittingbourne, England, the effect is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple.Nim's dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain's decision to leave the European Union - widely known as Brexit - the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company's founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. ""I had to cut costs somewhere,"" she said.She could be speaking for all of Britain.In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies' paring their investments in Britain.Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had expanded a tad more than expected between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market's assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus.But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain's fragile state. Many focused on plunging retail and car sales as a harbinger of trouble.The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped during the past year while consumer credit is rising - a combination that often ends badly.The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.""Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,"" said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. ""There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.""Britain now stands as one of the world's weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. During the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent.Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within EU territory.Citigroup has outlined plans to set up a trading operation in Frankfurt, while applying for a backup license in France. Goldman Sachs recently leased expanded office space in Frankfurt.In the West Midlands, an industrial reach of England that includes Birmingham, foreign direct investment dipped slightly in the year after the Brexit vote, according to a recent assessment from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce.The chamber pinned the blame on ""uncertainty caused by the outcome of the EU referendum,"" which was ""delaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K.""Chamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the EU in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth.""It's a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe,"" said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. ""We really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world.""Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain's governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.""We can't see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,"" said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. ""How can you go ahead with big investments when you don't know what framework will result?""For Nim's Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim's buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.The fall in the pound has also made Nim's products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim's snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and - soon - Saudi Arabia.""What I've learned is that Europe isn't the only market for us,"" said Raja, whose Nim's business card identifies her as TheBoss.Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.""I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,"" she said.She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit.""I have to keep my margins tight,"" she said."

In order to divert attention of the people, the BJP leaders pick up brooms or wear masks,"" he told reporters here.""The BJP blames others (for lack of development in the state), but now it is ruling Uttar Pradesh... most of the big cities had BJP mayors, but even the garbage has not been removed in the past 10 to 15 years,"" the SP leader said.""Except for picking up brooms (as part of the Swachcha Bharat Mission)... I don't think the BJP has any direction,"" he said.Stressing that his government had completed the Agra- Lucknow Expressway in 23 months, Mr Yadav said that it was now the responsibility of the present dispensation to construct the Purvanchal Expressway.""This is the responsibility of the government... they will get funds from the Centre... Niti Aayog is also cooperating with them. They (BJP) were saying that they will connect Varanasi and Ayodhya, but they should at least start the work,"" he said.Mr Yadav said that if expressways and 'mandis' (wholesale markets) are made, the state will develop and farmers will get good rates for their produce.""If dairies such as Parag and Amul come up, it will improve the rural economy, if laptops are distributed it will take the country ahead on the path of 'Digital India',"" he said.To a question on the possibility of entering into an electoral alliance with the BSP, the SP president said, ""We are trying to work a way out an alliance... our relations are not bad with anyone... we are in the forefront to improve relations."" His remarks came after BSP chief Mayawati yesterday said that her party favoured joining hands with secular fronts in the Lok Sabha and state polls, only if it gets a respectable number of seats to contest.On the law and order situation, the former chief minister said that the people of the state know that the BJP government has ""failed"" on this front."

(Reuters)Vast swathes of both sides of Punjab have been blanketed by smog in the past few weeks, with the pollution affecting normal life and transportation. Schools on the Indian side were closed for three days earlier this month while the timing of educational institutions on the Pakistani side was changed because of the smog.The smog has been blamed on a variety of factors, ranging from the widespread burning of crop stubble, dust from construction sites, emissions from industries and coal-fired power plants.The phenomenon has now assumed regional proportions and it engulfs the areas from New Delhi to Lahore and beyond. You will agree with me that the problem is essentially scientific and economic and cannot be tackled through other means, wrote Sharif, who is being projected as a potential prime ministerial candidate by his PML-N party for Pakistans general election next year.I firmly believe that it is in the interest of the people of both Punjabs to make a collective effort towards identifying technologies and business methods that may eliminate the need to burn rice-stubble and help control smog formation, he added.Sharif, 66, said the smog was affecting public health, especially the elderly and children, and agriculture, as it has delayed the sowing of wheat and damaged potato and other crops.The governments of both sides of Punjab had very close links though these were hit by the tensions that followed the 2008 Mumbai attacks. In the past, the two sides organised joint sports events and a large number of people from the Indian state visit Sikh shrines in Pakistan every year.This is not the first time Pakistans Punjab, the countrys most prosperous and populous province, has suggested that the two sides of Punjab should work together to tackle pollution.We have imposed a ban on stubble burning in Punjab (Pakistan) & hope @capt_amarinder takes similar measures.

He has now become the poster-boy of defaults.The liquor baron was not wise about his activities during the days of default, Gopinath said, referring to him as a political football, who borrowed money when the Congress-led UPA government was in power.Without naming political parties, he pointed out that one party was disgruntled that Mallya was allowed to leave the country, while the other blamed the former for not taking adequate action against him for defaulting.He also acknowledged that Mallya is a poster boy for loan defaults, and hence, both parties politically find him too close for comfort.Politicians from both parties have been seen socialising with Mallya, and have been witness to his overindulgent habits including Formula One races, and IPL matches, yet they accuse each other, Gopinath pointed out.Reiterating that Mallya is not a victim of any political conspiracy, Gopinath once again said he has become a hot potato for all, which has led him to be politically abandoned.Gopinath was critical of the fact that Mallya fled the country and hinted that he should have paid back his dues using the wealth from his other companies.I think he should have acted sooner by mobilising funds from his other liquor companies and rescued Kingfisher Airlines. But it was too late, he said, adding that if competitor Spicejet could be saved, Kingfisher could have also been saved.While speaking about the factors leading to KFAs indebtedness, Gopinath conceded that the money required for the acquisition of Air Deccan could have been one of the factors, but underscored that Mallya was forced to buy the low-cost airline to make it eligible to fly overseas.A domestic airline would not be allowed to fly overseas unless it has completed five years of local operations, which discriminated (against) Mallya. It was to favour Jet. Since he was competing against Jet Airways at that time, and wanted to fly international, he bought Air Deccan to overcome the five year rule, Gopinath said.He (Mallya) asked the government to relax FDI in aviation, which at that time barred foreign airlines investing in Indian carriers. Jet opposed it and the government did not allow. But when his airline (KFA) was grounded, hastily this policy was changed and the government permitted Indian carriers to get up to 49 per cent equity from overseas airlines, Gopinath said.Gopinath also said that the luxury airline business model introduced by Mallya was not fit for the Indian market. In his latest innings in the aviation sector, Gopinaths Air Deccan started flights under the UDAAN scheme which aims to improve connectivity between smaller towns and larger cities."

The committee, sources said, has been given four weeks to examine demands made by various religious groups in this regard and submit a report.This comes days after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asked the minorities commission to look into demands from various political and religious leaders who have sought minority religion status in the Lingayat and Veerashaiva faiths. This is also an indication that the government is in a hurry to draw curtains on this issue, which is considered a political hot potato with polls round the corner.According to sources, the committee comprises Kannada Development Authority chairman S G Siddaramaiah; Jawaharlal Nehru University Kannada Language chair Purushothama Bilimale; University of Mysore political science professor Muzaffar Assadi; former backward classes commission chairman C S Dwarakanath; journalist Sarjoo Katkar and litterateur Ramakrishna Marathe.The Veerashaiva and Lingayat camps, comprising leaders from the Congress, have been at loggerheads over the issue. The Veerashaiva group comprises veteran Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa, his son and Horticulture Minister S S Mallikarjun and Municipalities Minister Eshwar B Khandre. They hold that Veerashaiva and Lingayat are the same and that the separate religion should be christened Veerashaiva-Lingayat. Veerashaivas say their religion predates 12th-century reformer Basavanna, revered as the founder of the Lingayat faith. Veerashaivas revere a pantheon of holy men.The Lingayat camp, led by Water Resources Minister M B Patil, Mines and Geology Minister Vinay Kulkarni and Higher Education Minister Basavaraj Rayareddy, argues that Veerashaiva and Lingayat are radically different, and the religion must be called Lingayat. This group says it goes by the ideals of Basavanna.BJP state chief B S Yeddyurappa said his party will side with the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, whereas JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda has accused the ruling Congress of creating a divide among Veerashaivas and Lingayats.Watch DH video series on Lingayat religion row."
