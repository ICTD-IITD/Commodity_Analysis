Its foremost task is how to spread hatred, create problems and humiliate others. In order to divert attention of the people, the BJP leaders pick up brooms or wear masks, he told reporters here.The BJP blames others (for lack of development in the State), but now it is ruling Uttar Pradesh. Most of the big cities has BJP mayors, but even the garbage has not been removed in the past 10 to 15 years, the SP leader said.Except for picking up brooms (as part of the Swachch Bharat Mission) I dont think the BJP has any direction, he said.Stressing that his government had completed the Agra- Lucknow Expressway in 23 months, Mr. Yadav said that it was now the responsibility of the present dispensation to construct the Purvanchal Expressway.This is the responsibility of the government. They will get funds from the Centre. Niti Aayog is also cooperating with them. They (BJP) were saying that they will connect Varanasi and Ayodhya, but they should at least start the work, he said.Mr. Yadav said that if expressways and mandis (wholesale markets) are made, the State will develop and farmers will get good rates for their produce.If dairies such as Parag and Amul come up, it will improve the rural economy. If laptops are distributed it will take the country ahead on the path of Digital India, he said.Improving relationsTo a question on the possibility of entering into an electoral alliance with the BSP, the SP president said, We are trying to workout an alliance... our relations are not bad with anyone... we are in the forefront to improve relations.His remarks came after BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday said her party favoured joining hands with secular fronts in the Lok Sabha and State polls, only if it gets a respectable number of seats to contest.On the law and order situation, the former Chief Minister said that the people of the State know that the BJP government has failed on this front."

On Thursday, a kg was selling at Rs. 64 in HOPCOMS against the average of Rs. 45 last month. The rates were in the range of Rs. 53 to Rs. 55 in the beginning of November.HOPCOMS managing director M. Vishwanath said the price rise was owing to a fall in supply.The production season for onions is over in the State and we have been procuring the vegetable from Nasik. But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise. The situation should return to normal in a week to 10 days, he said.In retail chains, onion was selling at Rs. 50 on Thursday. But, the price is likely to increase on Friday and will be on a par with the HOPCOM rates, said a senior official from a retail chain.In the Bengaluru APMC market, supply of onion has trickled down to less than 30% of normal during this time of the year, said Ravishankar B. of Bengaluru Onion and Potato Merchants Association.As against an average of 2.5 lakh sacks during November, we got less than 50,000 sacks this month, he said.The fall in supply is also attributed to massive crop loss during the recent spells of heavy rain in September-October.This year sowing was delayed by over month. Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed onion in the second half of August.But the first sowing was ruined, as heavy rain led to water stagnation in the farms.There was massive crop loss in the second sowing as well owing to rain, bringing down the yield to less than half, he said.Onion harvest season in Karnataka starts from September and the crop floods the local markets till December. However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

5aeae7d19855b7179ad6fa00,In cotton belt  a touch of discontent,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-cotton-belt-rising-wisps-of-discontent/article21153648.ece,2017-11-30,"Gangaram Patel, a 50-year-old farmer at Kalyanpar village in Morbi district, grows cotton and groundnut on four hectares of his land. For the past 22 years, he has been a BJP voter.However, this time, Mr. Patel says, he will change his voting preference because the party has done little for farmers.In this area, we have always voted for the BJP but not now. We farmers have been ruined by this government. They are only concerned about some industrialists, an angry Mr. Patel says, standing on his farm on the Morbi-Rajkot highway.The main issue is the poor prices of cotton and groundnut for the past three years.For the past several years, we are not getting remunerative prices; so farming has become a burden. Today, cotton fetches Rs. 800 to Rs. 900 per 20 kg, while our production cost is almost Rs. 1,000, if we include labour and input costs, he says.Farm distress is emerging as one of the important factors in the Assembly elections in Gujarat. The State is the largest producer of cotton and groundnut, which take up the largest cultivation area. In the current year, cotton has been cultivated on 26.41 lakh hectares and the expected production is 1.25 crore bales. Groundnut has been grown on 16 lakh hectares and 26 lakh tonnes is expected.Paresh Ujaria, a farmer with about 1.5 hectare of land and local Youth Congress activist, says farmers in the cotton belt are in distress. The prices of seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, power and labour have gone up. Today, one labourer charges Rs. 300 a day, while prices of our produce have stagnated for the past several years, making farming a loss-making proposition, he says.Babubhai Vasoya, a 52-year-old farmer at Thebachda village near Rajkot, echoes the same sentiments. I want to ask Modi [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] where is the Rs. 1,500 [per 20 kg] for cotton that he promised in 2014? In 2017, we are not getting what we used to get in 2011-12, when cotton price was Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,300 per 20 kg, Mr. Vasoya says.Gauravsinh Jadeja of the village says farm distress is sweeping across the region. Similar is the situation in every district of Saurashtra. You go to Jamnagar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad and you will see poor farmers crying for better prices for their produce, he says.In North Gujarat, farmers face a similar predicament as they are not realising remunerative prices for potato, a major crop in Banaskantha, Patan and Gandhinagar.Farmers are forced to sell potato at Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 a kg against their production cost of Rs. 5 and cold storage costs. They need at least Rs. 10 a kg to make a little profit, says Ramanbhai Patel, a farmer and cold storage owner from Deesa in Banaskantha."

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

Moreover, the party has also announced supply of 16 hours of power to farmers instead of the eight hours they get at present.The manifesto has been prepared after receiving inputs from all sections of society. We have prepared a comprehensive sector wise report on each and every commitment and promise the party is making to the people of Gujarat, said Gujarat Congress president Bharat Solanki.Another notable feature of the manifesto is special category quota to Patidars if the party comes to power. We will introduce a bill in the assembly to provide special category quotas to the Patidars, without compromising on the 49% quotas given to SCs, STs and OBCs, Mr Solanki said.

The introduction of potatoes and the resultant increase in productivity dramatically reduced conflict both within and between states for some two centuries, it says. The researchers, who examined 2,477 battles fought in 899 wars over a 500-year period, drew two key conclusions. The first is linked to the declining value of land on which potatoes are grown.Land value fellAccording to the study, the value of the land on which potatoes were grown fell with advances in productivity. Populations were able to feed themselves on ever smaller amounts of land.Conflicts declined when the value of the object for which one was fighting decreased, the study says.Increases in farmers incomes, often due to much bigger and more reliable harvests, boosted tax revenues for the state, providing added governmental stability and thereby helping to buy the peace, the report states.To risk losing these resources  for workers and for political leaders  represented a financial danger that states were less and less willing to risk, resulting in a decline in peasant revolts and civil wars, the study said.It had become too expensive to engage in combat.The analysis does not detail the impact of specific wars or conflicts but says that most of those studied took place on the borders of modern-day Austria, France, Russia and Turkey. Others were in the Near East and North Africa."
5aeb22da9855b7179ad71987,"From Plate to Plough: Agri-futures, likeÂ China",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-agri-futures-like-china-4968066/,2017-12-05,"(Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh) (Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh)In November, prices of most major kharif crops crashed below their respective minimum support prices (MSPs), triggering farm distress. One of the many reasons behind this situation is that planting decisions of our farmers are based on last years prices, rather than the prices expected at the time of harvest. Signals indicating future prices are largely absent as agri-futures have been decimated by excessive controls and regulation. It is time to think afresh and resurrect agri-futures in India.In 2003, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments decisions to allow futures markets in India  after a long gap  was hailed as a big and bold step towards better price discovery for farmers. This, in turn, was supposed to help farmers take informed planting decisions. In the initial years  2003-2007  agri-futures did show promising growth. But around 2007-2008, they were hit by the global food price crisis. Agri-futures picked up momentum again and peaked in 2011-2012. However, since then, there has been heavy government intervention in agri-futures with higher margin requirements as well as absolute suspensions, resulting in their near collapse.Chinese agri-futures have had a contrasting trajectory. The agri-futures market was introduced in the early 1990s in China. It struggled for a decade, but thereafter Chinese agri-futures had such a robust growth that by 2016, it was at the top of global chart, crossing the 1,000 million mark, dwarfing Indias 20 million contracts in the process.What lessons can India learn from China in order to promote its agri-futures and help its farmers in better price discovery? Very briefly, China experimented with several things, including inviting experts from the Chicago Board of Trade in the US, rationalising commodities and exchanges by closing down trade in many items and focusing on a few farm products, especially the less sensitive ones. However, to understand Indias story better, we need to look at the perceptions and actions of three key stakeholders: Policy-makers, regulators (FMC/SEBI), and commodity exchanges. A pre-requisite for the development of a agri-futures market is to have a stable policy environment.The government, including the regulator, should provide a favourable environment for the futures trade to flourish. Commodity exchanges have to invest in designing appropriate contracts for business development. Abrupt interventions, with frequent changes in stocking restrictions on private trade, have reduced the prospects of agri-futures in India. We collated information about various interventions related to margins and suspensions since 2003 and found that suspensions of agri-futures, as well as high margins, have been targeted more towards commodities that are perceived as sensitive in the common mans food basket (See graph). For example, tur, urad, rice have been suspended for more than a decade now. High margins for sensitive commodities, for example, 100 per cent for potato (August 2014), 95 per cent for chana (June 2016) and 70 per cent for sugar (September 2016) reflect the governments intention of blocking their futures trade.So, if one has to develop agri-futures in India, the first lesson is to stay away from sensitive commodities (for example, common rice, wheat, most pulses, and even sugar), at least for some time, till futures gain momentum and some depth. It would be prudent to focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex (oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maize), cotton, basmati rice and spices. Once markets are developed and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort, the country can diversify to other commodities in the agri-futures portfolio. This is what China also seems to have done. The largest volumes in agri-futures have come from oilseeds. This points to the significance of the regulators role: Giving a clear direction in terms of the choice of commodities, and then staying the course by adopting a stable policy with minimal interventions.Second, for the government to be assured that speculators are not rigging markets, the regulator should allow only delivery-based contracts, at least till markets deepen. This is another lesson from the Chinese experience: All agri-commodities traded at the Dalian Commodity Exchange are physical-delivery based.Third, like its Chinese counterpart, the government of India should encourage state trading enterprises (STEs) to trade on the agri-futures platform. This will boost the governments confidence in agri-futures as it will have ample information from its STEs. In China, STEs, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) for example, have a major presence in the agri-futures markets. COFCO is directly administered by Chinas State Council and is the largest food processor, manufacturer and largest exporter and importer in the country. It trades in agri-commodities like soybean oil and meal, palm oil, cotton and sugar in the futures market. Indias STEs like the MMTC, STC, PEC or even the FCI can participate on the agri-futures platform in a similar manner, helping it to deepen.Lastly, it has to be recognised that developing agri-futures is as much the responsibility of the regulator as that of commodity exchanges, and both need to work in harmony for the benefit of various stakeholders, especially farmers who need useful information about future prices for their products while they are planting those crops. Can the Narendra Modi government take bold decisions to revive the legacy of the Vajpayee government and scale new heights in agri-futures, say 200 million contracts by 2022? Remember, China crossed the billion mark in 2015.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Movie buffs will remember the iconic 1967 Hollywood movie, The Graduate, in which Ben, played by a very young Dustin Hoffman, is given career advice by a friend of his parents at his graduation party. Plastics, he is told, there is a great future in plastics. Fifty years later, the spread of plastics bears out the accuracy of that prediction. But our message today would be, plastics are all pervasive and very convenient but we need to worry about food safety, design for recycling, and safe management of non-recyclable plastic waste to ensure environmental protection.Plastic is a synthetic polymer, deriving its name from the Greek word plastikos, which means fit for moulding. It was invented in 1869 by John W. Hyatt, responding to a New York firms offer of $10,000 for anyone who could provide a substitute for ivory. The subsequent 150 years have seen chemical companies develop many new polymers and many different types and grades of plastic.This inexpensive, light, and versatile product enters our everyday lives in numerous forms ranging from bread wrapping, magazine and invitation covers, and packages of many ordinary consumption items at one end and also as part of television sets, refrigerators, cars and aircraft at the other. The problem is that plastic does not decay. It sticks around in the environment as deadweight. Recycling of plastic is, therefore, extremely important, and waste management systems and product design explicitly need to facilitate plastic recycling. Worldwide, only 14 per cent of plastic is collected for recycling, while the rest stays in the environment causing pollution both on land and in the ocean.As regards food safety, consumers need to understand which plastics meet the criteria. Among the many choices available, while PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) are generally considered safe in not leaching any chemicals, there are concerns with regard to PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) which need to be addressed. The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 Sec 4(b) explicitly state that only virgin plastic is to be used for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging food stuff which is ready to eat or drink. However, enforcement remains a challenge.Recycling of plastics is not always economically and/or technically feasible. Composites like roofing sheets, bonded rubberised coir mattresses, etc are really difficult to recycle when the components are hard to separate. The solution lies in instituting extended producer responsibility laws under which their take-back and disposal by manufacturers should be mandatory.Plastic sachets used for packaging of snack-foods like potato chips can also not be recycled. These sachets are composed of three to seven thin layers of different plastics glued together to keep air and water vapour out and retain odours and freshness. These could be recycled if all the layers were thermoplastic (like polythene and polypropylene) which soften into lumps and granules upon heating. They become non-recyclable because of an inner layer of thermoset plastic (nylon or polyester) which does not soften on heating but chars instead, blocking the filter screens and requiring the shutdown of heating equipment every few minutes. Even plastic-coated paper cups and/or stationery pose problems for recycling.Appeals to snack-food packagers to use recyclable multi-films are often countered by the argument that the new (non-recyclable) material extends the shelf-life for snack-foods from six months to one year. But should we want one-year-old biscuits or chips at the cost of a city littered with uncollected food sachets? Moreover, the cost of collecting and transporting this light fluffy waste to an energy-recovery plant exceeds any possible gain from energy recovery.Section 9(3) of the Plastics Waste Management Rules 2016 requires the phase out of non- recyclable multi-layered plastic by March 2018, while Section 17 requires manufacturers, producers and users of non-recyclable packaging to either pay municipalities for the cost of managing such waste, or arrange to take it back and manage its disposal themselves.India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. Shopkeepers would give a discount on new purchases if old bottles were returned. In the US, there is a printed refund value (different for every state) of 5 to 10 cents for return of aluminium cans, glass bottles, PET bottles and containers of soft drinks. Unfortunately, hardly any Indian city has actually taken advantage of our highly beneficial Rule 17. Municipal corporations can ask all major snack-food brands to provide the city with equipment for shredding snack sachets into 2-4 mm tea-powder-like flakes and for transport of the shredded flakes to hot-mix plants. In our October column, we had highlighted how plastic waste can be used for strengthening roads by adding such flakes to hot stones to form a baked-on polymer primer coat. The excellent bonding with added bitumen gives 2-3 times longer life to tar roads.PET bottles have enjoyed high recycling value for making into flakes and then fibre, after removing bottle caps, rings and labels, and sorting by colour. Here too purity of the collection stream is the key. At one time, almost all PET bottle-waste from around the world ended up in China. Some years ago, US anti-dumping duty on Chinese T-shirts and knitwear made from recycled PET-based fibre caused a crash in the price of PET bottles for waste-pickers in India. It remains to be seen what will happen with the recent cutback on PET bottle imports by China.PVC was one of the earliest plastics to be invented, but is now banned in many cities, states and even countries. It is used in water pipes, wiring cables and also beverage bottle labels, flexes, etc. It contains 57 per cent chlorine by weight, which like other chlorine-like (halogenated) plastics, releases deadly dioxins and furans when burnt. The National Green Tribunal has now asked the Ministry of Environment to consider and pass rules phasing out short-life PVC.Major short-life PVC items like PVC hoardings and banners, flex and posters are almost invariably burnt in the open in Indian cities and contribute heavily to air toxicity. These items are largely imported from China which has banned their use in China but allows the same to be produced and exported to countries with lax environmental rules.Another troublesome waste is expanded polystyrene, known more generally as thermocol which is a brand name. This is widely used by packaging industry for packing large items like TVs and tiny ones like cell-phones. Though theoretically recyclable as polystyrene, here too its light weight makes collection and transport for recycling and even take-back uneconomical. The West and Far East have solved this problem by switching to wonderfully creative and recyclable alternatives: Moulded papier-mch, folded cardboard, expanded paper, bubble-wrap, air bags, compostable peanuts for loose-fill packaging and much more.The plastic menace for Indian cities is compounded because of their generally poor state of solid waste management and the poor infrastructure for sewerage and stormwater drainage. Developing eco-friendly consumption habits such as avoiding disposable catering items and using washable cups and plates instead, will make a difference, but plastics will continue to play an important role in our lives. A sustainable way forward is to minimise consumption of disposable/single use plastic items, create awareness about the use of appropriate grade of plastic for different purposes, and emphasise the importance of recycling and reusing plastic.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/File) Airstrikes target Islamic State positions on the edge of the Old City. (AP Photo/File)The morgue in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul was where atrocity met bureaucracy. Here was the processing point for the victims of the machine of butchery that the Islamic State group created during nearly three years of rule in large parts of Iraq and Syria. Every day, the doctors and staff witnessed the worst of what the militants were capable of inflicting on human beings, constantly fearing they could be next.Yet the morgue men of Mosul found ways large and small to defy their captors by honoring the dead as best they could. Some days, up to 100 bodies would stream into the facility. They included the mangled casualties of bombardment or fighting between the militants and the U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi forces. Others had suffered the grotesque punishments that IS dealt out to those it considered criminals.The records kept by the morgue contain monstrous details.One Excel sheet documents more than 1,200 people who were shot in the head, a likely sign of IS executions, between June 2014 and January 2017, a period covering most of IS rule. Thats an average of 11 a week. Among them were 16 boys and six girls under the age of 14. It notes 12 women stoned to death, the IS punishment for those suspected of illicit sex. It also lists 95 people who were beheaded and 50 men and boys who died from a fall from a height, likely hurled from rooftops, the sentence for those suspected of being gay.In general, it was forbidden to return these victims bodies to their families. Instead, they disappeared into mass graves. The records are not complete, and thousands are known to have been thrown directly into mass graves without ever coming to the morgue.Here is a look at some of the men of Mosuls morgue and how they tried to keep hold of their humanity amid relentless brutality.RESCUED FROM MASS GRAVESRaid Jassim, the chief medical assistant at the morgue, arranged the meeting in a parking garage at night. You brought her? the businessman asked. Yes, Jassim replied. The man broke into tears and hugged him in gratitude. Jassim then opened his cars trunk so they could pull out the body of the mans wife.Jassim and other staffers tried to do this whenever they could, sneaking bodies out of the morgue to return them to their families and keep them out of mass graves. They had to do it secretly, cutting off electricity to turn off the morgue security cameras. In this case, the woman had been killed on accusations of spying.The 48-year-old Jassim recounted how IS fighters slaughtered two captives right in front of the morgue staff, decapitating one and shooting the others. Jassim himself was given 30 lashes for smoking, a crime under IS, and he was severely beaten after he refused to forge a death certificate for a fighter.In 2005, Jassim had been overjoyed to get a government posting at the morgue. The pay was several times more than what hed earn in a government hospital. He was a graduate of a medical institute, a two-year diploma after high school, and had gone on to serve as an army nurse.But now he has been left scarred, unable to sleep without taking several valium every night. Pressure, pressure, pressure, he said. I always expected them to come at any moment and kill or behead us.LESS THAN FOUR MINUTESA 35-year-old medical assistant, Sameh al-Azzawi tried to help families by sewing the heads back on the bodies of those IS decapitated. This was strictly forbidden by the militants, so al-Azzawi did it in secret at night, working quickly. He got to the point he could stitch a head back on in four minutes.But he stopped when one day an IS fighter discovered a body with the head sewn back on and threatened to decapitate whoever did it. Al-Azzawi, a father of three, graduated from a medical institute in Mosul in 2008 and worked in a hospital for several years before being assigned to the morgue in 2012.The time under the Islamic State group has left him a broken man.He found one of his cousins among the bodies arriving at the morgue _ IS had shot him in the head for allegedly feeding information to the Iraqi government. Al-Azzawi later tried to escape with smugglers, hiding in a truck under boxes of potato chips, but he was caught and had to sign a statement acknowledging that he would be punished by death if he tried to flee again.After that, the terror wrecked him: Anything they ask for I do without complaint.BURYING THE TRAUMAThe senior examiner at the morgue, Modhar al-Omari could only watch helplessly as the victims of the Islamic State group flowed in and the militants imposed their terror even on the morgues staff. Our profession as doctors is all about humanity _ respecting life, he said. They were doing the exact opposite.The 43-year-old veteran doctor and surgeon was well known among his staff for his calm. He was used to wearing suits, but under IS he was forced to wear the Islamic garb of shortened pants and a long beard that the group said was the style of the Prophet Muhammad.His job was to sign off on the cause of death for victims brutalized corpses. As a forensics doctor, he also had to investigate the crimes of the living _ like signing medical examinations of whether women accused of adultery were virgins or not.He got some revenge by passing on information. He secretly told the government in Baghdad when several senior commanders were killed in airstrikes.But he says he has never cried for the dead.You cant talk or explain. You just keep it inside, he says. If I cried, Id cry every day for every single body.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Vishal Srivastav Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary at a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal SrivastavLeader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of provoking and instigating opposition parties and asked him to be mridubhashi (soft-spoken). Chaudhary targeted Adityanath over his statement in the Assembly on Tuesday, when he had indirectly mentioned Congress president Rahul Gandhi speaking about aloo ki factory. Adityanath had said that there is a leader, who does not even know that potatoes are grown on fields, not in factories.While Adityanath had also said that many in the Opposition do not even know the difference between aloo and lauki or mango and sugarcane, Chauduary said, Aap to vipaksha ko khud uksate hain bharkate hain mridubhashi ho jaiye (You provoke and instigate the Oppositionbe a sweet-talker).Chaudhary said that he had raised the issue (of potato farmers) even during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. Lag sakhta hai aloo ka karkhana, said Chaudhary, while pointing out that potato farmers are facing acute crises due to extremely low rates of their crop in the market. He said that the anger of farmers is increasing. Replying to Chaudhary, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government had taken steps to help potato farmers soon after it had come to power. He added that apart from allowing and promoting export of the crop, farmers were also given exemption from mandi fee and the government had even purchased the crop. He said that the state government has decided to include potato in the midday meal menu of state schools.Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu, meanwhile, raised objection to the comment made on the statement of Rahul Gandhi but Treasury benches as well as the Speaker pointed out that no specific name was taken at the Assembly. As the Opposition went on to raise the issue of potato farmers, Adityanath said that his government has worked to give protection to all farmers without any bias. He said that while his government has announced support price for potato farmers for the first time, a three-member committee was also formed to solve their issues, apart from giving them other benefits. The chief minister said that for the first time, potato farmers were given permission to export their produce and orders have been issued to include potato in midday meals as well.Adityanath said that his government kisano ke hiton ko puri tarha se sanrakshan karegi (The government will protect the interest of the farmers in every possible way).At this point, Samajwadi Party MLAs staged a walkout, calling the government kisan virodhi (anti-farmers).Later in the day, Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded discussion on the deaths of children across the state especially in Gorakhpur and staged a walk out over the issue. He said outside the Assembly that he demanded a discussion on the issue of childrens death in Gorakhpur and other districts, but was denied it. The Congress leader said that he would again raise the issue on Thursday.Chaudhary as well senior BSP leader Sukhdev Rajbhar also raised the issue of incorrect information being given by officers in reply to questions asked in the Assembly and requested action in the matter. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna promised to order an inquiry into the matter and take appropriate action against the guilty officers.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 was placed in the Assembly on Wednesday. In the written statement of objects and reasons for presenting the bill, Law Minister Brajesh Pathak maintained that, On the recommendation of the central law commission and Ramunujam Committee constituted by the central government, it has been decided to repeal those Acts, which were notified by the central government during Presidents rule in the state and during the British Rule before Independence and have become obsolete and useless. The Acts, which have been repealed include The Police (Agra) Act 1857, The Mirzapur Stone Mahal Act, 1886 and The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation (Vote on account) Acts of 1980, 1993, 1996, 1996, 1997 and 2002 along with The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation Acts of the respective years.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

KCNA/via REUTERS North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un is seen during the inspection of a potato flour factory in this undated photo released by North Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang December 6, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERSNorth Korea says a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has become a matter of when, not if, as it continued to lash out at a massive joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea involving hundreds of advanced warplanes. In comments attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea also claimed high-ranked US officials, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have further confirmed American intent for war with a series of bellicose remarks.Pompeo said Saturday that US intelligence agencies believe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesnt have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally.The Norths spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the US in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the US high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula an established fact. The remaining question now is: when will the war break out, the spokesman said.We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the US miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the US dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened.The comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes.South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Koreas eastern coast during a drill with US and South Korean fighter jets.Through the drill, the South Korean and US air forces displayed the allies strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles, the South Korean military said in a statement.B-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the US mainland.The five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters.North Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as nuclear strategic although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb4a8f9855b7179ad72e62,Farmer commits suicide in Hooghly after â€˜failing to repay Rs 5Â lakhâ€™,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/farmer-commits-suicide-in-hooghly-after-failing-to-repay-rs-5-lakh-4975933/,2017-12-10,"IN a first such case this year, a 59-year-old potato farmer has committed suicide at Arambagh in Hooghly after he allegedly failed to repay a debt of Rs 5 lakh. The suicide comes at a time when West Bengal has witnessed a bumper potato harvest for the second year running.The deceased, Golak Bijari Ullal, had taken loans from the Cooperative Bank and moneylenders to grow potatoes on his 20 bigha plot.A resident of Muzaffarpur village in Harimkhola, Golaks son Tarakhnath Ullal said: We have a debt of Rs 5 lakh We had grown potato because the crop had been doing so well. While some of the crop was destroyed because of the untimely rain there were months when there was no rain. But the potato crop itself has done well in the state and thus, the prices plummeted. We couldnt even recover our investment.On Friday morning, finding his fathers room locked, the family called the police. My father did not open the door. The police broke the door and found him hanging, said Tarakhnath.BJPs OBC Morcha state president Sapan Das, who hails from Hooghly, has paid a visit to the family. Blaming the Trinamool Congress government for the death, he said: Farmers are in trouble if crops dont do well they are in trouble even when crops do well. The bumper crop has made the price of potatoes drop. While the market price of potato is substantial even now, farmers dont get this priceThe state government buys the crop from farmers at Rs 6 per kg While the current market price is Rs 8 per kg, the farmers are investing the same amount in the crop So, they are not making any money Middlemen from the ruling party buy the crop at a lower price from farmers and sell it at a higher price. Farmers are thus pushed to commit suicide, he alleged.Pal maintained a healthy price for the farmers is Rs 14 to Rs 15 per kg. The government buys 40 kg of potato for Rs 120 It should instead buy 10 kg at this price, he said. In case of wheat surplus, the crop can be processed and stored. This is not the case with potatoes, as it is perishable. There arent enough storages, which the government is supposed to build. And even when storages are built, these are taken over by TMC workers and middlemen, alleged Pal.Bengal is one of the largest producers of potato in the country with main cultivating areas in Burdwan, Hooghly and Aram-bagh. During 2016 state polls, the Left had raised the issue of farmer suicide. According to CPM, 200 farmers have committed suicide in the last three years in Bengal, with 116 such cases in Burdwan.Kisan Sabha state secretary Amar Haldar said the main cause of farmer suicides is debt. The government has not made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give a subsidy to farmers for crop cutting. This has been removed by the Mamata government. Moreover, the production cost of crops has increased  prices of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, electricity have increased. The fertiliser subsidy has also been removed.For the first time in 50 years, potato farmers dont have water to irrigate their crops. The crops fail, farmers go to moneylenders and are then unable to pay off their loans, he said.In 2015, 12 potato farmers had committed suicide in Bengal. A bumper harvest of 120 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 led to a similar crisis, resulting in the price of potatoes falling to Rs 3 to Rs 5 per kg. While in 2012, Bengal was not among top five states in terms of suicides, by 2013, it contributed to 9.7 per cent of all suicides. Unlike Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where the cities recorded highest number of suicides, Kolkata recorded 360 out of a total of 14,310 suicides in 2014, with most suicides taking place in rural Bengal.Despite repeated attempts, Agriculture Minister Ashis Banerjee was not available for comments.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Express file Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Express fileFive major wholesale markets in the state, including Punes, are likely to see a major change in the way their board of directors are elected. Instead of elections to pick the board, the state government is likely to appoint senior officials as directors to run these markets. These five markets  the wholesale markets of Vashi, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur, besides Pune  receive around 30 per cent of the commodities arriving from other states and have substantially large turnovers. Vashis is the largest wholesale market in the state and, besides Maharashtra, records arrivals from Gujarat, among other states. The move to appoint senior officials as directors is part of the new model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act circulated by the central government in March this year. The Act specifies markets with more than 30 per cent arrival from other states as markets of national importance.State governments have been asked to give their suggestions and objections to it and adopt it as they deem fit. The Act has numerous other provisions to improve the performance of wholesale markets and help farmers realise better value for their produce. The government has formed a special committee headed by the director (marketing) to study the matter and submit a report. The report, it is learnt, is in its final stages after which it will be put before the Cabinet for approval.APMCs for long have been the hub of politics. In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP have traditionally controlled these markets with the ruling BJP having a thin presence in them. Earlier, the state government had mooted the concept of expert directors, who would be political appointees on these boards. Majority of those appointed, it is said, were close to the BJP. The present move, many say, is another government move to wrestle control of these markets.Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Meanwhile, most traders say the move will not affect the functioning of the markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the Vashi markets onion and potato traders, said trade would go on unhindered. This is purely a political move and will achieve nothing substantial, he said.Jagdish Apshunde, a director of the Nashik market, however, said the move will have its pros and cons. An upright officer will be able to run the markets better but if power is concentrated in the hands of a corrupt officer, the market will go for a toss, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Earlier, the vegetable was being sold at a steep Rs. 35 to Rs. 50 per kg.
