Scientists are testing crops in the area which can make the district a potato hub.International Potato Centre Peru and Central Potato Research Centre Shimla have jointly sown potatoes of various varieties in the fields of 11 farmers in Nachna area.Under the project, 11 farmers from PWM, 10AWD, NLD areas have been selected and given free seeds varieties including Kufri Ganga, Kufri Lima, Kufri Garima, Kufri Sadabahar, Kufri Pukhraj, Kufri Surya, Kufri Jyoti, Kufri Chipsona-3, Kufri Chipsona-4 and Kufri Frysona.Agriculture scientist Dr S K Luthra of Central Potato Research Centre Shimla, trained the farmers to prepare land, quantity of water, seed treatment and technical aspects.While scientist Dr Sanjay Rawal collected soil samples from the fields of the farmers and educated them about the use of fertilizers. Regional director, International Potato Centre Peru, Mohinder S Kadiyan said, the centre is working in many parts of India and the objective is to encourage farmers for growing potatoes so that they become economically independent.He said that the farmer who grows more potatoes will be awarded. Agronomist Dr Sushma Arya said this is third project in Nachna area in three years. Earlier the project was carried out in Didhu area.Farmers had grown potatoes and the yield and quality was good.Scientists informed that the quality of potatoes grown here is better than Gujarat and Punjab. Once the farmers are trained, they can grow potatoes on their own and earn more profit."

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

While the showers are responsible for pulling down prices of a handful of vegetables , it has adversely affected the stocks of others, thereby burning a hole in consumers' pockets.Over the last few days, prices of cabbage and cauliflower have dropped sharply, thanks the low-pressure triggered rain. Wholesalers have resorted to distress sale to clear the cabbage-cauliflower stock damaged by the rain.But buyers are not so lucky when it comes to other vegetables. Prices of some staple vegetables have remained consistently at or above Rs 50/kg. This is bit unusual if you look at previous years. By this time last year, vegetable prices nosedived sharply.According to sources, rain has delayed harvesting of winter vegetables in Bengal, forcing the state to depend on other states. Consumers, subsequently, are bearing the price burden. ""Most of the winter vegetables we are now getting is coming from outside. Peyajkoli (Scallion), which is coming from Karimpur in Bangladesh , remains pricey. Tomato from Purulia has just started arriving. So, tomato price is likely to crash in two-three days,"" said Kamal Dey, Koley Market vendors association president and Bengal government's market task force member.But the showers have spelt doom for potato. After last year's bumper crop, this year was predicted to be a lean year. But the untimely rain can make it far worse. ""So, potato prices might shoot up unusually,"" said Dey.But what is most striking is the gap between wholesale and retail prices. ""Around 20% is the reasonable gap between wholesale and retail prices, if you take into account transportation cost, waste and local market levy by trading associations. But in case of most of the vegetables, the difference is between 60% and 80%,"" said Anubrata Chatterjee, an agro-retail economist.The government should put up a board at every municipal market to publicize wholesale prices so that a consumer knows whether the retail vendor is asking for too much, advised Dey. An aware consumer can always bring down the price of vegetables at a reasonable level.Last week's rain has hit the prime vegetable producing districts like South 24 Parganas, East, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah hard. In South 24 Parganas, 8,242 hectares have been affected, followed by East Midnapore (6,984 hectares), Bankura (4,380 hectares) and Hooghly (1,544 hectares),"" said an agriculture department officer."

""The solution lies in concrete steps such as setting up Potato Board , involving think tanks for long-term policies and getting rid of randomness in policy so that initiatives to export potatoes can work. The international community is expecting from us, but archaic steps like fixing minimum export price hold the farmers back.""The bad run for potato farmers started last year as 70% of the crop was pushed into cold storages and potato seed buyers from West Bengal did not turn up.

Apart from the decor, cribs, carols, midnight mass, sweets and presents, if there is one much looked forward to festive tradition, it is that of the scrumptious Christmas lunch. Since Christmas and year-end festivities usually draw together family members who may be spread far and wide, the lunch is almost always a rather elaborate affair, sometimes going well into tea time.Recalling Christmas memories of her younger days, homemaker Nirmala Fernandes says, Back then, the Christmas lunch spread was akin to a feast spread, featuring a range of traditional delicacies such as pulao, sorpotel, sannas, beef or pork roast, beef stew and sometimes a whole chicken or suckling that would be roasted, she says, adding that the platter of Christmas sweets, which doubled up as dessert, was what they looked forward to the most since many of the items would be prepared only during the festive season.Of late though, the western influence seems to have heavily dominated festive eating habits. An increasing number of people today opt for items such as stuffed turkey, roasted duck, leg of lamb, pork belly, along with their accompaniments such stuffing, sauces, salads and steamed and sauteed exotic vegetables to be the highlight of the lunch.Kirit Maganlal of Magsons Superstore, which caters to such requirements on a pre-order basis, says that the trend, which is as recent as about five years, has numerous takers. Earlier, such meal choices were restricted to five-star venues. Now, however, their affordability and the ease of availability means that more people are able to enjoy these choices, which would otherwise be considered exotic, Maganlal says. Ask him about the clientele for these offerings and he says that opposed to the view that it is mostly the foreigners settled in Goa who opt for their ready-for-the-table, pre-cooked meal offerings, almost 80% of those who place orders with them are Goans.Talking about this western influence, Raia-based Fatima Moniz , who conducts cooking classes, says that closer to the season, she mostly gets demands for classes for stuffed chicken, leg of ham, salted tongue and other such delicacies. We anyway have the added advantage of the food legacy left behind by the Portuguese, which has become an important part of our cuisine, she adds.For chef Vasquito Alvares , the raging trend this year is the honey-glazed whole leg of lamb.As for the many Goans settled in the West, Christmas is a time for going back to the roots of sorts. David DSouza, who resides in Canada and manages the popular page dedicated to Goan food titled Traditional Goan Foodies on a social networking site says Christmas lunch for them is about heartily tucking into traditional favourites such as potato chops, sorpotel, roast beef, chicken xacuti, pulao and salad. In fact, in the run-up to Christmas, sorpotel has emerged as a hot favorite on the page. While many Goans are seeing what folks in the West are doing and adopting those food trends, we Goans, who are away from home, miss our traditional foods and are sticking with those."

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."

He has done a wide-ranging research on potato and the diseases affecting it.He said Uttar Pradesh was the biggest producer of potatoes in the country amounting, to 29-35% of the total national production.Ground reports said 2016-17 saw potato cultivation in an area of 6.14 lakh hectare across the state with an expected production of 155 to 160 lakh metric ton.With the BJP having made huge promises to farmers during assembly polls, handling of the potato harvest will be the first true test of the Yogi government, especially in light of UP being the largest producer of potatoes in the country where lakhs of farmers cultivate this cash crop. Last year, thousands of potato farmers were forced to dump their crop, leaving it to rot owing to very poor price being offered for their produce in the market.To ensure that all promises are kept, the state government, based on recommendations of an expert committee, has come up with a market intervention strategy to handle the potato harvest in the state.Based on it, the principal secretary (horticulture) Sudhir Garg has shared that a scrutiny of the 19 bulk markets or mandis of the state has shown that on April 10, 2017, the bulk price of potatoes varied between Rs 290 and Rs 690 per quintal.Garg has communicated this information through a government order sent to director (horticulture and food processing department).Potato sold at Rs 290 per quintal, the lowest in the state, in Farrukhabad and at Rs 680 per quintal, the highest, in Lucknow.Further scrutiny of the markets has shown that in districts like Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Moradabad, Allahabad, Kanpur, Farrukhabad, Meerut and Saharanpur the bulk price of potato was Rs 400 or less per quintal on April 3, 2017. Its price was Rs 500 or above in districts like Gonda, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Mirzapur and Varanasi.The order says that the government believes that timely and adequate supply of potato from low-priced markets to high priced ones can help achieve a balance in pricing that benefits both farmers and consumers.The government wants the district magistrates and the district horticulture officers to not just get the potato prices printed in local dailies but also through coordination with their counterparts of other districts facilitate flow of potato from low priced districts to markets in high- priced ones.The state government also plans to send potato to other states with support of their agriculture ministers via respective distribution agencies and marketing federations and tapping the e-NAM or e-national agriculture market.Welcome step but support price too low: ExpertExperts believe that extending support price for potato, which is the most important cash crop of UP, is a welcome step. However, they say the support price of Rs 487 per quintal is too low, especially as a bulk of the potato farmers are small scale cultivators.Out of the states total production, around 75 lakh metric ton is consumed by the people and around 7 lakh metric ton is used for processed food. Another 20 lakh metric ton is used as seed. The surplus is exported to other states and even abroad, including Nepal, said prof Pradeep Bhargava, a noted development economist.Uttar Pradesh has 1708 private and government cold storages at present with storage capacity of 130.26 lakh metric ton, amounting to 81% of the expected produce.The state government has said that till March 31, 2017, 96.49 lakh metric ton of potatoes, 74% of the storage capacity, had already been achieved.When there is a bumper harvest, the governments move will enable farmers to get at least the minimum support price. This is a welcome step. However, the support price should have been much higher so as to ensure a decent minimum earning for small-scale farmers who farm on 1 to 5 bigha land so that it justifies their investments and helps make enough money to promote farming and also support their livelihood, he added.Prof Bhargava says that on the face of it, the fact that cost of production on average is Rs 28,000 per hectare and the return is Rs 84,000 per hectare seems impressive. However, when the farmer is small scale and sells potato at a price of Rs 4.87 per kilogram earning hardly Rs 8,400 per bigha, he ends up with hardly enough to justify his investments and labour of three-four months. A better support price therefore is needed, he added."
5b2e03109855b7245313c760,Snack and the City: How the Vada Pav Has Kept Up with Mumbai's Appetite,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/snack-and-the-city-how-the-vada-pav-has-kept-up-with-mumbai-s-appetite/story-K5JRuEMt00i4iTYqCkD74L.html,2017-04-17,"Its a fairly odd recipe, as recipes go  carbs dipped in more carbs, wrapped in carbs.But thats no accident. The vada pav is the answer to a riddle from the last century: What filling snack can you offer a mill worker with just a few annas and no time to sit and eat?Even before the vada pav, its ingredients  chilli, garlic and potato  were already favourites, says food historian Kurush Dalal. What the stalls of the 1960s did, was take the migrant workers average meal and package it to go. And that just worked. It soon became a hit with students or whoever had little money to spend, but wanted a good snack. It is only later that it has become an identity of Mumbai itself. Now, everyone who comes to Mumbai tries the vada pav, he says.Today, you cant turn a corner without running into fresh, hot vadas served with garlic powder, teekha-meetha chutneys (imli and green chilli), and fried chillies on the side.You already want one, dont you? Chances are youve had at least one in the past month. And it may not have been at a pavement stall either.You can now order Mumbais favourite snack at trendy cafs and casual fine-dining restaurants in the city. Sometimes itll come to you in the form of a slider; other times, its deconstructed.Its a fairly well-travelled little fellow too. You can now get a vada pav in London, New York or Sydney  granted, you will have to ask for the Bombay burger when you order.Its been a symbol, snack and political icon. At each stage of the citys transformation, it has acted as a mirror  going corporate at the turn of the century, saffron in the oughts, and taking to casual fine-dining in the early parts of this decade.Its a migrant too!Interestingly, the vada pavs core ingredients arent really local. The pav is a legacy of the Portuguese; the potato and groundnut came to us from the Americas, also via the Portuguese. The garlic is localand the chickpea batter.Like any good Mumbaiite, the snack is supremely adaptable. Its many things to many people, often at the same time.In 2008, for instance, it became a political statement when the Shiv Sena launched more than 100 Shiv Vada Pav stalls across the city. As Sena legislator Anil Parab puts it, It is a part of Mumbais culture. Several people who had vada pav stalls were Shiv Sena supporters already, so the party felt it would do well for the business and the city to turn it into a brand.These stalls werent the snacks political debut either. Theres a theory that the vada pav has its very roots in the Senas battle to establish a Marathi identity as the basis of Mumbais melting-pot culture.In the 1960s, some Shiv Sena protest signs read Idli dosa bhagao [Stop idli and dosa], referencing the two iconic snack foods of Tamil Nadu, as Sainiks attacked South Indian Udipi restaurants because the party founder, Bal Thackeray, accused south Indians of taking jobs that rightly belonged to the Marathi manoos, says Harris Solomon, a professor of cultural anthropology at Americas Duke University, in a paper titled The Taste No Chef Can Give: Processing Street Food in Mumbai, published in 2015.It was then, as a counter to the increasingly popular idlis and dosas and as a way to promote entrepreneurship, that the party first encouraged Maharashtrians to start their own vada pav stalls.It was about encouraging the Marathi people to turn entrepreneurs instead of hunting for jobs, says Parab.#MumbaiMeriHai What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city? We will trace the roots of Mumbais most popular street foods, drop in at its maidans, explore the workings of its stock markets and that grand dream machine that is Bollywood. We would like to hear from you too.Tweet, Istagram your favourite pictures of the city with #MumbaiMeriHai, or write to us at @htmetro@hindustantimes.comPav wowTwo decades on, came the real boost for the vada pav.When the citys textile mills began to close in the 1980s and people needed income, they sold vada pav outside the mills. The rest of the mill workers would pass their former colleagues on the streets selling vada pav, and buy from them, Solomon writes.Then came the post-liberalisation boom. In 2001, Dheeraj Gupta launched Jumbo King Vada Pav, with its first outlet outside Malad railway station.This was followed by trendy kiosk-style outlets with names such as Goli Vada Pav (2004) and Wow Vada Pav (2012).With their shiny clean interiors, quirky combinations and customisable toppings, they soon became popular.All three now have scores of outlets across the country  from Jharkhand to Uttarakhand and Hyderabad to Delhi.Somewhere in Ranchi, then, there is someone eating what started out as a mill workers snack, now available in local flavours  with chhole, for instance, or achari-flavoured.We think of the vada as the ultimate finger food, says Gupta. And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers. Weve made no changes and have no secret recipe. It just works, and has kept working.The many avatas of the Vada Pav DECONSTRUCTED At Farzi Caf (top) and SpiceKlub, you get potato mousse or patties accompanied by smears or pouches of chutneys, sprinkled with lasoon chutney, sev, fried chillies and curry leaves IN A BAO Casual fine-dine restaurants such as the popular Social chain put the patty in a soft Chinese bun called a bao. Accompaniments include a lehsun chutney mayonnaise. AS A SIZZLER At outlets of Bar Stock Exchange, the vadas come with a side of vegetables, cumin rice and kachumber, topped with AS A SALAD Dishkiyaoon in BKC serves the potato patty comes with salad leaves, pomegranate and a pinch of farsan.Smart casualWith the boom in disposable incomes and the mushrooming of stand-alone restaurants, the vada pav went smart casual.The changing economy changed the way people snacked too, says Mumbai columnist and city chronicler Smruti Koppikar. Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food. Like any true Mumbaiite, the vada pav is at its best under pressure and on the move."

The central bank left policy lending rate (repo) unchanged and hiked borrowing rates (reverse repo) at the last policy review on April 7.RBI has already signalled that uncertain monsoon and low statistical base effect will keep CPI inflation at 4.5% in the first half and 5% in the second half of 2017-18. The government may also increase the minimum support prices (MSPs) of crops, which will put an upward pressure on inflation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.A pick up in new currency in circulation helped revive consumer demand after a bout of severe cash crunch during the demonetisation drive of November-December of 2016.The March inflation number was still higher compared with the 0.45% fall in WPI during March 2016, as prices of petrol, diesel and minerals, firmed up due to an upward trend in global prices.Festival demand pushed up prices of vegetables by 5.7% and fruits by 7.6%. However, potato prices fell 17%, onion 10.8% and pulses 6.1% from a year ago.Mineral prices were up 23.5% while fuels were costlier by 18.2% as petrol and diesel prices were revised up.Last week, government data showed a rise in the prices of sugar, confectionary, snacks and fruits during Holi pushed up Indias consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3.81% in March from 3.65% in February.The slowing pace of remonetisation, or pumping new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes into circulation, during March to replace the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, helped inflation to stay within 4% in the financial year ending March 2017.Consumption and investment activity were dampened after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the bold decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.While the demonetisation weeded out Rs 15.44 lakh crore or 86% of currency from circulation, the government and RBI has been able to pump in about Rs 13.35 lakh crore worth of new notes so far."

The waiver will cost the state exchequer around Rs 3,500 crore.The farmers having outstanding power bills of Rs 10,000 or more will be allowed to pay the same in four installments, the cabinet decided.It also decided to ensure that transformers were changed in 48-hours, instead of 72 hours, in rural areas and within 24 hours in the urban areas.The farmers will not be required to transport the malfunctioning transformers to the power station. This would be responsibility of the power corporation officials, Sharma said.A memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed under the union governments power for all project in the presence of Yogi Adityanath and union power minister Piyush Goyal in Lucknow on April 14, the minister said.The pact will be inked to meet the Centres target of making the state energy efficient by 2018.Relief for potato farmersThe cabinet decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potato at Rs 487 per quintal to protect the interest of potato farmers.The government wants to give adequate price to potato growers. Even if we cannot give them profit, we will ensure they do not incur loss, Sharma said.He said district magistrates were asked to set up procurement centres wherever needed.If the previous SP regime had played a proactive role, the condition of potato growers would have been better, he added.Sugarcane dues to be paid in 14 daysThe government also made it mandatory to clear the current dues of the sugarcane growers within 14 days and previous dues within 120 days.Legal action will be initiated against sugar mills if they fail to make payments, Sharma said.Steps to end shortage of building materialsThe state cabinet also decided to amend the Uttar Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1963, in a bid to end the shortage of sand and coarse sand, which is adversely impacting construction activities.Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state cabinet had constituted a committee, headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, at its last meeting to look into the issue.The committee had submitted its report, he said.The state government will allow transportation of minor minerals with valid transit permits from other states.As a short term measure, district magistrates will issue e-tenders to allocate up to 10-acre area for sand mining for six months. He said short term measures had been initiated as implementation of long-term measures may take six to eight months."

It remains common among Muslim families even in Jakarta, although doctors there typically carry out a less extreme form of the procedure that involves pricking the clitoral hood with a needle.In an effort to accommodate cultural and religious considerations, the government has moved away from previous attempts to ban the practice entirely and has instead sought to stamp out the more harmful methods and ensure safety.Authorities insist the methods most commonly used in Indonesia -- usually involving a pin prick -- do not amount to female genital mutilation.The methods used in Indonesia are generally less harsh than the most brutal forms of FGM found mainly in African and Middle Eastern countries, that can go as far as total removal of the clitoris.Read: Female circumcision: A cruel practice that numbs womens sexual pleasureThe UN, however, disagrees with the Indonesian governments stance, classifying FGM among harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes and has passed two resolutions aimed at stopping it worldwide in recent years.The global body says FGM has no health benefits and can cause many problems, such as infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications.Not in KoranDebate within Indonesia has been heating up in recent times, with activists and even a major Muslim organisation arguing against female circumcision, saying it violates a womans right to do as she wishes with her body.I believe there are no verses in my religion that allow female circumcision -- it is not in the Koran, Khorirah Ali, a member of the government-backed national commission on violence against women, said.The countrys second-biggest Muslim organisation, Muhammadiyah, discourages its followers from partaking in circumcision but the largest, Nahdlatul Ulama, and the countrys top Islamic authority the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) is still in favour.The issue is a hot potato and the government has flip-flopped in recent years.Also read: Over 800 girls circumcised in Tanzania despite govt crackdown on FGMIn 2006, the health ministry banned doctors from carrying out female circumcision, saying there was no medical benefit -- but the MUI hit back with a fatwa saying that women who undergo the procedure would be considered noble.The government backtracked several years later and said licensed medics could conduct the procedure as long as it was only scratching the clitoral hood, only to later void this measure in favour of asking a specially appointed council to issue safety guidelines.Campaigners say the constant changes have created confusion about what is allowed and more harmful practices -- such as those used in Gorontalo -- continue to exist.Despite the opposition, the practice is unlikely to end soon in the country of 255 million people.Jurnalis Uddin, an expert on female circumcision from Jakarta-based Yarsi University, and a member of the governments advisory council, said the focus should be on encouraging the less harmful methods.To get rid of the practice completely is like swimming against the current, he said."

The minister said 35.52 lakh farmers have been provided soil health cards and soon cards will be provided to the remaining farmers.Saini said organic farming is being encouraged in the state under traditional agriculture development scheme. At present organic farming is done on 65,000 hectares and efforts were being made to increase the area.He also announced that 900 veterinary doctors and 4,000 livestock assistants will be recruited and a subsidy scheme will be implemented to help farmers in setting up agriculture product processing and value addition unit on their own fields for post harvest management and value addition through processing technique. In this scheme, subsidy of 50% or maximum up to 20 lakh will be given on the project approved by banks.Under Chief Minister Foreign Training visit, progressive farmers will be sent abroad for training.

Singh wanted to about the illegal power connections at the area.Rathore said the plot on which the slum area has come up is disputed and the Supreme Court on November 13, 1992 had appointed a former judge as receiver and administrator.In 1995, another judge from Gujarat was appointed as receiver and without the judges no objection certificate, electricity connection cannot be given in the area."

Politically, the BJP will benefit the most from this investigation, said Rahul Sinha, BJP national secretary and former state president.The chief minister appeared to have anticipated that the BJP would up the ante in view of the election results in five states. While reacting to the court order, she made her first political move.Over the next few months, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has to battle the opposition parties that are lining up their arsenal to gun for her. (Subhankar Chakraborty)Our party will move the Supreme Court. The judgement was most unfortunate. How could the state president of a political party predict that the court would order a CBI investigation once the UP elections were over? she asked while addressing the media at the state secretariat.The judges were asking right from the beginning why a CBI probe should not be ordered. If a judgement is leaked before it is passed, it is unfair, said Banerjee. She was referring to BJP state president Dilip Ghoshs recent remark when he predicted that a CBI probe into the Narada scam was imminent.This is a grand conspiracy. The footage was also released from the BJP office, she reiterated. State BJP leaders reacted by saying they might file a contempt petition against the chief minister for making such remarks on a high court order.Read: Election results: Why BJPs sweep in UP could be ominous for Mamata BanerjeeThough Congress was the first party to move court on the Narada scam, Bengal PCC chief and MP, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, somehow seemed convinced that the BJP would now claim its pound of flesh.Virtually the entire Trinamool leadership may land in jail soon, Chowdhury told HT. He ruled out any possibility of the investigation going slow - as feared by the Left- given the BJPs dependence on Trinamool Congress to save its newly-formed government in Manipur.The Narada verdict came at a time when the Trinamool chief is at the pinnacle of her popularity following the redistribution of the SIngur land among the farmers and her move to rain in private hospitals. (HT Photo)The BJP is a master is horse trading. It is Mamata Banerjee who should feel scared. There may come a time when her party leaders will start flocking to the BJP to save their skin, said Chowdhury.Political observers however pointed out that no matter how hard the state BJP might try to corner Trinamol Congress, the Left and Congress would work out their own strategy to regain lost ground.Read: Setback for Mamata and Trinamool, HC asks CBI to probe Narada sting operationCPI(M) state secretary Suryakanta Mishra and Politburo member and MP, Md Salim both alleged that the BJP and Trinamool were allies and hence, the CBI probe meant little. How does one explain why the Parliaments Ethics Committee headed by L K Advani didnt meet even once over the past one year? Since some of the accused are MPs, the matter was referred to the committee long ago, said Salim.The partnership was evident in Manipur where the BJP formed the government with support of the sole Trinamool MLA. Had the Centre been serious about Naradha, Saradha, Rose Valley and other scams, they would have taken steps long ago, alleged Mishra.The chief minister is not above suspicion. Why wasnt any action against S M H Mirza, the IPS officer seen accepting money in the Narada tapes? The chief minister has argued that political parties accept donation to contest elections. Question is, do IPS officers accept those donations on behalf of politicians? said Mishra."

Despite good crop yield, they are not even able to recover the input cost of their produce.Uttar Pradesh witnessed an increase of about 20% this year in the areas under potato cultivation. There has been increased production as the weather too remained conducive, said Ram Saran Verma, a leading farmer of Barabanki who has introduced many innovations in potato farming.Farmers are getting Rs 3-4 per kg in the wholesale market for potato that is being sold at Rs 8-10 in the market. The cost of production alone has been around Rs 4 per kg and thus farmers are running into losses, said Verma.Kannauj, Barabanki, Farukkhabad, Firozabad and Agra are some big potato producing areas in UP.The scenario is same in other potato producing states, including West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar, where potato has been priced almost at the same rate in the wholesale markets.The reason for low prices is very good yield this season. Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP. But as production has been good this time, these storages are likely to be full to capacity and farmers would have to sell off their produce at low prices.Farmers who manage to get their potatoes stored will be safe. But others are sure to incur huge losses. About 30% of the produce is likely to get either spoiled or farmers will be forced to sell it off for Rs 1-2 per kg, said Verma.Read more: Prepare roadmap to prevent farmer suicides, SC tells government"

He said the promise has come true only for industrialists as the countrys farmers continue to face burey din (bad days).The Congress has often accused the government of following pro-industry and anti-farmer policies.Ghazibad, which has a thriving steel and dyeing industry, was one of the 73 constituencies that voted on February 11, the first of the seven phases of polling for the UP state assembly.February 17 (Rae Bareli): The Congress leader again used the governments ambitious Make in India programme to hit out at the Prime Minister at a poll meeting in Rae Bareli, saying we only see Made in China on everything.Sister Priyanka by his side, Gandhi went on to explain, It is because our PM only listens to 50 corporate families in India and he has helped Vijay Mallya escape and collectively waived off six lakh crore loan for his corporate friends.The PM, he said, could have helped with some money in setting up food-processing plants in the area. I want to see Made in Rae Bareli on packaged products one day, Gandhi said.Rae Bareli, which has five assembly segments, is the Lok Sabha constituency of his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Rae Bareli voted on February 23.October 1, 2016 (Firozabad): Addressing a gathering of farmers in Uttar Pradeshs Firozabad, Gandhi said he ask the government to set up a potato factory. This was in reply to villager asking him to set up a potato chips factory so that they would be able to get a good price for their crop.Gandhi had told the farmers: You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader. I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers.March 6, 2014 (Mirzapur): Addressing a rally in the carpet-manufacturing belt of Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said he wanted the American president to one day wear a wrist watch bearing Made in Mirzapur tag.I want to see a day when the American president is asked: Bhaiya, what is the time? He looks at his watch and on it is written Made in Mirzapur. He then asks his people: Where is this Mirzapur? These youth of Mirzapur are snatching jobs from American youth. Where is this place? sources quoted Gandhi as saying.."

The state agriculture department and Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Limited (PAIC) are working out modalities for exporting the crop to the two countries.As supply of potato from Pakistans Punjab province in the current season will end by March 15, the Indian side is gearing up to export consignments. The state agencies woke up to the farmers plight after they complained of earning less than the input cost and fleecing by traders. A bag of 50-kilogram potatoes is selling for just Rs 80 to Rs 100.Also read |Punjab govt intervenes to bail out potato growersWe have orders to supply 2,800-tonne potatoes to Russia and 5,000 tonne to Iran. Modalities are being worked out to start the export, said PAIC managing director KS Pannu.Last season, the area under potato cultivation stood at 70,000-80,000 hectares. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Financial commissioner, development, NS Kalsi, who is in charge of the agriculture department, said the landing cost of potato in the two countries will be Rs 18 per kilogram, while it will sell for Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kilogram.The profit will be passed on to the farmers. The corporation has sought Rs 5-crore financial help from the government to start lifting the produce from farmers, he said.Bharatiya Kisan Union president Balbir Singh Rajewal said area under potato has been expanding and this season an alltime high of one lakh hectare was under potato cultivation, with 25-lakh tonne production expected.Last season, the area under potato cultivation stood at 70,000-80,000 hectares.Although the quantum of export is negligible as compared to the total production, it will give a fillip to the trade, he said.He, however, questioned the delay in listening to the farmers, who had to bear heavy losses, and suggested export of the produce should be made a regular exercise.Jalandhar potato growers association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha said big growers have offered their produce for export for free and the income generated by the corporation could be passed on to farmers after recovery of payments from the foreign buyers. To help small farmers, we have offered to lift their produce at Rs 4 to Rs 5 a kilogram, he said.WHY PRICES CRASHEDFollowing the Centres demonetisation move, traders stopped lifting the produce. Seeing the drop in demand, cold storage owners refused to stock the crop.If farmers are not able to sell their produce, they will not be in position to pay for the storage charges, reasoned a cold storage owner. There are 500 cold storages in Punjab, with a combined capacity of 25 lakh tonne.Seeing the plight of farmers, the state government had asked deputy commissioners to ensure cold storage owners dont fleece them."

He also decided to slash the rates of commission charged by the commission agents from 5% to 1%, with immediate effect.Badal also asked the Punjab Agro and Markfed to explore the feasibility of export potential of potatoes to Russia, Dubai, Iran, Sri Lanka and other countries for which the state government would subsidise the freight.Besides, the agriculture department has also been directed to undertake distant marketing of potatoes in the other parts of the country to ensure better prices to the growers.The CM also asked the agriculture department to ensure rational utilisation of storing capacity of cold stores across the state to curb the malpractice of hoarding.It was also decided in the meeting to issue an advisory to the department of education and jails, besides other government institutions, for optimum utilisation of potato in the mid-day meal scheme and for consumption of jail inmates for rich nourishment, which would also boost the sale of potato in the state."

It is one of the earliest resistance movements by the people of Odisha against colonial rule. Of late, this historical event has become a political hot potato for both the BJP and the BJD in Odisha. Chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik has written to the Centre to declare the rebellion as the first war of Independence.The uprising of 1857 is popularly known as the First War of Independence though the government has not officially granted any such status to it. Upasana Mohapatra, the great granddaughter of Buxi Jagabandhu, has joined the BJP at a function in Bhubaneswar in October in the presence of petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Her father late Lulu Mohapatra was a Congress leader till his death last year. Earlier on July 20, the NDA government organised a function here to celebrate 200 years of the popular uprising.To a question by Congress leader Mullapally Ramachandran, the junior HRD minister said other than the 'Paikas', ordinary peasants, landholders and salt-makers had all risen in unison against the British during this period making it a popular movement. ""Later, in 1857, we see a movement or uprising of similar nature though on a much larger scale. Therefore, from a historical point of view it can be said that the 'Paika Bidroha' had set an example for the classes as well as the masses in India to follow later on as and when circumstances so warranted,"" the minister said.""Therefore, considering that this is one of the beginnings of popular uprisings against the British in India, it has been decided to include it as a 'case-study' in the Class VIII history textbook of NCERT, which deals with the 1857 event,"" he added.Case study in NCERT books refers to small boxes describing certain significant events of the past.However, historians demanded that the NCERT should have included text on other such uprising of that time like the Poligar rebellion of Tamil Nadu of 1799 and the Santhal rebellion of 1855 in present day Jharkhand.A few years ago, some scholars from Tamil Nadu had demanded that Poligar rebellion be declared the first war of Independence. When the matter was referred to the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), the council said the demand had no merit.""It is a good thing that students will get to know about rebellions taking part of various parts of the country. But contemporary rebellion of all parts of the country should be included in the books,"" Saradindu Mukherjee, a member of the ICHR said.A faculty of history from Jawaharlal Nehru University said NCERT books earlier used to avoid giving texts on events having regional significance, but gave importance to developments of national scale. ""Now the decisions to include and exclude texts are taken under political pressure,"" the faculty member said. Sources in the NCERT said a panel took the decision to include Paika rebellion in the textbook without much debate. There is no specific policy on what to be included or excluded.Despite efforts, NCERT director Hrushikesh Senapati was not available for comment on the demand for inclusion of other revolts."

Initiatives to enhance irrigation network by renovating major reservoir projects, however, will increase yields in a year or two.Agricultural experts of the department, however, claimed that production of major cereals and vegetables this year would be very high as compared to past years.Notwithstanding official claims, the survey report fails to project a cosy picture for the farm sector. Besides dip in production of major fruits like mango, guava, litchi and banana, productivity of major crops like wheat, rice and pulse also witnessed downtrend in 2015-16 as compared to 2013-14.Although production of potato witnessed marginal improvement (63.45 lakh tonne in 2015-16 against 60.50 lakh tonne in 2013-14), onion and tomato went down to 12.47 lakh tonne from 13.04 lakh tonne and 10.01 lakh tonne from 10.61 lakh ton in the same corresponding year.Net sown area for sugarcane also came down to 3.46% of net cultivable area in 2015-16 as against 3.66% recorded in 2013-14.

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming.

While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each.

The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

Instead, childrens palate is assaulted with unhealthy food high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and low on essential nutrients they need to grow mentally and physically.Chips, sweetened beverages, instant noodles, fries, samosas, bread pakoras and patties are the standard fare in most school cafeterias. When schools ban them, enterprising vendors set up makeshift kiosks and sell meals-on-bicycles outside schools. With no running water or quality control for cooking and storing, most children end up with empty calories and very often, gut-destroying germs.All refined, fried and processed foods are just empty calories because most of the essential sugar and fat the body needs is present naturally in food, such as sugar in fruits and fat in dairy, seeds, nuts, meats and cooking oil, says Rahul Verma, founder of the Delhi-based non-profit Uday Foundation, which filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court in December 2010 asking for a ban on the sale of junk food in schools. Though traditional snacks are freshly made and do not have additives such as colour and preservatives added to them, they are usually high in low quality oils, salts and sugars, Verma underlines.In March 2015, the Delhi High Court asked the administrator of Delhi to issue healthy eating guidelines under Rule 43 of the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, and directed the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to formulate guidelines, which have since been circulated but are not binding.While many private schools in Delhi and Mumbai have not waited for government guidelines and moved towards healthier snacks years ago, Punjab, where the states child rights commission banned junk food in schools in January 2016, unhealthy foods are still widely available.Delhis Springdales School, Pusa Road, removed fried snacks and aerated drinks from their canteen menu a decade ago. The shift in the attitude occurred after a survey showed 70% of the students were overweight and were either suffering from associated conditions or would grow up to be unhealthy adults.Children have only one meal in school during recess. To make the child healthy over-all, we have to involve the parents. Too many children were getting two-minute noodles, fried potato taters or foods high on sugar and fats, says Ameeta Wattal, principal, Springdales, where poha, idli sambar and wholewheat sandwiches are sold along with drinks like lassi, chaach and lime juice.Read | Out of the box: Healthy eating is now part of school lunchroomsThese foods are also part of the cafeteria menu at Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, where the menu is changed periodically to include seasonal vegetables. The school also has a committee  consisting of teachers, students and some parents who work in the field of nutrition -- that monitor the nutrition value of the food, the taste and the oil it is cooked in. Our canteen is outsourced, but we strictly monitor it to make sure that the quality of the food is maintained, says Manohar Lal, principal of the school.In Lucknows La Martiniere Girls College, children are encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables from kindergarten. The practice was introduced by our former principal Late Farida Abraham and it is still continuing, vice-principal Aashrita Dass told HT.In Mumbai, parents associations are sore at the lack of guidelines in Maharashtra. Schools receive cutbacks from vendors, and canteen contractors also prefer such items because it boosts their sales, says Jayant Jain, president, Forum for Fairness in Education, a parent-teacher body.Read | Boys in India eat better than girls: Oxford studyEven education officials admit they do not check whether schools serve junk food as there is no regulation against it so far. We cannot stop a school from serving junk food, as there is no official ban in place. We can at best advise them to opt for healthier choices, concedes BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai division.While many schools said it is difficult to restrict junk food in its vicinity, some have come up with innovative ways to restrict fast food in the campus: Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri serves fresh, hot and hygienic food breakfast and lunch on campus and doesnt allow home food to ensure parents dont send unhealthy food. Aerated drinks are banned.At Ryan International, Kandivali, teachers patrol the streets after school to ensure children walking out dont stop at the nearby McDonalds or other junk food joints.In government-run schools, the hot meals provided under the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (Mid Day Meal Scheme) are nutritive and safe but remain a challenge in many districts. The scheme was launched to increase enrolment, retention and attendance while improving the nutrition levels of children by giving them 300 calories of energy, 8-12 gm of protein and adequate micronutrients.The meals were not good enough to keep children in school. A 2015 audit of the action taken on the Comptroller and Auditor Generals 2008 Report on Mid Day Meal Scheme showed that the enrolment of children in the midday meals-covered schools dropped from 14.69 crore in 2009-10 to 13.87 crore in 2013-14, while enrolment in private schools shot up by 38% in the same period.The audit also found children were given less than the prescribed quantity of 100/150 gms of foodgrains and prescribed inspections were not carried out to ensure quality. Most schools sample checked in the audit were lacking in infrastructural facilities like kitchen sheds, proper utensils, availability of drinking water facility etc. There were several instances of food being cooked in the open in unhygienic conditions, the report found.Few lessons seem to have been learnt from the shocking case of negligence that left 23 children dead and dozens others seriously ill after they ate a pesticide-laced midday-meal at a primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman in the Saran district in Bihar in July 2013. A month later, 30 children fell ill in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh; and in November 2014, 25 children fell ill after eating their mid-day meal at a government school in Gaya district in Bihar.In July 2016,40 students fell ill in Chincholi village of Adilabad district of Telangana after eating food prepared in the school kitchen for a farewell party for seniors. In September that year, 25 students were hospitalised in Kolar district in KarnatakaIn September 2015, about 150 students in Chandoor town and Ilapuram village in Telangana started vomiting after their mid-day meal.Such cases of food poisoning are very rare and take place in remote areas due to lack of proper supervision and maintenance of kitchen. Otherwise, there is a periodical check on the quality of food by officials, parents committees and teachers. Even we eat the same food regularly to ensure the quality, said L Ravinder Rao, a senior headmaster in a government school in Ranga Reddy district of Telangana."
