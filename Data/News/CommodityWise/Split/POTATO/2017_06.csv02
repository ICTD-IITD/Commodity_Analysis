There has been experience of imposing labels on junk food in some countries part of one of the recommendation on the food, said the FSSAI chief.Pawan Kumar Agarwal, CEO of Foods Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). (via Livemint)The FSSAI came into prominence after the Nestle Maggi fiasco, soon after which Agarwal joined as its CEO. An officer with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Agarwal, sees a huge requirement to make people aware and educate them about food, and help them follow a healthy diet.In the past, he has brought large temples and mosques under the regulators surveillance. Shree Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai, Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Tirupati and Sai Baba temple in Shirdi, follow safety standards for the Prasad or bhog that they offer to its devotees.The regulators move to introduce junk food label comes at a time when India is going through an era of higher degree of urbanisation. A large number of small towns and cities are being exposed to the American burgers and Italian pastas, and millions of kids are acquiring new tastes. This has led to a debate on introducing a fat tax on junk food.There is a larger problem  obesity. India ranks third after the US and China, with 41 million obese people, according to Global Burden of Disease Study.To control the growing problem, FSSAI had set up a committee to prepare guidelines on healthy diet for Indians. The committee has made eight recommendations in the report, and a lot of it is about public education, Agarwal added.So will there be a special label for junk food? Agarwal said it is under consideration and a final decision will be taken soon.FSSAIs bigger problem will be to regulate local shops selling Indian fried snacks such as samosa and cutlets. That is the challenge There are practical difficulties in the Indian context for street food. You can do it in potato chips, but if someone sells a samosa on the street, it is difficult, Agarwal said.However, Agarwal is not giving up yet. Based on the committee report, he has chaired multiple discussions to see how street food vendors can be regulated. We are applying our mind because there is a lot of public interest Large, vocal and articulate consumer organisations say that something should be done, but the practical problems have to be taken into consideration, Agarwal said."

From the vast open fields of the Sunderbans to the Rann of Kutch, from the chilly upper reaches of the Himalayas to the dunes of Rajasthan, from the ultra-busy executive in Nariman Point to the wheeler dealer in Lutyens Delhi, the common man turned into a picture of patience and forbearance.Life came to a standstill and people on the move turned into a frozen silhouette against a tall steel-and-glass building, or dirty bylanes of a metropolitan city, near a crowded market in the suburbs or under the boughs in idyllic surroundings described by Davies.The Welsh poet was familiar with cows and sheep of the highlands, but was not fortunate enough to witness the common Indian at the end of 2016, who stood patiently in a queue ignoring responsibilities at home and office. Doctors left their patients behind, housewives their kitchens, teachers his students, pensioners their favourite television serials, actors his greenroom and sportsmen his games  all to queue up in front of banks and ATMs. Farmers cared little for his fields, workers left his tools in the factory sheds, fishermen abandoned his net and the butcher dropped his knife to queue up. Mothers left newborns at home and fathers their occupation.Pharmacists reported increased sales of balms for sore feet, stiff legs and low back pain. But the patience never wore thin.Many scurried out of their homes even before the first rooster woke up and stood in queues that seldom melted away before midnight. Pensioners doubled up in pain, chirpy college goers constantly glanced at their watches but they didnt walk out of the queue.More than 100 men and women departed for their heavenly abode while waiting in these queues, countless fell ill. In a queue in Hooghly district of Bengal a fifty something man, suffered a cardiac arrest and slumped to the ground. But none from the dozens waiting with him abandoned his position in the queue to assist him. He died, his death scripting an immortal ode to a nation with infinite patience.Life blossomed too. In Kanpur, a woman delivered a baby while waiting in a queue.At a few places like UPs Fatehpur, police wielded lathis on those standing. But the lines didnt vanish.It was more special because a large part of the nation, particularly the younger citizens, was a stranger to long queues. They only heard of people eager to buy food and kerosene stood standing in serpentine lines in the fifties, sixties and seventies. They also read about unending queues in the Eastern bloc (for almost everything from potato to clothes) in books and newspapers.From the pages of history, queues rushed back to emerge as a national vocation in every corner of this land spread over 3.287 million sq kms.Queues, or lines, have a variety of meanings. In geometry lines are defined by its length compared to a negligible breath. Right from the morning of November 9, real life began to approximate what we learnt in mathematics classes  with the queues continuously adding feet, their breath quickly became negligible compared to the length.Standing, or locus standi in Latin, has a wide meaning in law too. It defines a persons role or justification in any incident. Every one standing was given a locus standi  he/she was helping in cleansing the economy. The queue became the weapon of mass cleansing  another version of Swachh Bharat.As 2016 drew to a close, the common man of India stood the test of time and of patience, and as the ruling party would like us to believe, of patriotism.Irrespective of the driving motive, in 2016 the common man began to appreciate the appeal to stand and stare. Rarely does such a big and busy nation stand up in unison to respond to a poetic call."

Picture by Ashwinee PatiBhubaneswar: Gothapatna resident Shanti Lata Rath had to run from one vendor to another on Saturday to buy fresh groceries. When she did find a vendor with a relatively fresh stock, she was stunned by the price that the he asked for.Rath wasn't the only one to go through such an ordeal.Rumours of a cyclonic storm hitting the state not only emptied vegetable markets, but also saw prices soar. The most affected were the smaller shops. Tomato prices rose to Rs 50 to 60 a kg from Rs 40 earlier, while cabbage was selling at Rs 50 a kg compared to Rs 30 a kg last Monday. Prices of potato and onion also witnessed a sharp rise to Rs 15 and Rs 40 compared to Rs 10 and Rs 30 earlier.""I prefer fresh vegetables and buy them daily. However, it seems that my practice came heavy on my family and me. It has been raining for the past two days and the vegetable shops have nothing apart from cabbage and potato,"" said Rath, a homemaker.Old Town resident Sushil Hota faced a similar predicament. ""Such rumours of cyclones affecting daily markets, mainly in October, have become a yearly practice. I was aware of the situation, but failed to stock the essentials, so had to suffer for that. I had a tough time finding tomatoes at the market,"" said the schoolteacher.Small vegetable vendors in the city suffered the most because of the hoax as they failed to provide bare essentials even to daily customers.""I bought vegetables from the wholesale market, but the prices there witnessed a dramatic rise. I was forced to get the vegetables at much higher prices and sell them,"" said a vendor at CRP Square.On Wednesday, the regional meteorological centre here traced a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal and predicted heavy to very heavy rain for the city.""We rigorously monitored the system and never stated that it would intensify into any cyclonic storm. The system moved to neighbouring Jharkhand on Saturday and weakened gradually into a well-marked low pressure. Rainfall in the city will stop, and it will be the same for the state from Sunday,"" said Met director Sarat Chandra Sahu."

Picture by Amit BhelariPatna: Before leaving for Ranchi for the verdict in a fodder scam case, RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Friday stuck to the vegetarian diet prescribed by his astrologer Shankar Charan Tripathi, who is also national spokesperson of the party.After an olive oil massage and a bath, Lalu soaked in some winter sun at his home, 10 Circular Road. At around 11:30am, Tripathi's SUV arrived. ""Do you know that on his suggestion only I have quit non-vegetarian food? I have become vegetarian now,"" Lalu told The Telegraph.Half an hour later he asked for lunch. His personal helper Azgar brought the food and kept it on a table. Lalu asked another person to keep fanning with a piece of cloth to keep the flies away.Lalu's lunch comprised saathi rice dal, a brinjal, potato and palak dish, a pumpkin preparation, tomato chutney, raw tamarind chutney, coriander and kundru. He rounded off the meal with fried green chana with a dash of salt.Saathi rice, from a paddy variety mainly grown in the Champaran region which becomes ready in 60 days, is considered auspicious in most north Bihar districts, including Lalu's native Gopalganj.Lalu ate heartily, using a spoon and leaving a bit on the plate as is his habit, and also asked RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari to have lunch but he declined politely. Lalu's wife Rabri Devi was sitting next to her husband.Asked if he had any prediction for Saturday's judgment, Tripathi said: ""No, prediction at all, he is the sun who gives light to everyone. Nobody can touch him.""Lunch done, Lalu took his medicines and went inside for a one-hour siesta.By the time he emerged, many MLAs had gathered at his residence.As soon as Lalu came out from the room, he asked the timing of his flight from his close aide Bhola Yadav. He said 3:30pm and suggested Lalu leave within an hour. Lalu asked his doctor about the timing of medicines. The doctor said Bhola has been briefed.When a flight passed above his residence, Lalu looked at Rabri and said: ""Is this the same flight I am supposed to catch?""Rabri said: ""No, you have another flight. Just drink your lemon tea, you have half an hour left. At 3 pm, Lalu got into his SUV. Younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav followed, after touching the feet of his mother."

I would need capital for that and hence want to sell my paddy crop soon. As there is not much support from the state government on this front I might end up selling the paddy at whatever price would be offered in the local market,"" he told The Telegraph while sharing his expectations from the third agricultural roadmap of Bihar that would be released by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday.He wants the government to take care of the marketing aspect of agriculture produce on a priority basis for the welfare of the farmers.Nitish Kumar, another farmer from the same district who had set a world record in potato production in 2012 by achieving a productivity level of 72.9 tonnes of potato per hectare, too echoed Sumant and said: ""Marketing of produce is the biggest challenge facing Bihar farmers. The roadmap should take care of this aspect.""Nitish also underlined the need of timely delivery of the benefits that are part of the roadmap.Sanjiv Kumar, a progressive farmer from Hajipur in Vaishali district, had a mixed opinion about the two agricultural roadmaps that have been implemented so far.He said: ""While a lot of pro-farmer works were done in the first roadmap (2008-12) the second one (2012-17) got entangled in red tape. One hopes that the latest roadmap would keep farmers in the centre and would minimise bureaucratic interference in the delivery of the benefits.""Rajkumari Devi of Anandpur village in Muzaffarpur district too appears to be a disappointed soul.""The two roadmaps promised a lot to the farmers but the percolation of benefits on the ground has not been very effective. Farmers do get fertilisers, seeds etc on time and several of them also started mechanised farming due to the support announced by the state government, but procuring the subsidy for these items really becomes a tough ask for them,"" said Rajkumari, who is popularly called Kisan Chachi by the locals in the north Bihar district for helping them in doing scientific farming.Amid these voices of concern, there is a silver lining as well for the state government - evident from the assertion of Devendra Yadav of Basopatti in Madhubani district.""Farmers have gained a lot after implementation of the two agricultural roadmaps. My paddy crop could survive the flood fury this year as I had followed the advice of agriculture department officials who extend their services on a regular basis,"" he said.Confronted with the voices from the ground, agriculture minister Prem Kumar said: ""Steps are being taken for timely procurement of crops in a very transparent manner. Farmers facing any problems on this issue should approach us and their problem would be solved at any cost.""Reacting to the farmers' refrain over non-delivery of extension services, the minister said special steps were being taken to ensure presence of field officials in villages and soon rosters would be made for this purpose.The agriculture minister is also planning to hold an interactive session with farmers after the release of the roadmap and this would be used for collecting feedback from the stakeholders for effective implementation of the works that constitute the roadmap."

Officials say the calendar has changed. Earlier, the yearly report card used to be presented in November because Nitish Kumar's government took oath in November (even the Grand Alliance government). ""Now it will be in July because the NDA II government took oath in July after the collapse of the Grand Alliance government,"" said an official wondering if Nitish wants to disown his tenure in the Grand Alliance government. Nitish started the tradition of releasing an annual report card first in 2006 when he completed a year in power with the BJP. But last year the function to release a report card was cancelled in view of a train accident in Uttar Pradesh.Missing in action RJD chief Lalu Prasad talked about huge dharnas across the state against demonetisation on November 8. But on November 8, both Lalu and his son Tejashwi remained at home, as RJD and Congress leaders protested at Gandhi Maidan. ""The two biggest faces in the RJD abstained from their own party's function. Laluji might have received information that the size of crowds was not what he had expected. That's why he went off to Hajipur,"" said a BJP leader gleefully. RJD leaders in Patna are fuming. ""State party president Ram Chandra Purbey does not have the appeal to draw crowds like Lalu and Tejashwi can,"" said a senior RJD leader, insisting that the two should have participated in the event.The astrologer case After astrologer Shankar Charan Tripathi's appointment as national spokesperson of the RJD, some newspapers highlighted his ""murky"" past, giving JDU leaders a chance to attack the RJD. The development frustrated RJD leaders one of who even cribbed before a friend in the BJP how Lalu was making appointments in the party without knowing the person's background. The BJP leader told him that the same astrologer had been lobbying to enter the BJP for the past eight months but was dropped like a hot potato when the party got to know of his background. An old-timer recalled how Lalu had once called a press meet to say central agency officials were harassing RJD workers from Punjab. ""But those workers later turned out to be narcotic smugglers,"" the RJD leader said.Isolated After releasing Tejashwi Yadav's photograph with a girl, JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh finds himself isolated, even within his own party. While BJP leader C.P. Thakur and Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav disapproved of the act, senior JDU minister Shrawan Kumar expressed his ignorance about it. ""Shrawan is very close to chief minister Nitish Kumar and there is an attempt by the JDU to show as if Nitish was ignorant of what his spokesperson did,"" said an RJD leader."

His officials asserted the constraints could be easily ironed out given that the same alliance was in power at the Centre and in the state.""The only thing needed is political will for greater public good,"" a senior AAI official said on condition of anonymity. ""If initiatives are taken, the common people will also understand the situation and the solutions.""Patna airport is suffering from an acute space crunch that is hindering its expansion. The present length of the runway in Patna is just 7,000ft; a minimum 9,500 feet is necessary for safe landing by bigger aircraft. Also, of the existing runway, only 6,409 feet is available during landing and take-off because of location constraints, including structures like the state secretariat's clock tower, the Delhi-Howrah railway line on the southern side and a busy Peer Ali Path (Airport Road) to the north.Because of the short length only seasoned pilots who have previously landed and taken off from Patna are allowed here, to reduce chances of any mishap. An Alliance Air jet that crashed in Patna in July 2000 killed over 50 people.""Land is available close to the airport,"" an AAI official said. ""Hundreds of acres of land is locked in huge campuses belonging to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Research Complex for Eastern Region and Central Potato Research and Central Potato Research Institute. Why can't these be shifted? Patna needs a good airport.""Another AAI official said that with the metro rail slated to come to Patna and good quality tunnelling machines available, the railway line on the southern side could be taken underground, freeing the land for airport expansion.""And why not relocate the secretariat clock tower, which lies in the aircraft approach funnel? It is just a vestige of the British era, when very few people had wristwatches. With latest techniques, it could be easily removed elsewhere or its height lessened,"" an AAI official said.The officials added that the Peer Ali Path could be closed and given to the airport so that it could expand a bit in that direction too, solving all the issues related to parking and terminal building.""If we get the identified land, we'll be able to increase the runway length to 12,000 feet. The cost of relocating other government institutions will still be much less than building a new airport for Patna,"" an official said.Meanwhile, the central and the state government are looking towards the Bihta air force base and issues related to construction of a terminal building for public use are being sorted out."
5b2e7c049855b72640115e51,Diabetes: A father sues to curb junk food in India...,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/650246/diabetes-father-sues-curb-junk.html,2017-12-26,"Rahul Verma's son was born gravely ill with digestive problems, but over years of visits to the boy's endocrinologist, Verma saw the doctor grow increasingly alarmed about a different problem, one threatening healthy children. Junk food, the doctor warned, was especially dangerous to Indians, who are far more prone to diabetes than people from other parts of the world.One day in the doctor's waiting room, Verma noticed a girl who had gotten fat by compulsively eating potato chips. He decided he had to do something. ""On one side you have children like my son, who are born with problems,"" said Verma, ""and on the other side you have children who are healthy and everything is fine and you are damaging them giving them unhealthy food.""Verma, who had no legal training, sat late into the nights with his wife, Tullika, drafting a petition in their tiny apartment. He filed the public interest lawsuit in Delhi High Court in 2010, seeking a ban on the sale of junk food and soft drinks in and around schools across India.The case has propelled court-ordered regulations of the food industry to the doorstep of the Indian government, where they have languished. They have outsized importance in India, population 1.3 billion, because its people are far more likely to develop diabetes - which can lead to heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations - as they gain weight than people from other regions, according to health experts.Since 1990, the percent of children and adults in India who are overweight or obese has almost tripled to 18.8% from 6.4%, according to data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The International Diabetes Federation projects that the number of Indians with diabetes will soar to 123 million by 2040 as diets rich in carbohydrates and fat spread to less affluent rural areas. ""We are sitting on a volcano,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of a diabetes hospital at Fortis Healthcare, one of India's biggest private hospital chains.In the years since the court ordered the government to develop guidelines to regulate junk food, the case has encountered ferocious opposition from the All India Food Processors Association, which counts Coca-Cola India, PepsiCo India and Nestl India as members, as well as hundreds of other companies.Subodh Jindal, president of the association, said in an interview that junk food was unfairly blamed for diabetes and obesity. It was overeating, not the food itself, that has caused the problem, he said. The government this year took a significant step that public health experts believe will help combat the rise of obesity. It partially implemented a tax on sugar sweetened beverages, instituting a 40% tax on such drinks that are carbonated, though not on juices made with added sugars that many children drink.But so far, the regulations to ban sales near schools sought by the court in Verma's case have led to naught. As the case has played out on Twitter and in newspapers, some schools have voluntarily stopped serving junk food.Verma, 42, quit his job as a corporate marketing executive after his son's birth in 2006 and set up a foundation in 2007 to help families like his with sick children. At one point, though, Verma begged the judge to let him withdraw the petition.But Chief Justice Dipak Misra refused. Instead, spotting a senior advocate, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, in the courtroom, the judge ordered him to act as the pro bono lawyer for Verma's case. As Kaul, 54, approached the bench, he recalled, he joked to the judge, ""You've got the wrong guy. I like junk food.""Scientists searched for genes that predisposed Indians to diabetes, but did not find them. Instead, a growing body of research suggests that Indians' body type - one that is smaller but with more abdominal fat - may be responsible.Being born to a malnourished woman - a common phenomenon in India - may also increase the odds of developing diabetes.Dr Chittaranjan Yajnik, a diabetes specialist, and Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, are among the researchers exploring a theory that Indians evolved what Yajnik has called ""a thin-fat"" body type over millenniums as a way to survive famines when monsoons failed.In the 1990s, Yajnik began following the pregnancies of hundreds of women in villages outside Pune, a city in western India, and tested their offspring as they grew up.Compared with infants in Britain, Indian newborns were about 1.5 pounds lighter but had more abdominal fat and higher levels of certain hormones in their cord blood, he found, suggesting a predisposition to diabetes.Yajnik said he believes Indians' susceptibility to diabetes may have emerged as their diets changed with rising affluence - and that their bodies, attuned to scarcity, couldn't handle an overload of food. Although obesity and overweight are far less prevalent in India (24%) than in Canada (60%), for example, adults there are just as likely to develop diabetes as in Canada, a New York Times analysis of data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found.Insatiable hungerIn the years since Verma filed his suit, sales of packaged foods have increased 138%; fast food 83%; and carbonated drinks 58%, according to Euromonitor International, the market research firm. Coca-Cola Co's chief executive James Quincey, in an interview earlier this year, said that he expected the Indian market to eventually become the company's third largest in sales, up from sixth.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the Indian market. They have also said they plan to increase their offerings of drinks with less sugar and more fruit.Sanjay Khajuria, a Nestl India spokesman, said the food processors association, which opposed Verma's case, had ""taken into account inputs received by the association from its members,"" and declined further comment. He also noted that the company has joined other companies in India to restrict advertising directed at children younger than 12 to products with a certain level of nutrients. A Coca-Cola spokesman referred questions on the lawsuit to the food association. PepsiCo India's vice president of sales, Harsh K. Rai, also declined to comment on the lawsuit. He said the company has stopped advertising to children 12 and younger.In early 2015, the food authority in the Health Ministry finally recommended regulations to the court, including some limitations on the sale of junk food around schools. The judge ordered the recommendations carried out within three months. Instead, the food authority appointed yet another committee.Agarwal, chief executive of the food authority, insisted his agency is finally ready to start adopting new rules early next year for labeling healthy food with a green light and those high in fat, sugar and salt with a red light. But he said taxing junk food and banning it around schools were long term goals. ""There is no point in confronting industry on these issues,"" he said.Verma was emphatic that someone needs to continue the fight; he is just not sure that someone is him. He is convinced the unending legal battle gave him high blood pressure.His former partner on the case, pro bono lawyer Kaul, said India needs more than Verma to make change happen. ""You need a movement to fight the inertia of the system,"" he said, sipping a can of Coke."

But how far should healthy eating stretch?A close relative of mine had some rigid ideas about eating certain types of food and believed that he had made the best choice, which became a habit over a period of time. After he got married, his wife cooked according to his taste and requirement and all went well until one day he complained of mouth ulcers.That day, lunch came with a special kind of greens to treat mouth ulcers, along with a detailed account of the hea lth benefits of the herb. Notwithstanding the unpleasant taste, he had to devour it to achieve the expected results! That was the beginning of his health capsule.Health problems of various degrees are common in every household, and he or the children would occasionally complain of stomach upset, sore throat, cold, etc. The lady of the house, keen on restoring the family's health, started her research on home remedies. She came up with a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices that were ""good for health"" and helped relieve many problems. She made the healthy eating strategy a routine, whether or not there was any issue!Bittergourd was cooked to check blood sugar. Banana stem, considered good for kidney stones, was used, while fried plantain and potato curry that were starchy and lead to gastric problems were avoided. As detoxifying agents, salads became a must. Since oily and fatty food raised bad cholesterol, steamed and boiled food was regularised. To maintain a stable BP and heart condition, a low-salt diet and use of garlic was introduced. Buttermilk/curd (Lacto bacilli) was compulsory after every meal to avoid stomach infections.To augment weight loss, vegetables with more water content like, cucumber, ash gourd and chow-chow made silent entry into the kitchen. Many other unfamiliar ""healthy vegetables"" became more familiar! Now, health mattered most than the taste! If someone had anattack of cold, the entire family was served pepper-jeera rasam!Oats pongal, millets idli and ragi dosa, occasional rice idli/dosa and cereals with low-fat milk were in the breakfast menu. A generous use of herbs and spices in every dish was incorporated for their special properties like healing, alleviating gastric problem, nausea, allergies and to serve as antacid.Evening snacks comprised a bowl of mixed fruits and nuts. Green tea was a forced favourite drink of the family. The entire range of ""healthy foods"" was stocked for the whole year. This revolution happened amid the initial, timid resentment from the rest of the family!During one of our visits to their house, we were baffled seeing him eat something which he had condemned as ""cattle feed"" long ago. Then he exclaimed, ""Every meal in this house is a medicine. I eat this for digestion and weight control. In this house we seldom eat 'tasty'... sorry 'unhealthy' food""!"

All we have to really do is kindly breathe, eat and excrete because most of our needs and jobs are taken care of by machines and the rest by electronics and the help we employ.Just when we are ushered into that idyllic world of doing nothing, there is an official declaration that most of the health problems of the present age stems from our sedentary lifestyles. So being the quintessential couch potato with matching chips alongside is no longer the most favourable position to be in. Those people who have pledged that they will not budge from their comfort zone for love or money will have to think again.These days, even momentarily opened doors and windows happen to be ushering in winged creatures which are mostly mosquitoes. They breeze in and hum around our ears, settle on the exposed portions of our bodies and merrily quaff on our life blood.As a rule, we humans do not resent the resultant itching or the sharing of half a drop of blood if it were not associated with a host of diseases. So we started using sprays, lights, coils and repellants with negligible results. Then, the brainier section of mankind invented the mosquito bat. All we have to do is place our thumbs on the button to activate the electrified battle-ready weapon and brandish it around ourselves and vanquish the bloodsuckers that dare to venture into our orbit. If we are lucky, our success is celebrated with some fireworks and we can slip back into indolence till the next beastly pest flies along.Initially, the conscientious Samaritans were hesitant to indulge in conscious ""himsa."" It took a few gurus and their disciples to use the implement in full public view to put across the message that the insects were probably wretched souls seeking liberation so that they could move on to higher planes. Then on, no one seems to have any compunction about using their bludgeons blissfully. On the contrary, they feel secure when they have one such racquet beside them.The users of the bats will vouch for the fact that their arms have been strengthened while protecting themselves from some dreadful diseases. More enterprising batsmen and women also manage to burn a few calories when they scout for victims in the vicinity of their homes. In fact, a couple of engineering students have started working on the sports model of the bat which can keep scores of hits and misses quite on the lines of Pokemon Go!Now that the power and position of the haloed bat has been established, the day is not far when the mosquito will be declared as an endangered species. True blue users of the bludgeon will understand that one of the sovereign duties of a desi is to safeguard the cesspools, potholes, garbage piles so that we have a never ending supply of offerings to the ubiquitous bats that each one of us possesses. After all, is it not our duty to protect our protector?"
5b2e966a9855b7264011649a,Interest rate hike in focus as inflation falls,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617559/interest-rate-hike-focus-inflation.html,2017-12-12,"Wholesale and retail inflation of 2.17% and 2.18%, respectively, in May makes a great headline for the government, leaving home makers happy too, but it also tells an underlying story of rotting onion, potatoes and other farm produce contributing a great deal to the nationwide crisis among farmers who are up in arms against the government, seeking loan waiver. Breaking it down, the Consumer Food Price Index has slipped into a deflation by 1.05% in May, 2017 from inflation of 7.47% in the same month a year ago. Further, segregation of the data shows nothing but distress being felt by farmers. Prices of vegetables year-on-year fell by 13.44% at the retail level while on a measure of the Wholesale Price Index, prices of veggies fell by over 18%. The situation for pulses growers is even worse with the sub- index falling sharply by close to 20%. With potato prices dropping by whopping 44%, the growers are in real crisis.Ironically, the rural stress has not come about because of drought or any other natural cause, but in a year of plentiful farm produce. Good monsoon last year and a similar weather outlook this year should normally bring smile on the faces of farmers. Instead, they are in distress. Whatever the government may claim about the ill-advised demonetisation, it too has left a trail of disruption in the farm mandis. While the loan waivers may win some reprieve to states, the solution lies elsewhere. The terms of trade must improve in favour of farmers and they cannot be left to the vagaries of the market which is distorted by the hoarders, middlemen and even the governments at times. The governments announce year after year increase in the Minimum Support Price, but makes no adequate arrangements for procurement with the result that the produce rots in the open in the mandis.On the other hand, with private sector operating at much below its existing capacity, the industrial output could grow by a modest 3.1% in April, telling a different story of distress. Indebtedness of large volume has not only been a problem for the borrow-ers but more for the public sector lenders which are not able to resolve the mess of the non-performing assets. Under such a scenario, the only option left is to drastically reduce the policy interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India with the CPI inflation slipping much below the target of 4%. Instead of making it an issue of one-upmanship and autonomy, the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI should see reason and go for a rate cut without any delay."

Pictures by Sudeshna BanerjeeShe came to CK Block, where her in-laws live as a joint family, as a new bride 24 years ago. Her brother-in-laws son Shashank, then just three years old, was devoted to her, because, among other reasons, Chachi was a fabulous cook.My school friends wanted to come home just for the food she would rustle up. She knew Marwari food and she would also make ravioli and risotto. She would cook Dum Pukht Biryani actually in a pot, says Shashank Agarwal of his aunt and now business partner Sarika Agarwal.The aunt-nephew duo started with a small health food joint as a franchisee for a year opposite Bengal Tennis Academy. But that did not work. People wanted a fulfiling meal. So they have now opened Studio Cafe at the same spot. Opening a cafe was always my dream. I told Shashank: Just give me a carpenter and a painter, I will do the rest. I purchased everything for the decor.Studio Cafe is a combination of a studio on the first floor and a cafe downstairs. The first floor is let out for parties for which the catering is done by the cafe. In the weekends, we host workshops, says Sarika.On the ground floor, the cafe is a 45-seater, part of which is designed to be let out separately. We have planned our menu like a delis, incorporating dishes from Continental, Thai and Chinese cuisine, says Shashank.A highlight of the food served is the option of avoiding flour in the list of ingredients used. Even our pizzas and pastas are wheat-based though we can make normal versions too in case a guest insists on it. Pizzas are all thin-crust.Similarly, their risottos are made with barley, oats or quinoa, instead of rice. Our Panini sandwiches are wheat-based too.In some dishes, she has given a Marwari touch. Our paneer fritters are wrapped with papad, Sarika smiles.Her teenaged son Krish loves parking himself at the joint when he is hungry after tennis lessons. He loves the mojitos, smoothies and hot chocolate that they make here, Sarika smiles. We also keep protein shakes for gym-goers and kids favourites like potato wedges.Why avoid wheat: Some experts believe that giving up not just gluten, but wheat altogether, could lead to weight loss and health benefits. Aside from some extra fiber, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is really little different, and often worse, than drinking a can of sugar-sweetened soda or eating a sugary candy bar, cardiologist William Davis writes in Wheat Belly.Dish of our pick: Chicken Malay Laksa, a thick gravy dish with a touch of lemongrass that is proof of its Far East origin. It has babycorn, broccoli, beans, zucchini and chicken underneath a forest of crisp rice noodles placed in a heap on top.Spot that caught our eye: A cosy alcove for two where a pair of lovers can snuggle. Not for plus-size individuals though."

But why this tangy chutney of indignation at the innovation? The masala dosa, after all, is a many-splendoured thing, one of Indias most inventive dishes, always metamorphosing into delicious new forms.Unlike, say, rice and daal, the masala dosa comes cloaked in the glamour of a thousand rumours. One urban legend says the masala dosa wasnt created in cosy homesteads at all but actually dished up in Udupi restaurants, where clever cooks used spare potato bhaji, folding this in a light, crisp, savoury crepe. This masala dosa was a huge hit; but it didnt stop at one chewy avataar. Constantly innovating, the masala dosa features in hundreds of variants, localising, specialising and targeting individual customers well before multinationals learnt how to spell idli; versions include the paneer dosa, khakhra dosa, cheese spread dosa, even mutton-fry masala dosas. There are ragi and oat dosas for health nuts  and there are pizza dosas for those who prefer taste over waist.Why be mealy-mouthed over meals evolving anyway? Modern gastronomy means mixing, blending, breaking rules and combining cuisines, dishing up a brave new world of food, from bacon ice-cream to vegetarian chicken, foie gras falafel to charcoal chocolate. The West may be loving fusion cooking now but India has been a master-chef at this for decades. Remember, we invented the dhokla pizza, tandoori momo, paneer enchilada, masala omlette sushi and that most brilliant of culinary creations, which even slides cheekily past a stony Great Wall  gobi Manchurian. A masala dosa makeover is just a cute starter for us.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The move is also expected to help farmers break the what-paddy cycle and take to growing vegetables.A study sponsored by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has found that the 69 FPOs in the state with 2,991 farmers as members have facilitated a shift towards crops without minimum support price (MSP). Twenty-nine more FPOs will be added in the ongoing financial year.The report makes out a case for integration of FPOs into the agriculture policy of the state by providing them agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) licenses.In the case of wheat, out of 74 sampled farmers, 73 continued to sell their produce directly even after FPOs were formed. However, out of 21 pea farmers, 11 switched to FPOs. For other vegetables (except tomato, potato and peas) too, half of the 20 sampled farmers shifted to FPOs.Not just that, eight other farmers who were growing other crops too shifted to growing vegetables on a part of their land and sold it through FPOs.

It depends on the functioning of each organisation. The FPO concept is yet to evolve to be really beneficial for marginal farmers. For instances, some FPOs are still relying on commission agents as licenses are still hard to come by, said Kiran Singh, a small farmer from Pathankot.However, the shift doesnt seem that easy as it turns out that even in case of matured FPOs, the area under cultivation of vegetables as well as sugarcane in kharif season was high but the farmers continued to sell all their produce directly.

The Jewish community in the city will be celebrating the festival of lights till December 20.The eight-day-long Jewish festival began by lighting the first candle of Hanukkiah on Tuesday evening.A prominent member of the Jewish community, Ezra Moses, said, The main part of the celebration is the lighting of the Hanukkiah candle, which has nine candles in it in the synagogue as well as at individual homes. We light one lamp along with the central head candle on each of the eight days. By the end of the week, all nine candles are lit.We spend the rest of the days in prayer and by feasting on sweets like halwas, doughnuts, custard and exchanging gifts. Some families even play games with dreidels and sing festive songs, he added.Speaking about the significance of the festival Moses, added, Over 3,000 years ago, the Romans had adulterated the pure olive oil used by the Jewish community in the synagogue in an attempt to force them to worship the king and other idols. The Jews found enough pure olive oil to burn their holy lamps for a day. This light, however, miraculously kept burning for eight days. The festival of lights commemorates this miracle that strengthened the faith of the community in our one God.While this is one of the two biggest festivals for the Jewish community across the world, it has a special significance for the community here as it marks the 138th anniversary of the only synagogue in the cityWith a population of 1,800 Jews, Thane has around 40% of the countrys Jewish community and the Gate of Heaven Synagogue was inaugurated during this festival over a century ago, which makes it special for us.

The MoU was signed by PEC director Prof Manoj K Arora and Agendra Kumar , president, ESRI India at PEC.The MoU aims at supporting government programs like smart cities, digital India and Clean Ganga, among others. Apart from the project and consultancy, the collaboration will work towards capacity building for geospatial technology. It also supports the vision and mission of PEC to become a centre of excellence in technical education and research.The future lies in the study of geospatial data. Due to unavailability of the expertise in the relevant field, the need for such a centre assumes greater significance, said Dr Arora. Agendra Kumar, president, ESRI India said it is working with colleges, universities and research institutes to build GIS capacity and address changing skill requirements and resource shortage.The ceremony was attended by deans, heads of departments and ESRI representatives.

Weather will remain dry the rest of the time.Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur at isolated places on December 13 and 14. Weather is likely to remain dry for the next two days. Maximum and minimum temperature is expected to hover between 16 and 21 degrees celsius and 5 to 12 degree celsius respectively. Maximum relative humidity is expected to remain between 78% and 90 % and minimum between 42% and 68 % during these days. Farmers sowing the gram crop are advised to use 36 kg seed per acre. They should treat the seed in termite-infested soil with Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) @ 10 ml per kg seed. Under December sowing, transplanting of gobhi sarson is more profitable than direct sowing, say experts. Farmers have also been advised to use 60-day old seedlings of gobhi sarson (GSL-1), 35-40 day old seedlings for gobhi sarson hybrid Hyola PAC 401 and 30-35 day old seedlings for GSC 6.As clear weather is expected during the next 3-4 days, wheat crop cv. PBW 658 and PBW 590 should be sown. Farmers are advised to spray weedicides. To control gulli danda weed, farmers are advised to spray leader, safal, Marksulfo 75 WG (sulfosulfuron) @ 13 g/acre in 150 litres of water.They are also advised to treat wheat seed with 13 ml Raxil Easy/Orius 6 FS by dissolving it in 400 ml water or 120 g Vitavax Power 75 WS or 80 g Vitavax 75 WP or 40 g Seedex 2 DS/Exzole 2 DS per 40 kg seed, using seed treatment drum to control loose smut and flag smut of wheat. Farmers have been warned against treating seed a month before sowing as it hampers germination.They should manage rodent pests in wheat crop sown with Happy Seeder by burrow baiting with 2% zinc phosphide twice at an interval of 10 to 15 days after sowing of crop (a week before or after irrigation) during this period. Farmers are also advised to spray magnesium sulphate in deficit soils where the wheat crop is 24 to 25 days old.They are advised to conduct regular surveillance of their fields for late blight of potato and if symptoms appear, spray the crop with Indofil M-45/Markzeb/Kavach @ 500-700 g in 250-350 litres of water per acre. For judicious use of pesticides, follow DSS for management of late blight of potato. If there is curling of leaves, farmers should uproot plants or damage infected plants. To control rust in pea, spray 500 g of Indofil M-45 in 200 litres of water. It is the optimum time for transplanting of nursery of tomato and brinjal and sowing of European varieties of radish, turnip and carrot should also be completed.Its time to protect fruit plants, particularly young ones, from low temperature and prepare thatches on young fruit plants. Ensure irrigation to ber trees as fruit is in developmental stage. Spray Karathane (0.5ml) or Bayleton (0.5 g) or Wettable Sulphur (2.5 g) per litre water to check powdery mildew in ber. To check physiological fruit drop in ber, spray Naphthlene Acetic Acid (NAA) @ 15g per 500 litres of water per acre. Dissolve NAA in alcohol before mixing in water.New-born calves need special care in the cold as they are susceptible to pneumonia. They should be fed well-chaffed berseem mixed with wheat straw to avoid tympany (Aphara). Do not feed parali (rice straw) alone to animals because it is rich in silica and causes diarrhoea.

The delay in sowing, along with a projected drop in the total acreage of potato this season, may lead to a supply crunch because the new variety is likely to reach the market earliest by March, instead of February. The notun aloo selling in the retail market now at Rs 25-30 a kilo are those from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Potato grower Chandranath Jana from Bankuras Jaipur said: I took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the rural cooperative to cultivate the tuber on a bigha (one-third acre) of land. The saplings have now all gone under water. The cooperative wont sanction loans unless I repay the earlier one and I now have to borrow from elsewhere to sow the seeds.A rough calculation of the input costs (seeds and fertilizer) and labour shows that a farmer needs Rs 10,000-12,000 per bigha to grow the tuber  costlier than sowing paddy. Yet, farmers took the potato route after incurring loss in the aman paddy because a substantial part of the crop was wasted while harvesting during the downpour. The damage of the early variety of potato will affect the sowing of the regular variety, particularly in the areas of Chandrakona and Garbeta in West Midnapore, Jaipur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur in Bankura, and Jabalpur and Kalna in Burdwan.However, these are only a portion of the areas that cultivate the early variety. Many farmers in Hooghly and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur didnt go for the early variety sowing after the November rain. The untimely rain has damaged the crop in parts of the entire 4.25 lakh hectares. It didnt have any major effect in Hooghly, which alone produces one-third of the crop. However, the sudden rise in minimum temperature will delay the sowing of the regular variety (jyoti). If it persists, the total acreage of the tuber may fall by 25,000-40,000 hectares this season. Potato needs the chill by December-January for better productivity, said Pradip Majumdar, agro-expert and adviser to the chief minister.The saving grace for consumers is the 17.5 lakh tonnes of potato available in cold storages that can feed Bengal of 5 lakh tonnes a month for the next three months, till the new crop arrives in March. Patitpaban De of the West Bengal Cold Storage Owners Association said the monthly output from Bengal was 7 lakh tonnes. Des claim puts a question mark on the steady supply from cold storages till March, leaving a gap of 15 to 20 days in February when people wont buy the last lot of the stored tuber while the new crop will take some more time to reach the market. Potato, thus, may get expensive for a fortnight at the end of February. But Bengal farmers wont be able to make the fast money. Instead, potato traders from Jalandhar and Amritsar in Punjab, and Farukabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh are likely to take advantage of the supply crunch."

""The next day, a statement was made that Modi is 'neech'.""The charge of a Pakistan hand in allegedly destabilising or influencing the election takes the bitterly fought election to a new low afterwith his ""neech"" reference to Modi and the PM's call to voters to avenge the insult.The alleged meeting between Pakistani leaders saw Modi attack Congress in what came across as a bid to play the polarising card by sticking a ""pro-Pak"" label on Congress.Modi said the 'secret meeting' lasted three hours. ""This is an issue of serious concern. We suffer a lot due to Pakistan's actions, and you (the Congress) conducted meetings behind closed doors?"" Modi said. ""You should've had an official of the Government of India in the meeting, and informed the government about what transpired."" He had earlier accused Rahul Gandhi of ""hugging"" the Chinese ambassador at the height of the Doklam stand off.Modi called Aiyar's comment ""an insult to the 125 crore people of India as well as to the post of the PM"". Aiyar was suspended from Congress following his comment. He later apologised for the remark.Earlier, Modi had said, ""One Congress youth leader Salman Nizami is campaigning for Rahul Gandhi... He said on Twitter that Rahul's father (Rajiv) and grandmother (Indira) had sacrificed their lives, while his great grandfather (Nehru) was a freedom fighter... Then he (Nizami) went on to ask that Modi should answer who were his father and mother. Do we use this language in public discourse? ""He called Indian armed forces rapists, and further said in his tweets that 'ghar ghar se Afzal niklega'. Do you want Afzal in every home?"" Modi asked.Modi urged people to vote for BJP and acknowledged that voters of this region did not support BJP during the previous assembly polls. ""In 2012, entire Gujarat was with Modi, but only these five assembly seats in Banaskantha did not remain with the BJP,"" he said. ""Are you not in anguish because of this? Don't you want to settle the score this time?"" Hinting at Dalit rights activist Jignesh Mevani's independent candidature supported by Congress, Modi said, ""In these five assembly seats, whether there are Congress candidates or any dubious person brought in by them, I want to win in all polling booths.""Modi lampooned Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi saying, ""You people know that potatoes are cultivated in farms with hard labour, but that fellow says potatoes are grown in factories. Bring him here and make him understand that potato farming requires hard labour."" ""Earlier, would there not be curfew during Ganesh festivities, Ram Navami and Uttarayan? But now don't Hindus and Muslims do businesses together?"" said Modi."
5b50c3ff9855b708a7ccd15a,Congress members held secret meeting with Pakistan envoy at Aiyar's house: PM Modi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-held-secret-meeting-with-pakistan-envoy-at-aiyars-house-pm-modi/articleshow/62008252.cms,2017-12-10,"AHMEDABAD: Unleashing a scathing attack at the opposition during a poll campaign in Palanpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday claimed that Congress leaders had held a secret meeting with Pakistani envoy and foreign minister of the neighbouring country before Mani Shankar Aiyar had called him a neech"" person.PM Modi also questioned why a former Pakistan army director general insisted on making Ahmed Patel, political advisor of Congress president Sonia, as the chief minister of Gujarat.You people must have read the newspaper about the incident at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. It was an issue of hot debate in newspapers and media yesterday that a meeting between former Pakistan high commissioner, former minister of external affairs of Pakistan, former vice president Hamid Ansari and former PM Manmohan Singh was held at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. The meeting had run for three hours and the next day he called me ""Neech (low-born), the prime minister said.This is an issue of serious concern that when Pakistan has become a sensitive issue for the country then what was the reason to hold a secret meeting with Pakistan when the polls are being held in Gujarat. Former director general of Pakistan army Arshad Rafiq has insisted that Ahmed Patel should be made CM of Gujarat. Former army director general intervenes in Gujarat election. They held meeting with Pakistanis at Mani Shankars house and on the very next day of that meeting, Gujarat, backward community of Gujarat, Modi and poor people of Gujarat were insulted. Is it not an issue of concern for the country? Congress must answer what suspicious activities they are doing. They must answer the country, added Modi.PM Modi, who had to cut short his speech due to bad throat apologised before the public and affirmed that he would return soon to talk to the people of Palanpur. The prime minister was campaigning for BJP candidates: Lalji Prajapati from Palanpur, Mavji Desai from Dhanera, Shashikant Pandya from Deesa, Mavjibhai from Danta and Vijay Chakravarti from Vadgam.He asserted that the BJP had been defeated only in these five seats of North Gujarat in 2012 state assembly polls and asked the people to not only win the constituencies but also each and every polling booths.In 2012, entire Gujarat was with Modi, but only these five assembly seats in Banaskantha did not remain with the BJP. Are you in aguish with that or not? Do you want to settle the score this time or not? In these five assembly seats, whether there are Congress candidates or any devious person whoever is brought by them, I want to win all the polling booths in these seats. I want that the lotus must bloom (BJP symbol) in all the polling booths. If lotus blooms in all the polling booths then no power of the world can defeat the BJP, said Modi.Taking a jibe at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi , PM Modi said, This region, which was infamous for its dust-storm, has now become famous in the entire country for its potato cultivation. You people know potatoes are cultivated in farms with hard labour in farms, but that fellow (Rahul Gandhi) says potatoes are grown in factories. Bring him here and make him understand that potatoes farming need hard labour.""When you shout Modi..Modi who do you see- the Prime Minister or Aapna Narendrabhai (our Narendra bhai). If you see Aapna Narendra bhai, that it means you still remember me and if you see the Prime Minister, then it means I am forgotten. I am fortunate that wherever I go for the poll campaign in Gujarat, people feel that Aapna Narendrabhai is here not the Prime Minister, PM Modi added."
