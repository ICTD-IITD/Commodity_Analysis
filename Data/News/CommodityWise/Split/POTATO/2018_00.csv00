Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."

The district faced acute shortage of potatoes during October and December last year.The cold storage, which is run by Cooperative Society of Jagatsinghpur, is lying defunct since the last 20 years. Another private one at Raghunathpur has been closed due to the financial crisis, leaving the district with no cold storage at all.Earlier, the district administration had proposed the State Planning Board to renovate the cold storages on Public Private Partnership mode. However, nothing had been done in this regard so far.In such a scenario, the skyrocketing prices of potato would continue to affect the kitchens of commoners in the district, experts opined.Besides the man-made factors, the crops cultivation has also been hindered by natural challenges. Prevalence of low-lying areas in the region and untimely rains, which delayed paddy cultivation, have also affected the crop.On the other hand, farmers alleged that they were deprived of subsidies for growing potatoes on Government lands, including river beds. They insisted that potato crop fails to reap profit for them. Some of the cultivators are even planning to give up potato farming.The department had requested for 150 quintals of potato seeds. But we have received only 130.5 quintals so far. Despite announcing a subsidy of `15,000 per acre to each farmer, the latter are reluctant to cultivate potato, Assistant Director, Horticulture Mihir Samantray, said."

Subash, who is into vegetable cultivation for the last 34 years, has made farming a lucrative affair and is reaping a profit of Rs 3.95 lakh per annum.Subash, who has studied up to Class X, started vegetable cultivation at an age of 29. His started with cultivation of pointed gourd (potal) and cabbage over about 2.5 acres of land. Before he ventured into farming, his father Seshadeb was solely concentrating on paddy cultivation. Subash took up vegetable cultivation after being informed that it offers good return.The 63-year-old now grows bitter gourd, pointed gourd, French beans and potato over 4.75 acres besides cabbage, cauliflower, cowpea and bottle gourd over 0.75 acres. Altogether, he cultivates vegetables over 5.5 acres of land and earns around Rs 3.95 lakh per year.Subash said he earns around Rs 50,000 annually from bitter gourd cultivation over half an acre and another Rs 1 lakh by growing pointed gourd over 1.5 acres. Similarly, he cultivates French beans over one acre and earns a profit of about Rs 70,000. He also gets around Rs 1 lakh from potato over 1.75 acres and about Rs 75,000 from cultivation of cabbage, cauliflower, cowpea and bottle gourd over 0.75 acre.I have planned to replace cultivation of potato with pumpkin over 1.75 acres of land due to distress sale and lack of cold storage, Subash said. He expects to earn around Rs 1.5 lakhs from pumpkin cultivation.This farm success has been possible only because of availability of proper get irrigation from Bargarh Main Canal under Hirakud Dam Project, he said. This apart, Subash has also excavated a dug well on his farm land.Subash said he faces no problem in selling his yield as traders visit his village regularly to procure his produce. I have never felt the need of a job and am satisfied with farming, he said. His son Trishakti is equally keen on continuing with vegetable farming and even lends a helping hand to him in the fields, he added."

Though the committee was supposed to submit the report in the next session of the Assembly last year, it has failed to do that, Mishra said.The delay in submission of the report proved that the State Government, which has been refusing to admit farmers suicide in the State, is trying to bury the matter, Mishra said and dared the ruling party to table the report to prove the Opposition wrong.As Bagartis suicide rocked the budget session of the Assembly in 2017, the Speaker had ordered the Standing Committee-II of Agriculture Department to probe the matter and submit a report in the next session.The Speakers ruling came after a logjam of the House for six days with the Opposition Congress and BJP demanding House Committee probe into Bagartis death. Though Bagarti allegedly committed suicide by consuming pesticides on February 26, 2017, Agriculture Minister Pradip Maharathy had told the House that the Bargarh farmer ended his life over family dispute.The issue cropped up during discussion on demand for grants of the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department.Coming down heavily on the Government for its failure to keep the promise to create irrigation potential for at least 35 per cent of the agricultural land in each block, Mishra said the Government is trying to mislead the people by providing figures manufactured by officers.While the Minister avoided most of the questions raised by Opposition members, he, however, claimed that the State has made significant improvement in production and productivity of food grains for which it has been receiving Krishi Karman Award from the Centre consecutively for the last four years.Maharathy, however, admitted that the Potato Mission failed to achieve desired result due to adverse market conditions.Excise duty up 28 times in 19 yearsBhubaneswar: Excise revenue has increased 28 times in Odisha during the last 19 years. Excise Minister Sashi Bhusan Behera informed this in the Assembly in a written reply to a question from Dillip Ray (BJP).The Minister said excise revenue which was Rs 135.35 crore in 2000-01, reached Rs 2786.23 crore in 2016-17. While a target was fixed to collect excise revenue of Rs 3,600 crore in 2017-18, the collection was Rs 3,221 crore, he said and added that a target of Rs 3,800 crore has been set for 2018-19.The Minister said there were 4303 licenced liquor shops in the State in 2017-18 of which 1157 were off shops and 531 were on shops, he said."

(Source: Reuters) Juventus Gianluigi Buffon and teammates remonstrate with referee Michael Oliver after he awarded a penalty to Real Madrid. (Source: Reuters)Juventus is still fuming over the penalty that resulted in its elimination from the Champions League, with club president Andrea Agnelli calling for the removal of UEFA chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina.The designator should be changed every three or five years, Agnelli said, suggesting that since Collina is Italian he overcompensates by making impartial designations for matches featuring Serie A clubs.A designator with that much responsibility should be changed every three years to avoid this presumption, considering his nationality, Agnelli added.English referee Michael Oliver called the penalty in the third and final minute of stoppage time, leading to Cristiano Ronaldos goal that meant Real Madrid advanced to the semifinals on 4-3 aggregate despite a 3-1 loss in Wednesdays second leg.Juventus defender Medhi Benatia was penalized for trying to keep Lucas Vazquez from scoring after Ronaldo headed down a ball back toward the area. Benatia came from behind Vazquez and appeared to push the forward while making a move for the ball.Agnelli, who is also president of the European Club Association, demanded that UEFA install the video assistant referee (VAR) for the Champions League.Weve got the technology to avoid these mistakes, Agnelli said. UEFA isnt against the VAR, it just has a technical problem that needs to be resolved. If the problem is instructing the referees from all of the federations then lets take some of them aside and set up a quick course.It was a departure from Agnellis comments at last months ECA congress in Rome.We must respect UEFAs timing on this matter as they have to train the referees to assist the video referees, Agnelli said then, adding that he was confident the VAR would be introduced for the 2019-20 season.Collina, who joined UEFA in 2010, is also running FIFAs program for referees at the World Cup, where the VAR will make its tournament debut. The VAR is also used in Serie A.UEFA had no comment over Agnellis words. Juventus, it should be remembered, was at the heart of the 2006 Calciopoli refereeing scandal, when it was uncovered that the club influenced the Italian leagues referee selectors.The Turin club was stripped of two Serie A titles due to the scandal and relegated to Serie B.When the penalty on Benatia was called, Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini started waving his fingers as if he were holding bills of money at Madrid counterpart Raphael Varane, seemingly suggesting that Madrid had paid someone to influence the match.Meanwhile, Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon, playing in what was likely his last European match, was sent off for vehement protests during which he lightly bumped the referee.You cant be cynical enough to destroy a squads dream, Buffon said. You cant try and be the protagonist just because you dont have the personality to make it on a stage like this one.If you dont have personality stay in the tribune with your wife and eat potato chips. To do this, to ruin an achievement, you must have a garbage bin in place of a heart.Juventus also appeared upset that Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was permitted to watch the match from near the sideline despite being suspended.The referee didnt understand anything, said Agnelli, who was also on the touchline at the final whistle.The penalty was taken eight minutes into stoppage time as it took Oliver a while to clear the protesting Juventus players.Agnelli was asked if Oliver, who is 33, was too young to handle such a big match.I became president of Juventus at that age, Agnelli said. The referee is a quality one but tonight he got confused.Buffon, who said he would retire this season unless Juventus won the Champions League, embraced Ronaldo before he left the field.Real deserved to advance. I want to complement them, Buffon said. Its always an honor to face them but we also deserved at least to go to extra time.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

However, the cold stores are yet to become popular among horticulture farmers.Absence of cold storage facilities had been a major headache for horticulture farmers of the district not long back. The private cold storage of 1,500 tonnes capacity at Rourkela was the last option for farmers two years back as the other two Government-owned stores in Kuanrmunda and Lahunipara blocks had been closed.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu informed that a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes has become functional in Bargaon block from 2016-end while another private store, having the same capacity, started operation from April last year in Bonai block.The Governments estimated cost for a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes is about `4 crore. Each of the private store promoters has been given a subsidy of `2.80 crore along with heavy incentives on energy bills for a period of six years, Sahu said.Another private cold storage of 5,000 tonnes capacity is also coming up at Sankara near Sundargarh town with support from National Horticulture Board of the Central Government, he said and added that farmers are being charged `160 to `170 per quintal for a season from March to November.Besides, a cold store of 10 tonnes has already been completed at Rajgangpur while two pre-cooling chambers of combined capacities of 16 tonnes are under construction at Sadar and Hemir blocks. These facilities would be beneficial to preserve thin skin vegetables for a short period of 15 days. Similarly, thick skin vegetables can be preserved for 45 days in the chambers, Sahu informed.However, farmers are not fully aware of the new cold storage facilities and are being informed to use them, Sahu added.Incidentally, the two cooling chambers with combined capacity of 45 tonnes, which were constructed in Nuagaon block four years back, are yet to be made functional. Similarly, a 10-tonne capacity chamber in Bisra block meant for BPL farmers is yet to operate. Sahu said initially, power supply issue was the reason for the delay in operation and now, there are management problems among local villagers.Administrative sources said that the upcoming Wholesale Market Yard project of Regulated Market Committee, with an estimated cost of about `98.5 crore, would also have a mega cold storage facility which would benefit horticulture farmers of the entire Panposh sub-division, including leading horticulture producers of Nuagaon block.Bonai Assistant Director of Horticulture Sanjeev Mahanta said with availability of cold storage facilities, farmers of the potato cultivation belt of Ruguda, Jangla, Badgogua, Kello, Kuliposh, Kariadihi and other pockets would be encouraged to revive cultivation of tuber crop."

Two persons have been arrested so far.ADG (Narcotics) Varun Kapoor said, Use of codine laced cough syrup is prevalent in the North East, where it is used as a substitute for hard drugs, but this is the first time that we have come to know that Madhya Pradesh and especially Indore has become the transportation hub for these drugs.Officials said they seized these bottles from a truck being used for transporting the bottles and also from a godown in Lasudia area of Indore where it had been stored. These syrups had been sourced from a factory in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, then stored in the godown in Indore, from where it was being transported to North East.The cough syrups had been cleverly hidden behind sacks of onion and potato in the truck seized by the narcotics wing on April 9. Initially the police arrested the truck driver Mohanlal Pathak (54) resident of Indore. On the basis of information provided by him, police arrested Ranjan Shukla (29) also resident of Indore, who had loaded the truck from the godown. However, another crucial link, Manish Bhaskar, owner of Anmol Medical Store, who had rented the godown in his name is absconding.ADG Kapoor says that the investigations are still in a preliminary stage, but from the interrogation of the two accused we have come to know that smuggling had been going on for the past two years from Indore which is a major pharmaceutical manufacturing and transportation hub."

The loan was waived after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government announced a debt redemption scheme for farmers last year.Actually, only Rs 74,000 was waived against the declared sum of Rs 1 lakh, said a dejected Kumar, who owns eight bighas (1.3 hectares) of crop land.In 2014, third-generation marginal farmers Vijay Mishra and brother Ashok took a loan of Rs 1.25 lakh through the Kisan Credit Card to grow potato and paddy in Samri Majra Baihrana village under Kaudihar block, 35km from Allahabad.But their crops got destroyed, first by drought and then by hailstorms. I was saddled with a loan and an interest of Rs 1.85 lakh. I was relying desperately on a waiver to survive. But after waiting for months, just Rs 65,000 got waived, the 38-year-old Vijay said.Today, I have over Rs 1 lakh to repay and the bank is putting pressure.These two cases reflect the shortcomings in the Yogi Adityanath governments loan-waiver scheme for farmers, a promise the BJP made before the 2017 assembly polls.The party won the elections with absolute majority. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived , the partys poll manifesto had said.The government of this cash-strapped state has spent around Rs 21,000 crore on this scheme, benefitting 3.3 million debtridden farmers.UP farmers in a precarious situation 1.80 crore estimated agriculture households are there in Uttar Pradesh and 43.8% of them are in debt 23.2% of farm households in Uttar Pradesh live below the poverty line, against the national average of 22.5%. UP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest in India.  The expenditures of UPs farmers are more than their earnings. The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4,923 against their monthly expenditure of Rs 6,230. In 2012, the farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18,059 and spent Rs 13,311, saving Rs 4,748 a month  Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectares in Punjab and 1.68 hectares in Haryana. 17.45% is UPs total share in the countrys food production, which is the highest estimated agriculture households are there in Uttar Pradesh andof them are in debtof farm households in Uttar Pradesh live below the poverty line, against the national average ofUP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest in India.The expenditures of UPs farmers are more than their earnings.

We had asked the farmers to give applications if they have been left out. We will verify the claims of lakhs of farmers and waive loans of those eligible in accordance with the rules, he promised.But the snags are drawing more critics than admirers to this well-intentioned scheme. The government is accused of keeping its promise by putting a number of riders for farmers seeking their loans to be written off.The government fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived and that, too, only against one loan account.Initially, the number of farmers to be benefitted after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore was put at around 7 million.The number was almost halved eventually.In Allahabad district, around 82,000 farmers were identified as eligible for the loan waiver. However, after three rounds of verification, only 49,600 farmers benefited with a total loan waiver of Rs 275 crore. The remaining 32,300 farmers had to repay their loans, lawyer and RTI activist Anand Mohan said.The loan-waiver scheme, Anand Mohan said, should have been implemented in a better way.Not only was the promise watered down, the execution was marred by criticism and controversies when it was found that many farmers received loan-waiver cheques of as low as Re 1 or even less.According to agriculture minister Shahi, loan waiver is not a solution to rural distress.We are working on different fronts simultaneously to double farmers income by 2022 as a lasting solution to the problem, he said, reminding critics that they should not forget that this government has the mandate for five years to work for the farmers.The criticism is not coming only from the BJPs rivals.The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers outfit affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological mentor, is unhappy as well.The bureaucracy messed it up by attaching too many riders, said Ram Chelaji, the Kisan Sanghs state organisation secretary.He pointed to the BJPs loss in the Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypolls in March and said the government should act fast to address the problems of disenchanted farmers.The disenchantment is difficult to ignore in a state in which 43.8% of its farmers are in debt. The government now stands hostage to a promise it made in the run-up to the polls."

So have many farmers like him. The reason: constant attack by wild animals.Some have switched to cultivating alternative crops like tea to save their crops and continue their livelihood.The menace has put at stake the Pawan Chamling governments ambitious mission of switching to organically farmed products completely by March 31 in the state.This means there would be a stoppage on the trade of items not produced organically, from other states and countries, in Sikkims markets.Started in 2016, the tiny Himalayan states organic mission had won it accolades from around the world.But to meet its objective by the deadline, the state has to produce vegetable and fruits organically in sufficient quantities to ensure there is no shortage in the markets.The state already has 76,000 hectares of certified organic farming land. Sikkim produced about 80,000 tonnes of vegetables in 2017. This has to increase in the near future to cater to the need of the states more than 6 lakh people and 14 lakh tourists visiting the state every year, said agriculture minister, Somnath Poudyal.Desperate to salvage his mission, Chamling assured farmers that they would not face punishment if they kill wild animals to protect their crops.People can chase away wild animals that enter farms to damage crops, or to eat goats and chicken. They can chase away animals using stones, sticks or weapons. No legal action would be taken if the wild animal is killed in the process. It will be treated as accidental death, Chamling had said on March 10 in the state assembly.Chamling also directed the forest department to issue an executive order immediately.The wild animals named by the chief minister are cheetah, leopard, wild boar, monkey, bear, porcupine, rats, jackal, wild cat.Farmers have the rights to protect their produce, said Poudyal, who is also the animal husbandry minister, adding that the ban on the entry of non-organic produce would be strictly implemented from March 31.The government has also been encouraging youths to take up organic farming.But the state, which has about 50,000 farmers, has seen about 25% quitting over a couple of years, according to an official in state agriculture department.One of the factors contributing to the farmers turning away from agriculture is the increase in the population of wild animals, which can be attributed to the governments ban on hunting in forests in 1999.According to Sarala Khaling, regional director, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment for north-east India, Villages located near forests in the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalayas are most vulnerable to crop depredation by wildlife.But there is hardly any region in Sikkim where agricultural activities do not experience attacks by marauding wild animals.Farmers of Daramdin constituency in West Sikkim have expressed their helplessness to protect their potato harvest from wild boars.At Parakar village near Pakyong in east Sikkim, many farmers have either stopped cultivating altogether or have shifted to tea cultivation, due to fear of wild animals.People moving into forests to collect edible flowers, roots and fruits are also responsible in drawing wild animals out of the forests into farmlands.Chamling has said that the government will restrict people from moving into the forests to tap what animals can eat in their natural habitat.If this continues, I doubt whether the state governments organic mission would succeed, said Balkrishna Sharma, a marginal farmer near Pakyong in east Sikkim."

Meanwhile, retailers in the city demanded that bags and packages used to maintain the quality and freshness of cereals, pulses, fruits and breads not be banned as they are used as protective material.Environment minister Ramdas Kadam said apart from the government traders and shopkeepers will also have a key responsibility in implementation.We have given adequate time of three months to traders, manufacturers and stockists for the existing stock by issuing a notification in January, he said.Facing uproar from manufacturers, the state government may extend the deadline for plastic disposal. Civic authorities will certify if a manufacturer has disposed of the stock within a stipulated time. Though they are expected to dispose it in a month, additional time will be given after deliberation by the high power committee and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, said Kadam.The government has clarified that according to the rules stakeholders have to set up a mechanism to recycle water bottles and milk bags.Manufacturing associations have slammed the government for allowing plastic containers of potato chips and tetrapacks for eatables manufactured by multinational companies. Multi-layered plastic packs used to package potato chips is not banned. Similarly, bags for pulses and cereals have been excluded from the ban. This is discriminatory and harmful to small businesses, said Ravi Jasnani, president of Maharashtra Plastic Manufacturers Association.The Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA), while welcoming the ban, has demanded to exclude bags that are integral part of packaging from the ban. Federations president Viren Shah, in a letter to the chief minister, said, Bags used to maintain the quality and freshness of cereals, pulses, fruits, breads should not be banned as they are used to protect the material.Ramdas Kadam said primary packaging has not been banned. The fear of rise in unemployment or loss of business was blown out of proportion as 80% of the plastic consumed in Maharashtra is manufactured in other states, he said. Three months ago, we had given a notice to these manufacturers to switch to other business and dispose of their stock, he said.Your home delivery food may cost moreThe plastic ban may reduce environmental destruction and clogging of drains, but your bill for home-delivered food is likely to rise.The government notification on Friday, which has banned one-time use plastic containers, has put home delivery businesses in a soup.Most restaurants that deliver food use banned disposable plastic containers. Restauranters admitted that this is the easiest and safest way to carry food, especially liquid items such as curries and soups.These containers are available in the wholesale market at Rs5 a dozen or more based on the quality.With the ban in force, restaurant owners are scrambling to find alternatives, which, they said, may not be cost effective.Santosh Shetty, president of Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR), said, As the notification was issued just a day ago, we have not got enough time to think about items that can replace plastic containers. Alternative items will be more costly, so we will have to charge for packaging.According to restauranters, the current cost of packaging is between Rs2 and Rs10 per delivery. A restauranter from Fort said, I charge my customers Re1 per container. Each dish is priced between Rs50 and Rs150. I fear I will lose business if I begin to charge customers more money for delivery. For most restaurants, free home delivery is one of their unique selling points.Dilip Datwani, president of Hotel & Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, We can use tin foil for most deliveries or paper bags for dry items. The problem will occur with soups. We may have to stop delivering soups and juice altogether, or come up with a viable option.Nafisa Jr, chief marketing officer of The Bohri Kitchen, said, We are yet to find an alternative that is cost effective. After we study cost implications of alternatives, we will decide whether to pass on the burden to customers or not.Restaurant owners associations have decided to try other options for a month. Shetty said, If it is not cost effective, we will approach the state and ask it to relax norms."

(AP Photo)The trouble-free Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket final, held in Karachi on Sunday amid a festival atmosphere, has reignited calls for foreign national teams to look past security concerns and play regular cricket in Pakistan.The South Asian nation has largely been starved of international cricket since the 2009 attack on a bus ferrying Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore which killed eight Pakistanis as well as wounding six players and a British coach.Pakistans biggest city ground to a halt for several hours on Sunday as fans packed restaurants and cafes to watch Islamabad United defeat defending champion Peshawar Zalmi by three wickets after being set a 148-9 target.This is a very big historic occasion, Najam Sethi, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman told fans in the stadium just before the culmination of the Twenty20 league started.You have filled this stadium and shown the world that we are ready for the return of the international cricket.In its third year, the PSL has become a phenomenal success in the cricket-obsessed nation of 208 million but security concerns mean many of the group games and Pakistans international test matches are played in the Middle East.Ahead of Sundays final, the first major cricket event in Karachi since the Sri Lanka bus attack, key roads leading to the stadium were closed and checkpoints erected amid tight security.Despite temperatures soaring to 38 degrees Celsius, many fans queued for hours to get into the stadium early to catch a glimpse of the local and foreign players whose popularity has soared in the run up to the final.We are happy on return of international cricket to Karachi, said Ahmed Alam, 20, an engineering university student on his way to the stadium clutching bottles of chilled water and packets of potato snacks.Cricket was unjustly kept away from Karachi for so long. Such matches could be held here much before.Windies SeriesPakistans Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the successful hosting of the PSL final was a victory of the entire nation.Pakistani officials are keen to repair the countrys image and reassure sceptical foreign nations, especially the more reluctant Western countries, that security is now good enough host major events.Since the bus attack, Pakistan has hosted Zimbabwe, a World XI, and a Sri Lanka team for limited overs matches, all at Lahores Gaddafi Stadium.Pakistan also received a further boost earlier this month when West Indies agreed to play a three-match Twenty20 series in Karachi in the first week of April.I am looking forward to playing more cricket here, I have enjoyed it, Darren Sammy, a West Indies cricketer and Peshawar Zalmi captain, told local Geo Super TV channel after the game.The fans are excited at the prospect of more cricket inside Pakistan.West Indies three matches at Karachi next month truly heralds the return of international cricket to Pakistan, added Alam, the student.

Last year had also seen a hike of allocation of 66% over the last budget of the SAD-BJP regime. This means that since assuming power, the Congress government has increased the allocation to agriculture by 131%.The government has also taken note of the perceived snub from the Niti Aayog and has provided for allied activities. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badals speech mentioned horticulture, floriculture, sugarcane, marketing of agricultural products, animal husbandry, fisheries, dairy development, piggery, goat rearing and even cattle-feed.The union government, despite our repeated requests, has failed to come to the rescue of the Anndata (farmer). Our policy shall be centred only and only on welfare of our farmers, he said.Funds for allied activities Rs 100 crore  Crop residue managementRs 10 crore  Buffalo Research Centre, PattiRs 42 crore  Edibile oil refinery at KhannaRs 13 crore  Cattle feed plant at KapurthalaRs 4,250 cr for debt waiverThe allocation includes Rs 4,250 crore for waiving off debt to small and marginal farmers. Manpreet added the government was still to get a list of eligible beneficiaries from commercial banks, and if complete database reached the government, he would top-up the scheme.Our slogan for farmers this year is, Khushhal Kisan, Pragatisheel Naujwan (Prosperous farmers, progressive youth). The CM has given this slogan. We will make efforts to achieve this, despite the empty coffers we inherited, the FM added. In his last budget speech, he was blunt, Akaal Naal Vaah (cultivate smartly).This year, Rs 6,256 crore has been earmarked for free power to the sector. In addition, a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, Rs 100 crore for disposal of crop residue and Rs 55 crore for horticulture.Horticulture to be key areaThe government plans to make efforts to break the wheat-paddy cycle. It targets assisting 7,000 farmers and bringing 10,000 acres cultivable area under diversification.There shall be special focus on horticulture, marketing of produce and food processing to ensure sustainability. An allocation of Rs 55 crore has been made under the National Horticulture Mission.Agriculture is a high-focus area. The CM, with 42 departments under him, is unable to do justice to it. There should a separate minister for agriculture, so that the cause of the peasantry gets full attention. Sukhpal Khaira, leader of oppositionDisease-free potato and other vegetable seeds produced at eight government potato and vegetable seed farms, 6.5 lakh fruit plants from 23 government fruit nurseries and registered private fruit nurseries and approximately 41,500 mushroom spawn bottles shall be provided to farmers.The government targets processing 80,000-kg fruit at six departmental fruit preservation laboratories.There are plans to spend Rs 750 crore on a special project to improve agricultural marketing infrastructure. Details were not revealed. No farm body or expert has come forward to offered a critical view of the allocation to agriculture.Opposition challenges pro-farmer claimClaiming that the state government had failed to disburse Rs 1,500 crore earmarked in last years budget for debt relief to farmers, the opposition parties, the SAD and the AAP, challenged Manpreets claims of being a pro-farmer government. They had promised to waive off entire Rs 90,000 crore debt on the state peasantry. Now, it is being done in a piecemeal manner. This is a failure of the government, said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal."

What is surprising is that the consumers are not protesting when the Government machinery has failed to control the soaring price by cracking down on unscrupulous traders, general secretary of Odisha Byabasai Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said. Since the Government is keeping a tab on the prices of essential commodities on daily basis, it is their look out to ensure that commodities are made available to the consumers at reasonable prices at retails points.The market intelligence wing of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has the responsibility to impose stock limits on onion and crack down on hoarding. But nothing is happening for obvious reasons, he rued.Ideally, onion should be sold at Rs 40 a kg in the retail market as a margin of Rs 5 per kg is enough for the retailers to make a good profit, said Shakti Shankar Mishra, seceratry of the Aeiginia Potato Merchants Association.The source price of onion, Nasik in Maharashtra being the major supplier of the vegetable, is ruling high due to shortfall in production in Andhra Pradesh and Karanatak, the two other States which also meet Odishas demand. The onion production has fallen short by 8 to 10 per cent due to unseasonal rains in major producing States including Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh. The production of the vegetable this year is about 22 million tonne as against 24 million tonne last year, Panda said adding, the prices will cool down after arrival of the new harvest.While the daily requirement of edible bulb in the State is about 1,500 tonnes, there is a short supply of about 200-300 tonnes. Bhubaneswar, one of the major mandis of the State, is getting a normal supply of about 150 tonne every day, Mishra said."

Kumar took the action after learning about the incident where a 4-year-old boy died after swallowing a toy that came along with a packet of potato chips in Andhra Pradeshs Eluru town. In October, another 4-year-old had choked to death in Kandivali area of Mumbai.Subsequently, the Prime Ministers Office directed the representation-cum-public grievance to the Hazardous Substances Management Division which is under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), for pursuing the matter.The division has written to the joint secretaries of ministry of health and family welfare and department of commerce (under the ministry of commerce and industry) as well as to the director of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for initiating action as appropriate. The January 4 letter, a copy of which is with HT, is signed by Amardeep Raju, a scientist at the division.Kumar, who is based in Dudhli village on Dehraduns outskirts, said several companies selling childrens food items were providing plastic, rubber or spring toys to allure them. Children are unable to differentiate between edible things and toys, leading to such tragedies. I hope after the PMOs intervention, action is taken by the authorities to prevent such incidents from recurring, Kumar, who has raised other important issues in the past as well, said.Sharda Tripathi, a member of Uttarakhand state commission for protection of child rights, recommended an immediate ban on such items. Children get attracted to such toys after watching TV ads. Precious lives are being put at risk by such toys every day. Action should be taken immediately on this front."

The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4923 against their monthly expenditures of Rs 6230 leaving them with savings in minus Rs 1307. The farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18059 and spent Rs 13311 saving Rs 4748 per month.Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectare in Punjab and 1.68 hectare in Haryana.UPs total share in countrys food production is 17.45% which is highest.Asking such questions is only natural as the BJP had devoted the first full four pages of its election manifesto Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra  to agriculture and farmers.Farm loan waiver was among the major promises that the BJP made to farmers. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived, the manifesto said.But when it came to implementing the pledge after the party romped to a grand victory in 2017, the fund-starved new government diluted the important loan waiver promise by putting in many eligibility conditions for debt-ridden farmers to avail the scheme, those familiar with the matter said.For example, it fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived, that too against one loan account only.Initially, 70 lakh farmers were expected to benefit after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore but gradually the number came down to just half. Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said the government had waived farm loan to the extent of Rs 20,596 crore, benefitting around 33 lakh farmers.The eligible farmers, who have been left out, had been asked to give an application by March 10. We have received applications from lakhs of farmers. We will sit in March end and take a call, he said.Even the implementation of the promise drew flak when it was found that many farmers received loan waiver cheques for as low as Re 1 or even less.Although the government countered the criticism by arguing that since the loans existing on March 31, 2016 were being waived, many farmers paid their loan before that period and a few rupees still continued to be showed as arrears with banks. These are the same arrears for which many farmers got the loan waiver cheques of very low amount, additional director, agriculture, Rajesh Gupta pointed out.Arguments notwithstanding, the opposition found an opportunity to mock at the loan waiver scheme. Shailendra Kumar Awasthi, a progressive farmer of Asmanpur village in Bahraich said, the scheme ended up earning more critics than admirers due to dilution and faulty implementation of the important pre-poll promise.The BJPs loan waiver promise was a big joke to farmers, UP Kisan Sabha leader Mukut Singh said. They promised to waive all the loans of small and medium farmers, but later limited the amount to Rs 1 lakh apart from putting many other ifs and buts, he added.The waiver, Singh claimed, was too inadequate and benefitted too small a number of farmers to make any difference.Contrary to the promise of providing affordable electricity to each field, power tariff for unmetered private tube wells owned by farmers was increased by 50% and by 77% for unmetered residential connections at one go a few months after the new government came to power.Unprecedented tariff hike with regard to tube wells and domestic connections in villages contrary to the promise of cheaper power is one of the major reasons for the simmering discontent among farmers, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma said.The work on some other farmer-related announcements is till to begin. They include interest-free crop loan to farmers, setting up of Mukhyamantri Krashi Sinchai Kosh and making cows and other milch animals available to landless farmers.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi claimed that the government had done a lot of work for farmers, which he claimed had no parallel. Apart from waiving crop loans, we are distributing 10,000 subsidised solar irrigation pumps to farmers every year, providing soil health cards to farmers as a campaign, we did record purchase of wheat and paddy and fixed the minimum support price of potato for the first time and ensured smooth and adequate distribution of fertilizers and seeds, he said, enumerating some achievements.Critics must not forget we got the mandate for five years and we will implement each and every promise made to farmers in the days to come. Our government is committed to doubling farmers income by 2022, he stressed.The criticism, however, becomes important when it comes from an organisation like the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, an outfit of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS). The government is trying its best but benefits of the policies are not reaching the ground because of the bureaucracy that makes the schemes and rules too complex for a common farmer to avail benefits, said Ram Chela Ji, state organization secretary.Farmers, he said, were disappointed. The government must act fast, he advised.The results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye polls must come as a wake-up call to those in power, he cautioned."

Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese. Cap your meal with Mangane: lentil and sago pudding prepared in milk with jaggery and coconut. The festival is on at The Dining Room till January 21."

Alcohol not served.Call: 98340 07058 / 99234 91378In north Germany, when colleagues leave the office for a short midday break, or at the end of the day, they might greet each other with the proclamation, Mahlzeit!. Informally, its used to say Hello! or Okay folks, Im off.In the rest of Germany and in Austria, the salutation takes its more literal sense, used only at mealtimes as a truncated form of gesegnete malzheit which means blessed mealtime, a more pious option to the common guten appetit.From a region which places hellos and goodbyes in the context of meals, Bandra restaurant Mahlzeit serves simple, homestyle, everyday food in a room thats so snug, eight diners inside it would be a bit of a squeeze.Mahlzeit offers a cosy, communal vibe where people must sit close together as they dine. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Its size works in Mahlzeits favour. People must sit close together to dine, so its the sort of place youd want to go for with someone who youre fond of, someone youd like to share your meal with. Its also the sort of neighbourhood eatery that could have a community of its own, regulars who become familiar, and drop in on a whim. Indeed, a couple walked in just as we were leaving, about 15 minutes before closing time. I called and they said its okay, she said to her companion as they walked in.The menu, which is identical to Mahlzeits outlet in Pune (where its very warmly received), is based around meat and potatoes  and some bread. There are wursts and schnitzels in various combinations, and meatballs and burgers, doners and grilled meats. Wherever it can be done, there is a paneer option.Have the wurst (German or Austrian for sausage) in any form. The ones in our pork bratwurst/currywurst mix platter, and in our coilwurst plate (coiled sausage), were as unprocessed, traditional, and tasty, as any we have had off a Vienna streetcart. Not so much the curry ketchup, which lacked character and did nothing for the meat.The thin, crumb-fried weiner schnitzels were crisp with flavourful beef tenderloin, served with two sauces and a side of potato salad. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)With both of these plates, there is a side of potatoes. Choose bratkartofflen  butter-fried potatoes, pepper, and caramelised onions, a comforting combination of fat, carbs, sweetness and spice. Or Oma Hedwigs potato salad, German-style cold spuds, in slightly tangy mayo.If we were satisfied with our wurst at Mahlzeit, we were thrilled with our wiener schnitzel. Under their crumbly and crisp breaded sheath was tender, flavourful meat, neither overwhelming the other.This meal will makes most folks want a cold beer. Mahlzeit has buzz-free Club Mate (pronounced mah-tey)  a carbonated tisane that we couldnt get enough of. Its crisp, more tart than sweet, lightly caffeinated, and deeply refreshing.It helps to keep in mind that Mahlzeit serves street food, so its about familiarity over fanciness. Most plates for one average at Rs 250. All things considered, we could do wurst.(HT pays for meals and reviews anonymously)"

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

This is being implemented on request of the state government willing to share the loss with the central government on a 50-50 basis, the order says.In a missive sent to all district magistrates as well as director, horticulture and food processing department on March 01, UP Agriculture Production Commissioner Raj Pratap Singh has conveyed the state governments decision in this regard following a letter from the Centre, also dated March 01, specifying the norms, said a senior official requesting anonymity in view of the model code in place for Phulpur bypolls.HT is in possession of a copy of the order that comes with a detailed table of agency entrusted the task of opening purchase centres in districts and the set target for them.The letter adds that overhead charges would cover expenses like transport, loading, unloading, gunny bag and other packing material, Mandi tax, purchase tax and godown charges etc. The purchases would be through agencies like UP Agro, Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Federation Limited, Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society, National Cooperative Consumers Federation of India Limited (NCCF), UP State Horticultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (HOFED) etc, the official added.As per the plan, Rs 2 crore each would be made available to the UP Agro, the PCF etc by the State Agricultural Produce Markets Board, UP, as an interest free loan for four months on their demands while the Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society and NCCF would arrange for the money themselves, the letter adds.These agencies would open procurement or purchase centres in different districts in consultation with the respective DMs with their numbers and targets being fixed as per local needs and circumstances. The purchase of potatoes would be made between March 2 and March 31, which, however, could be increased with the permission of the central government.The order specifies that while one purchase centre should become functional in every district from March 1 itself, by March 6 at least one such purchase centre should start functioning in every tehsil of a district.The procurement agencies should furnish a daily progress report to horticulture and food processing department through e-mail while the DM would ensure that a team of senior officials undertakes surprise inspection of the purchase centres, the missive says.Uttar Pradesh is the largest potato producing state of the country accounting for about 35% of the countrys total output. As per some estimates, a whopping over 23 lakh farmers grow potatoes in the state. With very limited capacity to store the produce just 1,708 cold storagesevery harvest produces the challenge for the government to ensure proper returns to the farmers at a time when large number of its cold storages are already full with last seasons harvest.In only its second cabinet meeting in April 2017, for the first time ever, the Yogi government had decided to fix minimum support price for potato to give fillip to potato growers who had been forced to sell their produce on throwaway prices in the past.Last year, the government had decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes from farmers at Rs 4,870 per tonne to arrest the sharp fall in prices besides an extra Rs 1,217.60 per tonne or actual whichever is less for overhead expenses."

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

The food processing sector is a giant which has now woken up in UP. A similar international investors meet for food processing World Food India was organised in Delhi last year. There international companies signed MoUs of more than Rs 1lakh crore investments and UP being the largest state of country will get a lions share, she said.The minister further said UP was the leading milk producing state accounting for nearly 17% of its total production in the country.Similarly it produces fruits like guava, mango, Indian gooseberry, watermelon, muskmelon in abundance. UP is second largest producer of carrots, bottle gourds, pumpkin, parwal, highest producer of wheat, sugarcane, meat bust still people are not fed properly because high amount of food is wasted.

This can be saved through processing, she said.The government has doubled the budget of department due to high opportunity of jobs in the sector, she said.Investors should invest in the sector as the government was ready to give a subsidy of Rs 5000 crore for this sector. Rs 6000 crore has been earmarked for Pradhanmantri Kisan Sampada Yojana. For establishing food parks government is ready to give subsidy, she added.She said the government also was keen on laying foundation stone besides inaugurating the ventures in the state.Kaur struck a chord with the audience by terming herself as UP Ki Beti as she sais she spent her childhood in Gorakhpur and studied in Lucknow. She said she still missed Shukla Chaat in Hazratganj.
