Vishal Srivastav Opposition members protest in Assembly, in Lucknow on Thursday. Vishal SrivastavOpposition leaders hurled paper balls, paper planes and balloons as Governor Ram Naik gave his customary address to a joint sitting of the Assembly and Legislative Council Thursday, the opening day of the budget session. Some Samajwadi Party MLAs arrived in the House wearing garlands of potatoes to highlight the plight of potato farmers. The Governor read out his over an hour-long speech at a stretch despite the uproar. As soon as Naik began his address, SP members donning red caps, BSP members wearing blue caps and Congress leaders wearing white Gandhian caps stooped into the well of the House carrying placards and banners, shouting slogans and asking the Governor to go back.Admonishing the Opposition, Naik said that while they were representatives of civilised society, their behaviour was that of the opposite. Aap sabhya samaj ke pratinidhi hain, iske viprit vyavahar kar rahe hain, he said as opposition members threw paper balls at the podium. Later, Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit also condemned the act and thanked the governor for fulfiling his constitutional duty despite the condemnable behaviour. Both Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as well as former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who is a member of the Legislative Council, were present during the address. While SP members led the protest, party chief Akhilesh watched while seated next to the Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary.As slogans rent the air, placards and banners read: Nirdoshon ka farzi encounter band karo (Stop fake encounters of innocents), Musalmanon ka utpeeran band karo (stop exploitation of Muslims), Kansganj ke sampradayik hinsa mein nirdosh logon pe julma band karo (stop harassment of innocents in Kansganj communal violence. Some banners even quoted the controversial Facebook post of the Bareilly district magistrate about a trend of carrying out processions through Muslim localities and raising anti-Pakistan slogans.The Governor, however, continued to highlight the achievements of the state government. My government has established the rule of law by generating a crime-free, fear-free and injustice-free environment in the state.Effective action is being taken as per law against criminal and mafia elements, he said. He also said that the government was making efforts towards promotion of communal harmony and national integration and social harmony among different religions, communities and other sections of the society.Naik listed the Uttar Pradesh Control of Organised Crime Bill, formation of anti-romeo squads, anti-obscene call cell, anti-land mafia task force as well as the governments decision to establish a women battalion in the current financial year among the achievements of the government. Speaking about the upcoming UP Investors Summit on February 21 and 22, he expressed pride over the fact that a resident of Paronkh village of Kanpur Dehat, President Ram Nath Kovind, has been elected to the supreme constitutional post of the country, while the Opposition continued to chant slogans.In his address, the Governor also said that the state government would soon set up the Chief Minister Agriculture Irrigation Fund with Rs 20,000 crore to ensure reach of irrigation water to each and every field and that a separate amount under the fund is being proposed for the drought-hit Bundelkhand region.With the government scheduled to present the annual budget for the next fiscal on February 16, Naik said that the present regime is bringing in a new health policy based on medical and health-related requirements of the state, so that people sitting on the last rung of the ladder can get quality medical facilities. He also mentioned the decision to construct the 340.24 km-long Poorvanchal Expressway from Lucknow to Ghazipur, adding that the project would start in the financial year 2018-19.While Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu called the Governors address Jhooth ka pulinda, BSP Legislative Party leader Lalji Verma quoted the phrase, Khoda pahaad nikli chuhiya.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo/Avinash Nair) Desraji Thakor at his house in Khariya village. (Express Photo/Avinash Nair)Last July, a flash flood had swept away his life, killing 17 members of his family and destroying his cotton crop in Khariya village of Banaskantha district of north Gujarat. This year, 70-year-old Desraji Thakor is battling for survival. Water, the abundance of which had played havoc in his life six months ago, the same water  now its scarcity  has made Thakors life miserable again.Struggling to reap his first crop after the devastating flood of last year, a desperate Thakor family has to draw water from the adjacent Narmada Main Canal using a diesel pump, an act outlawed by the government. Last month, farmers were warned by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) against illegal lifting of water from the canal, and some of them were even issued notices.Read | As Gujarat gets NCA nod, CM says crisis avertedWe have sown wheat and castor on six bighas. This is our very first crop after the last years flood. Last year, we had sown cotton at the beginning of the Kharif season, but the flood washed it away. We could not sow anything later in the year as our land was full of mud and slush, says Thakor, resting on his cot under the shade of a neem tree in his backyard and surrounded by the remains of his houses that were swept away by the flood.Banaskantha, the potato capital of the country, reaps harvest round the year  kharif, rabi and summer crops  because of its fertile land, and has the highest harvest of summer crops. This rabi season, farmers in the district have sown crop in over 5.71 lakh hectares, the highest among all the 33 districts of the state. Most of the farmers in the district have sown mustard in over 1.57 lakh hectares, followed by wheat in 74,000 hectares with canal irrigation facilities and cumin in 70,500 hectares. But at the beginning of this year, the BJP government said that it will not be able to provide Narmada waters for irrigation after March 15, citing very low rainfall in the catchment area of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and warned farmers against sowing summer crops.Read | Gujarat in fix as Sardar Sarovar water level at alarming lowWe spent at least three months cleaning our farmland and making it cultivable. Now, when we are in the middle of the Rabi season, we hear that the government has disallowed lifting of water from the Narmada Main Canal. How will our crops survive, asks Desrajis nephew Pradhan as he joins him on the cot.We spend at least Rs 1,000 on diesel, every time we irrigate our fields. This is the only way, we can irrigate our fields as our borewells were damaged in the floods, adds Pradhan who is hopeful that the state government will not act harshly against the farmers of the village, which was one of the worst-affected areas during last years monsoon.The political allegiance of the Khariya village can be gauged by the BJP flags fluttering on most of the rooftops. In the recently concluded Assembly elections, distribution of Rs 1,500 crore of flood relief had become a major political issue in the district as parties pitched for votes.In the adjoining farmland, 33-year-old Mehraj Desai has just finished watering his mustard crop that he has sown in two of the three bighas he owns. My one bigha of land is not yet suitable for cultivation. You can see, nothing grows in this patch of land, says Desai pointing to an area where the rich loamy soil has been swept away.For farmers like Desai, who are still in the process of rebuilding their homes destroyed in the flood, the Narmada Main Canal, which cuts through the Khariya village, carrying water to Rajasthan is the only source of irrigation.Our families cannot survive by reaping just one crop in a year. We will have to go for the summer crop as well, says Desai who plans to sow bajra in an adjoining piece of land once the rabi crop is harvested.According to the the agriculture department figures, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017, which largely included crops like Bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Last year, most of the summer crops were sown in Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts.The situation of the families living on western side of the Narmada Main canal  that breached at several places last year, compounding the flood-situation - is even worse.Shravan Vaghela and two of his brothers, whose 22 bighas of land was completely inundated after the canal got breached, live in tents on a piece of land that resembles a dried-up riverbed. Six months after the floods, the damaged wall of the canal has been rebuilt, but the Vaghela family has managed to rebuild only one of the three houses that once stood at a corner of their farm.We cannot starve to death, and so we have sown wheat in one bigha of land that we have managed to cultivate using water from the canal. The rest is full of sand and gravel. It will take several months to restore them, says Vaghela as children play cricket in an empty plot of land behind the rebuilt house.Not a single government official came to inquire about our condition after the floods, but now officials from the Narmada Nigam (Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd) come in droves to tell us to remove our diesel pumps which we use to irrigate a small portion of our land. Isnt this unfair? asks Vaghela whose borewell still lies buried in two-feet of sand. Nearby, the work of repairing the damaged canal is still underway.Read more from The Indian Express series, Narmada Rationing the Lifeline, here.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

The meteorological department has predicted more rainfall in the regionBoon for cropsThe regional research centre of Punjab Agricultural University in Bathinda recorded 2.2 mm rain till Monday morning. Chief agriculture officer (CAO), Bathinda, Gurditta Singh said rain was beneficial to all the crops including wheat, mustard and gram.Though the region experienced high-velocity winds as well, these are not yet harmful for the crop, he added. The weather forecast has predicted rain till February 13, which will also be beneficial for the crop, the chief agricultural officer said.Moderate rain in DoabaModerate rainfall coupled with strong winds and thunderstorm across the Doaba region on Monday early morning will help to bring down temperature, giving a boost to the wheat crop and other vegetable crops for healthy growth, agriculture experts said.Jalandhar and adjoining districts including Kapurthala and Nawanshahr recorded rainfall ranging from 8mm to 10mm during the early hours on Monday.Farmers need not to worry. In fact these moderate showers are healthy for all crops, especially wheat, which is a temperature-sensitive crop and needs cold conditions to flourish, Dr Jaswinder Singh, Jalandhar agriculture development officer said.The wheat crop, which has to be harvested in April mid to mid-May, does not need water before three months of harvesting for good growth. He said rainfall will help to bring down the chilling effect on the crops and stabilize the temperature.Dip in temperature will help to save the crop from the moisture, which usually results in damaging the crop. If atmospheric conditions remain favourable in the coming days, we can expect bumper production this year, Singh said.A man runs for shelter amid pouring rain in Patiala on Monday. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)Potato harvesting could be delayed if rainfall continuesAgriculture experts in Kapurthala said that though rainfall was good for all the crops, it could delay harvest of potatoes.If rainfall continues for more time, it will lead to a delay in harvesting the potato crop. The crop will not be damaged, though, said Resham Singh, a Kapurthala-based agriculture expert.Rain lashes AmritsarRainfall witnessed across the northern region provided respite to wheat growers in and around Amritsar.Wheat growers in the region had been worried over increasing temperature, which impacts rabi crops negatively.In Amritsar, rainfall started at 12.30 am on Monday. It continued intermittently throughout the night till morning. Similar condition prevailed in the Majha region.Rainfall pushed the temperature down, thereby creating favourable climate for rabi crops. It was light rain, which is good for the health of wheat. It has a positive impact on the quality of grain and yield. Wheat crop needs low temperature, but for the past few days the temperature had not gone down much. The rain has made the weather favourable for vegetables too, said Dalbir Singh Chhina, chief agriculture officer of Amritsar.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer, said the increasing temperature had been a cause of worry for them but light rainfall has brightened their spirits.Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Rajinder Arora said rain has settled pollutants and dust particles causing allergic diseases and infections. Rain has settled them down. Increased moisture in the air also helps fight diseases, he added."

To make the potato-peel soup, store your peels in the freezer until you have enough. You can also add other vegetable peels for more flavour, she added.The audience was full of questions and doubts.What can be done with pea pods, one eager participant asked? When they are tender, in winter, they are edible, Suchde replied.For curator Roxanne Bamboat, the spirit of learning forms the heart of workshops such as these. Participants have to enjoy themselves, but our aim is for everyone to also learn something new.Food blogger Aarthi Basrur from Borivli said she was torn between this session and the Zakir Hussain performance. I picked this because it seemed rare and interesting, she said. I wanted to learn how to reduce kitchen waste too, besides using the discarded vegetable for stock.For Anant Thattey, 50, a fintech executive from Dadar, the workshop was a reminder of his days as an impoverished student in the US. I know how important it is to never throw anything away, he said. Im looking to see new ways in which I can do this."

We will ensure that farmers get remunerative prices. This will be done by setting up additional procurement centres for wheat and paddy, said minister for agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi.A committee of ministers has also been set up to look into the problems of potato growers. Measures will soon be initiated to improve their lot on the committees recommendations. We are focusing on diversification as farmers remain mostly focused on wheat and paddy crops. An amendment to Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act is being contemplated to reach out to the farmers to get them better prices for their produce. We want to double the income of farmers by 2022, said Shahi.An action plan that NITI Ayog formulated for Uttar Pradesh also refers to the proposed agriculture sector reforms. The plan also refers to the challenge of transforming the agriculture sector, that has not grown despite claims of successive governments, by addressing issues of low growth, low productivity and low income of farmers. It asks the state government to identify reasons for decrease in canal irrigated area from 32.1 lakh hectare in 1990s to 25.5 lakh hectare now and take appropriate action.A decrease in irrigated area assumes significance as the states backward regions like Bundelkhand have witnessed drought and a number of distressed farmers have reportedly committed suicide over the years. Bundelkhand has seen 411 suicides of farmers from January 2014 to June 28, 2016, said Saheb Lal Shukla, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhupendra Singh Mann group).But a change in the UP story is perhaps now showing. If claims of the officers of the agriculture department were to be believed, the state achieved 3.5 percent growth in the agriculture sector in 2014-2015. The sector may have grown further in the following years.After its installation on March 19, 2017, the Adityanath government had announced a number of measures for welfare of farmers. These included a loan waiver scheme involving an expenditure of Rs 36,000 crore for farmers in the states annual budget for 2017-2018.Earlier, the UPA government too had taken a number of initiatives for the farmers. A debt relief scheme for farmers was implemented across India during the UPA regime. It had also introduced schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MNREGA) scheme and the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition and Resettlement Act 2013 to ensure that the farmers got better value for the land that was acquired for various development projects.."

Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

At that time, it was reduced to 25 % for business houses having a turnover up to Rs 50 crore, benefiting the MSME sector.But in the union budget for 2018-19, the tax benefit has been extended to larger business units having an annual turnover up to Rs 250 crore.Vaish also said, It has been announced that bank loans to the MSMEs will be sanctioned online. Yet, the MSME sector is doubtful in view of the attitude of banks towards it.Moreover, the online systems are not reliable at present as is being experienced in the case of the GST, he said.Today, reports have come in from various chapters of the IIA that the online e-way bill system is not properly operational, he added.Vaish, however, said the decision to set up mega food park and provide incentives for the apparel and leather sector will give a boost to the MSME sector.Manmohan Agarwal, the IIA vice-president, said the emphasis on road and health infrastructure and improvement in the education system would indirectly help the MSME sector.CONSUMER DEMAND TO GET A BOOST: ASSOCHAM PRESIDENTSandeep Jajodia, the Assocham president, said the finance minister had placed much emphasis on agriculture and rural India, allocating bulk of resources to interior landscape, while helping the middle class salaried employees along with giving relief to senior citizens. These measures will boost consumer demand and help revive economic growth, he said.The budget is on expected lines and provides support to sections of the society where it was needed the most. The agriculture and rural landscape were in some kind of distress and provision of over Rs 14.34 lakh crore on rural infrastructure should also add to employment generation, especially in the farm sector, Jajodia added.Relief to salaried employees by way of Rs 40,000 per annum standard deduction in lieu of transport allowance and medical reimbursement will leave more disposable income in the hands of the middle class and boost consumer demand, he said.Initiatives like Operation Green to stabilise prices of onion and potato will help ease retail inflation and help the RBI in keeping interest rates on the lower side, Jajodia said.MANY MEASURES IN LINE WITH CII RECOMMENDATIONSChandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said: Many of the measures in the budget are in line with the CIIs recommendations such as incentives for new jobs, extending fixed term employment, enhancing quality of education including teacher training and addressing healthcare access.Overall, this is a balanced and prudent budget that sets the foundation for future growth in the economy, he said."

He wont. There is no point in asking for his resignation when people are not getting justice, he said.Akhilesh said Adityanath had famously said that pradesh ke apradhi pradesh chhod ke bahar chaley jaayein (Criminals in UP now must leave the state and go elsewhere). What happened to this warning that Yogi had been issuing? he asked.He said there was no place in the state that is untouched by gory crimes. Robberies have been reported from the outskirts of Lucknow, an SP worker was beheaded in Azamgarh and incidents of crimes are happening unchecked in Meerut, Chitrakoot, and Varanasi.Investors will be terribly scared of coming to UP to invest. Let us see how he (Adityanath) eradicates that fear now, he said.Akhilesh was referring to the forthcoming UP Investors Summit scheduled on February 21 and 22 for which Adityanath and his colleagues have held roadshows in Mumbai and Hyderabad to make it a big draw.The Samajwadi Party leader accused the Bharatiya Janata Party government of posting officers who he said were engaged in pleasing their political masters instead of deploying good officers on important posts.The BJPs leaders should recall their statements during the 2017 polls. They went around saying that police stations were being run by Samajwadis. Now, I ask who are running the police stations, Akhilesh said.Akhilesh said the government had made tall claims that encounters would improve the law and order situation in the state but instead of bringing about any change, questions are being raised about the extra-judicial killings by the police.According to reports, 28 criminals have been killed in nearly 940 encounters till January 9 and about 3,900 have been arrested across the state since Adityanath assumed office on March 19 last year.Akhilesh also accused the activists of the BJP of the violent protests against Bollywood period drama Padmaavat."

Information travels really fast now. Investors who earlier wanted to come are now scared after seeing news of crime in the state. They are in a dilemma, he said.On the protests against Padmaavat in UP, Akhilesh said, Sochiye aap kidhar le ja rahe hain Bharat desh ko virodh bhi khud karwa rahe hain aur laathi bhi yahi marwa rahe hain aap CCTV ki ya jo recording hogi un sab ko nikalwaiye aakhir wo kaun they jo sadko par ye Bhatriya Janata Party ke log gaye they (Just think where these people are taking the country. They are staging protests and then they themselves are lathi-charging. Go find all CCTV recordings. Who were those people on the roads? They all are BJP people).Referring to a few recent incidents of crime, including the one on Wednesday in which an old woman and her son were shot dead in Meerut as they were witnesses in her husbands murder case, Akhilesh said: CM Yogi Adityanath used to say criminals have fled the state, but the spate in crime is saying something else. It seems the message to criminals is to stay in UP.We went to Kakori recently. You and I cannot even imagine the dacoity that happened thereThere was such a nanga naach (of fear) in the village that people cannot sleep, he said. While committing robberies, they threatened the villagers against informing police. When one 19-year-old youth came to resist, they shot at him Then again, there was another dacoity in the neighbourhood. There too people lost lives. Why does the government claim that law and order problem can be solved with encounters? Akhilesh asked.When some potato farmers who suffered losses dumped their produce in Lucknow, police tracked 10,000 phone calls. (When) I asked police to check phone towers (in Kakori) and find out who made the calls and in which direction the dacoits escaped, police were busy pleasing BJP leaders, he further said. The SP chief said he would not ask the CM to resign, but urge the people to dislodge Adityanath and his party from power. Asked about new DGP OP Singh, the SP leader said, Singh is a good officer and close to me and my father. Let us see whether BJP people are going to let him work or not.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

Before we start the agitation against the state government, which has been a complete failure on all aspects be it law and order or protecting the interests of farmers, youth or women  we have to ensure that our units are well prepared. We do not wish to do a protest just for the sake of it, said Babbar.Every region in Uttar Pradesh has its own issues, like the problems of sugarcane farmers in western and eastern UP and those of potato farmers as we move towards central UP from western Uttar Pradesh, etc., he added.He further said, These divisional workers meetings aim at preparing the cadre for the agitations. Thus, senior leaders will spend the entire day in these interactions. We will give chances to not only district or city presidents, but also one representative from each block to speak and share problems, said Babbar, adding that the message would be to go to the people and raise their issues.Sources in the party said the aim of these meetings is also to finish grass-root level differences and ask workers and office-bearers to prepare for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The partys scheduled caste department has already asked its office-bearers to replace inactive workers in next 15 days and start Dalit Swabhiman Yatras.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

Reason: Owing to surplus potatoes in the national market, the price remained around Rs 2 per kg, which is the lowest of the season, leaving the farmers with no choice but to take their potato stocks from cold stores and dumping them away.Reports in this regard have come from various parts of the state, including the Dera Bassi, Banur and Rajpura belts. Sacks full of potatoes can be seen dumped near Chhatt village right along the Zirakpur-Patiala highway.With potato production costing Rs 5 per kg, farmers say no one is ready to sell the crop at Rs 2 per kg in the market because selling the potatoes at such low price cannot even cover transportation, labour and gunny bag cost.The ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers.  Jang Bhadhur Sangha, potato farmer, JalandharTheir plightDidar Singh, a potato farmer from Shatabgarh village of Dera Bassi, said, Keeping a 50-kg bag of potato in a cold store costs Rs 120 for a full season. A gunny bag costs about Rs 20 and labour cost for filling, loading and transporting the potato-filled bag costs Rs 25.This way, a 50-kg bag costs us Rs 165 in total. However, in the wholesale market, the bag fetches only Rs 120-130. With such a negative return, majority of farmers prefer not to lift their crop from the cold stores, he said.Another farmer from Shatabgarh village, Dasmesh Singh, said, As farmers neither pay the rent of keeping the potato in cold stores nor come to lift their stock, the owners of stores are forced to just dump the potato away on open spaces. And sometimes, farmers themselves throw the potato away in open spaces instead of taking the crop to the market.Mohali, India January 28: Potato dumped road side in village Chatt in Mohali on Sunday, January 28, 2018.Photo by Ravi Kumar/Hindustan Times (Ravi Kumar/HT)Farmers refuse to pick stockThe slump in potato prices has also caused huge losses to the owners of various cold stores, including those of the big cold stores in the 7-km stretch from Jhungian to Jhansla village.Claiming to have suffered losses worth Rs 50 lakh, Manjit Singh, owner of Baba Ajit Singh cold store in Jhungian village,said, Around 500 farmers had kept their potato stock at my store. Out of these, only 200 farmers have lifted their stock. The remaining just refused to pick up their stock, due to which I had no choice but to dump the rest of the stock as the store needs to be cleaned for the next season.One-month electricity bill of my cold store is around Rs 5 lakh. Besides, I have to pay the salaries of my workers too, Singh said.Govt of no help eitherA leading potato farmer in the country,Jang Bhadhur Sangha of Jalandhar, said, The central government had prepared a market intervention scheme to support the market at the time of slump in price of farmers' produce. However, knowing that there is huge price slump due to surplus potato production, the government did not care to intervene. This has left the farmers to fend for themselves. They have no alternative but to dump their stock.Sangha also pointed out how ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers. Export to Pakistan would have helped with the profit from potato in the domestic market as the surplus stock in Pakistani market had exhausted, he said.He said they had asked the Union government through multiple channels to allow export of potato, but to no avail."

Amazon's technology charges customers after they leave.SEE PHOTOS | Inside Amazon Go: No cashiers, no registers, no cash""It's such a weird experience, because you feel like you're stealing when you go out the door,"" said Lisa Doyle, who visited the shop yesterday.Amazon employees have been testing the store, at the bottom floor of the company's Seattle headquarters, for about a year. Amazon.com Inc. said it uses computer vision, machine learning algorithms and sensors to figure out what people are grabbing off its store shelves.The store is yet another sign that Amazon is serious about expanding its physical presence. It has opened more than a dozen bookstores, taken over space in some Kohl's department stores and bought Whole Foods last year, giving it 470 grocery stores.But Amazon Go is unlike its other stores. Shoppers enter by scanning the Amazon Go smartphone app at a turnstile, opening plastic doors. When an item is pulled of a shelf, it's added to that shopper's virtual cart. If the item is placed back on the shelf, it is removed from the virtual cart.Not everyone can shop at the store: People must have a smartphone and a debit or credit card they can link to be charged.Amazon said families can shop together with just one phone scanning everyone in. Anything they grab from the shelf will also be added to the tab of the person who signed them in. But don't help out strangers: Amazon warns that grabbing an item from the shelf for someone else means you'll be charged for it.There's little sign of the technology visible to customers, except for black boxes, cameras and a few tiny flashing green lights in the darkened, open ceiling above.One shopper, Paul Fan, tested the technology by turning off his phone and taking items and putting them in incorrect spots. The app was still able to tally up his items correctly.""It's really smart,"" he said.Want to return something? Trying it to return a bottle of kombucha Monday didn't mean returning anything to the store just clicking ""return"" on the receipt, and a refund was supposed to appear soon. A customer service representative said to toss out or donate the item.At 1,800 square feet, Amazon Go resembles a convenience store, except for a kitchen visible from the street where sandwiches and ready-to-cook meal kits are prepared. A small section features products from the Whole Foods 365 brand."

In fact, DySP Srinivas, Puttur Rural Circle Inspector Gopal Naik, Uppinangady Sub Inspector Nandakumar and other police personnel were camping in Mithamajalu since morning.When ANF members showed the photographs of a few Maoists to the inmates of the house, they (residents) said that the Maoists have identified themselves as ""Rajesh"" and ""Latha"".Mithamajalu, situated two-kilometres away from National Highway has 40 houses, of which three houses are situated on the periphery of the forest. The Maoist members had visited the houses on Sunday night. However, it was kept a secret till Monday evening. It was through schoolchildren that the news was spread among the villagers.Puttur DySP Srinivas said that the visit of Maoists to the houses has been confirmed. Two teams of ANF have started combing operations.'Did not threaten'One of the residents of the house that the Maoists visited said, ""The members just informed that they were Maoists and asked us not to inform anyone. They did not threaten us.""A team with two men and a woman entered the house at 7.30 pm on Sunday. After introducing themselves as Purushotham, Rajesh and Latha, they asked for groceries. ""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice. When I said there are no shops nearby, they demanded rice from the house. They have taken 3 kg boiled rice, 8 kg white rice, tomato and potato from my house.""Enquiries madeThe trio were also asking for Biju, whom they said had reportedly informed the police about their visit to Subrahmanya last time.As a result, one of their collegue Yellappa was killed in crossfire with the ANF (in 2012).Another resident said: ""I encountered three members of the Maoists first. My parents had gone to the temple on account of Sankranti. When I heard dogs barking, I came out of the house and saw three armed persons at my yard. When they introduced themselves as Maoists, I ran towards my uncle's house."""
5aeaff709855b73f522c5afb,From Dalit activist to Gujarat MLA: Tracking Jignesh Mevani's journey,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-depth-jignesh-mevani-s-journey-from-a-dalit-activist-to-vadgam-mla/story-T9N0QvSF6jVaah8tjKPlQI.html,2018-01-20,"Jignesh Mevani, underdressed for the chilly morning at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, walks tiredly into a dhaba. Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats. On the other side was Mevani, a novice, self-proclaimed agitator, who was out to expose the socio-economic conditions of farmers, Scheduled Castes and minorities.Ironically, Mevanis image became his biggest stumbling block in the election. Dalits, comprising 16% of Vadgam population, could relate to his agenda. But the predominant Chaudhary community was not comfortable with his approach. They presumed that with Jignesh as an MLA, they would be routinely booked under the Atrocities Act because Dalits worked in their farms and factories, says Sagar Rabari, 50, a social activist and general secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj, who helped Mevani devise his election strategy. I had to act as Jigneshs guarantor, says Rabari.Supporters at a public meeting during Jignesh Mevanis election campaign in Vadgam, Gujarat, on December 10, 2017. This was Mevanis first election. (Kunal Patil/HT PHOTO)A lot, however, was going in Mevanis favour. The AAP and the Congress withdrew their candidates so that voters had a choice between Mevani and the BJP. Crowdfunding platform crowdnewsing.com raised Rs 20.5 lakh for his campaign. By the time of the election, Mevani had polished his oratory skills, having spoken at multiple forums in the one year period since the Una incident. Four teams were canvassing for himhis aides from Ahmedabad, activists and volunteers from Delhi, the local communities in Vadgam, and the Congress cadre.In retrospect, Mevani admits that he spent more time convincing people why they should vote the BJP out than talking about the change he intended to bring. We didnt elaborate on what we would do. My positive campaign was inbuilt in my image. I believe that I got 4,000 votes only on my credibility, he says.The BJP claimed that Mevani was an outsider; that he had accepted funding from the Social Democratic Party of India, a political wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), which has been accused of terror links (Mevani denied the charges); and that he was using Muslims for votes. The last charge stemmed from Mevanis interview published in the Forward Press, which quoted him saying that his first girlfriend was a Muslim.Mevanis victory was a vindication for his supporters not just in Gujarat but across the nation. At the all-India level, the anti-right forces are in search of some spark. They have found that in Jignesh. His position in Gujarat is reinforced with his national position, says Ahmedabad-based sociologist Ghanshyam Shah. If Muslims wanted someone whose hand they could hold, they have found that person.VADGAM IN WAITINGThe people who have been part of his journey so far or who have monitored his trajectory seem to know where he is faltering and the pitfalls that lie in his way forward as an MLA.He should watch his words. The radicalism he shows at times makes him vulnerable. Else the government will file cases against him and he will find himself entangled in legal battles, Sanjay Bhave echoes a concern shared by almost all of Mevanis well-wishers. Now he should rise above Modi-bashing and talk about concrete issues, he adds.He will have to cut down on travel and concentrate on his constituency. Now people have expectations from Jignesh Mevani, the MLA. He has to deliver. He cant continue to only be an orator, says Nirjari Sinha.Ghanshyam Shah suggests that Mevani should have a panoramic view of society and politics and move ahead accordingly. Currently, all the information he is getting is from the media. For long-term politics, he should have a group or a think tank which dispassionately reflects on the ground situation.Mevani says that the one criticism he has got the mostthat he should be less aggressive  is not unwarranted. I agree with this, he says. But the problem is that I wont remain who I am if I start working on this. This is who I am.About the charge that he over-travels, he says, Me going to various states energises the youth and Dalit groups. I should keep doing that but not at the cost of Vadgam.THE JUBILATIONIt will be some weeks before Mevani overcomes the euphoria of the resounding win that caught his aides and the country by surprise.Mevani is still getting used to being addressed as MLA saheb. I bought 10 new kurtas, all of different colours. I like wearing them with folded sleeves, with a wrist watch on my left hand. I flash the victory sign like a neta (politician) does. I am quite enjoying this. His eyes sparkle. But the feeling has not sunk in as yet.Mevani underplays the congratulatory phone calls and the meeting with the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi before the election. He describes it as a Hi, hello meeting. He is still getting accustomed to his new role  learning how to greet people, how to listen to them, how to become a leader his followers can admire and look up to.Like the bunch of students who surround him at the dhaba in JNU, vying for selfies with him, cautioning him, in awe of him, and waiting for him to prove them right. Responding to each one of them, Mevani seems like a leader at the start of an eventful and uncertain voyage. I am also a brand now, a force to reckon with, he says in a matter-of-fact tone."
5aeaff809855b73f522c5b07,UP: Potato subsidy policy to be tweaked for farmers' benefit,http://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-potato-subsidy-policy-to-be-tweaked-for-farmers-benefit/story-r0rOJGMApRjH41IHiqFMYJ.html,2018-01-20,"The Mandi Parishad will modify its policy on potato transportation subsidy to the extent that it benefits farmers more and not traders.The Mandi Parishad board has also cleared a proposal for giving subsidy on export of potato and mango of all varieties. Till now, the subsidy was available to only select varieties like Taj brand of potato and Nawab brand of mango, said an official.The move comes in the backdrop of the opposition raising the problems of potato growers and alleging they were not getting a fair price for their produce even though the fresh crop too has arrived.The mandi board of directors meeting was presided over by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday.At the meeting, it was pointed out that transport subsidy introduced by the government last year ended up benefiting traders instead of farmers.The subsidy was introduced to help farmers lift potato from cold storages and sell the same in other cities and states to get a better price.An official said, 99% of the benefit of the transport subsidy went to traders and transporters and only 1% to farmers. It was, therefore, decided at the meeting to launch the scheme this year in a new form so that the subsidy amount went to farmers more.Under the scheme launched last year, the government provided transportation subsidy at Rs 50 per quintal on the potato to be transported to a distance of over 250 km.Although last years actual bills are yet to be submitted for clearance, the Mandi Parishad may have to bear an expenditure of around Rs 60 crore as transport subsidy, said the official."

TGIFridays has recently launched their hangover brunch every weekend, which has all the right appetisers, entrees and desserts to satisfy your hungover heart, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to either refresh you, or keep the buzz going.We started the meal with some mocktails  the Basil Peach Cooler and the Gold Mango Margarita, both of which were a tad bit too strong for our tastes, but were also high on flavour and taste. We tried the Chocolate Milkshake next, which was rich, thick and decadent  just how a good milkshake should be.If you are looking to keep their spirits high by taking care of your hangover with another drink, try Hangover Bloody Mary. This drink, is a meal in itself. The tall glass, the classic tomato juice-based cocktail is served in, is decorated with a lamb slider, chicken wings, fries and celery sticks - an ideal meal for one. The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."
5aeb037d9855b73f522c5e27,Price crash: Punjab to export potato to Russia and Middle East,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/price-crash-punjab-to-export-potato-to-russia-and-middle-east/story-6DlafxNuRH6GP4y5ajljVO.html,2018-01-20,"Four months after farmers dumped potatoes on road in Mohali and other parts of the state, seeking remunerative price for the produce, the Punjab government has allowed the staple foods export to Russia and the Middle East. The past few years have witnessed surplus production of potatoes in the state. This, however, has not been adequately transported to other states.This glut in production and no buyers due to demonetisation over the past two seaons had led to a crash in prices. Against a production cost of around Rs 5per kg, potato is selling at Rs 2 per kg in the wholesale market.The price crash is a cyclical occurence in the state, but demonetisation had aggaravated the crisis. Doaba has 93% of the states sown area of the crop at 80,000 hectares of 86,000. In a series of reports, HT had highlighted the plight of potato farmers who had been facing heavy losses.What caused the crisis Production cost: Rs 5/kgWholesale selling price: Rs 2/kgAcreage in Punjab 86,000 hectareAcreage in Doaba region 80,000 hectare (93%)Production per hectare 200 quintalIf the government fails to intervene to help potato growers, Doaba farmers will be the worst-hit, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha had recently said.After the decision, he said, We hope for export to Europe and the Americas to start soon as well. The decision to export the crop was taken during a meeting of members of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) with financial commissioner, development, Vishwajeet Khanna earlier this week.Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) will be the assisting agency. Farmers will hand over their produce to the agency, which will bear the transport cost in exporting the produce.

5aeb03dd9855b73f522c5e77,UP: Potato Subsidy Policy to Be Tweaked for Farmers' Benefit,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-potato-subsidy-policy-to-be-tweaked-for-farmers-benefit/story-r0rOJGMApRjH41IHiqFMYJ.html,2018-01-20,"The Mandi Parishad will modify its policy on potato transportation subsidy to the extent that it benefits farmers more and not traders.The Mandi Parishad board has also cleared a proposal for giving subsidy on export of potato and mango of all varieties. Till now, the subsidy was available to only select varieties like Taj brand of potato and Nawab brand of mango, said an official.The move comes in the backdrop of the opposition raising the problems of potato growers and alleging they were not getting a fair price for their produce even though the fresh crop too has arrived.The mandi board of directors meeting was presided over by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday.At the meeting, it was pointed out that transport subsidy introduced by the government last year ended up benefiting traders instead of farmers.The subsidy was introduced to help farmers lift potato from cold storages and sell the same in other cities and states to get a better price.An official said, 99% of the benefit of the transport subsidy went to traders and transporters and only 1% to farmers. It was, therefore, decided at the meeting to launch the scheme this year in a new form so that the subsidy amount went to farmers more.Under the scheme launched last year, the government provided transportation subsidy at Rs 50 per quintal on the potato to be transported to a distance of over 250 km.Although last years actual bills are yet to be submitted for clearance, the Mandi Parishad may have to bear an expenditure of around Rs 60 crore as transport subsidy, said the official."
5aeb05309855b73f522c5f7f,From Dalit Activist to Gujarat MLA: Tracking Jignesh Mevani's Journey,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-depth-jignesh-mevani-s-journey-from-a-dalit-activist-to-vadgam-mla/story-T9N0QvSF6jVaah8tjKPlQI.html,2018-01-20,"Jignesh Mevani, underdressed for the chilly morning at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, walks tiredly into a dhaba. Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats. On the other side was Mevani, a novice, self-proclaimed agitator, who was out to expose the socio-economic conditions of farmers, Scheduled Castes and minorities.Ironically, Mevanis image became his biggest stumbling block in the election. Dalits, comprising 16% of Vadgam population, could relate to his agenda. But the predominant Chaudhary community was not comfortable with his approach. They presumed that with Jignesh as an MLA, they would be routinely booked under the Atrocities Act because Dalits worked in their farms and factories, says Sagar Rabari, 50, a social activist and general secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj, who helped Mevani devise his election strategy. I had to act as Jigneshs guarantor, says Rabari.Supporters at a public meeting during Jignesh Mevanis election campaign in Vadgam, Gujarat, on December 10, 2017. This was Mevanis first election. (Kunal Patil/HT PHOTO)A lot, however, was going in Mevanis favour. The AAP and the Congress withdrew their candidates so that voters had a choice between Mevani and the BJP. Crowdfunding platform crowdnewsing.com raised Rs 20.5 lakh for his campaign. By the time of the election, Mevani had polished his oratory skills, having spoken at multiple forums in the one year period since the Una incident. Four teams were canvassing for himhis aides from Ahmedabad, activists and volunteers from Delhi, the local communities in Vadgam, and the Congress cadre.In retrospect, Mevani admits that he spent more time convincing people why they should vote the BJP out than talking about the change he intended to bring. We didnt elaborate on what we would do. My positive campaign was inbuilt in my image. I believe that I got 4,000 votes only on my credibility, he says.The BJP claimed that Mevani was an outsider; that he had accepted funding from the Social Democratic Party of India, a political wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), which has been accused of terror links (Mevani denied the charges); and that he was using Muslims for votes. The last charge stemmed from Mevanis interview published in the Forward Press, which quoted him saying that his first girlfriend was a Muslim.Mevanis victory was a vindication for his supporters not just in Gujarat but across the nation. At the all-India level, the anti-right forces are in search of some spark. They have found that in Jignesh. His position in Gujarat is reinforced with his national position, says Ahmedabad-based sociologist Ghanshyam Shah. If Muslims wanted someone whose hand they could hold, they have found that person.VADGAM IN WAITINGThe people who have been part of his journey so far or who have monitored his trajectory seem to know where he is faltering and the pitfalls that lie in his way forward as an MLA.He should watch his words. The radicalism he shows at times makes him vulnerable. Else the government will file cases against him and he will find himself entangled in legal battles, Sanjay Bhave echoes a concern shared by almost all of Mevanis well-wishers. Now he should rise above Modi-bashing and talk about concrete issues, he adds.He will have to cut down on travel and concentrate on his constituency. Now people have expectations from Jignesh Mevani, the MLA. He has to deliver. He cant continue to only be an orator, says Nirjari Sinha.Ghanshyam Shah suggests that Mevani should have a panoramic view of society and politics and move ahead accordingly. Currently, all the information he is getting is from the media. For long-term politics, he should have a group or a think tank which dispassionately reflects on the ground situation.Mevani says that the one criticism he has got the mostthat he should be less aggressive  is not unwarranted. I agree with this, he says. But the problem is that I wont remain who I am if I start working on this. This is who I am.About the charge that he over-travels, he says, Me going to various states energises the youth and Dalit groups. I should keep doing that but not at the cost of Vadgam.THE JUBILATIONIt will be some weeks before Mevani overcomes the euphoria of the resounding win that caught his aides and the country by surprise.Mevani is still getting used to being addressed as MLA saheb. I bought 10 new kurtas, all of different colours. I like wearing them with folded sleeves, with a wrist watch on my left hand. I flash the victory sign like a neta (politician) does. I am quite enjoying this. His eyes sparkle. But the feeling has not sunk in as yet.Mevani underplays the congratulatory phone calls and the meeting with the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi before the election. He describes it as a Hi, hello meeting. He is still getting accustomed to his new role  learning how to greet people, how to listen to them, how to become a leader his followers can admire and look up to.Like the bunch of students who surround him at the dhaba in JNU, vying for selfies with him, cautioning him, in awe of him, and waiting for him to prove them right. Responding to each one of them, Mevani seems like a leader at the start of an eventful and uncertain voyage. I am also a brand now, a force to reckon with, he says in a matter-of-fact tone."

The past few years have witnessed surplus production of potatoes in the state. This, however, has not been adequately transported to other states.This glut in production and no buyers due to demonetisation over the past two seaons had led to a crash in prices. Against a production cost of around Rs 5per kg, potato is selling at Rs 2 per kg in the wholesale market.The price crash is a cyclical occurence in the state, but demonetisation had aggaravated the crisis. Doaba has 93% of the states sown area of the crop at 80,000 hectares of 86,000.

The decision to export the crop was taken during a meeting of members of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) with financial commissioner, development, Vishwajeet Khanna earlier this week.Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) will be the assisting agency.

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

(Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav) Two of the accused in Lucknow on Saturday. (Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav)RULING OUT that farmers were behind potatoes being dumped on Lucknow roads on January 6, the police on Saturday arrested two persons and booked six others, including two Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav went on to rebuke the state police, saying he would honour Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar with Yash Bharti award for this achievement when his party came to power. On Saturday, the SSP said that while Kannauj residents Ankit Singh and Santosh Pal were arrested on Friday, Shivendra Singh, Deependra Singh, Sandeep Yadav, Sanju Katiyar, Pradeep Singh and Jai Kumar Tiwari were booked on the charge of mischief by injury to public road.He added that Shivendra Singh and Jai Kumar Tiwari are SP leaders. Barring Santosh Pal  who drove the truck that dumped the potatoes  all were friends, said the SSP. Calling it an act of political conspiracy, Kumar said Shivendra had unsuccessfully contested the recent urban local body polls for the post of nagar panchayat chairman in Kannaujs Tirwa area on an SP ticket. Jai Kumar, too, contested for the chairmans post for municipal board from Kannauj on an SP ticket. Another accused, Sanju, is the husband of Shilpi Katiyar, who had won the zila panchayat chairperson election on a SP ticket from Kannauj.With the help of CCTV footage, we arrested Ankit Singh and Santosh Pal, said the SSP. He claimed that while Shivendra and Sanju purchased the potatoes from a cold storage in Kannaujs Thathia area, Sandeep hired Santosh and arranged two SUVs. Deependra, Pradeep and Jai Kumar helped load the potatoes in the truck, he added.They reached Lucknow in the SUVs early January 6 and followed the truck, which started throwing potatoes from the 1090 crossing on Lohia Path they covered areas near the VVIP guesthouse and the Raj Bhavan crossing the last consignment was dumped outside the Vidhan Sabha building, Kumar added.Later in the day, Akhilesh took on the SSP, saying: The SSP should better concentrate on law and order and arrest criminals I will give Yash Bharti to SSP for this achievement (of arrest).He added: Jis tareeke se sarkar ka ravaiyya hai us se kanoon vyavastha nahi theek hone wali jinhe kanoon vyavastha dekhna hai wo aaloo ki vyavastha dekh rahe hain Jinhe kanoon vyavastha sambhalna hai wo apne aaloo liye ghoom rahe hain ke humne aaloo ke kisano ko pakad liya (Such attitude of the government will not improve the law and order situation those who have to look after law and order, they are busy in handling the potato business they are roaming around with potatoes and claiming that they have arrested the potato farmers).Akhilesh claimed that even if those responsible for the protest did contest elections on SP tickets, there is nothing wrong in it, as they are raising the voice of potato farmers. He added that he will ask SP leaders to fill gunny bags with potatoes and gift the same to all district magistrates on January 27. The government still has enough time to purchase potatoes from farmers, Akhilesh said.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

SSNNL blamed the limited water availability in the dam and poor monsoon in catchment areas of the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.Hitting back at the Gujarat government for unilaterally deciding to stop the flow of Narmada water for irrigating summer crops in the state, a farmers body on Saturday said the move will adversely hit thousands of farmers in north and central Gujarat districts. Gujarat Khedut Samaj has claimed that the water meant for irrigation was being diverted for industrial use during the summer season.The organisations secretary, Sagar Rabari, has also threatened to take legal steps against the state governments decision. We feel that the move to cut Narmada water for the farmers is a kind of revenge taken by the state government after the BJP suffered heavy electoral losses in the rural areas in the just concluded state assembly elections, Rabari said.The Gujarat Khedut Samaj said while the industries  who are last in the ladder of Narmada project beneficiaries  will continue to get water throughout the upcoming summer season, it is farmers who will bear the brunt of the state governments decision.On Friday, the state government-run Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) issued a circular alerting farmers not to take up the cultivation of summer crops as Narmada waters meant for irrigation will be available only till March 15, 2018. SSNNL blamed the limited water availability in the dam and poor monsoon in catchment areas of the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.The Narmada dam had overflowed on July 27, 2017, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attended a ceremony where he dedicated the project to the nation after radial gates were installed on top of the dam. Where has all the water from the dam gone? The state government should provide answers, says Rabari. He claimed that the water level in the Narmada dam stood at 118 metres on December 31, 2017.Secondly, the Narmada project was designed to be a drinking water project where water allocation to industries was the last priority. So, if the farmers are not going to get water, then will the supply of Narmada water to industries be stopped? Rabari added.The representatives from the organisation claimed that the SSNL was non-transparent with regard to how much water it was currently supplying to farmers, how much was kept for drinking purpose and how much was being supplied to industries. We are not sure how many farmers will be affected by the state governments decision, but those in Mehsana, Surendranagar, Patan, Botad and Bhavnagar growing crops like bajra, jowar, watermelons, sweet potato and fodder will be affected, Rabari said, alleging that the state government, faced with water deficit, was diverting precious water meant for irrigation to industries in Sanand, Vagra, Kutch, Jamnagar and other industrial estates operated by the GIDCs.The government is already supplying more than the 0.2 million acre feet water of the Narmada meant for the industries, he said, adding that the demand for water from industries in Gujarat had surpassed the water allocation way back in 2014.There are three distinguished agriculture seasons in Gujarat  kharif, rabi and the summer season. Out of the 125 lakh hectares of gross cropped area, 70 per cent is cultivated under kharif crops, 25 per cent under rabi and only five per cent under summer crops.According to the figures sourced from the agriculture department of Gujarat, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017 which largely included crops like bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Most of the summer crops are sown in north and central Gujarat districts.Meanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has also criticised the move of the state government to stop Narmada waters for summer crop irrigation. Manish Doshi, the party spokesperson, said that due to the incomplete canal network, the government was forced to divert the excess water during the monsoon to the sea.The benefits of closing the radial gates and generating hydro power will go to the neighbouring states. The real deal for Gujarat in this project is the water of the river, he said.Before the elections, the state government organised a Narmada Mahotsav and went around the state talking about how the project has benefited the farmers. Now, just a month after the completion of polls, waters meant for irrigation have been stopped. This will adversely affect the farmers, Doshi said. He added that the government should, in turn, impose a cut on supply of water to industries and divert it for irrigation.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads..., Gandhi said at a public meeting in Salon.He was referring to Modis poll promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen by cracking down on black money, if voted to power.He alleged that a step-motherly treatment was being meted out to Rae Bareli, his mother, Sonia Gandhis parliamentary constituency, and Amethi. He promised to restore the mega food park in Rae Bareli and other development projects once Congress was voted back to power.Farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce. They grow potato and mint but had been denied remunerative price. Farmers were committing suicide and throwing away their potato, he said.Rahul Gandhi went to Hanuman temple situated on the borders of Rae Bareli with Lucknow. Rahul also donated khichri on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. He also stopped for a cup of tea at Nigoha near Rae Bareli.Modi and Yogi for giving long speeches - Both of them believed in putting people against each other. They can not claim of launching a scheme that may have benefited the people.Had the food park -- scrapped by the Modi government -- been set up in Amethi, farmers in Rae Bareli, Amethi and other districts would have been benefitted, he told a gathering in nearby Pratapgarh.They are meting out a step-motherly treatment to you. They snatch away whatever development plan comes here and hurt you, said Gandhi.The 47-year-old called upon people to gear up for Uttar Pradesh polls and the Lok Sabha election due in 2019.The Congress had tied up with the Samajwadi Party for the 2017 UP election but was wiped out, with the BJP storming to power with a brute majority.Gujarat, where his party put up an impressive show but couldnt dislodge the ruling BJP, also found a mention in Gandhis address.Illustrating the alleged failure of the Modi model of development, he said. Ninety per cent universities in Gujarat are in private hands. A youth told me that students need to pay Rs 15 lakh to get admission there. he said.POSTER WARA poster war seems to have erupted ahead of Congress chief visit. While some posters depicted Rahul as Lord Krishna, others questioned his work as MP. The posters that were critical of the Congress chief, however, disappeared soon.A group of youth, holding placards questioning Gandhi and reminding him of his promise to connect Salon with rail, was chased away by Congress leaders before the arrival of party chief, sources said."
5aeb24ae9855b73f522c74d5,PM Narendra Modi’s move on FDI underlines RSS faultlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pm-modis-move-on-100-fdi-in-single-brand-retail-underlines-rss-faultlines-5019924/,2018-01-11,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the BJP headquarters on Monday. (Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal) Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the BJP headquarters on Monday. (Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal)Prime Minister Narendra Modi governments decision to permit 49 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Air India and allow 100% FDI in single-brand retail with liberalized sourcing norms, may not be economically significant, but is of outsized symbolic importance because of its potential to aggravate the faultlines within the RSS Sangh Parivar.The degree of government intervention in economic activity, especially the role of foreign investment, has long been a deeply contested matter within the Sangh Parivar. The BJPs current FDI policy is best summed up by the Prime Ministers promise of red carpet, not red tape for foreign investors.The liberalization of FDI limits and easing of regulatory requirements, such as permitting greater FDI via the automatic route, the policy thrust of the Modi government has been unmistakable. The RSS economic affiliates, especially the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) and its labour union, the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), have been critical of the governments FDI liberalization policies.The SJM has vocally contested the governments assertion that FDI is a means to boost growth and generate employment. But, unlike during the Vajpayee government, a modus vivendi has been worked out between the Sanghs economic affiliates and its political arm, the BJP, to air policy differences behind closed doors rather than taking disagreements to the street.Nevertheless, yesterdays decisions could exacerbate the aforesaid faultlines because they impinge upon the Sanghs ideological verities: preferring economic interests of mom-and-pop retail stores. Throughout its history, the BJP has had a robust debate on the role of foreign investment in the economy  a debate that, until recently, lacked a counterpart within the RSS. The RSS was implacably opposed to FDI because it was perceived as inimical to traditional Indian values. The RSS believed that foreign investment would infuse into the national bloodstream culturally alien values of consumerism and sybaritic hedonism.The RSS feared that an economy dominated by impersonal market forces would undermine local economic activity which, it believed, was key to sustain bonds of family and community. The SJM was established in 1991 as a response to former prime minister and Congress leader P V Narasimha Raos reforms to advocate for economic self-sufficiency because the Sangh feared that greater foreign investment would lead to a ceding of economic sovereignty to multinationals. The second coming of the East India Company was a common trope used in SJMs arguments justifying investment protectionism. Because small traders and North Indian trading communities were the core of RSS support base, the opposition of FDI in retail was an ideological totem for the Sangh.The rapid expansion of the Sangh has changed its social composition. Most of the new entrants into the RSS are urban professionals or members of upwardly mobile social groups. The new joiners do not share SJMs autarkic or statist proclivities. The younger members of the RSS are more accepting of foreign investment and recognize FDIs criticality in a resource-constrained economy.Also Read | Modi opens up FDI before he meets Trump at Davos, but has the show already moved to China?Moreover, the political needs of the BJP, especially the imperatives of employment generation for sustained electoral success, also moderated the RSS stance on FDI. Younger BJP leaders with RSS provenance  Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis or Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, for example  have been enthusiastic supporters of greater foreign investment.Unlike during the time of former RSS chief or Sarsanghachalak K S Sudarshan (2000-2009), the current RSS leadership rarely delivers rhetorical broadsides against FDI. Signaling a reevaluation of the RSS stance on FDI and economic liberalization, the current Sarsanghachalak, Mohan Bhagwat, had contended in November 2013 that the organization was not bound by dogma and was willing to change with the times.The softening of the RSS once implacable opposition to FDI created a faultline between pragmatists and traditionalists within the RSS, and exacerbated disagreements between the BJP and RSS economic affiliates.Notwithstanding a greater acceptance of FDI, the RSS remains firm in its opposition to FDI in retail, especially multi-brand retail. Apart from hurting the economic interests of a key part of its support base, that is North Indian trading communities, the RSS believes that undermining the economic viability of small traders would be inegalitarian.The RSS prefers small trading businesses because it believes that these enterprises treat employees as an extension of the owners family (jajman), and a concern of employee welfare is at par with pecuniary considerations. To be sure, the tweaks to the Modi governments policy in retail announced yesterday are relatively minor. Earlier 100% foreign investment in single-brand retail was already permitted, albeit with government approval for increasing stake beyond 49%. Now, government approval will no longer be needed as all 100% FDI in single-brand retail will be cleared automatically.Similarly, allowing 49% FDI in Air India could hasten its privatization  a hot potato the Modi government had been careful to avoid in its first three years. Privatization had long been a sticking point within the BJP and the Sangh Parivar.Ram Naik, the current governor of Uttar Pradesh and Petroleum Minister during the regime of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, had reportedly resisted Vajpayees attempts to privatize public sector oil companies. In fact, Dattopant Thengadi, an influential Sangh ideologue and the founder of the SJM, had termed Vajpayee governments move to privatize BALCO as anti-national.Certainly, the battle isnt over yet. As the privatization of Air India neared fruition over the last several months, the BMS warned the government of a major confrontation. Air Indias privatization, especially to a partly foreign-owned entity, will be vehemently opposed by it and the SJM, because these issues have been an ideological totem for the RSS.Perhaps Prime Minister Modis decision to open up FDI could deepen faultlines over economic issues within the RSS and among its affiliates. But it is certainly a manifestation of the PMs determination to push through another liberal economic reform in the face of rising demands for a shift in governments focus to alleviating economic discontents. Does this mean that the PM has taken this decision with the support of the RSS highest decision-making body?The answer to that question could make the politics of the BJP-RSS clearer as the Modi government moves to present its last full Budget before elections are held just over a year from now.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

(Express photo by Sahil Walia) The biodegradable bags turn into compost after six months if exposed to water or sun or disposed. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)THE PUNJAB Pollution Control Board (PPCB) Tuesday launched biodegradable carry bags made from granules of potato and cornstarch in Ludhiana. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, while launching the bags with PPCB officials, appealed to the masses to shun plastic bags.PPCB chief Kahan Singh Pannu said these bags were produced from starch granules which can be derived from potatoes, corn and other starch rich products. Currently, five companies have been given licence by the Centre to manufacture these bags. They are based in Bengaluru, Chennai and other places out of Punjab. So we have tied up with them and getting bags on basis of orders, he said.The biodegradable bags turn into compost after six months if exposed to water or sun or disposed.The bags are costlier compared to plastic ones. Price is a little higher because demand is less and there are not many suppliers. But as soon as common people will start adopting them as the substitute for plastic, they will be cheaper. We are making these bags available in small quantity as of now to plastic bags sellers here so that people can start buying them, said GS Gill, environmental engineer, PPCB Ludhiana.PPCB added that at least 225 tonnes of plastic bags were currently used in Punjab on a daily basis of which 130 tonnes are used in Ludhiana. This, even as plastic usage is completely banned in Punjab. On Tuesday, plastic manufacturers were also invited at the launch and appealed to shift from plastic bags manufacturing to these biodegradable bags.Pannu said PPCB is trying to popularise these bags which turn into compost, among the masses. We are holding awareness drives on daily basis. We are facilitating tie-up of manufacturing companies with plastic manufacturers here so that they can study the product and plan manufacturing in future, he said.MP Bittu also advised plastic carry bag manufacturers to shift towards manufacturing of compostable carry bags by using starch derived from maize and potatoes.Earlier, the Golden Temple in Amritsar has announced usage of these bags to give prasad. On Tuesday, Mastuana Sahib gurudwara in Sangrur district also started usage of these bags for giving prasad to devotees. PPCB said that till now 500 kg of these bags were provided in Sangrur and Barnala.For all the latest Ludhiana News, download Indian Express App"

With the meeting between Kim and Trump on the horizon, she said she hoped the struggles of North Koreans were not buried in the push to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.Walking through the Korean War Memorial in Washington, Grace Jo remembers a pivotal point in her childhood in North Korea, what she calls the almost dying moment.On the brink of starvation, she and her brother burned so hot with fever that they could only find relief on the cold concrete floor of their home in rural North Korea. Another time they were so hungry, Jo said, that they ate six newborn mice found under a stone.Memories like those keep the 26-year-old Jo from placing much faith in North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns bid for peace talks after years of threatening his neighbors and the United States with his nuclear arsenal.He will meet with President Donald Trump on June 12 in Singapore in the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader.If the North Korean government doesnt drop the bombs around their other neighbor countries, that doesnt mean its actual peace for North Korean people, Jo said in a recent interview. Inside of North Korea, there are thousands of people that will still die and keep dying in the future. So I dont really call it a peace treaty.North Korea, in announcing last month a suspension of nuclear and missile tests, said it wanted to concentrate on markedly improving its socialist economy and the living standards of its people.THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLENow an American citizen, Jo arrived in the United States in 2008 as a refugee, one of about 200 North Korean refugees who have been resettled here.Severe famine in North Korea in the 1990s took its toll on Jos family. She said her two younger brothers died of starvation, as did her grandmother, whose dying wish for a potato went unfulfilled. Jos older sister disappeared. Her father escaped to China to find food. Caught, he was returned to North Korea. He was tortured and starved to death in a North Korean jail in 1997, she said.When Jo was 6, her mother decided the only hope for her and her two remaining daughters was to forge a new life in China, where they lived a secretive and transient existence for 10 years. They were returned several times to North Korea and were tortured, Jo said.Their luck turned when a Korean-American pastor raised money to bribe North Korean officials for their release. In 2008, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) took the family from China and settled them as refugees in the United States.Jo is a college student in Maryland and works as an assistant in a dentists office, but also helps run NKinUSA, an organization her sister founded to help rescue North Koreans from their country and establish new lives.With the meeting between Kim and Trump on the horizon, she said she hoped the struggles of North Koreans were not buried in the push to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.Whatever the leaders decide, I hope the U.S. government can bring up the humanitarian issues and think about the people in North Korea, Jo said.

Rain upto 22.6 mm was recorded in various parts of Chandigarh. The temperature dropped till 18Celsius from a maximum of 33.7C on Sunday.Humidity between 50-70% is expected in the region on Monday. The Indian Meteorological Department said more rain on Monday was unlikely although isolated spells of light rain will be experienced throughout the week. The in-charge of IMD Chandigarh, Suresh Paul, said, The temperature is also set to fall and the maximum temperature of the day will come down to 30C.This rainfall and drop in temperature was also seen in Chandigarh last year. In fact, last year on this date, the temperature ranged between 32.5C and 16.6C, which is lesser than the 33.7C to 18C recorded by IMD on Monday.The weather turned pleasant following the rain, which lasted for around one hour. The sky however, remained overcast.It was quite dark when we were leaving for school on Monday morning. The rain came soon after. It was very pleasant, Jaskaran, a Class 10 student of a private school, told IANS.Not so merry for farmersDoaba Continuing strong winds and rain from late Sunday night to Monday morning lashed parts of north India, adding to farmers woes and delaying harvesting of rabi crops.Agriculture experts in the region said such sudden change in weather was indeed worrisome for the farmers as it brought down the standing wheat crop in several places.Heavy rain continued in most part of Doaba region on Monday morning. If the rain continues for the next few hours, about 10% of the wheat crop could face yield loss, the experts added.I have asked the field officers to report from their areas to know about the exact damage to the crop. In most of the areas, crop have been flattened and it will delay harvesting, agriculture officer from Doaba Naresh Gulati said.A farmer from Jalandhar, Amanveer Singh, said most of the crop on his two acre land was down following rain and hail. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintal per acre. The crop was ready for harvesting and the losses will be huge, said another farmer Hardev Singh from Kapurthala.Majha Although the weather remained cloudy in Majha on Sunday night with wind and showers reported from some areas, the sun shone in the morning on Monday.However, there were some reports of damage o crops from the areaFor Monday, the maximum temperature will remain at 36Celsius and the minimum at 22Celsius. However, it is expected to fall by four or five degrees on Tuesday with moderate or heavy rain, as per the forecast of meteorological department.An agriculture expert, Dr Partap Singh, said rains are harmful not only for wheat, but also for vegetables and potato crop as dry weather and high temperature is the present requirement.He said the farmers should not water wheat crop as rain is forecast from Tuesday to Thursday this week.Patiala The agriculture department has rushed its teams to different areas to access damage to crops.Not only the standing crop, but even wheat yield unloaded at purchasing centres will also suffer an increase in moisture level due to the rains. Chief agriculture officer Arvinder Singh said farmers cannot harvest the crop till the fields get dry.Hail batters apple orchards in HimachalShimla In the last 24 hours, rainfall, thunderstorm accompanied by hail battered the cash crops in parts of Himachal Pradesh.Capital town Shimla, apple growing districts  Shimla, Mandi, Kullu  have been receiving rain, accompanied by sleet, hails, thunderstorm, high velocity winds, for the last 24 hours, causing damage to apple blooms in many areas. Kotkhai is one of the worst affected regions in the state.In the last one week, it is the third time that hail has pounded apple orchards in the region, said NR Thakur, an apple grower of Kullu district.In lower and mid hills, apple is at the blooming stage and low temperature, rain and hailstorm are going to harm the crop and impact the fruit adversely, said horticulture expert SP Bhardwaj.Parts of the state received light to moderate rain while heavy rain lashed some villages in the state.Heavy rainfall also partially damaged three houses in Jajaid village of Shimla district. There are also reports of minor damages to apple orchards and houses due to the current weather.Meanwhile, Shimla meteorological centre has predicted more rain in the next 24 hours. Till now, 5mm rainfall was recorded across the state. Light to moderate rains accompanied by hailstorm is likely in the next six to eight hours in parts of the state, said Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh. He said the day temperature has decreased by four to five degrees at various places.About the effect of rainfall on wheat, Manmohan said, The rainfall is likely to delay the wheat crop harvesting in low regions. Over mid-hill rainfall is beneficial because wheat is in the stage of milky to dough. However, in lower hills, it will have a negative effect as the crop is already mature.(with agency inputs)(to be updated)"

The unsold produce soon turned into heaps of rotten slush.Singh says he sold 40 quintals for Rs 2,306 to a local trader, meaning he got Rs 57.65 a quintal. It was the worst year as long as I can remember, he says.The potato crisis of 2017 had to do with a knee-jerk farm trade policy that tends to clamp down on exports at the slightest hint of rising consumer prices. In June 2014, to rein in potato prices, the government imposed a minimum export price on potatoes, put the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act and also allowed duty-free imports. This choked off exports and caused domestic prices to crash amid a potato glut of 48 million tonnes.To avoid such disasters, India is now looking to setup a national agriculture trade policy, similar to the countrys three-year foreign trade policies. The farm exports policy will be geared towards promoting exports rather than them being used as a tool to control domestic prices, a person familiar with the development said.Last month, the commerce ministry unveiled a draft national agriculture export policy in step with the governments target of doubling farmers incomes. It has sought to boost agricultural exports from $30 billion currently to nearly $60 billion by 2022.Consultations among stakeholders, including the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), began this month. Key proposals include ensuring processed agricultural products and all organic produce will be free of export restrictions in future. The agriculture and food ministries will also identify food items which will be permanently free from export controls.The government may form a trade perspective over a 5-10 year period and undertake a mid-term review of agriculture trade policy... the official said.The agriculture ministry, along with APEDA, has identified 50 farm export clusters, the official said. The Centre will soon hold consultations with states to standardise taxes in local markets for export-oriented produce, he said. For instance, local market taxes vary widely for basmati rice, a key export commodity. It is 4% in Punjab and Haryana and 1.6% in Rajasthan. For pulses, the fees are 1% in Maharashtra and 2.5% in UP.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. Farm economist Ashok Gulati says knee-jerk export restrictions on food items to prevent domestic inflation have deprived farmers of higher prices in the global market. A paper by Gulati, Infosys chair professor and Shweta Saini, who works with policy think tank ICRIER, analysed 10-year data to show that Indias agri trade policy had a pro-consumer bias. The governments Doubling Farmers Income also says Indias exports policy does not promote agricultural trade but is mainly used to control prices in the domestic market. According to the new draft policy, a three-year ban on non-basmati rice exports during 2008-11 amid a rice glut led to a notional loss of $5.6 billion."

It also left behind a trail of destruction, uprooting trees, bringing down electricity poles, and damaging houses.The weather improved on Thursday and officials remained busy restoring broken water supply and power lines. The weather department, however, said there were chances of rain in some parts of the state in the next 24 hours.According to state disaster and mitigation centre, two persons were killed due to thunderstorm related incidents in the Kumaon region. One Ajay Kumar (32) was killed after a tree fell on him on Almora  Jageshwar highway on Wednesday noon. Another Md Arif was crushed to death by an oncoming vehicle, which he failed to spot in sudden squall in US Nagar district. Arif was returning home after closing his shop in Kelakhera area.The sudden rain also put on halt for some time the ongoing Chardham pilgrimage. Officials, however, claimed that normalcy was restored after debris were cleared particularly in Chamoli and Utttarkashi districts. There were reports of a cloud burst in Narayan Bagar of Chamoli after rainwater brought down tonnes of debris. The Chamoli police, however, denied the cloud burst. In an official communiqu it said some vehicles were trapped as the rain and debris blocked Badrinath highway. The highway has been cleared now.Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat toured Narayan Bagar area. He accused the officials of being least concerned towards restoring normalcy in the area.In Dehradun, the storm uprooted many trees. The high-speed winds also had an effect on the electricity supply. The villages in the Jaunpur area near Mussoorie were reeling in the dark. Reports suggested electricity and water supply had also been affected in Nainital, Haldwani and several other locations in the interiors.Meanwhile, a fresh Western Disturbance is approaching and likely to affect Western Himalayan region from May 5, warned the Uttarakhand metrological centre.The untimely rains and storm since Sunday left an adverse impact on the fruit flowering in Uttarakhand, officials said .

By CSE's reckoning, I should be as safe as a fire extinguisher.But I could actually be drop-dead unhealthy since the last 3% of me consists of samosas, chaat, pav bhaji, dosas and parathas.

The only Indian brand visible is also a chain, Haldiram's. But the bulk of finger-lickin' good unhealthy food is produced by the informal sector, on the street. It is not advertised or promoted, and still sells out. Like movements against corruption and nuclear power, this sector is difficult to engage with precisely because it is informal. There is no corporate face to heckle, no visible head to cut off. But not to try at all is a cop-out, neglecting the majority who do not patronise food chains.That's one problem with the debate. The other is that it lost the plot on day one. The CSE report was a sophisticated guided missile locked onto a specific target. It claimed that food corporations are mislabelling or misrepresenting products in a manner which threatens public health. A serious matter in a country which may be heading for a public health crisis, led by an escalation in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.The priorities should have been peer review and confirmatory replication of the study, followed by punitive action against corporations guilty of concealment or misrepresentation. Instead, the matter was referred to the uproar of TV debate, where the missile's guidance chip overheated and it veered off on irrelevant tangents, including the need to ban fast food from schools.Uttar Pradesh has gone and done that already but bans are a bad idea in principle, whether we're talking books, alcohol or potato chips - which go very well together, incidentally. Enforcement of standards and informed consumer choice serve the purpose better. Instead, there was a lot of sound and fury, after which some corporations named in the CSE report smugly reported that their sales were unaffected.Does this mean that apart from a vocal minority of bleeding-ulcer progressives, Indians don't care about what they consume? That's difficult to believe, since a 2003 CSE report on pesticides in soft drinks had sparked off public demonstrations. But there's a difference between the two cases. Consumers were shocked to learn that soft drinks were contaminated. But when they order a burger meal, they know what they're asking for.CSE's report suggests that they don't know the whole truth. But the patron of a paratha stand may know even less. So we need full disclosure for packaged food and better public education about unbranded food. Thus armed, if consumers still choose to assassinate themselves with burgers and bhaturas, they will soon have the right to do so. The government plans to decriminalise premeditated suicide.Pratik Kanjilal is publisher of The Little MagazineThe views expressed by the author are personal"
