This year the government revised and raised the MSP/MIP to Rs 549 per quintal.A low production in various states, including West Bengal, the second largest potato grower after UP, and various incentives offered by the state government for other states to buy potato from UP to help farmers get better price are being seen among main reasons for the potato prices shooting up in UP.While UPs production fell only slightly to around 150 lakh MT from 155 lakh MT last year, the production in West Bengal and Bihar, the other potato growers, has dropped significantly creating more demand for UPs potato there, said a senior horticulture department official. UP produces more than 30% of the countrys potato.Many southern states are said to have sourced potato from UP availing the governments incentives including one on transportation.As per the estimates, there are little chances of the potato prices coming down this year. Many farmers store potato at their home and keep on supplying the same to mandis but once the supply of this kind of potato ends after May, the price may even go up further, said DN Pandey, an ex-official of the horticulture department.The prevailing high prices of potato to much of the benefit of farmers must have come as a big relief to the BJP government that had been under attack from the opposition for the potato growers facing hardships due to their not getting the proper price. The issue was much in news when some farmers allegedly threw potatoes outside the CM residence and the Raj Bhawan as a mark of protest. The BJP had blamed the Samajwadi Party (SP) of stage managing the protests."

But the controversy at hand is perilously sensitive, conceivably volatile and seriously scrappy. Nevertheless, I am gallantly going to raise the question, so here goes: Is the vada pao (hold your breath), a traditional Maharashtrian food or not?Oh dear me I can hear the faint sounds of utensils clashing, the feel of heat sizzling and a faraway murmur even as I speak these words. Is that the sound of turmoil or is it just the sound of hot oil. Well, like all civilised people do, lets chat about this.The vada pao is Mumbais go-to food, and you dont need me to tell you that. But is the chauvinism slightly misplaced? I can only speak from personal memory. When I was a kid, in the early 70s, there was only batata vada, and no such thing as a vada pao.In fact the pao or bread was taboo in most Hindu homes till as late as the 1950s. Only Christians, Parsis and Muslims ate bread. Rumour has it that Portuguese missionaries in 15th-century Goa would throw bread into Hindu wells at night, and when Hindus drank the water the next morning, the missionaries would proclaim You have now become Christians.This much-loved working-class snack was created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, Dadar. Or so they say. (HT File Photo)In a traditional Maharashtrian restaurant like Prakash Shakahari Upahar Kendra at Dadar  where the iconic batata vada is a big fat ball of mashed potato spiced with green chilies, turmeric, curry leaves and mustard seeds, doused in batter and deep-fried till its a crispy gold; and where the time-honoured misal is dark and dangerously spiced with garam masala and raw onions  if you dare ask for pao to go with either, the waiter will stare you down with disdain and flatly refuse.So then when did the vada acquire the pao and assume the mantle of Mumbais most identifiable food?The most plausible story traces it back to a batata vada seller outside Dadar station, in the early 70s. The food cart was poised right in the centre of hundreds of hungry commuters rushing about at a pace only Mumbai demands. His snack was in great demand, but the piping hot batata vadas were impossible to eat on the run.As the story goes, this enterprising vendor decided to find a way to make it portable. Right next to him was a street cart selling omelette-pao. He observed how an omelette could quickly be sandwiched between a pao, and taken away.The legend goes that he borrowed some bread from the omelette-pao-walla, threw in some garlic chutney and bunged in a batata vada. And lo and behold, the vada pao was born.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.This working-class snack, created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, was soon to become a staple food, a political symbol, a favourite in one of Londons most happening eateries and the only Indian dish that I could find at the foot of Mount Titlis in Switzerland. Salut, vada pao."

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Agra, Moradabadright? Wrong!Its Kasganj, the district that made headlines after communal riots took place there on January 26 this year, having the fourth highest per capita GDP in the state after Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida), Meerut and Lucknow.The department of economics and statistics has prepared total and per capital GDP of all the 75 districts taking the constant and current prices of 2015-16 into account and treating 2011-12 as the base year. The resultant GDP figures circulated to commissioners and DMs on February 22, 2018 show that at Rs 71,294, the per capita GDP of Kasganj is almost equal to that of Lucknow, Rs 71,846.The per capita GDP of Kasganj, a little-known district carved out of Etah in 2008, is next only to Gautam Buddh Nagar that tops the chart at staggering Rs 3,68,081 and Meerut with second highest per capita GDP at Rs 88,273. Even developed districts like Ghaziabad ( Rs 64,907), Kanpur Nagar (Rs 57,308), Aligarh ( Rs 47,849) and Agra ( Rs 68,795) are all behind Kasganj.Explaining the probable reasons for Kasganjs remarkable per capita GDP, director, economics and statistics, AK Pawar said growth in livestock production, especially buffalo meat, rise in minerals and potato production etc during that particular year(2015-16) could have contributed to a high GDP.In 2014-15 also, Kasganj was on the sixth position but this time it has found a place among the states top five districts with regard to per capita GDP, he said adding A higher GDP obviously shows an overall prosperity of a district.Further analysis of the GDP figures shows that while western UP comprising 30 districts has the highest per capita GDP at Rs 62,386, eastern UP with 27 districts has the lowest GDP at Rs 32,360, which is worse than Bundelkhands per capita GDP of Rs 44,446. Central region with 10 districts under it has a per capital GDP of Rs 44,372.Orai in western region, Rae Bareli in Central region, Banda in Bundelkhand and Bahraich in eastern region were found to have the lowest per capita GDP at Rs 31,841, Rs 30,993, Rs 26394 and Rs 21914, respectively.Further analysis revealed that barring five of the 27 districts, no other district in eastern UP has even half the GDP of Kasganj. The five eastern UP districts whose GDP is more than half of Kasganjs GDP are Allahabad, Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur and Basti."

Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

The association said that being badly treated has become the norm for civil servants serving in the Capital since the formation of the AAP government in February 2015 and is symptomatic of what both sides now admit is a problematic relationship.Harassment of members of the bureaucracy has, gradually, become just another part of the job for civil servants serving in Delhi. Resolutions were passed in only very serious episodes, irrespective of the affiliation of the accused member of the political executive. Many similar instances went unreported but are now gradually coming out, said a senior Delhi government official.The first resolution passed by the association pertained to the alleged physical assault meted out to District Magistrate (north-west) Sanjay Goel by local residents of a village where and anti-encroachment drive was undertaken by him.In the resolution, the association said that the Secretary to the Lok Sabha MP from North West Delhi had a hand in the episode.At loggerheadsThe officers had asked the Chief Minister, Lieutenant-Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to consider providing additional security to officials undertaking such tasks in future.The rest of the resolutions, the association said, pertained to illegal actions of AAP leaders and functionaries. On December 31, 2015, bureaucrats serving in the Delhi government went on mass leave to protest against the suspension of two DANICS-cadre officers.The action was taken against Yashpal Garg, Special Secretary (Prosecution), and Subhash Chandra, posted in the Home Department, for refusing to sign on a Cabinet decision file pertaining to a proposed increase in the salary of public prosecutors. Around 200 DANICS officers participated in the mass leave while 70 IAS officers went on half-day leave to show solidarity. The MHA later rendered the suspension orders null and void.On October 17, 2017, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal hit out at the bureaucracy and said that 90% of IAS officers dont work and that they tend to create obstacles when it comes to getting work done.Terming his comments derogatory, the outfit condemned the statements and other in similar vein such as IAS officers should be kept on adhoc basis and equating the IAS officers to the level of contractual employees, among others.The Delhi government was, and continues to be, the proverbial hot potato that not many bureaucrats are in favour of handling, if given a choice. The number of bureaucrats being posted to Delhi but seeking, for instance, study leave over the last three years is unprecedented, said another official not willing to be named."

He had lost about Rs. 2.80 lakhs he had invested in potato farming withthe price of the tuber plummeting owing to overproduction. In 2016-17, 1.15 crore tonnes of potato was produced in the State which was considerably higher than the 90 lakh tonne produced the previous season.I have mortgaged jewellery and some of my lands for growing potato this season and now with the fall in price, I have no way to retrieve the property, Mr. Mofizul told The Hindu. Having lost all hopes of retrieving his investment, he had decided not to take back the 4,500 kg of potato, which he had put in cold storage.Mr. Mofizul was just one among thousands of farmers incurring huge losses owing to the fall in potato prices. From the usual price of Rs. 14 per kg, the farmers were getting just Rs. 1 this year. Apart from Purba and Paschim Bardhaman, potato was cultivated mainly in the districts of Hooghly and Bankura.The potato farmers were unwilling to take out their crop from the cold storage as they did not have the money to pay for the rent. One has to pay about Rs. 80 per sack of potato kept in the cold storage.Accusing the Trinamool Congress for the crisis, the Pradeshik Krishak Sabha, peasant wing of the CPI-M, said it would burn potatoes at Moshagram town on Wednesday."

Industry players opine that bumper production could further put market prices under pressure as the government is only procuring quality groundnuts. On the other hand, oil millers, oilseed expellers and exporters are treading cautious in purchasing the commodity as they see Rs 800 per 20 kg as viable price for profitable business. The government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg.PALANPUR: Potato growers in north Gujarat are feeding huge quantities of tubers to cattle in gau shalas in Banaskantha. With prices falling to Rs two to Rs six per 20 kg and fresh arrivals expected from January 17, the farmers who stocked their produce are now selling the crop in distress. TNN P6The groundnut production for 2017-18 is higher by 2.5 lakh metric tonnes than 2016-17. Off late, the number of farmers coming to mandis to sell their groundnut crop at market rates has decreased as the state government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg. However, delay in payment has been the major concern and hence the farmers are forced to sell of their produce at a lower price. In the APMC, Rajkot, the price range was Rs 650 to Rs 850 on Friday, which was lower than the MSP, secretary, Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Rajkot, B R Tejani said.A secretary of another APMC said the MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg is not acceptable to the traders and hence they are refusing to buy at prices at par with MSP. Further, the quality of groundnut has also taken a beating this year.Director Agriculture B M Modi admitted that the government was only purchasing quality groundnut as there are set norms for purchase of crop at MSP and hence only those groundnut which complies with the norms was purchased by the government. Agriculture minister R C Faldu was not available for his comment. Amid bumper production, procurement at MSP was hampered due to finance issues earlier and now shortage of bags has adversely affected groundnut purchase at MSP.The new government in state had taken the issue very seriously soon after taking the charge. Even in the first cabinet meeting decision were taken to purchase groundnut at MSP.In order to ensure MSP for farmers and supply to industry players, Gujarat government should follow Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojna or price deficit finance scheme adopted by Madhya Pradesh government for soyabean procurement, whereby farmers sell commodity in open market and government pays farmers the differential amount between rates in mandis and MSP. This way, the industry gets supply, farmers get MSP price and the state government does not have to bother about storage of the commodity, executive director, the Solvent Extractors Association of India, BV Mehta said."
