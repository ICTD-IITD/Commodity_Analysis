A major portion of banana farm belonging to Sugandha Raj at Ramadevarahalla village has been reduced to the ground. Savithramma, also from Ramadevarahalla, has suffered a huge loss as mango and sapota trees have been damaged.The farmers have demanded that the Forest Department drive away the elephants. We have put in a lot of effort to grow crops. When elephants damage them, our hard work and investment go waste. The department should make efforts to safeguard our farms, said Venkatesh, a farmer."

Delhi is just the right place for any such occasion, for the city is  despite all the high-rises  still peppered with vast green spaces, which often even boast of an old monument or two to add to the ambience. And when the sun shines as the temperature dips, there is nothing like a food outing.Every winter, we organise a picnic. Friends bring all kinds of food  from sandwiches and aloo puri to pasta and cold cuts. My friend Harsh is much in demand when a picnic is organised because he always carries with him delicious kachoris with a spicy potato curry. The kachoris come from a shop called Gopal Sweets Corner in north Delhi, and its fare, indeed, is mashhoor, which is the word most kachori-wallahs tend to use to describe their food.I was in the Delhi University area one evening when I thought I should look up Gopal. This is in Kamla Nagar, but at the very end of this bustling market. If you make your way from Ramjas College towards Shakti Nagar crossing, you will find Gopal on your left just before a traffic signal. Its an old shop which has given much pleasure to students, teachers and others for decades.When I used to go there many years ago, it was a tiny place. But it has grown substantially in the last few years. As always, the place was crowded to the hilt. And what surprised me was that a whole lot of people were actually eating bedmi-sabzi, which is traditionally considered a breakfast meal, late in the evening. But its one of my favourite dishes (I just had bedmi from Mahalaxmi in Chandni Chowk for lunch some days ago), so I shouldnt complain. But that day I wanted Gopals kachoris.Crispy and crunchyThe kachoris came on a plate, with a bowl of potato sabzi on the side. They added some chholey to the sabzi and then topped it with a bit of yoghurt to balance out the spices. The kachoris was deliciously crisp  and when I broke it into two, it snapped with a crunchy sound that was like music to my ears. I broke off a small piece, scooped out some hot and spicy potato curry with the chholey and popped it into my mouth. One bite of it, and I was in seventh heaven.Gopals USP is the freshness of his stuff. The kachori is fried right there and then (as is the bedmi, and the other snacks) so its deliciously crisp and khasta. Some of the food is cooked in the two new shops that Gopal has acquired, but the kachoris are fried in a huge kadhai in front of you. And that, of course, added to the taste.A plate of two bedmi puri is for Rs. 40, two pieces of kachori are for Rs. 24 and two samosas for Rs. 24. Paneer bread is for Rs. 30 and aloo bread for Rs. 18. A piece of gulab jamun is for Rs. 16 and jalebi is for Rs. 140 a kilo.I find that Gopal now has a regular menu, too, in the adjoining outlet called Gopal foods. They offer dum aloo (Rs. 140), rajma (Rs. 150) and jeera aloo (Rs. 120). Gopals special thhali with three kinds of vegetable dishes, rice, papad, raita, one rasgulla, two naans or missi rotis or lachcha parathas is for Rs. 215.Its nice to know that Gopal has expanded over the years. And its good to be assured that his kachoris are still among the best in town."

The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

He said farmers were no longer willing to grow the crop.Replying to him, the Minister said the Rabi crop saw a 1% decline in area sown this year but the actual figures would be known later as sowing was still going on. He expressed confidence that the overall area was likely to remain the same.Mr. Jhakhar was joined by other colleagues who wanted to know the steps the government had taken to help the growers. Mr. Singh said no minimum support price had been fixed but the Centre and the States resorted to the market intervention scheme (MIS) to ensure that farmers could recover their input costs in case of glut.BJP member from Amreli (Gujarat) Narayanbhai Kacchadiya highlighted the plight of the cotton growers because of inadequate prices. Pointing out that the farmer actually got about Rs. 900 against Rs. 1,200 for production for 20 kg, he wanted to know the steps taken to help the farmer.The Minister replied that the government was trying to ensure better prices and was committed to ensuring minimum support prices."

His name is Wilfried Bergerhausen and he is revered in gourmet food circles for his creations  dishes that weave magic with just a few flavours.The Michelin-starred chef likes revisiting traditional classics and giving them a contemporary twist. Barely 30, he is among the top chefs in the world today. At 28, he became the executive chef of Le Cirque in Las Vegas.Chef Wilfried, who grew up in the south of France and has been working in the United States for many years now, was in India to leave his imprint at Le Cirque at The Leela Palace New Delhi.The chef believes in minimalistic cooking and plating  and thats quite a change from the overdosing of design and flavours that was quite the trend till recently.His style was evident in the dishes that he presented before us, a small group of invitees. To start with, for vegetarians, there was l Asperge white asparagus panna cotta with compressed cucumber and pear, flavoured with sorrel herb.I opted for le homard, lobster ravioli in a kohlrabi casing with saffron yuzu, a mildly tart sauce. I enjoyed the crunchy casing  and the look of the samosa-shape of the homard.The pea soup  le petit pois  was excellent. The soup came with mascarpone mousse and crispy buckwheat. In one little glass there was the mascarpone and puffed buckwheat. On this they poured the cold pea soup, which was smooth and so lightly flavoured that it whetted the appetite in a pleasing way.I enjoyed the St-Jacque  seared scallops with Japanese sea urchin and sauces of ginger lemon grass, lime leaves and turnip. Scallops have to be cooked just right  for even a bit here and there can ruin the dish. This was perfect, with just the right flavours of gingery lemon grass in it. The turnip gave it a crunch that was rather nice and I liked the texture and strong flavour of the sea urchin.But what made my day was la caille  quail stuffed with foie gras, quail legs in mashed potato covered in gold. The quail meat was tender and the foie gras gave an edge to the fowl meat. The mashed potato and legs with a light ultra-thin gold foil made for a pretty picture  and a delightful dish as well. The chef said the idea was to present it like a gooses golden egg. Neat, I thought!I had a small scoop of the ice cream  mango, Sichuan pepper, lemon cream, pomello meringue and chamomile  and left for an appointment with the sharp taste of Sichuan pepper happily lingering in my heart.The special dinner is available this evening, from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. The hotel tells me that a meal is for Rs. 6500 plus taxes.I read that the chef grew up soaking in every bit of the food process  from production to cooking. His grandfather owned a farm while his father worked in the front-office of restaurants. He was introduced to some of the best known restaurants in France through his father.Chef Wilfried did his magic on me. When you have been inspired by a spring garden in the south of France  as the chef says he was  what do you expect, but a nice bouquet of fragrance and flavours?"
5b148d9d9855b72ada07d130,15% increase in potato production expected,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/15-increase-in-potato-production-expected/articleshow/62397878.cms,2018-01-07,"AHMEDABAD/PALANPUR: Farmers and traders in Banaskantha are expecting a bumper potato crop. Though the acreage sown increased by 17%, output is expected to rise by 15% from last year.In Gujarat in 2017, potato production was 17.10 lakh metric tonnes (MT), making up nine per cent of the countrys output. If market sources are to be believed, this figure will cross 19 lakh MT this year. After groundnut, the government will face a huge task to handle potato farmer, keeping in mind that in 2017 farmers were forced to dump potatoes in the streets, because they were getting meagre prices, an officer at APMC Deesa said.Fearing that farmers will not get remunerative prices this year too, Deesa APMC chairman Mavjibhai Desai wrote to the state government and met the new agriculture minister, R C Faldu With the area sown increasing we are expecting a bumper crop this year too. I have asked the state government to work out an action plan to bail out farmers who may not get proper prices for their produce. I even met Faldu. Desai said that the new crop has started trickling in but will be in full flow in 15 days.The price of new potatoes was around Rs 6 a kg at Deesa market, while old potatoes, which had been kept in cold storage is Rs 2 a kg. Satish Mali, the owner of a cold storage in Banaskantha, said the new crop is while there is still stock in cold storage. He said he still has 200 tons of old potatoes and the farmers or traders are not answering his the calls. We pay Rs 100 as loan for a 50kg bag to farmers, to meet packing, labour and transportation expenses. When the produce is sold the loan is recovered along with rent. A farmer incurs a cost of Rs 5 per kg to put potatoes in cold storage. Presently, they cant even recoup their input costs, so they dont turn up to claim their stored stock. We are just getting Rs 1.5 per kg against the input cost of Rs 5 at the moment.Kalubhai Ratnabhai, a farmer, says, Last year I got Rs 4 per kg and was expecting the price to rise further. I didnt sell my crop and am now not even getting a price that will match my storage cost, leave aside other input costs. If potatoes are in cold storage after October, that person is required to pay Rs 2.6 per kg. He further said that he opted to sow grow potatoes this year too, as it is cheaper, in terms of input cost, than others crops.Mavjibhai Patel, a trader from Deesa, said he had stored about 5,000 50-kg bags and in the last month he only got an average of Rs 3 per kg. He said that this was lower than what he paid the farmers."
5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"
5b149bfc9855b72e9ad64eb5,Farmers gain from Israeli agriculture technology,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-gain-from-israeli-agri-tech/articleshow/62451023.cms,2018-01-11,"AHMEDABAD: Kalpesh Patel, a farmer in Prantij , earlier made Rs 4 lakh growing cabbage and cauliflower on his 16 bighas of land. Today, from the same produce on the same land, he earns Rs 15 lakh. The secret to his nearly three-fold rise in income is the new Israeli hi-tech protective cultivation and precision farming method.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Patel and his facility later this week. Patel is not alone. Some 50,000 farmers like him have reaped the benefits of the Centre of Excellence for Protective Cultivation and Precision Farming on Vegetables. The centre at Vadrad village in Sabarkantha district has played a pivotal role in extension of the Indo-Israel Agriculture Plan (IIAP) to 50,000 farmers in the 30 months since it was set up.The Vadrad centre is one of eight in the state, set up in collaboration with Israel. Jitendra Patel, the deputy director for horticulture, who is in charge of the centre, says that the centre is set to demonstrate the technology to farmers and extend it to them, increasing their income.Jitendra Patel said the Vadrad centre raises pest and disease-free saplings at the nominal price of Re 1 per sapling from farmers seeds and hands back saplings to be transplanted in fields. The Vadrad centre has been developed under IIAP at a cost of Rs 11.47 crore. It is focusing on protected cultivation of vegetables.The project has four high-tech temperature and moisture-controlled polyhouses or nurseries, where seedlings are grown for a fortnight under protection till they reach a certain height. Technologies like drip irrigation, protective cultivation of germinated seedlings and a precise mixture of soil and vermicompost are used, which lead to savings on fertilizer costs further on. The seedlings so produced are of high quality and disease-free.Patel said that because of the centre, farmers also get their crop before the trading season begins and consequently, better prices. With the produce arriving a fortnight before others, the farmer earns twice as much as he would in the middle of the season. The quality of vegetables also improves, with the minimal use of chemicals. He added that the fertilizer costs are cut by 70%.Kalpesh Patel, the farmer from Prantij, says, If we choose conventional sowing, there is a fear of damage to the crop. If we sow seed directly in the field, about 25% do not germinate and this is also a direct loss. In the first month, we have to spray insecticide on three or four times, to save seedling from pests and insects. With the seedling developed at the centre, I save on pesticides. During the monsoon, delayed rains can damage growth and hence if I opt for a 30-day seedling, there is no damage even if the rains are delayed.Ahmedabad: In Kadi and Kalol, it is not only the usual tomato, but now also cabbage and cauliflower which is drawing traders from Delhi. Officials of the horticulture department said around 10 traders would would usually go to Kadi or Kalol, are now camping in Prantij, despatching cabbage and cauliflower consignments to Delhi. Officials said about one truckload of cabbage and cauliflower is sent to Delhi every day. Demand for cauliflower is high in north India and traders coming to Kadi and Kalol are also setting up centres in Prantij.Mamroli Grad Turns Farmer, Taps Israeli Ideas For Huge ProfitsAhmedabad: Samir Patel, a B.Sc. in chemistry, has decided to adopt farming as his full-time profession. On a cue from the Centre of Excellence for protected cultivation and precision farming in Vadrad village, he has set up his own nursery. The turnover of his nursery per annum is around Rs 1.5 crore.Patel, a resident of Mamroli, said he was always interested in farming with the latest technology. When I learnt about the centre, I was the first farmer to utilise its services, he said.I still remember that I gave the seeds of bitter gourd (karela) for seeding and, after I received the benefits, I came to the centre and studied the technology in detail, Samir Patel said.He said that he had 25 bighas of land and had taken another 330 bighas in the area on lease. In the year 2014, his profits after deducting the expenses came to around Rs 20 lakh.After adopting Israeli technology, my income had grown and now I make a net profit of around Rs 60 lakh, Samir said.He further said that he was now into farming of potatoes, bitter gourd, tomato, chillis, brocolli, red cabbage and cauliflower, among others. He further said that he had also entered into contract for potato farming with some big multinationals.Regarding the nursery that had been set up on the lines of the Vadrad centre, he said that he had grown seeds at the government centre at Vadrad and had a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore from this nursery alone.Patel further said that his farming had grown so large in scale that now even his wife Daxa had to assist him in taking care of the nursery."

5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperousÂ states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Inadequate availability of raw material, inadequate post-harvest infrastructure, inadequate research and development by processing industry, fragmented value chains and policy distortions are some of the challenges that food processing industry is facing in Punjab, said Dhillon.He also said that PAU has been continuously developing some food processing techniques to promote cultivation of fruits and vegetables but the real challenge lies in their adoption by farmers and other stakeholders. We are developing several techniques to promote crop diversification so that farmers come out of wheat-paddy cycle. But the real challenge is their adoption. Not many farmers are adopting them because it is difficult for them to come out of wheat-paddy cycle as still there are many challenges. On one hand we are asked to push crop diversification and at the same time, we are given the wheat and paddy production cultivation targets to be met each year. So how can we expect that farmers will abandon wheat-paddy, said V-C.He also called for developing strong linkages between PAU and industry for strengthening of food processing sector. The conclave was inaugurated by Punjab industry and commerce minister Sham Sunder Arora who said that Punjab which till now is known as Food Bowl of India will soon be known as Food Processing Hub of India too.Soon Punjab will be the food processing hub of the country. From the largest producer, it will be the largest processor too. A high tech manufacturing cluster at Ludhiana and an integrated manufacturing cluster is being built at Rajpura apart from three mega food parks at Ladhowal, Phagwara and Fazilka. Punjab has total cultivable area of 4.2 million hectares. It produces 19 per cent of wheat in India, 10 per cent rice, 10 per cent milk, 20 per cent honey, 48 per cent mushroom and 5 per cent cotton with just 3 per cent of net sown area in the country, he said.PepsiCo and ITC Limited to expand operations in PunjabThe conclave which was was jointly organized by the Department of Industries and Commerce, Punjab; Confederation of Indian Industry and PAU also saw the participation of several food processing companies representatives including ITC, PepsiCo, Cremica among others. PepsiCo and ITC announced that they would be expanding their operations in Punjab in agro-food processing.Rinkesh Satija from PepsiCo India that they would be investing in snacks manufacturing units in Punjab. He said the need of the hour is to provide cold storage infrastructure and develop more potato varieties for processing. Sanjay Singhal from ITC Limited said that the company has launched new juices products and biscuits and soon they are also going to invest in dairy sector in Punjab. He also suggested enhancing the production and processing of fruits and vegetables in Punjab.Bhavdeep Sardana from Sukhjit Starch & Chemicals Limited called for increase in maize production and processing in Punjab. Akshay Bector of Cremica Food Industries Limited added that abolishing of truck unions in Punjab is a welcome step.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Not true, if Chef Manish Mehrotra is anywhere around. Give him some crispy golgappa puffs, some flavoured water, and he will turn them into haute cuisine.Yet, whats great about the chef is that he doesnt play around with the original taste or flavours. He gives you a dish as it is  but presents it in such a way that it opens your eyes. And your mouth, of course!I had a very nice evening at Indian Accent, now at The Lodhi, trying out some of the chefs special creations. The occasion was a promotion of New South Wales, so quite a few of the ingredients came from Australia. And the food was served with the wine from the region, which is giving a tough competition to established wines from other parts of the world.To get back to the phuchkas, as the golgappa is known in Bengal, the chef serves it atop tiny glasses filled with different kinds of flavoured water  tempered with mint, tamarind, pineapple, pomegranate and yoghurt. There is a masala couscous chickpea mix in the phuchka. You fill it with the flavoured water and pop it into the mouth. Tastes like phuchka that you may have eaten in Kolkata  but looks like an artists installation.The dinner, attended by New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian, sought to highlight the use of Australian-grown ingredients in Indian cuisine. Some of the ingredients included Australian lamb and seafood. And there were dishes such as slow cooked lamb with fenugreek, rice-crusted Australian John Dory and baked Australian barramundi.Chef Mehrotras expertise also lies in presenting food  so each dish was delightful to look at, too. The wonderfully sweet-tart-and-salty nimbu pani sorbet, for instance, came in a small pressure-cooker. The Australian lamb cornet was a succulent dish of pulled lamb in a crispy cornet. The spices were just right, and I liked the way the crunchy cornet (baked with refined flour and butter) complemented the juicy pieces of lamb.I enjoyed the baked barramundi, too. The fish came with small boondis flavoured with mint and Amritsari masala butter. The Australian John Dory was excellent, crispy from the outside and moist within.The two regions did a nice tango with the rice  crusted fish dish which was served with a bean foogath and coconut curry. Likewise, the slow cooked lamb with fenugreek came with a small potato chilla, which added both texture and taste  and a surprise twist  to the lamb dish.The dessert  Aamras summer berries and bitter chocolate  was superb. Beautiful to look at, moulded in bright yellow, with bits of red, green, brown and white, it was a delicious dessert with just the right sweet and tart mix and medley of flavours.It was a pleasant evening, with a bit of the old and the new. The old favourites were there, as were some new surprises. The chef says the new dishes would be a part of the menu if there is a regular supply of the ingredients from Australia.As I often say, keep the borders open."

The state government dismissed the incident as the ""work of miscreants"".Potatoes were found strewn at WPL 1090 Crossing, Vidhan Sabha and Raj Bhawan. Three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on charges of negligence after the incident.Lucknow district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said potatoes were thrown from a truck but they were yet to ascertain who was responsible for the act. So far, no farmers' group has claimed responsibility.In Meerut, however, CM Aditya Nath Yogi said his was the first government to announce a minimum support price (MSP) for potatoes. ""If needed, we will raise it further,"" he said.Meanwhile, SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar suspended sub-inspector Pramod Kumar , constables Ankur Chaudhary and Ved Prakash deployed on night shift at Hazratganj police station and constables Komal Singh and Naveen Kumar of Gautampalli police station.Kumar has also formed a committee comprising ASP (east) and CO (Hazratganj) to probe the matter. ""We need to identify the truck seen in CCTV footage before we take action. We are also investigating if there is any anti-social element involved,"" said Kumar. Farmers in the city have expressed displeasure over government policy on potato produce.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) zonal president Hariram Verma said, We get only Rs 4 per kg from the sale in open market, while the cost of production is Rs 10 per kg. Why is the government not regulating the price?He also took a dig at the government for regulation of price even for people who get it for Rs 15-20 per kg despite an excessive produce.We will sit on an indefinite strike if the prices are not regulated; not only of potato but also sugarcane and other vegetables, said Verma.Uttar Pradesh agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi told reporters that the present state government was committed to the welfare of farmers, especially potato growers. This appears to be some political conspiracy to defame the state government, he alleged."

The officers should work with the peoples interest in mind. At present, residents of 32 villages in Arsikere taluk are getting water supplied by tankers. He directed the officers to procure required amount of seeds and chemical fertilisers for cultivation soon after the monsoon. With regard to potato cultivation, he asked the Horticulture Department officers to make preparation to procure certified seed potatoes."
