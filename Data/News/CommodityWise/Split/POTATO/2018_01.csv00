Janakiraman, Assistant Director General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, has said. Inaugurating the golden jubilee of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Tuber Crops at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute on Friday, he stressed the need to promote new varieties of tubers. He highlighted the need to promote overhead farming of sweet potato through hydroponic system, suited for urban horticulture."
5b1535d99855b744d63904fa,It has been a love-hate relationship with Marx,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/it-has-been-a-love-hate-relationship-with-marx/article23790169.ece,2018-05-06,"My eldest brother brought Communism into our home in the 1950s as an activist of SF (Kerala Students Federation). A childhood friend lent me the Communist Manifesto to read when I was in Class 7. Marx has been there with me ever since alongside two other disparate companions viz, Protestant Christianity and politics of identity.The famous potato metaphor of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte has helped me a lot in explaining why Dalits continue to be represented by others and not by themselves; and in linking this condition to their total lack of the four Bourdieuan capitals such as social (intellectual or professional networks), economic (land or wealth), cultural (good education) and symbolic (respect). Marx used the potato metaphor mainly to argue the relation between want of social capital and lack of self-representation among French peasants. For me, the symbolic capital which deals with the idea of respect and dignity is more important than the social or economic. The treatment of a person as untouchable and polluting (Govindapuram, Vadayampady, Ashanthans body, the ill-treatment of Dalit students and faculty by fellow students and learned colleagues reported from universities), and the daily humiliation such a person is subjected to cannot be resolved through subsidised rationing or use of euphemisms like thozhilurappu for traditional scavenging. Adolfo Gilly says, The essence of revolution is not the struggle for bread but the struggle for human dignity.Marxs name is often used synonymous with revolution. But it was Fanon who explained the meaning of revolution to me in simple and clear words: The last shall be first. Who are the last? Brahmins, or Dalits? Before Fanon, W.E.B.Du Bois warned the world about the question of the colour line. In India, Ambedkar raised the structural problem of caste, which the twice-born Communists dismissively dubbed as superstructural. But the Indian social structure is that of caste. It is the Base and not the superstructure. Gramscis notion of hegemony does not help to overcome this theoretical blindness of the communists who accuse Dalits of theoretical confusion. It is not Dalit confusion but the casteist attitude of the communists towards Dalits that leads to Dalit estrangement from the communists. How is revolution possible with caste intact? Ambedkar is right in asserting how caste effectively prevents the coalescence of the oppressed. And what space is provided by communists to Dalit leadership in the class-based struggles? Thanks to endogamy and heredity, even after 70 years of Independence, the chief means of transfer of wealth and power is through caste. This phenomenon is to be called caste politics and not the emergence of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati.I understood Marx better with my acquaintance with writings of thinkers like Eric Fromm, Ivan Illyich, Paolo Freire, Fanon, Memmi, Ambedkar, Gutierrez, James Cone, Paul Lehmann, Foucault, Derrida, Zizek, Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams , E.P. Thompson, Hogarth, etc., feminists, leaders of the Countercultural movements, historians of the Subaltern Collective, and writers on new social movements. I would not have read them but for my love-hate relationship with Marx.The author is a Dalit scholar"
5b1537cb9855b72e9ad6925d,Japanâ€™s dilemma over Korea talks,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-dilemma-over-korea-talks/article23789727.ece,2018-05-06,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-uns transformation from rocket man to summit maven has caused global excitement about the prospect of peace on the Korean peninsula. On the heel of consecutive meetings with the Chinese and South Korean Presidents, Mr. Kim is now looking forward to a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, scheduled for late May or early June. But watching this diplomatic frenzy, somewhat churlishly, from the sidelines is Japan.Tokyos fear of being left out in the cold as North Korea mends bridges with Seoul and Washington is based on two issues: Japanese abductees and medium-range missiles. Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 of its citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies in Japanese language and culture. North Korea has acknowledged 13 of these kidnappings. It allowed five of them to visit Japan in 2002 where they stayed on. However, Pyongyang claims that eight others have died, an assertion that is deeply distrusted by the Japanese public. The issue of abductees remains a domestic hot potato in Japan, one that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked much political capital on.In mid-April, Mr. Abe rushed to the U.S. to meet with President Trump and received assurances that the abductee issue would be raised at the U.S.-North Korea summit. South Korean President Moon Jae-in also reportedly brought it up with Mr. Kim at their meeting on April 27. However, it is clearly not a priority for any country other than Japan. The main focus for the region is on the Norths nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Here, Tokyos worry is the possibility of Mr. Trump striking an agreement to curtail the Norths ability to hit the U.S. mainland without addressing the shorter-range missiles that can reach Japan.Within rangeAmerican fears escalated last year when the North test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. shore. Japan, however, has long been within range of North Korean weapons. The Nodong ballistic missile, for example, has a maximum range of about 1,290 km and could reach Japan in 10 minutes after take-off.Mr. Moon has said the North Koreans are open to talking with Japan at any time. But rather than leap at the opportunity, Tokyo has responded with caution, reiterating the need to maintain the policy of maximum pressure on North Korea until more tangible steps are taken towards the complete abandonment of its nuclear weapons and missiles.Historically there have been several occasions when deals with Pyongyang have been struck, only to fall apart with the North reneging on its promises. Some amount of scepticism is therefore warranted. However, it is also difficult to avoid the impression that Mr. Abes lack of enthusiasm might have something to do with his domestic woes. Plagued by nepotism and corruption scandals for over a year, the Japanese PM has benefited politically from North Koreas belligerent missile testing in 2017. Despite plunging popularity ratings, Mr. Abe won a snap election in October, largely by promoting the idea that strong and experienced leadership was needed at a time of regional crisis.His main political agenda  that of constitutional revision to give Japans military a more muscular role  is abetted by turmoil on the Korean Peninsula. Since the majority of Japanese voters remain opposed to the revision in principle, peace in Korea will make the proposed amendment harder to push through.Tokyos fear of being left out in the cold as North Korea mends bridges with Seoul and Washington is based on two issues  Japanese abductees and medium-range missiles"
5b153cf09855b76246385864,From the house of Mr Biswas!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-the-house-of-mr-biswas/article23859553.ece,2018-05-12,"I went chasing a rainbow, and actually found a pot of gold at the end of it. It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."
5b156ab19855b75db2e72b43,The changing terms of endearment,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-changing-terms-of-endearment/article23876235.ece,2018-05-14,"Uttar Pradeshs pivotal importance to Indian politics is hard to exaggerate. Anyone who wishes to rule India must control this State. The Bhartiya Janata Partys (BJPs) biggest win in 2014 came from U.P., which was instrumental in providing Narendra Modi with a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. The party won 73 (with its ally) of the States 80 seats, while its nearest rivals, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress, got only five and two seats, respectively. The BJP repeated this performance in the 2017 Assembly election, winning 325 seats (with its ally) in the 403-member State Assembly, which is about 80% of the seats. No party has ever registered such a colossal tally, not even Indira Gandhi, whose party, the Congress, had won 309 seats in the then 425-member Assembly in 1980.An alienationBut barely a year after its stunning victory the situation has changed significantly. The strongest sign of the changing public mood is the growing alienation of Dalits from the government. Even though many Dalits voted for the BJP in 2014, they feel excluded from access to power and the benefits it brings. Attacks on Dalits have not ceased even after the national furore over the Saharanpur violence in May 2017. A Dalit student of Allahabad University was lynched in February. Some of the BJPs Scheduled Caste MPs from U.P. wrote to the Prime Minister to express their anguish over these incidents. One of them accused the government of only paying lip service and not doing anything for the benefit of the community. This unusual development had occurred just days after the BJP lost in its bastions, Gorakhpur and Phulpur (which is part of Allahabad district), to the SP-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in the by-elections pushing scores of Dalits towards the anti-BJP camp.Elements of a strategyThe growing conflict between Dalits and Hindutva must be seen in the context of the paradigm shift in U.P.s politics which is increasingly defined in narrow majoritarian terms, even as the BJP is seeking to co-opt the oppressed groups within its electoral umbrella. Two key elements of the BJPs electoral strategy are inclusion/visibility of Dalits and exclusion/invisibility of Muslims. It has shown that it can win elections without Muslims even though they constitute a fifth of the States population, which is larger than the population of several Muslim-majority countries. By contrast, it has made every effort to demonstrate its love for Dalits. But they are unhappy with the terms of endearment since they want greater Dalit representation to address their concerns regarding social exclusion, food preferences, education, employment, housing, and so on.The BJP has consistently used religious polarisation to trump the caste divide in U.P., but it hasnt succeeded; in fact, the divide has been exacerbated by the cold caste and sub-caste calculations of its top leadership to undercut old forms of caste mobilisation. Moreover, the attempts to assimilate Dalits within the fold by invoking the legacy of B.R. Ambedkar or the symbolism of communal inter-dining is not enough to cool tempers of Dalits who face discrimination and atrocities despite the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The instrumental use of both gestures is obvious to everyone; not surprisingly, these gestures have failed to quell the growing tide of discontent, with many Dalit voters losing patience with the ruling dispensation.Elusive developmentDalit inclusion will work when their core concerns are addressed and when there is overall development, which the State badly needs. Development and economic growth has, of course, been a constant leitmotif in the electoral campaigns of the BJP since 2014. But there is no evidence to show that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is the leader who can deliver development for the State. In fact, the very idea of development was sidelined by his controversial appointment. He was installed as Chief Minister to polarise public opinion on Hindu-Muslim lines, and not to promote integration through development. His elevation signalled a decisive shift from the dual strategy of combining Hindutva and development to a singular embrace of Hindutva which has been used as a weapon of mass mobilisation to offset the fissures of caste, class, language and culture. Asked about Opposition parties linking his speeches and work to Hindutva and not development, the Chief Minister replied that Hindutva and development are complementary to each other... Those who are opposing Hindutva are in fact opposing development and Bharatiyata. In other words, even the optics of development and the claims of taking everyone along through development will be sacrificed at the altar of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2019 election.Going by the policy decisions of his government, the cow appears to be the fulcrum of the U.P. model. It took centre stage in the governments budget with a record Rs. 233 crore allotted for the welfare of cow and dairy development. In a similar vein, social sector spending has been reduced while religious tourism is being given a boost. Mr. Adityanath made a plethora of promises such as building houses, toilets, laying roads and providing 24-hour electricity supply. But these promises are unlikely to be fulfilled, which is causing restlessness even among people who voted to bring the BJP to power in 2017. This is evident from several events in the past few months. In October 2017, sugarcane farmers burned their crop in front of the U.P. Assembly after the government increased the minimum support price by only Rs. 10; in January, farmers unhappy with the minimum support price for their potato harvest dumped the crop in front of the houses of VVIPs in Lucknow; and the much-hyped farm loan waiver turned into a farce as many of the beneficiaries received waivers of amounts as small as Rs. 1 to Rs. 500. The employment situation remains grim, as large-scale government recruitments  the major source of public employment in the State  are not regular and even previously conducted exams, for instance, for clearing the backlog in police jobs have been cancelled. An extravagant UP Investors Summit 2018 held in February to boost investment in the hope of creating employment cannot promote industrialisation and job creation unless the structural constraints of underdevelopment are removed.Closing the gapWhat seems to be working for the BJP is the disarray in the Opposition camp. However, this can change as political majorities are constituted and reconstituted in changing historical and political circumstances. Political majorities are contingent and do not last, at least in part because the Opposition parties make adjustments to capitalise on opportunities. The Mandal (caste) and Mandir (religion) interregnum of the early 1990s signified the arrival of identity politics, which upstaged religious politics that was catapulted by the Ayodhya movement to take centrestage. The ensuing upper caste-backward caste confrontation displaced the Congress from its position of dominance in U.P. and prevented the BJP from reinforcing its political clout despite unprecedented public support for Hindutva in north India for the first time since Independence. Twenty-five years later, in 2104, the BJP closed the gap between the economic and the political sphere with its mantra of development to secure a popular mandate. Currently, the Opposition is making tactical adjustments to counter the overarching narrative of Hindu nationalism. The by-election results demonstrate that if the two main Opposition parties combine, they can give the BJP a run for its money. If there is one State where Opposition unity can upset the BJPs plans for majority rule in 2019, it is U.P.Zoya Hasan is Professor Emerita, Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University"

Be it a broken hairbrush or threadbare glove, she channels a kind of charm into them, introducing you to an all-new level of ideation and understanding.The puppeteer and object theatre artiste says her art has a very subjective edge. Object theatre is all about infusing ordinary things with meaning, it lets the magic flow out of things not typically meant for that. It uses an object to communicate an idea, something totally unexpected out of their mundaneness. There is magic in everything, you just need to stop and look, she says.She was in the city recently to hold a workshop for children at the 8 Point Art Cafe here. At the workshop, she helped each child create his/her own story with everyday objects as they sat transfixed in a world of mountains and deserts, forests, and fairylands.Ms. Ghosh says she disturbs hierarchies of importance through her art, adding value to the banal.I try to change the concepts of ordinary and premium, matchless and mass-produced, functional and dysfunctional. The simple, routine act of peeling and chopping potatoes can be interpreted in a volley of ways, she adds, explaining the symbolism involved. As she talks about the tubers transformation ending up in a fancy chips packet, you cant help wondering isnt it too intense for children? You will be very surprised, but its not. In fact, children have been more receptive of symbolic concepts. She talks about her theatre production Dhaba where all the characters are vegetables. It has been just eggplants so far and suddenly one potato enters which goes on to become the other.And in one scene the potato and brinjal come together changing the menu of the dhaba to include mixed veg.It was a child among the audience who first shouted shaadi ho gayi (they got married) while many of the adults couldnt see we were showing an inter-caste marriage.Very often, adults will be full of doubts after each show and will ask us a lot of questions. I have seen children impatiently correcting their parents and explaining things to them, she says.Trained in object theatre from Institut International de la Marionnette in France, Choiti has taken her art to many places across India.In 2011, she started Tram Theatre that specialises in object theatre."

5b1587629855b76a5f1a258b,Plastic ban at what price?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plastic-ban-at-what-price/article24004256.ece,2018-05-27,"What would happen if plastic carry bags are banned? Partial ban on plastic bags that several local bodies in the State implemented at various stages has fallen flat so far primarily due to faulty implementation. Secondly, the non-availability of feasible alternatives has been dissuading administrators from opting for a complete ban. Assuming that lax implementation is an issue that can be addressed and rectified, it might be time to look at the second issue.Paper bagsThough paper is the first option, it cannot be counted as an environment-friendly option considering the large-scale destruction of trees for paper pulp and also because they cannot hold much weight. Though recycled paper bags have become a trend, common people may not find them pocket-friendly. Up-cycled paper bags using newspapers may be used for purposes other than packaging liquid and semi liquid products.Non-woven bagsCloth is the next choice, though the non-woven bags that pass off as cloth bags in most shops these days are equally or even more dangerous than plastic bags.Those bags are 98% polypropylene. They can neither be recycled nor composted. They emit carcinogenic fumes when burned, said Vasundhara Menon, a dentist-turned-environmental activist who got the non-woven bags tested at the Centre for Biopolymer Science and Technology in Kochi.I gave the test reports to officials and Ministers of all departments concerned. But there has been no response, she said alleging that vendors across the State have been shifting to non-woven bags slowly as they have been misguided that it is cloth. Some shops have been selling cloth bags, though the cloth being used is polyester, equivalent to plastic, rather than cotton, which should be ideally used. Real cotton cloth bags are environment- friendly and can hold reasonable weight, but are heavy on the pocket. Neither can they be used to carry liquids.Biodegradable plasticThe third option is biodegradable plastic that comes in several varieties.There are starch-based bioplastics that are soluble in hot water. There is also compostable plastic that disintegrates and joins the soil within 90 to 180 days.The Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had suggested bioplastics as a viable alternative for plastic carry bags in a notification issued in March 2016.There are four bioplastic manufacturers in India that have been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board as manufacturers of compostable plastic and follow the ISO 17008:2008 standards. Their products have also been tested at the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology. These bags are slightly costlier than normal plastic carry bags, but not as much as paper or cloth bags.Large-scale use of bio-compostable plastics would put a huge demand on agriculture to increase the production of tapioca, corn and potato though they can even be made out of water hyacinth. In a way, it would benefit agriculture in the country and in turn our farmers, said Santhosh Kandamchira, general secretary of Green Fraternity, a Kottayam-based environmental organisation, that has been promoting bio-compostable carry bags for over a year now. He said the vendors preferred these bags as they served the purpose of plastic carry bags and freed the vendors from being penalised for sale of thin plastic carry bags.The 50 microns rule is not applicable to bio-compostable bags and hence the vendor gets more quantity at a lower price, Mr. Kandamchira said.The advantage of bio-compostable bags is that they can be composted along with biodegradable waste.They are technically and theoretically reliable. But they cannot be differentiated from a normal plastic carry bag very easily and hence there are chances of vendors passing off plastic bags as bio-compostable material. However, they can be identified through proper test, said lawyer and environmental activist Harish Vasudevan.Oxo-biodegradable bagsOxo-biodegradable bags that are in supply in some high-end shops are being mistaken for compostable material. The Oxo-biodegradable material is plastic that degrades after some time. They become invisible, but pollute the atmosphere, water bodies as well as soil with micro plastic particles. We breathe them in every day, Dr. Vasundhara Menon said.With so many options, finding the right alternative for plastic carry bags is a tricky matter and only large-scale awareness at the grassroots can ensure that another hazardous material does not substitute plastic in the State.Use of bio-compostable plastic will also benefit agriculture and our farmers.Santhosh KandamchiraGreen Fraternity"

With over 30 lakh tourists visiting Ooty every year, department officials are hopeful of surpassing the revenue generated by the hill stations own botanical garden (maintained by Kerala government), which has an annual turnover of Rs 9-10 crore, said B K Krishnamurthy, assistant horticulture officer.While the work for the gardens second phase has already begun, officials say it would be completed by March this year. A three-acre designated parking space has already been allocated for the garden owing to constraints in the hill station.The Rs 12 crore-project has been in progress for the past 10 years; development activities have intensified since 2014. It boasts of attractions like a 10-acre topiary garden (art of training plants into decorative shapes), a pre-existing frigid zone glass house (housing low temperature climate plants) and an Italian garden.Inaugurating the garden on Monday, Karnataka horticultural and agricultural marketing minister S S Mallikarjun said his department officials have been asked to prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) to develop sites like Nandi Hills, Kemmanagundi and KRS among others on a par with international standards.The department received ample funding from the government last year and a host of developmental activities have been going on, some of which have been completed, he said.The second phase of the garden will boast of a viewpoint, giving tourists a birds-eye view of the garden. We will also run eco cars around the garden as there will be more slopes than steps. This will enable tourists to explore the garden tirelessly, said Krishnamurthy.Phase II will also have nearly five waterbodies, including a chasing fountain, a pool for aquatic species, one for ornamental fish and two dedicated for collection of water through rainwater harvesting.Entry to the garden will be free for the public till March 31. From April onwards, we are planning to levy a fee of Rs 25 for adults and Rs 15 for children (aged above six), said Krishnamurthy.Situated on the land since 1979, the frigid glass house is home to flowers that grow only at an altitude of 7,000 feet above sea level. Officials from the department said from April to June this year, the house will host orchids as well.The garden is most famous for topiaries, that were created nearly 60 years ago, covering an expanse of 10 acres of the garden.Three smaller gardens within the space  the Italian garden with sculptures and flower arrangements inspired by 15th century villas of Rome and Florence; the maze garden, which is an outdoor labyrinth wherein passages are divided by vertical hedge walls and the tea garden  are among the attractions.In 1964, on the behest of MH Marigowda, Maharaja of Mysore Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar donated 62.14 acres of land to the Karnataka government. This was to help farmers of Karnataka procure potato seeds from a much nearer place rather than travelling all the way to Shimla in north India. The 38.91-acre land, most of which has been utilized for the project, was initially used for producing these seeds which were transported to Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Kolar."

Potatoes thrown on Lucknow roads,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-protest-potatoes-thrown-on-lucknow-roads/article22389830.ece,2018-01-07,"Potatoes were hurled from a truck at various prominent places here on Saturday in what is seen as a protest by farmers against low purchase price of the produce. A State government spokesperson, however, dismissed the incident as the handiwork of miscreants.There was a truck which had sacks of potato, which were thrown from it in various parts of the city early this morning. So far no farmers group has claimed responsibility for this act. This seems to be the work of antisocial elements... We are probing all possible angles, said Lucknow District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma.He added that the potatoes were thrown on Vidhan Sabha Marg, near VVIP guest house and near the 1090 Crossing. The roads were then cleaned by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation.Pre-planned actToday it is the potato farmers who have thrown potatoes on the streets of Lucknow, tomorrow it may be the sugarcane farmers, the wheat and paddy farmers if the situation does not improve, said Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit.State Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi called it a pre-planned act. The potatoes which were thrown were partly or completely rotten and rejected in the mandi (market). It is a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the Yogi Adityanath government, he said."
5b160c5c9855b72e9ad6ced2,Writing about truly Indian matters,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/writing-about-truly-indian-matters/article22389370.ece,2018-01-07,"The new year, 2018, is here! Nothing seems to have changed, despite the firecrackers. Of course, in many parts of the world the firecrackers might have been confused with, or replaced by, bombs, and millions in those and other regions find firecrackers (let alone bombs) an unimaginable luxury as they struggle to obtain food or shelter.New Years Eve came, as it does, close on the heels of Christmas, which commemorates the birth of a homeless child to poor refugees in a foreign place. That too was widely celebrated, as it should be, though in a world where the homeless, children, refugees and foreignness are often abused.As I am writing this column largely for fellow Indians, many of whom, like me, are not Christian, I am aware that a group of increasingly loud fellow nationals might accuse me of celebrating foreign festivals. (Some of them consider me foreign too, as I am an Indian born in a Muslim family.) I have no desire to upset these people.A New Years listSo, I told myself: I do not want to start my new year being abused by these people whose voices are getting louder every year; I should only write of truly Indian matters, whatever they might be. I spent much of New Years Eve thinking of such topics. People make a list of things to do in the new year; I made a list of things to write about.I was aware that I could not write about the new year itself. After all, most people, including most Europeans, observed new year on other days of other calendars until recently. Some of us, as in India and Iran, still have festivals that mark such new years, mostly, given agriculture, in spring.Formalised calendars go back to the Bronze Age, which makes them about 5,000 years old, and they have been developed in different ways by different people, and changed by the same people in different periods. The Gregorian calendar that we use to mark the new year today was itself introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582. So, yes, I was aware that I should not write about the Gregorian new year, but I could not write about other new years either, because not only are there various new years in India, some are also shared by other nationals.What about clothes? After all, India is justifiably renowned for some of its fabrics and dresses. But I discovered that everything we consider Indian today has some foreign admixture. It is not just in the dress type  obvious in the kurta, topi, shirt  but also in modes of stitching, tailoring, producing, and so on. One could, perhaps, talk of the dhoti and the lovely sari, which go back to ancient times, but alas such entire sheets of largely unstitched cloth were by no means restricted to India back then: most other civilisations, like the Greeks, Persians and Romans, used similarly woven but unstitched garments back in the far past.What about food? Now, what is more Indian than our food? Sometimes I go all the way to London or Leeds just to eat good Indian food, which I do not get in Danish restaurants.Potatoes and mangoesImmediately, the potato came to mind. Growing up in Bihar, we had a saying which, roughly translated, meant: The uncle is a bother in relations, the bear in forests, and the potato in food. It was explained to me, as a child, that all three were summarily dismissed in the saying because one was far too likely to come across them. Now, my uncles were never a bother, and I have not yet been bothered by a bear, perhaps because there are hardly any forests left. But it is true that the potato is unescapable in Indian cuisines, ranging fromsamosas, pakorasanddosasto curries, pulaos and parathas.But alas, the potato is not Indian. It comes from South America. It was introduced in Europe only in the 16th century, and from there it came to India. In the phase when Europeans were colonising the world and decimating indigenous populations in South America, the lowly potato performed a reverse colonisation by taking over world, including European, cuisine.This is true of many other agricultural produce, such as the pineapple, which caused mobs to collect on London docks when it was shipped in from South America in the 19th century. Unfortunately, even the varieties of chilli that we use today are from elsewhere.The mango? True, India has a long history of the mango. But, again, it is not confined to India, and, unfortunately, the cultivation of mangoes reached its pinnacle in India under the now-often-reviled Mughals.The more I searched, the more I realised that just as India has penetrated the world  for instance, with its numerals  the world has penetrated India.Perhaps what matters is not where things are from, but what they have become with us: the potato, after all, is cooked in distinctive ways in Brazil, England and India. Surely, what is true of the potato must be true of people and festivals too? Hence, I wrote of Christmas and New Years Eve after all."

Spandana is in charge of social media outreach for the Congress.The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya , its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Malviya, though, didn't 'tag' Spandana on Twitter, and the latter wondered if it was because those who follow him on the microblogging site would see her videos about PM Modi.""You didn't want to tag me cos you didn't want people to watch the Modi video pinned on my timeline?"" she said.Spandana also wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again"".PM Modi used the word acronym ""TOP"" when talking about the Union Budget 2018's 'Operation Green'.""Farmers producing fruits and vegetables are our 'TOP' priority. 'TOP' means 'Tomato, Onion and Potato'. We have launched 'Operation Green' in interest of these farmers.

The members were protesting against Kasganj violence and Noida encounter.However, a determined governor, facing a barrage of paper missiles and relentless slogan-shouting, read out his 38-page speech, lasting nearly 90 minutes. Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit described the oppositions behaviour as unruly and unconstitutional. Last year, on May 15, the opposition had staged a similar protest during the special session on GST and marshals had to use official files to bat away the paper balls and missiles to save the Governor and the Speaker.While reading out his speech, Naik warned the agitating legislators that they were honourable members and that their behaviour was uncivilised and being watched by the entire state. chief minister Yogi Adityanath said a handful of members had no right to hijack the functioning of the House.Opposition members protest during the address of Governor Ram Naik before the start of the budget session on ThursdayOppn will keep pointing out govts wrongdoings: AkhileshHowever, soon after the joint session, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said: The opposition will continue to discharge its constitutional responsibility and duty to point out the state governments wrongdoings. Nothing is wrong. What is being done has been a tradition in the assembly.As soon as the governor started speaking, the opposition members from SP, BSP and Congress started shouting Governor Go Back.Within a few seconds, SP MLAs carrying banners and placards trooped into the well of the House, trying to force their way towards the Chair.When they were stopped from moving ahead, they fished out banners from their pockets and showed placards saying, Goli bandook ki ye sarkar, nahi chalegi nahi chalegi (Down with the triggerhappy government) and Kanoon vywastha dhwast hai, Yogi sarkar mast hai (In Yogi government, law and order has crumbled).In between their protests, SP members threw paper balls, missiles and potatoes wrapped in paper towards the chair but alert marshals and security guards foiled all attempts.One of the SP members had come to the House with a garland of potatoes to highlight the plight of potato cultivators."

The government received nods from the municipal corporations earlier.This has become a political hot potato as the sealing drive has left Delhi traders worried. There have been protests at various parts in the city since the sealings began in December last year. While the AAP government has claimed that no sealing has happened on these 351 roads, BJP has contested it.Sending the file pertaining to 351 roads to Hon'ble LG today, as soon as we recd the proposal from MCDs. As soon as LG's approval is obtained, it will be presented before SC for its approval, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Wednesday.The government claimed that the file was sent to the LG for his approval as soon as it was submitted to the urban development minister Satyendar Jain by the three municipal corporations. This survey report had been pending with the corporations since 2006.Sources in the government said that earlier the corporations had not certified the report, saying that the survey had been done long ago in 2006. Thats why the urban development department hadnt cleared it.But BJP said that the AAP government had to give its nod under pressure from the opposition, paving the way for legalising commercial activities on these roads.Finally, the hard work of Opposition yielded result. People were suffering but AAP was doing politics, BJPs Vijender Gupta tweeted in Hindi.Gupta demanded AAPs apology to the people of Delhi for this. Our long struggle for notification of 351 roads has ultimately compelled the Kejriwal government to initiate the process of notificationThe Congress government wasted seven years initially and then the AAP government wasted another three years to notify the roads, Gupta added.When the LG clears it, the report would be presented before Supreme Court for its approval, an official said. When the approval comes, all 351 would be notified under the commercial and mixed-use category."

So no wonder then, that actor Madhura Deshpande jumped at the chance to join a misal hop around the city. A group of 20 foodies gathered near the Tilak statue at Mandai and led by Jayesh Paranjape , the curator of the hop (which was part of the Pune Heritage Festival), visited various misal outlets to try unusual varieties of the dish. The actor, known for her roles in Marathi soaps such as Ase He Kanyadan and Zunjh , tried everything from extra spicy to traditional and even dum cooked versions of the dish. And if you too are a fan of the dish, here are a few recommendations from our hop...This quaint eatery is situated in the narrow by lanes of the shopping destination Tulsibaug. Though it's nothing fancy to look at, this place serves some of the tastiest misal in town. The misal here is as Puneri as it can get, said Jayesh, the curator of the misal trail. The base is poha and it has typical boiled potato cooked the traditional Puneri style, mixed with the curry (also known as kat or tarri or sample) that has loads of coconut and is garnished with chopped onions and shev, he added, as Madhura polished off her plate.Misal is always believed to be a spicy dish. As someone not too fond of chilli, I always steer clear of spicy food. But this one I absolutely loved. It has the perfect balance of sweet sour and spice, she said.Our next stop was a small eatery in Bibwewadi. And misal being a filling dish, most of the foodies were already full, but one glance at the menu and they simply had to try the three different styles of misal available here. We have the Damodar misal which is regular, Upwas (fasting) misal and the dum misal, said Alok Thakar, the owner of the place. Here you get a Puneri sweet and sour meets Kolhapuri spice kind of flavour. And the spices used at this eatery are ground the traditional way, on stone. Their speciality  the dum misal  is infused with a smokey flavour and served in a clay pot. The smokey flavour of the misal was great and it was served very well too, said a happy Madhura.Also on the itinerary, was a restaurant on Sinhagad Road. Despite being a place that's known for its grills, this restaurant serves a very Puneri version of the dish. It is spicier than the other two versions, said Jayesh, adding that the curry here is made on a chulha, which gives it a distinct flavour. There are very few places in the city that serve misal made on a chulha and this is one of them, he informed.I am a big foodie. I need variety in my food, but I tend to eat small quantities. When it comes to Maharashtrian cuisine, I love homemade ukad. I also have a sweet tooth and love desserts.The places where you get the best local food will seldom show up online. That's why I joined this misal hop. I am from Uttar Pradesh, but wherever I go, I like to explore the culture and cuisine of the place.Ive been in Pune for one and half years, but did not know about these places. I really like misal and joining this hop was a wise decision. The SriKrishna misal was my favourite among the versions I tried today.Despite being born and brought up in Pune, I did not know about many of these places. We usually tend to explore only eateries that are close to where we live. This hop took us around the city to explore the food culture."

To add a dash of spice to the battle, revenue minister Umashankar Gupta shot back that he, too, sold pakodas before joining politics and doesnt see anything wrong in it.At 11 am on Wednesday, state Youth Congress president Kunal Choudhary sat in front of the state PCC office in Bhopal alongside a statue of former PM Indira Gandhi to fry pakodas as his supporters flavoured it with slogans. Educated youth asking for employment, Youth Congress activists shouted.Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah promised to generate 2 crore jobs a year for the youth. Now, after four years of his government, the Prime Minister is asking us to fry pakodas. There is no shame in frying pakodas, but it is shameless to make promises and fail to deliver, Choudhary told TOI.The Youth Congress sold palak (spinach), potato and onion pakoras to passersby saying, The educated youth has been insulted. Have parents given education to their children so they have no dreams? Have students toiled to get engineering and MBA degrees to start a pakoda enterprise?Since Tuesday, the Youth Congress has held such pakoda protests in 90 towns and cities across MP, including Sehore, Rewa, Panna, Chhattarpur, Indore and Bhopal.Senior BJP leader Umashankar Gupta hit back at Congress, saying: There is no shame is making and selling pakodas. I used to sell pakodas and fried snacks to earn my livelihood before joining politics. I have seen qualified engineers working as labourers. There is no shame in generating self-employment.BJP MLA from Bhopal Madhya, Surendra Nath Singh, said that Congress and some pseudo-intellectuals failed to understand PMs pakoda example. The PM never asked engineers to sell pakoda. It was for unemployed youths who have no way to earn. It was a motivation for generating self-employment but some pseudo intellectuals, politicians and media twisted the debate, alleged Singh.BJP leaders felicitated pakoda sellers in Bhopal, Sehore and Ashta to blunt Congress protests."

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away? Or sacrificing his close aide, responsible for his rise as a leader, takes some courage?To this Ramya replied: Single Meaning plz ! Share it with those who have understood. If TOP means Tomato Onion Pakoda sorry Potato for @narendramodi, POT can also mean Potato Onion & Tomato for @divyaspandana Think Good!!!"
