The PM on Sunday said in an address in the state that farmers are his ""TOP"" priority, and explained that by ""TOP"", he meant ""tomato, onion and potato"".Ergo, the Karnataka Congress today tweeted asking him questions on unemployment, using similar acronyms and giving new expansions to existing ones.""Mr. Modi, isn't your TOP priority to create Jobs? But your government is NDA - Not Doing Anything!"", tweeted the Congress party's Karnataka unit.NDA is, of course, a reference to the government at the Centre. It actually stands for 'National Democratic Alliance' and is a coalition of parties headed by the BJP About Modi's ""TOP"" comment, the Karnataka Congress got into a smidgen of trouble yesterday and on Sunday.What happened was that the Congress social media head and Karnataka unit member Divya Spandana asked referring to Modi's comment, ""Is this what happens when you're on POT?""The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya, its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Spandana then wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again""."

The committee has been directed to submit its report by March 1.The committee would suggest ways and means to provide marketing support for maize and potato crops to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices without wastage of these commodities.The chief minister directed the committee to identify domestic and international markets for sale and supply of farmers produce at attractive prices as they have to suffer losses due to lack of proper marketing facilities for these crops. It has also been directed that the committee should also explore the possibility of future trading in these farm produce to facilitate farmers in ensuring remunerative pricing with risk hedging.The chief minister also reiterated that farmers should be encouraged to opt for crop diversification in a big way in line with the state governments thrust on diversified cultivation as a means of rescuing them from their debt cycles. He has also sought committees suggestions to spread awareness among potato growers about various varieties to help them cultivate the varieties that are in demand by large multi-national companies (MNCs) such as McDonalds and McCain Foods.The chief minister also asked the committee to assess the possibility production of ethanol from maize as suggested by the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari."

Last weeks decision to withdraw the proposed amendment to the Karnataka Tree Preservation Act, 1976, is the latest in a string of such rollbacks. The government withdrew the proposal suo moto after it had threatened to snowball into a major political controversy following an outcry from green activists and the public.TOI samples cases of projects and legislations which were shelved after similar opposition from the public.Barely months after Siddaramaiah's government rode to power, it decided to introduce the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill of 2014. The stated aim was to streamline the functioning of mutts and religious institutions, many of which were constantly involved in controversies over administrative scandals and financial scams.However, following stiff opposition from the BJP , JD(S) and even from within the ruling Congress itself, the government decided to withdraw the bill and shelve it permanently. One of the political fallouts  exploited by the opposition  was the perception that the Siddaramaiah government was anti-religious.In January this year, a letter from the DGP to police commissioners of Mangaluru, Belagavi and 21 other superintendents of police in different districts turned into a political nightmare for the Siddaramaiah government. In the letter marked urgent  the letter was written on December 22, 2017 and a reminder sent on January 2, 2018  the DGP had sought the opinion of police commissioners and SPs on withdrawing cases against innocent people of a minority community, who were booked for allegedly being involved in communal riots in the past five years. The proposal ran into stiff political opposition, and the government was forced to retract the circular and issue a fresh one asking commissioners and SPs to give their opinion on withdrawing cases against those persons of all communities perceived to be innocent in communal riot cases. The BJP accused the Congress of being a minority appeasing party. Home minister Ramalinga Reddy tried to defend the circular, citing that it was done keeping the Justice Sachar committee report in mind. The committee had studied the social and economic background of the Muslim community in India.The government appeared to have forgotten the old adage of once bitten, twice shy as it attempted to regulate mutts and religious institutions four years after its first failed attempt. A public notice earlier this month, seeking the opinion of people on whether the state should take complete or partial control of the religious mutts, temples and other institutions in Karnataka, courted much controversy. The matter became such a political hot potato that Siddaramaiah himself had to clarify the governments stand in the legislature, despite the presence of the Muzrai minister Rudrappa Manappa Lamani.We had issued the public notice in good faith, based on the HC division bench order of 2000 which directed the government to either set up a religious commission or any other body it deems fit to oversee the affairs of religious mutts, temples, trusts and other institutions, Siddaramaiah said. However, seeing the opposition from the public, we have decided to withdraw the proposal. The government does not, and will never, intend to take control of religious institutions in the state.Since it came hot on the heels of the circular seeking to withdraw criminal cases against members of a minority community, the BJP sought to make political capital of the governments discomfiture by projecting the Siddaramaiah government as minority appeasing and anti-majoritarian."
5b169d149855b76a5f1a6ac3,Living up to its name!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/living-up-to-its-name/article22779878.ece,2018-02-17,"Nice name, I said to myself when my brother-in-law told me that he had been to a new restaurant in Lodhi Colony. It was called Jamun, and he said it served outstanding food.Then, some days ago, a friend invited us over to Jamun for lunch. I got a little worried when I landed up there  the restaurant is in the Lodhi Colony Market  and found the place empty. Though crowds are no yardstick of how good the food in a restaurant is, an empty place can be a cause for concern. But I neednt have worried  for the place started filling up, and by the time we were done with our lunch, there was even a queue outside.Let me start with the dcor and the music. Its a warm place, with dangling lamps that lighten up the room. There is great music playing  black-and-white music, as I call it, or songs of the sixties.And now, before I go on to the amazing food, heres the drawback. The menu is comprehensive  but a lot of what is listed is not available. I had read about its Pandhi Coorg curry, but it wasnt available. The pork had just come in, I was told, and would take a while to be readied. One of their very popular fish dishes was not there either.I asked the helpful server if there was any pork dish on the menu. There is vindaloo, he said, and I was happy.Unlike the others with me, who gorged on the crispy potato and sabudana papads that came to the table, I waited for the real stuff. So by the time the food came, I was raring to go.We ordered a mix of dishes  a Bengali shukto, a Kerala sole curry and some daab chingri, apart from the vindaloo. And for starters, we had fried white bait and tenderloin cubes.I thought the food was excellent. Some of my companions griped a bit, and said their last meal was a lot better, but I had no complaints. The crispy white bait  small fish with a crunchy batter  was excellent, as was the tenderloin, cooked with pepper and curry leaves.The shukto  a mildly bitter dish of vegetables cooked in a very light sauce  wasnt quite like the kind cooked in my in-laws house, but I enjoyed it. The sauce was a bit too sweet, though shukto is meant to be sweet and bitter. I think they tweaked it a bit to cater to the tastes of the large mass of people the Bengalis refer to as non-Bengalis.The Alleppey sole fish curry, eaten with red rice, tasted really good. It wasnt hot, but had the flavours of whole spices, and a bright colour and a mild tart taste that may have come from kokum. What I loved was the pork. The pieces were tender and juicy, and the thick masala was just right. I ate this with some Goan poi, which, however, left me a bit cold. I found the bread too hard and dry.For dessert, we had some mishti doi  avoidable, I would say  and a nice sorbet called Jamun ki kulfi. The jamun had been bought while in season, pulped and frozen. And the dessert was shaped like a kulfi, and tasted like sorbet. It had captured the taste of the jamun, and I loved it.It was a very nice meal and I am glad the restaurant lived up to its name  and my expectations."

Narayan, former Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, said.Rice and wheat are standard items and the government has been procuring them over a long period of time. But the case of potato and tomato is different with so many variants. To standardise and give the correct price would be difficult, he pointed out.Mr. Narayan was speaking at a seminar titled Demystifying the Union Budget 2018, organised by The Womens Christian College in association with Finmark Trainers.Regular increaseHe pointed out that in the UPA regime between 2004 and 2014, there was regular increase in the minimum support price and farmers were better off.After 2014, the minimum support price was not increased. But, the cost has gone up and there are several instances of farmers distress. One shot increase in the minimum support price is a good sign, though it might be inflationary for the common man, Mr. Narayan said.The budget proposal to provide technology for horticulture was a great idea, but the government needed to spell out its plan clearly, he added."

Had we tried ordering food from Taamonline, he wanted to know. Nice, genuine biryani, he said. And I swung into action.The moment I hear the word biryani I get activated, quite like Pavlov and dog. For someone who is essentially a wheat eater, I cant quite understand this great love I have for biryanis. But as I have said before, I truly enjoy this rice-and-meat dish  irrespective of where it is from. I love the spiciness of the Hyderabadi biryani, the richness of the Awadhi one, the more rustic taste of the Delhi version, the juicy potato in the Calcutta dish and the variations that you find in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. I dont even mind the pickled taste of the Moradabadi biryani.So, of course, I went online to get to know more about Taam.It turned out that it is a service which provides biryanis, kormas, kababs and other such delicious dishes in kilos.Diversity on tableBut a sampler came home, and I tried out quite a few of the dishes  and had a great meal, indeed.There was quite a spread  biryani, korma, kababs, baghare baigan, meethi roti and sewain. I think I enjoyed the lamb shami kababs the most  they were soft, the meat was deliciously tender and lightly spiced, and what I really liked was that they were not thick and chunky, as kababs often are, but thin, like home-cooked kababs. The kababs had been made with beaten meat and not minced meat, so they were exceptionally tasty. I ate a piece with a small chunk of the meethi roti, and found they complemented each other rather well.The Lucknowi biryani was good, too. The rice was long-grained, and the meat pieces were well cooked. It was rightly spiced  neither too much, nor too little.Nawabi dishThe mildly sweet taste of the Hyderabadi dish, baghare baigan, was delightful. The tamarind in it gave it the tart edge that it needed. But, somehow, the korma didnt work for me. I found the gravy too runny and the meat a little insipid. The Muzaffar sewain (Rs. 300 a box  450g and serves 7-8 people), on the other hand, was superb, and gave a pleasantly sweet end to what was a veritable feast.The rates are in kilos. The Lucknowi mutton biryani  which serves 5-6 people is for Rs. 1400 a kilo, the chicken biryani for Rs. 1200 a kilo. Hyderabadi mutton biryani is for Rs. 1600 a kilo and chicken biryani Rs. 1400 a kilo. The mutton qorma, which serves 10, is for Rs. 1800 a kilo. A plate of mutton shami kababs  one kilo with 40 pieces  costs Rs. 1500. The baghare baigan is for Rs. 1000 a kilo and serves 10, says the rate card.Taam is an online platform run by Asra Ahmad. It takes orders on phone and online. The phone numbers are 8586030554 and 9953170590. The email id is order@taamonline.com, and the website is www.taamonline.com. You have to order your food at least a day in advance, and they take delivery charges as applicable. The bawarchis of Taam have been trained by the family, and a cook is there from Hyderabad as well.My friend from Bhopal was not wrong. You wont be disappointed, he had said. And I certainly wasnt."
5b16cb3e9855b75cf6a8f09a,In Lucknow  a crop crisis of plenty,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-lucknow-a-crop-crisis-of-plenty/article22539233.ece,2018-01-28,"Potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh have a twin crisis on their hands  they brought in a record production of the crop but that has led to a slump in rates.What happened?On January 6, several quintals of potatoes were found strewn outside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly as well as near the Chief Ministers residence, in what appeared to be a mark of protest by distressed farmers. The BJP government dismissed the incident as a politically motivated conspiracy and filed an FIR against unknown persons. It also suspended five policemen for negligence. A few days later, the police arrested two persons linked to the Samajwadi Party from Kannauj on charges of conspiracy. However, the entire fiasco brought the much-needed focus on the dilemma faced by potato farmers.Why have prices fallen?Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of potatoes in the country and in the 2016-17 season, it broke the previous records, growing 155 lakh metric tonnes. A record 120 lakh tonnes was also stored in the 1,708 cold storages in the State. But rather than bringing cheer, the bumper crop led to a fall in prices. The newly elected Yogi Adityanath government stepped in to launch a market intervention scheme in April, under which one lakh tonnes of potatoes would be purchased from growers at the minimum support price of Rs. 487 a quintal. However, farmers are not satisfied.What are the problems?The grievances of farmers revolve around high input costs and low and unpredictable rates.First, farmers say the minimum support rate set by the government is too low; the cost of growing a quintal of potato, including expenditure on transport and cold storage rent, comes up to Rs. 800-900. They are demanding that the minimum support price be increased to Rs. 1,000. Second, farmers claim the government did not actively purchase their produce as promised. Even in cases where the State purchased the potatoes, the farmers complained that the purpose was counter-productive due to the grading system, under which only the best quality was selected by government agencies. The bulk of average-poor quality potatoes was left with the farmers, who had the option of selling it in the market and dumping the rest in cold storages. Horticulture Department Director S.K. Joshi, however, says the State purchased 12,937 tonnes from farmers during April-May, causing the market price to increase by Rs. 100 a quintal.Where to store the excess?The new produce from 2017 is already in the market even as cold storages are still flush with last years yield. Already bearing the loss of the input costs, farmers are faced with the dilemma of letting their produce rot in the storages or attempt to sell the old produce at throwaway prices in markets, while competing with the new potato. Many farmers chose to let their produce rot in the cold storages or threw them in their fields for cattle to eat, as the costs of transporting them to the market to sell at low prices was unfeasible. As farmers are unable to repay the cold storage rents, they too face losses as they have to incur operational costs.Authorities, however, say the potatoes being dumped by farmers are the rotting old stock, which would have been cleared from the cold storages sooner or later.What happens next?The State has sent a proposal to the Centre for purchasing 2 lakh tonnes from farmers under the market intervention scheme for the new season. Once the Centre approves the rates proposed by the State, the Horticulture Department will start buying potatoes from farmers in districts where rates are lower than the minimum support price. Last year, purchasing was done in 41 districts. Potatoes for the new season are still being dug out and the situation will be clear by February-end.OMAR RASHID"

She said Kufri Lima potato was suitable for the hot and humid conditions in Andhra Pradesh as it could withstand heat and various diseases, and required relatively less quantity of water in the sense that drip irrigation was enough for it to flourish. Mr. Reddy requested noted scientist Aldas Janaiah to advise on diversification of potato crop and instructed Dr. YSR Horticultural University scientist Dileep Babu and Deputy Director of Horticulture Padmavati to try some of the varieties suggested by the team on a pilot basis."

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

(Express Photo) Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu (middle) and other officials launch biodegradable bags in Ludhiana Tuesday. (Express Photo)The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) launched biodegradable carry bags made from granules of potato and corn starch in Ludhiana Tuesday.Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu while launching the bags with PPCB officials appealed to the masses to shun plastic bags.Speaking to The Indian Express, Kahan Singh Pannu, PPCB chairman said that these bags are produced from starch granules which can be derived from potatoes, corn and other starch rich products. Currently, five companies have been given license by central government to manufacture these bags. They are based in Bengaluru, Chennai and other places out of Punjab. So we have tied up with them and getting bags on order basis, he said.Currently, no company in Punjab is manufacturing these biodegradable bags which turn into compost after six months if exposed to water or sun or disposed away in garbage.The bags are also costlier compared to plastic ones. Price is a little higher because demand is less and there are not much suppliers. But as soon as common people will start adopting them as substitute for plastic, they will be cheaper. We are making these bags available in small quantity as of now to plastic bags sellers here so that people can start buying them, said GS Gill, environmental engineer, PPCB Ludhiana.PPCB further revealed that at least 225 tonnes of plastic bags are currently used in Punjab on daily basis of which 130 tonnes are used in Ludhiana. This, even as plastic usage is completely banned in Punjab. On Tuesday, plastic manufacturers were also invited at the launch and appealed to shift from plastic bags manufacturing to these biodegradable bags.Pannu said said PPCB is trying to popularize these bags which turn into compost, among the masses. We are holding awareness drives on daily basis. We are facilitating tie up of manufacturing companies with plastic manufacturers here so that they can study the product and plan manufacturing in future, he said.MO Bittu also advised plastic carry bag manufacturers to shift towards manufacturing of compostable carry bags by using starch derived from maize and potatoes.Earlier, the Golden Temple in Amritsar has announced usage of these bags to give prasad. On Tuesday, Mastuana Sahib gurudwara in Sangrur district also started usage of these bags for giving prasad to devotees.

It is believed such huge size potatoes are grown for the first time in the country. Usually, such huge potatoes are imported from other countries by those into production of wafers or potato chips.KVR Rao, principal scientist, in irrigation and drainage department along with his team was able to grow such a huge potato. Rao said, the experiment was successful and plastic munching technique was used. It helped in fast growth of microbes, which in turn triggered tubers size by at least three times. Rao said, By using plastic munching technique, we were able to grow such huge potato. In plastic munching, a special plastic sheet with silver and black colour is installed on the farm land. Then a hole is made in the plastic sheet under which seed is sown.The plastic munch method will help raise yield output manifold and prevent the crop from pest attack and diseases. The sheet will support crop during excess rain and lack of required rain. Rao claimed, Farming of potato is difficult in the state due to black soil, but through plastic munching we can grow it that too in bigger size. Rao said, I have been working for three years to increase size of potatoes. Last year, we did first successful trial. On Wednesday, after harvesting second trial, we were able to do our successful experiment. Farmers will have to invest around Rs 24,000 per hectare on plastic munching sheet. After installing this, fertilizer and labour expenses will be nil and production will be three times higher than conventional method, he said."

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

The three-way split with the emergence of BSR Congress and the KJP under Yeddyurappa proved fatal. Our estimates had put us at 90 to 95 seats in 2013, but with a united front we could have easily secured 115 to 120 seats.No. While the Mahadayi issue has favoured the BJP  we have put our best efforts into it and the Congress are the culprits  the Lingayats have all consolidated and rallied behind the BJP. I shall in fact thank chief minister Siddaramaiah and the Congress party after these elections. I would say Congress leader Shivaraj Patil also needs to be thankedThere is no comparison between Modiji and Siddaramaiah. The PM is in his own league and cannot be compared to the Congress chief minister. On paper, due to the ineptness of AICC president Rahul Gandhi, it may look like that. But at present there is no leader in the Indian polity to be compared to Modi.He (Patil) also put in efforts on the same issue in Maharashtra and the Congress lost in that state.That is definitely not going to happen. I will not discount the JD(S) getting no seats, but there is a wave in the country favouring the BJP. The previous elections, including those in the northeastern states, have given us a mandate. Besides, the common phenomenon between the Congress and the JD(S) is caste, money and family. In our case it is lagan (effort), prathiba (caliber) and mehanat (hard work). Our leaders, including Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind are products of these three factors. Ninety-nine per cent of our leadership does not have a caste factor, no political lineage and no money power.Our focus will be a mixture of local and state level issues. We are concentrating on issues related to every constituency and limited to that segment. While in Belagavi the issues are related to the potato crop, in Davanagere it is related to cotton and maize crops. Elsewhere, in Hassan it is related to Hemavathi and in Malnad region it is the arecanut growers. So we have asked our leaders to raise these local issues in the segments concerned. State-level issues will include Congress goonda raj and corruption within this government."
