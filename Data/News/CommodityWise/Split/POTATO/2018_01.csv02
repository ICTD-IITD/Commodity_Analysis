The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

If you went to a house and saw people eating the tuber, they would hide it because it was identified with being poor, she recalls. An year later, Dr. Andrade, a scientist with the International Potato Centre (CIP), initiated a breeding programme for orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) in the drought- prone areas of sub Saharan Africa. The project led to the release of nine varieties of the root crop rich in vitamin A, a critical micronutrient for pregnant women and undernourished children.In 2016, she won the World Food Prize for her role in sweet potato production that helped many countries of Africa address food and nutritional insecurity.Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the third Asia Sweetpotato Breeders and Seed System meeting here, Dr. Andrade said promotional programmes by the CIP and policy initiatives by governments had pitchforked sweet potato to the status of a top priority crop in 14 African countries. Over a period of twelve years, OFSP has reached five million families across the continent."

Assistant Director General, ICAR (Horticulture Science), T. Janakiram said the meeting had provided a platform to assess the strength of the participating nations in sweet potato production and bridge the technology gaps in agricultural research.The discussions centred on how the member states could benefit from the transfer of genetic material and exchange of technology for molecular breeding and value addition, he told The Hindu on the sidelines of the event.As a climate-resilient crop that can address malnutrition, sweet potato production assumes significance across the world. In India, though sweet potato production is largely focussed on food and nutritional security, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has initiated efforts to promote value addition of the crop and explore the potential for alternative uses like animal feed and starch production.Dr. Janakiram said moves were on to create a value chain for sweet potato involving farmer producer organisations. Commercial cultivation of the crop will be dictated by market dynamics. We are trying to assess consumer demand for value-added products.Director, CTCRI, Archana Mukherjee said farmers in many States were switching over to sweet potato because of the short crop duration, low input costs, high yield, disease tolerance and climate resilience.Dr. Mukherjee said the area under sweet potato cultivation in India was declining due to the lack of processing industries."

But the delicious snacks the shop has been serving all these years have won a lot of admirers for the 55-year-old woman. The eatery which has many loyal customers is located on West Adaiyavalanjan Street in Srirangam.Ask one of her regular snackers what they love to pick first from the shop and the answer is likely to be Tirumaal vadai. That is one item which my customers never get tired of. Within minutes of preparing the vadais, they get sold out. Most of those who come to my eatery tell me that ours is the best vadai they have ever tasted, says Shagunthala proudly. The specialty vadai is made of black gram and pepper. Besides this sought-after snack, the eatery also has a dedicated following for mint and onion pakoda.Asked how she learnt to make Tirumaal vadai, she said, It kind of tastes like vadais that we get as prasad in temples. I just made my own version of it. According to her, at least 500 customers come to her eatery every day. This is the reason why I make sure I dont take leave and my shop is open throughout the year, she said.Open from 4.30 pm to 8.30 pm, the other snack varieties at Shagunthalas shop include medhu vadai, masala vadai, potato bonda, chilli bajji, plantain bajji apart from the sweets adhirasam and boli. While adhirasam and boli cost Rs 5 apiece, four pieces of the rest of the items are available at Rs 10.Shagunthala credited much of her eaterys success to her husband. Though I run it, my husband helps me a lot. Hes the one who prepares the dough for all the items. He never gets tired, she said. The Srirangam-resident said she was immensely satisfied with the fact that the prime reason to start the eatery had been fulfilled. I started it so that I could provide good education to my children. My son is now working abroad and my daughter is leading a happy married life. This is all I wanted, she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her business, she said, No, not at all. Its tough to manage this place itself. If I get greedy, Ill ultimately be the sufferer in the end, she said."

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit. That too, for tomatoes that are mostly damaged, as a result of a poor crop. Earlier, we used to buy a crate (25 kg) at Rs 30. Now, it has gone up to Rs 300, said a wholeseller for tomatoes. As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."

Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) members also shared the stage with Eco-Sikh members and heads of different religious groups. Eco-Sikh India president Supreet Kaur, while addressing a packed gathering, said: Eco-friendly plastic bags are the future, as pollution levels are increasing every day with the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags. These bags play a crucial role in controlling pollution levels across the globe. They have the capability to decompose naturally in 180 days when exposed to water or sunlight, or disposed of in garbage. Even if they are consumed by animals, they are not harmful to them. Moreover, the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags in religious places have increased in the recent past. Because of this, we have started this service from the gurdwara, so that people take this issue seriously, and make an effort to bring these bags into their daily use.Speaking on the occasion, PPCB chief engineer Pradeep Gupta said: Next month, India is hosting the World Environment Day on 5 June, under the theme Beat Plastic Pollution. PPCB will make all efforts to popularize the manufacturing and sale of bio-degradable bags on a large-scale, to overcome rising pollution levels due to the use of plastic bags. We are supporting every effort being taken to save the environment and future of the earth by different organizations.Extending his gratitude to PPCB and the religious bodies  including Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, Gurdwara Sarabha Nagar, Jama Masjid (Field Ganj), Durga Temple, Gyan Sthal , and Sri Krishna Mandir  Eco-Sikh Board member Jaspreet Singh said: The use of plastic bags has brought Punjab on the top in terms of pollution. According to past PPCB reports, Punjab produces about 4,300 tonnes of garbage every day, most of which is not recycled and ends up polluting the rivers and our soil. Looking at all statistics, these bags are the need of the an hour. Eco-Sikh has taken up the matter bio-degradable plastic bags, which will conserve nature and preserve our future."
5b1b14b79855b76d57036d1b,"Break, queen, pocket... carrom’s still alive, waiting to strike it rich",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/break-queen-pocket-carroms-still-alive-waiting-to-strike-it-rich/articleshow/64346341.cms,2018-05-27,"PUNE: In the days of non-existent mobile phones and playstations, long hours spent deflecting wooden coins to round corner holes on a square plywood board was a prime distraction during the school vacations. Indeed, carrom as a sit-down game had a charm of its own then, giving the energetic and raucous street cricket, gilli-danda and kabaddi a run for their money.Parents, as an indulgence or simply to stave off the holiday ennui in their children, would buy a carrom board that lasted till the surface puffed up or the bumpers on the sides spewed wood shavings due to the constant strikes. The less fortunate children from the mohallas and bastis would seek the carrom clubs in their areas, but parental reproach was certain as these places were also known for gambling on games.Carrom remains in a transitional phase but much of the past has seen a makeover, says Shekhar Chavan, a professor with the Suryadatta Group of Institutes in Pune and the secretary of the Poona District Carrom Association. Around 16 carrom houses in Pune city and a few others in Pimpri Chinchwad are registered with the association, abiding by the rules of play as well as decorum. Then there are numerous small carrom clubs which also have players signing up with the association for tournaments.The rules of the game have seen several changes over time. Those who have played carrom at home will know of the 29-point board but international rules now allow for 25-point games, where pocketing the queen fetches 3 points, not 5. The queen is of no value after a player notches 21 points. A contest involves 8 games; the winner is the one who scores 25 points first or who secures maximum points after 8 games are completed. Home shots are still allowed.Gone are the ivory strikers of old, which seasoned players kept safely in cushioned circular cases. Strikers nowadays are made of the same plastic material that is used in snooker balls and weigh 15 grams or less. Coins glide across the board surface aided by boric powder, concerns over its toxicity notwithstanding. Some Western countries prefer potato starch to boric powder.The ongoing Ramzan month sees players coming in droves till late in the night to Irfan Shaikhs carrom house at Kausarbaug off NIBM Road , close to the now-famed iftar eating places. There are 15 boards here, the most any club in the city has. Huddled around these boards, players devote equal time to their play and wiping their sweaty palms, the latter a result of the heat generated from the overhead filament bulbs ensconced in conical metal shades. The fans cant whirr here for relief as the boric powder would get blown away.As at most carrom houses, the charges here are a nominal Rs 30 for an hours play. Shaikh, who runs a furniture business, is obviously putting in his own money to pay for the rent of the premises, electricity and purchase of boards. A new board costs around Rs 7,000, but a good player would practise on it only for one-and-a-half year or so.Chavan justifies this, saying top players today wont chance their skills on lesser boards. Players these days have a very strategic and scientific approach to the game. For instance, you find many a player using the exact same strike power while making a break at the start of every game. The coins too will come to rest in exactly the same position as in the earlier breaks, he says.But while players are increasingly setting the bar higher, the game is still not attracting big bucks. The budget for the nationals held in Pune recently was a trifling Rs 40 lakh. Though the tournament drew around 800 people from all states, including players and officials, the district association had to tap sponsors, MP and MLA funds, central and state aid, and also bring out a souvenir which fetched money from advertisements.Pradeep Bartake (64), who runs Janardhan Carrom House, the oldest one in the city since 1974, agrees that the player profile has gone up over the years and the facilities at clubs are far better. However, incentives or the lure of free participation is important for getting the numbers for tournaments, he says. Giving an example, he points out that the carrom tournament for the mayors trophy around two months back drew 1,450 participants, but quiet a few of them were lured chiefly by the free tracksuits and Rs 300 per day offered to them.There are, however, top-notch players who owe their all to carrom. Like 37-year-old Yogesh Pardeshi, who as a child had seen his family struggling to make ends meet. A winner at the prestigious world carrom championships and two world cups, Pardeshi is now a manager with the Indian Oil Corporation solely for his playing skills. Several other players in the country have landed government jobs too, he says.Governments need to loosen their purse strings too, says Pardeshi. He points out that the Maharashtra government, in an unprecedented move, gave Rs 70 lakh each to three state players who shone in the Birmingham world championship held in 2016.In the end, though, it is purely the love for the game that keeps it going. Pradeep Jadhav (76), a retired dentist, has been playing since 1962 and shows up daily at Shaikhs carrom club after shutting his denture-making shop. He recalls playing at a club near Alpana talkies in the early days where the hourly fee was just two paise. An ivory striker would then cost a princely Rs 9, but Jadhav says he cant get one these days even though he is willing to offer Rs 5,000."

Merchants said the volume was higher than what was in the recent years.Usually during May, the market would see an inflow of 500 to 1,000 bags of carrots a day, said K Abdul Hakkeem , a wholesaler. But this year, around 3,000 bags of carrots have been coming daily, he told TOI.One bag would have 70kg of carrots on average. So in the recent weeks, the market has been seeing an inflow of around 2 lakh kilograms, which was unprecedented as far as he knew, said Hakkeem, who has been trading vegetables for the last 15 years. From the Mettupalayam market, carrots are sent to markets across Tamil Nadu and Kerala.While the copious summer rainfall has ensured good carrot harvest in the Nilgiris , from where carrots reach the Mettupalayam market, farmers said they had also increased the acreage of carrots as they had seen good profit from the crop last season. A kilogram of carrot was sold for as high as Rs 70 last year, said G Ramesh , a carrot farmer from M Palada in the Nilgiris. The good price led several farmers to increase their carrot cultivation area by reducing the area for other vegetables such as beetroot and potatoes, he said. Ramesh himself had increased carrot plantation from five acres last year to 10 this year.Also, we received a good yield this time. There has been a 10% increase in yield per acre. Usually, we would harvest around 250 bags from an acre. This year we have harvested 300 bags, Ramesh said.On the flip side, the boom has resulted in drastic price fall. Compared to last year, carrot price has dipped down to Rs 15 to Rs 20, say farmers and merchants. While we invested heavily in the crop, the high production has turned adverse and has hit the prices, said P Raju, a carrot farmer from Lovedale in the Nilgiris.The area under carrot cultivation in the Nilgiris has significantly increased over the last five years, said officials of the horticulture department. Now carrots are cultivated in around 2,500 hectares, which is a 50% to 60% increase from what was five years ago, said an official. Potato cultivation area has come down and carrots have taken over. Several farmers thought they could at least get back what they had invested if they cultivate carrots, the official added.However, farmers said if they had better logistics and marketing opportunities, they could see better returns."

Scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP), Lucknow, claim that sweet potato plant originated in India and not the United States They claim to have discovered a 57 million-year-old sweet potato fossil from the East Garo hill district of Meghalaya , adding that it is older than the last recorded 40-million-old sweet potato fossil found in Colorado, US.Their premise is based on an 18-year study conducted by a team of three scientists  BSIPs Rakesh C Mehrotra and Gaurav Srivastava, and David L Dilcher from Indiana University , US.The sweet potato fossil found in Meghalaya is the oldest in the world, say BSIP scientists.The study has been published in the international scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The fossil of some leaves were collected by the two BSIP scientists in 1996 from Meghalaya. After the initial fossil identification study, they found that the leaves were of sweet potato. A detailed research work began in 2000.The discovery of a plant fossil is rare because plants soft structure is not easily preserved in the rocks, said senior scientist Rakesh C Mehrotra.He said that 17 specimens of the fossil of leaves discovered were made to study the pattern of veins in the blade of a leaf and secretory ducts (cells). The study showed that the leaves were of sweet potato and belonged to the morning glory family, Mehrotra added. The research was conducted at three herbariums in the country  National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow; Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, and Central National Herbarium, Howrah.Mehrotra said the sediment where the fossil was extracted was found to be 57 million years old, hence the fossil was also considered to be of the same date.BSIP director Sunil Bajpai said its a landmark discovery.The study will help in understanding the evolutionary origins and the existing concepts of sweet potatoes. It will also help in understanding the climatic conditions and related factors that prevailed millions of years ago."

For the past 179 years, the ritual has been repeated every Ramzan in the bawarchikhana (kitchen) within the premises of the Chhota Imambara.While it is dal and tandoori roti that is cooked for three days, an Awadhi delicacy called taley hue aaloo ka salan (fried potato curry) with roti follows for the next three. The cycle continues for the entire month of Ramzan, feeding around 600 poor people as their dinner the the entire month of Ramzan.In the same kitchen, a different set of snacks is also prepared for the specific purpose of serving rozedars coming to offer prayers in 15 mosques under Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT).Around 2,500 people will receive a plate of gujhiya, phulka, chana, suhaal, dates, a fruit (preferably banana) along with bread-butter and cake outsourced from a bakery, thanks to a kings commitment to the poor.The third King of Awadh, Muhammad Ali Shah, had created the Husainabad Endowment Deed in 1839 to feed the poor. Since then, the two massive community kitchens within the Chhota Imambara have been following the tradition of sending out iftari to the 15 mosques under its umbrella.Every Ramzan, by the end of the day, this kitchen would have fed over 3,000 mouths.A sum of around Rs 16 lakh is passed for the iftar and dinner services every year. Two separate dedicated teams of chefs and their assistants are engaged for it. Everyday, activity in the kitchens begins at 8am. By 4.30pm, we send out the first batch of iftar food for the mosques, said Habibul Hasan , an official from HAT.The 179-year-old Nawabi tradition saw a break only in 2015. During Ramzan that year, a movement against alleged corruption in the UP Shia Central Waqf Board being spearheaded by Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad had brought the tradition to a halt. Protesters had locked the entrances to both the Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara, restricting all entry. Even the kitchens could not function.However, people from the neighbourhood of the 15 mosques came together to fund the food. HAT had also roped in private bakeries. Even during the mourning months of Muharram, food is served from the traditional kitchens of the Imambara."

Many eateries in the city provided them early morning (sehri) and evening meals (iftaar) before and after the fast (roza) on Thursday.Eateries in areas like Sabzibagh and Ramna Road prepared variety of dishes, including chana, pakoda, potato and egg cutlet, bread pakoda, onion and brinjal fries, imarti, fruit salad, for devotees to break their fast in the evening.We began preparing the meal from 3.30pm on Thursday and continued till the time of sehri in the wee hours on Friday. We are open 24X7 during the holy month to serve those who live alone in the city, Md Mokhtar, the staff of a small hotel on Ramna Road, said and added mostly boys and girls living in hostels came to eat food at the hotel during Ramzan.Another restaurant owner at Sabzibagh said, I start preparing sehri from 2am so that the food gets prepared on time. I make sure the ingredients used in the process are pure and healthy. Items made of milk like shaahi tukda, doodh lacchha and sewai are popular among customers as they make them feel energetic for the rest of the day.While some devotees are trying to eat healthy by consuming food cooked at home, those staying away from home are finding it difficult to look for healthy food options to break their fast.Gulfashan Ehsan, a postgraduate student of a Pune-based college, said, I am glad my summer break has started during the month of Ramzan. It is important to have healthy food after breaking the fast, but my hostel canteen does not provide hygienic food.Working professionals rued that they did not get much time in office to have proper meal during iftaar. According to Anam Ahsan, a dentist by profession, My patients are my first priority. I break the fast with a khajoor (date) and some water and take my meal once I reach home.Imbesat Imam, a working mother, told TOI, I keep my food simple and conserve energy as much as possible. As my sons school is shut, it is easier for me to manage everything at home."
5b1b1ebd9855b76d570373fc,Mumbaikars take eco-friendly steps to be plastic-free,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-take-eco-friendly-steps-to-be-plastic-free/articleshow/64206844.cms,2018-05-18,"The Maharashtra government has extended the deadline to implement plastic ban to help vendors and shopkeepers utilise their existing stock. Mumbaikars, however, are in no mood to wait for the official implementation and want to be the change themselves. So, some of them have gone ahead and started making lifestyle changes to make a smooth transition to a plastic-free world.While shopkeepers have found a solution to pack dry items in cloth or paper bags, fish, meat and milk sellers are yet to find an alternative in a plastic-less world. In fact, people have started carrying metal utensils to buy milk or non-vegetarian items like chicken, meat or fish. Says Mili Shetty , an environmentalist, A group of us in the neighbourhood have always carried our own cloth bags to buy vegetables and fruits, so the introduction of the plastic ban didnt make any difference to us. In fact, we have also started carrying tiffins to buy stuff like meat as its inconvenient to carry it in paper. We also use utensils to pick up milk from dairy.Carry your own plate to make a difference to the environment, suggests Kysha Rochlani . The young mom is a regular visitor to the organic food market held over the weekend at Juhu. These days she has started carrying stainless steel plates to use it whenever she feels like eating from the many stalls put up there. Her friend Sarah Pinto does the same when she visits the Chembur organic market on Sundays. Says Kysha, I always carry my own cloth bag to pick up stuff from the farmers market. For some days now, I have also started carrying a plate and spoon with me to avoid eating in disposable plates.For those who find cloth bags used from grand-mom days plain, it is time to take another look at the cloth bags that are now available in the market. Bags made of denim, jute, canvas and crochet are quite popular. Made out of natural material, not only are these bags eco-friendly but also sturdy. Navin Singh, a management student, says, Earlier boys would avoid carrying cloth bags, but now there are so many trendy options to choose from. I have started carrying a denim bag that looks cool, while my mom has pulled out my grandmas handmade crochet bags which are in fashion again!Bags made from starches and vegetable wastes are also available; they are stronger, more durable and of course, bio-degradable. Says home-maker, Kusha Wadhwa, After segregating dry and wet waste in different dustbins, our society has gone a step further  theyre now encouraging us to use dustbin bags made from potato starch which are bio-degradable. We have completely stopped using the black plastic dustbin bags.Much before the ban was announced, Rhea Chhabria , a young designer, started making bamboo and stainless steel straws in January to reduce the usage of plastic ones. Many cafes and restaurants are now using the same. So many plastic straws are used and discarded on a daily basis, but now that people are forced to make the switch, we hope that more will join in the cause, she says.Many households have also started buying eco-friendly straws to use at home. Says Mitali Narayan, My daughter uses a straw to sip milk and other liquids, but now I have switched to bamboo and steel straws. They come with a special brush to clean, which can be maintained easily and are re-usable for a long period.These days food parcels come with bamboo plates and spoons. Foodie and blogger Geeta Sridhar was in for a surprise, when she asked a restaurant to parcel the leftover food. They packed it in a terracotta pot and closed the lid tightly. They didnt give a plastic bag to carry it, but told me to hold it straight to prevent the contents from spilling out. It was a re-usable pot, so I have planted some herbs in it now, she says.For some people like Joyee Mahanta , whos into food catering, the ban has made them look at alternatives to plastic. We intend to replace all plastic bags with bio-degradable corn starch bags. Even though plastic containers are not banned yet, we are looking for an eco-friendly replacement, she says."

Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of Ramzan. The annual observance is regarded as one of the five pillars of Islam.In a bid at creating an environment free of terror and violence during the holy month, the Centre has announced a conditional ceasefire under which security forces will not launch any operations in Jammu and Kashmir during Ramzan, but reserve the right to retaliate if attacked.Here are some questions and answers about Islam's holiest month. (Source: AP)Ramzan is a time of contemplation, fortitude and worship. The fast is intended to bring the faithful closer to God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate. Ramzan is a time to detach from worldly pleasures and focus on one's inner self.It's seen as a way to physically and spiritually purify, refraining from habits such as smoking and caffeine. Muslims often donate to charities during the month and feed the hungry. Many spend more time at mosques during Ramzan and use their downtime to recite the Quran.Fasting during Ramzan is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayer, charity, and performing the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca (TOI Photo)Observant Muslims abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk for the entire month of Ramzan. A single sip of water or a puff of a cigarette is enough to invalidate the fast.However, Muslim scholars say it's not enough to just avoid food and drinks during the day. Ramzan is also an exercise in self-restraint. Muslims are encouraged to avoid gossip and arguments. Sexual intercourse between spouses is also forbidden during the daytime fast.Just before the fast, Muslims have a pre-dawn meal of power foods to get them through the day, the ""suhoor."" Egyptians eat mashed fava beans called ""ful,"" spiced with cumin and olive oil, while in Lebanon and Syria, popular suhoor food is flatbread with thyme, cheese or yogurt. In Afghanistan, people eat dates and dumplings stuffed with potato and leeks, first steamed, then fried.(TOI Photo)Muslims traditionally break their fast like the Prophet Muhammad did some 1,400 years ago, with a sip of water and some dates at sunset. That first sip of water is the most anticipated moment of the day.After sunset prayers, a large feast known as ""iftar"" is shared with family and friends. Iftar is a social event as much as it is a gastronomical adventure. Across the Arab world, apricot juices are an iftar staple. In South Asia and Turkey, yogurt-based drinks are popular.Every night of Ramzan, mosques and aid organizations set up tents and tables for the public to have free iftar meals.(TOI Photo)Yes. There are exceptions for children, the elderly, those who are ill, women who are pregnant, nursing or menstruating, and people traveling, which can include athletes during tournaments.Many Muslims, particularly those living in the United States and Europe, are accepting and welcoming of others around them who aren't observing Ramzan.However, non-Muslims or adult Muslims who eat in public during the day can be fined or even jailed in some Mideast countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which is home to large Western expat populations in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In many predominantly Muslim countries like Indonesia, karaoke bars and nightclubs are closed across much of the country for the month. Restaurants there use curtains to conceal customers who eat during the day.(TOI photo)And in Egypt, the Dar al-Ifta, which is the main authority in charge of issuing religious edits, warned against eating in public, saying this is not an act of ""personal freedom, but chaos  an assault on Islam.""In China, minority Uighur Muslims complain of heavy restrictions by the Communist Party, such as bans on fasting by party members, civil servants, teachers and students during Ramzan, as well as generally enforced bans on children attending mosques, women wearing veils and young men growing beards.(TOI Photo)Typically, the start of the month is welcomed with the greeting of ""Ramzan kareem!"" Another hallmark of Ramzan is nightly prayer at the mosque among Sunni Muslims called ""taraweeh.""Egyptians have the tradition of Ramzan lanterns called the ""fanoos,"" often the centerpiece at an iftar table or seen hanging in window shops and from balconies. In the Arabian Gulf countries, wealthy families hold ""majlises"" where they open their doors for people to pass by all hours of the night for food, tea, coffee and conversation.Increasingly common are Ramzan tents in five-star hotels that offer lavish and pricey meals from sunset to sunrise. While Ramzan is a boon for retailers in the Middle East and South Asia, critics say the holy month is increasingly becoming commercialized.Scholars have also been disturbed by the proliferation of evening television shows during Ramzan. In Pakistan, live game shows give away gifts promoting their sponsors. In the Arab world, month-long soap operas starring Egypt's top actors, rake in millions of dollars in advertising.(TOI Photo)The end of Ramzan is marked by intense worship as peopple seek to have their prayers answered during ""Laylat al-Qadr"" or ""the Night of Destiny."" It is on this night, which falls during the last 10 nights of Ramzan, that Muslims believe that God sent the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad and revealed the first verse of the Quran.The end of Ramzan is celebrated by a three-day holiday called Eid al-Fitr. Children often receive new clothes, gifts and cash.Muslims attend early morning Eid prayers the day after Ramzan. Families usually spend the day at parks and eating  now during the day."

The price of the vegetable has jumped from Rs 10 per kg last month to Rs 18 per kg.Collectors have also been advised to crack down on unscrupulous traders. ""They have also been asked to keep a close watch on the arrival of potatoes in the market and ensure the availability of the same to consumers,"" food supplies and consumer welfare secretary V V Yadav said in a letter to the collectors.The letter said, ""If required, action may be taken against the hoarders and unscrupulous traders under the Provision of Essential Commodities Act, 1955."" The price of potato has shot through the roof in the last few days. ""It is ascertained that there is less production of potato this year in the producing states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, which has led to the rise in price in our state. Taking advantage of such a situation, some traders may resort to hoarding and creation of artificial scarcity in the market,"" the letter read.The collectors of border districts were requested to ensure that flow of potato from the producing states into Odisha is not disrupted. ""Potato is the most essential vegetable in the kitchen and in summer we use more of it. But due to high prices, we have had to cut its consumption,"" said Hemangini Das, a homemaker living in the capital city.The civil supply department on Wednesday conducted raids at several vegetable mandis of Cuttack, including the one at Chhatra Bazar , following Yadav's letter. ""We have conducted raid on 14 vegetable godowns and found no extra stock there,"" said district civil supply officer Amar Mohapatra. Odisha produces around three lakh metric tonnes of potato every year against the annual requirement of around 12 lakh metric tonnes and depends on West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to meet the need."

The cost factor coupled with deliciousness worked wonders for him and his food cart became the toast of K K Nagar and still remains a sought-after snack destination in the locality.Today, at least 500 people on an average visit his eatery every day. Masala vadai, which is available for one rupee apiece, medhu vadai for Rs 2, samosa for Rs 10 (three pieces) and potato bonda, which also costs a rupee per piece, are the in-demand snacks in his food cart. Rengaraj said that his business had turned out to be successful because he didnt get overly ambitious or greedy and that he never liked to increase the cost of the snacks. Selling snacks for a low price has proved to be a win-win for both me and my customers. If they like to have good snacks for a low price I too make a decent profit because so many customers visit my place every day, he said.Apart from vadai, samosa and bonda, adhirasam, which costs Rs 5 per piece and pakoda, which costs Rs 20 (100 grams), are also very popular among the customers. Sometimes the work is so tiring because everything gets sold out the moment they are laid on the tray. But again, I take it as a reward for the quality of the food that is offered at my eatery, Rengaraj said.The 45-year-old owed much of the good reputation that his eatery has earned to his wife, R Kavitha. The food cart is open from 1 pm to 9 pm. Every morning, my wife starts the primary preparation by around 10 am and it is her recipe that has worked wonders, Rengaraj said. Since only the two of them looked after the eatery, they were able to cut costs efficiently.Rengaraj says he lays much emphasis on serving healthy food. I never ever sell leftover food at my eatery. I procure fresh vegetables everyday and also take so much effort to make sure that even the ingredients used are as fresh as possible, he stated."
5b1b4ce49855b76d5703903c,"ITC pips PepsiCo in salty sticks, triangles",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/itc-pips-pepsico-in-salty-sticks-triangles/articleshow/63992723.cms,2018-05-02,"MUMBAI: A certain subset of the Rs 23,000-crore salty snacks market has come into the spotlight with leading packaged foods companies  PepsiCo India and ITC  in a neck-and-neck race for the market leadership position.The Rs 3,400-crore subset in question is bridges, where ITCs Bingo Tedhe Medhe and Bingo Mad Angles compete with PepsiCos Kurkure . Bridges primarily consist of two formats  sticks and triangles. While most players in the category operate in sticks, the triangular format is pioneered by Mad Angles, inspired by the traditional Gujarati snack khakra. The four broad sub-segments of the salty snacks industry are Indian namkeens (Rs 9,500 crore), potato chips (Rs 5,500 crore), extruded (Rs 4,300 crore) and bridges. PepsiCo and ITC compete in almost all segments of salty snacks. Besides, they also compete in juices.According to industry sources quoting Nielsen data for February and March 2018 in the bridges segment, ITC Bingo, with a share of just over 30%, has overtaken PepsiCos Kurkure by a small margin. ITC has displayed consistency in being a leader in this subset for three months (January, February and March) this year.However, according to Nielsen's moving annual total data quoted for March 2018, quoted by these industry sources, PepsiCo has a higher value share of about 31% as compared to ITCs share of about 30%. MAT data is relied upon by the FMCG industry to get a picture of the rolling yearly sum. However, any event such as a change in leadership  no matter how minor  in a particular month indicates a turning point for a brand.ITC divisional CEO (foods) Hemant Malik said, ITC Bingo is today the market leader in the bridges segment. The category has become a lot more challenging with the expansion of various smaller and regional players. However, ITC Bingo has been steadily growing in the segment and has maintained a very high share vis--vis competition. Tedhe Medhe has been the growth driver for ITC in the bridges segment. The brand continues to grow in double digits every year.PepsiCo India, however, believes the data relating to a subset does not represent a correct picture. In our view, the understanding of the category is important. The bridges category appears outdated and does not hold relevance given the evolution of the snacks market and consumer preferences. PepsiCo looks at the broader extruded segment and so does Nielsen (that includes sub-categories like collet, puffs, triangle-shaped chips and others) where bridges is only a subset. Hence, it is not a like-to-like comparison, said the PepsiCo India spokesperson.In extruded snacks, PepsiCo India has a higher share of 26% (MAT data for March 2018), while ITC is at around 21%. The PepsiCo India spokesperson said considering that salty snacks is a very complex category  with multiple segments and sub-segments operating within it  different manufacturers and brands may assess their performance based on classifications best suited for them in the market. This is done by taking into account factors such as presence of branded products in a segment, average selling price of segment or sub-segment.PepsiCo India, which extended its portfolio with the launch of Kurkure Trangles , is the market leader in salty snacks, which is also the fastest growing category in overall snacks. Our flagship brand Kurkure is growing at a healthy double-digit and we aim to double our volumes on the brand in the next five years on account of regionalisation and innovation, the spokesperson added. ITC, on the other hand, has utilised its in-house culinary expertise of ITC hotels chefs to understand the needs of variety-seeking consumers in different geographies. ITC has a widespread distribution network that plays a critical role in ensuring product availability across the length and breadth of the country. Strong distribution growth is also a key driver for Tedhe Medhes business growth. In the last one year, ITC has added over 2.9 lakh retailers in the bridges segment, said Malik."
5b1b5f599855b76d57039789,Trump hosting glitzy White House state dinner for Macron,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-hosting-glitzy-white-house-state-dinner-for-macron/articleshow/63889373.cms,2018-04-24,"WASHINGTON: Now it's President Donald Trump's turn to pull off the ultimate charm offensive.Wined and dined on multiple state visits during his tour of Asia last year, Trump is paying it forward and celebrating nearly 250 years of U.S.-French relations by playing host to President Emmanuel Macron at a glitzy White House state dinner on Tuesday.Months in the making, it's the first state visit and first big soiree of the Trump era in Washington ""It sounds like what they're planning will be spectacular,"" said Jeremy Bernard, who was White House social secretary in 2014, the last time the U.S. feted a French president.The White House has said little beyond the fact that dinner will be served, sticking to the tradition of trying to maintain an element of surprise for its guests.In fact, Macron will break bread twice with Trump.On Monday, the president and Melania Trump dined privately with Macron and his wife, Brigitte, at Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington, on the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia. The White House had said the setting would serve as a reminder of France's ""unique status"" as America's first ally.Trump ended his first year without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, making him the first president in nearly 100 years to do so and heightening the stakes for Tuesday.Dinner tickets are typically highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite. A few inklings of who's in and who's out already are known: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in, as are House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was invited, but his office said he is unable to attend.In a break with tradition, Trump invited no Democratic members of Congress or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements. But at least one Democrat will be in the crowd: the office of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed his attendance.Approximately 150 guests will take their seats in the State Dining Room on Tuesday, making for a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest lists numbered into the hundreds, requiring that the event be held in a tented pavilion erected on the South Lawn because no room in the White House can accommodate that many people.Most of the responsibility for executing a flawless celebration falls to the first lady and her staff, including such key details as what is served (Trump likes wedge salads and chocolate cake) and poured into glasses (Trump wine?), who sits next to whom, who performs after dinner and what the decor looks like.One big moment is the first glimpse of the first lady in her gown. Fashion details are kept secret until the first couple steps on to the North Portico on Tuesday night to welcome their dinner guests.Former first lady Michelle Obama often used state dinners to showcase the talent of up-and-coming designers. Some designers have cited Trump's politics in refusing to dress the current first lady, a former model. Still, a likely choice would be Dior, the French design house whose fashions Mrs. Trump often wears, or Herve Pierre, the French-American who designed her inaugural gown and other looks.The last time a Republican president hosted his French counterpart was November 2007 when President George W. Bush welcomed the newly divorced Nicolas Sarkozy.More than 100 guests feasted on lobster bisque, lamb with tomato fondue, green beans and sweet potato casserole, salad and dessert served in the State Dining Room. Among the guests were major league baseball pitcher Tom Glavine, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, French chef Guy Savoy and several Louisiana politicians.After dinner, guests strolled down the hall to the East Room to watch performers in the roles of Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, the Frenchman who served on Washington's staff in the Continental Army. Sarkozy toured Mount Vernon the following day.When Macron's limousine first pulls up the White House driveway on Tuesday morning, Trump, the first lady, White House and administration officials, and hundreds of invited guests will be waiting on the South Lawn. The pomp-filled arrival ceremony is for the man who became the youngest president in French history when he was elected in 2017 at age 39 on his first run for office.The visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office meeting and a joint White House news conference with Trump. There's also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence before Macron and his wife arrive for the state dinner.The Trump-Macron relationship appeared to get off to a bumpy start with a white-knuckler of a handshake when the political novices met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last May. But Macron likely sealed the bond after Trump accepted his invitation to attend the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris in July. Macron and his wife also took Trump and the first lady on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up into the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light. The experience led Trump to order up a military parade for downtown Washington later this year.But the two part company on some significant issues, including the Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from last year, and the Iran-nuclear deal, another multinational agreement that Trump is itching to pull out of. The president did successfully rally Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, with whom Trump has sparred, to mount a joint military operation against Syria in response to an apparent chemical attack this month that killed Syrian civilians. Macron still worries about Trump's desire to remove U.S. troops from Syria.An art lover who speaks good English, Macron is known to watch what he eats. Yet he told reporters at an agricultural fair in Paris in February that ""I drink wine at lunch and dinner.""Discerning his tastes, including likes and dislikes, even allergies, is one of the first things the White House tries to pin down for all guests, said Bernard.""You're really focused on making sure the guest feels special,"" he said.Mrs. Trump's social secretary, Rickie Niceta, came aboard last year after two decades of event planning for a caterer whose clients included the White House, the State Department and several embassies, in addition to working on the past five presidential inaugurations, including Trump's. The first lady, who speaks French, also has experienced hands running the kitchen, pastry shop and florist's lair. All three women helped execute more than a dozen state dinners for Obama.Trump owns hotels, including one near the White House, and knows about good hospitality.Bernard recalled that, just as invitations were about to go out for the 2014 dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande, news broke that Hollande and his longtime girlfriend had abruptly split. Mrs. Obama's staff anxiously sought clarity on whether Hollande would bring another date.He didn't, and Bernard dealt with the awkwardness of the situation by seating Hollande between the two Obamas."

Now prices have gone up and I expect good profit on my produce. Last year farmers had to pay from their pockets to sell potatoes.Like Banglewala, several potato farmers have heaved a sigh of relief after potato prices touched Rs 20 per kg in the market after trading as low as Rs 3 to Rs 4 per kg.Market experts said lower production and less availability of potatoes this season help in lifting prices. Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Dhar and Shajapur are the main potato growing belt in the region.As per data from MP Cold Chain Industries Association, about 10 lakh MT of potatoes are stored at cold storages in Malwa region as against the capacity of 12 lakh MT.Association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, Potatoes contributes about 60 to 70 per cent of storage volume of the cold storages. A lot of capacity was left unutilized this season because potato crop was less.Potato production was down by over 20 per cent last season due to poor prices.Gandhi said, Farmers will earn good profit on potatoes this year because prices have gone up and supply is less.

It is one of the desired destinations for food enthusiasts for five decades.At least 250 people visit the eatery every day for their samosas and vaazhai poo vadai. The snacks are aptly served with tasty mint chutney. In fact, the vadais and samosas are prepared non-stop at the cart since they are immediately sold out once placed on the tray. Both vadai and samosa are priced at Rs 5 per piece.Mohamed is the third generation owner of the food cart, which was launched by his grandfather 50 years ago. ""Once I was handed over the cart, my first target was to experiment with the snack items that were served. I brought a twist to the conventional samosas by using vaazhai poo and onion as stuffing instead of the normal potato and onion,"" Mohamed said, adding that he chose vaazhai poo because of its health benefits.Since both wheat and maida flours are mixed in equal proportions for making the dough, the crispiness is very good, said the 50-year-old. ""The mint chutney, which is served with the snacks, is loved by everyone,"" he said.Though the cart is operates only from 5 pm to 8.30 pm in the evenings, work starts at 5 am for Mohamed. ""I go to Gandhi Market and purchase vegetables since I use only fresh ingredients and never use leftovers,"" he said. The preparation for the stuffing begins at 10 am and goes on up to 3 pm.When asked on why he restricted the menu to only two varieties of snack items, Mohamed said that he didnt want to take the risk and compromise on quality. ""I have only one helper and if I get greedy and add more snack items, to increase profit, I would end up losing my customers since it is impossible to maintain the same quality,"" he stated.The cart owner also said that he had no plans of expanding his business. ""I believe in minimalistic lifestyle. And its no different when it comes to my business too,"" he said with a philosophical note."

The spicy mix traditionally comes in a scooped-out potato cup (kulle) but vendors are now experimenting with fruits, tomato and cucumber as the base. Made popular by food walks, this new avatar of kulle chaat is lapped up by tourists and shoppers in Chawri Bazaar and Sitaram Bazaar, but Purani Dilli frowns on these upstarts who have tinkered with the original.How can you make kulle with tomato? agonises Ashok Mathur , 48, a fifth-generation Old Delhi resident, who has grown up eating Sultans Kulle in his neighbourhood. Kulle used to be only made of aloo or shakarkandi (sweet potato). The spicier, the better! This was followed by a cup of tea, Mathur recounts, sitting in his 100-year-old home in Roshanpura.Arun Kashyap , 32, sits at the same spot where his great grandfather, Sultan Singh, parked himself on a raised platform outside a Jain household, in a narrow bylane that runs parallel to Nai Sadak Kashyap says he has grown up hearing tales of the legendary Mukesh  the singers family lived in Old Delhis Chelpuri  eating kulle made by his great grandfather when he was a roaming hawker with a khomcha (stand).Banana was the first fruit our family experimented with for customers who liked fruit chaat but didnt want the traditional aloo as the base for kulle. Now, we make it with more fruits but the regulars insist on aloo, says Kashyap, who also serves aloo chaat and tikki.The aloo is sand-baked at a bhatti in the Old Subzi Mandi area in the morning. By afternoon it reaches Roshanpura, where Kashyap scoops out the middle to make space for the filling.He starts with a few pinches of a homemade masala which, Kashyap says, has 36 ingredients. This is followed by boiled chana (small chickpeas), kala namak, roasted jeera powder, black pepper, boora (powdered sugar), pomegranate seeds, a squeeze of lemon and finally topped with sliced ginger.This was a vantage point when Sultan set up base here 80 years ago; but changing demography and competition from chaat vendors on the main roads, have made life tough for his great grandson.But support from the local community has kept Sultans kulle going. We use the space outside a Jain familys house but they dont charge us. They let us store our wares inside, and even pay for the kulle they consume, says Kashyap.His chaat still draws members of the Mathur families, who once occupied most houses in this neighbourhood. Today, the homes have given way to shops and godowns. Sultans masala runs in our blood, says Ashok Mathur, talking nostalgically about how people used to choke the lane during Ramlila celebrations to relish the kulle served on dhak patta.So, next time you take Nai Sadak to cross over from the food streets of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid , do try out this palate cleanser."

The fake encounter case became a political hot potato and reportedly saw several cover-up attempts. Gopinatha, who had consistently contested the Gujarat government and police claim that his son was involved in terrorist plots, claimed at one point that his son had been a police informer and had worked for patriots. With Gopinathas death, Ishrats mother Shamima Kauser remains the only petitioner in the case.Police are probing all aspects of the accident. Full investigation will be conducted to determine whether it was an accident or murder, Kerala DGP Loknath Behra told TOI. Gopinatha, a native of Nooranad, met with the accident at Vayalar JunctionWe left home by 4am on Wednesday. A car that was moving in front of us applied brake. As I slowed down the car it was slammed from behind by a lorry. Our car lost control, crossed the median and collided with another lorry that was moving towards Alappuzha, Madhavan Pillai told TOI on Friday.However, the Pillais do not suspect any foul play. It was an accident. We do not suspect anything else in this case, Gopinathas nephew, Anush M N, said.

The market authorities claim that the area is cleaned twice a day.The garbage bins are almost overflowing and even the space outside the shops is littered with leftovers. Rotting vegetables and fruits seems to be scattered on the road. During a visit to the grain market on Tuesday, the TOI team found few of the shopkeepers dumping rotten tomato and potato in the open and on the streets. Due to this, the passersby and customers looking for vegetables and fruits were facing a lot of problems. The market's roadsides were full of dirt, junk material, and garbage.Some of the vendors had pitched their carts on the muddy patches and their vegetables and fruits witnessed had dirt all over. And many people were buying these items, too. To the naked eye, these items seemed injurious to health. The loading and unloading of trucks was in progress on the main road inside the market, which had jammed this passage.Vegetable peels flies into the eyes of the customers and commuters. Even many of the shopkeepers sitting in the ground were found to be uncomfortable because of the stinking environment they had created themselves. Dustbins in the market had not been emptied in days. Most of these were either broken or not in a usable condition. Encroachment around the main gate and the inside main road was rampant. Rows and rows of trucks occupied the middle of the road. The other vehicles didn't have space to even squeeze past.Sector-26 grain market secretary M K Sharma said: ""Every day, we collect garbage in the trollies. This problem recurs after every spell of rain and we had been facing it for the past many years. All problems stem from the disorderly traffic. One of the alternatives is to shift the grain market to Sector 39. Because of the crowd, we are unable to collect waste from each corner. This waste is dumped outside the city. The marked generates waste in bulk indeed.""Bablu, a shopkeeper at the grain market, said: ""This market is cleaned twice a day but most of the shopkeepers chuck their waste on to the road and litter the interior areas as well. Even though they are responsible for the problem, most of the big shopkeepers do not accept their responsibility or behave in a disciplined manner.""The customers at the market attributed many problems to all the dirt, garbage, and unpleasant smell generated from the place. Sector 28 resident Sheetal Chaturvedi said: ""The market doesn't have toilet facilities. The MC officials and the market committee have not taken appropriate steps for the improvement of civic facilities in the area."""
