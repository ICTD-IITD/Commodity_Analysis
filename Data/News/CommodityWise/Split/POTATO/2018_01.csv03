The governor has asked state election commissioner Amarendra Singh to take all possible measures to guarantee peace in the rural polls.During his meeting at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday, Singh told the governor that the state election commission had already intimated the state government about the need for central paramilitary forces.In an earlier meeting, the governor also asked chief secretary Moloy De and home secretary Atri Bhattacharya to ensure that candidates can file nomination papers across districts, with particular reference to South 24 Parganas, Bankura and Birbhum. According to the state election commission (SEC), till Wednesday, Trinamool had filed 3,629 nominations (including gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad) while BJP had filed 2,316 nominations, and other parties together filed 1,651 nominations.Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee will be calling on the governor on Thursday to apprise him of the ground reality. The governor is going on an overdrive without verifying the facts. The opposition has raised a clamour from the second day of filing of nomination in a bid to keep the state election commission under pressure. State BJP leaders are quoting the governor, which is unfair. We will meet the governor tomorrow and also the state election commissioner, Chatterjee said.Clashes between political parties in the run-up to panchayat polls have become a political hot potato in Bengal, with opposition parties knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court while keeping up the pressure on SEC. BJP leader Mukul Roy staged a dharna at the SEC office on Wednesday while party activists demonstrated in front of the office. I told the state election commissioner that we are being denied the right to contest in rural polls, which is a fundamental right. Our party has moved the Supreme Court on this ground, Roy said.In a counter-offensive, Trinamool leaders called on Union home minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Wednesday to complain against the governor going on an overdrive over rural polls when things were under control. A 20-member Trinamool MPs delegation, led by its Lok Sabha party leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Rajya Sabha leader Derek OBrien, met Singh to put on record their unease over the governors interference. They took exception to the governor giving directions to the chief secretary and home secretary without taking the elected state government into confidence.Constitutional experts, however, see nothing wrong in the governor calling senior state officials or meeting the state election commissioner once the rural poll process is on because the Constitution, under Article 243K, vests in him the power to make available to the state election commission such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions of the SEC. However, the state Act specifies that the arrangement has to be done in consultation with the state government."

And thats what Easter is all about for our celebs as well. Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother. My favourite is the Banofee Pie, says Sharmiela.* 250g digestive biscuits, crushed* 100g butter, melted* 4 small bananas* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* Grated chocolate to garnish* Caramel (can be made from scratch or bought from the store)* 2 tablespoon of brown sugar for the cream* Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop. There are a lot of traditional Kerala dishes that are prepared on Easter by my wife, that I love to eat, says Bruce. His favourite- appam and chicken stew.* 1 kg chicken pieces* 20 cardamon pods* 6 inch cinnamon stick* 7 cloves* 2 large onions* 4 inch ginger piece finely chopped* 10 medium size green chillies (or less if you prefer a milder stew)* 1/4 teaspoon pepper* 1 tablespoon coriander powder* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder* 2 large potatoes  diced* 1 cup thick coconut milk* 5 tablespoon oil* Curry leaves* Salt* Heat oil, then add the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds crackle, add cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and mix well.* Add ginger, chopped onions, green chilli and curry leaves. Saute until the onion is soft.* Add pepper, coriander, garam masala and turmeric powders and mix to let the spices roast for a minute.* Add the chicken pieces, sprinkle salt and stir to coat with the masala.* Add 1 and 1/2 cup of water, cover and boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.* Add potato cubes and cook for another 15-20 minutes till the potatoes are cooked.* Add coconut milk and take it off the flame as soon as it starts to boil.* Serve with hot pallappam or iddiappam. (If using fresh coconut, add its thick extract first and then the thinner extract of coconut milk. If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool. Add the cream a little at a times and whisk until you get a smooth, even coloured consistency.* Add the vanilla extract and whisk for a few minutes.* Pour into a container and place in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.* Before serving, grate the last bit of chocolate and sprinkle over.* You can also garnish with mini Easter eggs if you have any."

The stink is unbearable. People walk over vegetable waste strewn along the pathway at the market causing an unpleasant experience for shoppers, said Shankar.The piling up of trash has been a longstanding woe for visitors to the market comprising about 2,750 shops selling flower, fruits and vegetables, generating nearly 200 tonnes of garbage daily. Though an area has been earmarked behind every shop for disposing of waste, traders prefer to leave it on the pathways. Rotten vegetables are dumped on the premises, which attracts cattle in the locality.S Chandran, president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association admitted traders were yet to practise proper disposal of waste but also raised concerns about clearing of garbage. We have asked traders not to spill trash on the pathways. The traders say garbage collection does not happen from the space earmarked for the purpose, he said. The Market Management Committee (MMC), comprising officials from the CMDA and representatives of traders, maintains that garbage clearance is being conducted by a private agency.V R Soundararajan, former member of MMC and president of Koyembedu Potato Wholesale Merchants Association, said the CMDA must allow the corporation to take over the responsibility of maintaining the facility. Of late, garbage is being cleared twice a day at flower, fruit and vegetable markets, said an MMC official, adding that steps are being taken to prevent cattle from entering the market"
5b1c409b9855b74aba67c24b,Delhi HC verdict gives ‘Kejriwal factor’ second wind,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-verdict-gives-kejriwal-factor-second-wind/articleshow/63436488.cms,2018-03-24,"NEW DELHI: The promise of alternative politics got second wind on Friday, when the Aam Aadmi Party got the opportunity to rebuild its crumbling public image dented severely by the disqualification of 20 of its MLAs for holding offices of profit. Party insiders saw the Delhi high court order restoring the legislators membership of the Delhi Assembly as an impetus to the Kejriwal factor that had slowly begun to lose lustre due to the constant wrangling with the Centre, the lieutenant governor and the bureaucrats.With the fear of bypolls receding, AAP will perhaps focus its energies now on next years parliamentary elections, though the high court has not entirely absolved the MLAs. Fridays order only said that the principle of natural justice had not been adhered to when the EC delivered its verdict and asked the poll panel to hear the case afresh. This is where the challenge lies for the party. The matter will continue to be a political hot potato in the capital, with BJP and Congress unlikely to stop badgering AAP about it.The high court decision boosts AAP political strategy, allowing it to reinforce the impression that it has always been the victim of the Union government, as evidenced by the fact that its MLAs were not heard by the EC before disqualifying them. The party will also ensure the 20 MLAs will now bolster their standing among the electorate by focusing on development work in their constituencies, party insiders said. As it is, the state government had taken up development as a priority even before their disqualification, cautious of the fact that AAPs politics had come under scrutiny.Among the 67 MLAS who won their places in the Delhi Assembly but have since fallen out with the party, the only vociferous dissident is former minister and suspended MLA Kapil Mishra. Pertinently, he too did not make direct attacks against the government in the House in the budget session that ended on Thursday. AAP founder-member Kumar Vishwas is another who frequently waves the red flag on party governance, leadership and other issues.Unlike them, the 20 restored MLAs always stood firmly behind Kejriwal's decision to appoint them as parliamentary secretaries and never wavered in their opinion about his leadership even when they lost their assembly membership for a while. Kejriwal had chosen some of his best MLAs to appoint as parliamentary secretaries through an administrative order in March 2015. The measure was described as a step to assist the ministers in performing their duties more efficiently, thus improving administration.The office-of-profit case is, of course, a facet of the constant tussle between the elected government and the LG. The appointments as parliamentary secretaries were made not only without the LG's approval, but despite the fact that there existed no provision in the law for such post holders. The singular point that AAP stressed throughout  that the parliamentary secretaries did not derive any pecuniary benefit from being in that position  hadnt cut much ice. This forced AAP to amend the law to provide the 20 immunity from disqualification. A lot now depends on how the party sees the high courts decision  as a respite or as a strategic weapon against the Centre."

The prospect of being fined by civic authorities has prompted this move.Across Four Bungalows market and Lokhandwala Complex, streetside sellers are using newspapers to wrap perishables and non-perishables. I had to collect onions and potatoes in newspaper before I resolved to bring a cloth bag from home, said Vedant Vaidya who lives in Manish Nagar.Vegetable and fruit sellers on RRT Road and J N Road in Mulund West had stopped giving plastic bags to customers a couple of days ago as they feared that there could be action from BMC vigilance squads. We heard the fine is as high as Rs 25,000 and that is a big deterrent, said Anand Jaiswal, a vegetable vendor. We had stopped giving plastic bags to customers although there was no official notification,"" he stated.Another vegetable vendor, Ramesh Singh, said he had incurred loss of business of over Rs 1,000 per day due to not giving plastic bags. Many officergoers buy vegetables on their way home during evening hours. Many were not carrying cloth bags and we were not issuing anything in plastic, and so they went away."" Vendors are, however, confident that once the rule is implemented across city, all buyers will come with cloth and jute bags.Vendors in Parel said civic authorities have been making three rounds a day to check if they are giving plastic bags to buyers. Meanwhile in Dahisar, vegetable and fruit vendors have been telling customers they would finish their existing stocks of plastic carrybags and thereafter, customers will have to carry their own cloth bags.An egg seller on J N Road said, We have switched to paper bags for giving eggs, and it is a good old feeling. A potato seller said it brought back memories of 20-30 years ago when women would buy everything in one cloth bag and separate the veggies, chillies, coriander, fruits and bread, etc at home instead of having separate packets. There were unconfirmed reports of an eatery being fined Rs 4,000 for using plastic bag on Thursday, and this spread like wildfire among vendors in Mulund.Plastic glasses are also out from sugarcane juice vendors. People who used to demand the juice in plastic glasses are no longer drinking sugarcane juice as they can see that we are serving in glass and then merely washing the glasses with water and serving other people. Many think that is unhygienic and go away, said Ramu Bhoir, a sugarcane juice vendor in Bandra.Vendors at Malad are using newspapers to pack vegetables and fruits. A few regular customers get lucky as vendors pull out plastic bags kept hidden away.A vendor Anto Singh from Malad market said that they have been threatened with a hefty fine if caught with plastic bags. He said that very soon cloth bags would be available in the market for sale."
5b1c4a859855b74aba67c366,"10% drop in farm suicides, 11,000 cases in 2016: Govt",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/10-drop-in-farm-suicides-11000-cases-in-2016-govt/articleshow/63405637.cms,2018-03-22,"NEW DELHI: Farmer suicides declined by nearly 10% in 2016 as compared to a year earlier, though the rate at which farmers took their lives continued to be at least one every hour. Maharashtra continues to be at the top in recording the highest number of farmer suicides in India.Provisional figures for the year 2016, disclosed by agriculture ministry in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, show that the country recorded 11,370 farmers (farm labourers and cultivators) suicides as compared to 12,602 in 2015.The decline may be attributed to better rainfall in 2016 which witnessed record production of kharif (summer sown) crops. In contrast, 2015 was the second consecutive drought year after 2014. A shortfall of 10% or more of rainfall for the entire monsoon season - June to September - is considered a drought year.The figures, however, show that the benefit of record production could not probably lessen the distress of farm labourers as suicides among them increased from 4,595 in 2015 to 5,019 in 2016. The overall decline was seen due to decline in the number of suicides among cultivators - from 8,007 in 2015 to 6,351 in 2016.The other states at the top in terms of having the dubious distinction of recording higher number of farmers suicides include Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. In fact, two states - Maharashtra (3,661) and Karnataka (2,079) - together account for more than 50% of the total farmers suicides in 2016.These are provisional figures, shared by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) with the agriculture ministry. The bureau has, so far, not made the final figures public.Farm activists took the figures for 2016 with a pinch of salt. Decline in number of farmers suicides can mainly be attributed to data manipulation and change in category (from farm related suicides to non-farm suicides). Getting the NCRB to abstain from releasing its report raised strong suspicion, said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture ( ASHA ).Out of 3,661 farmers suicides in Maharashtra, 2,550 were cultivators while remaining 1,111 were farm labourers. Similarly, in Karnataka, 1,212 cultivators and 867 farm labourers took their lives in the state.Flagging figures of West Bengal which reported zero suicide in 2016, Kuruganti told TOI that those who worked on the ground had reported suicides of potato farmers in the state but the ministry figures show it as nil. Where have those numbers gone? she asked.Though the ministry has not specified causes behind suicides in 2016, the minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala, in his written response, said the bankruptcy or indebtedness and farming related issues were reported as major causes of suicides among farmers/cultivators in 2015. Citing the NCRB report of 2015, he noted that family problems followed by illness were reported as major causes of suicides among agricultural labourers.Kuruganti said, Even 11,370 farmers suicides in a single year, as disclosed by the ministry as the NCRBs provisional figure, is quite a big number. It clearly shows that neither the Centre nor the states are serious about dealing with the farm distress."

Experts tracking the price movement of potatoes say the possibility of a slide in the rates seems thin. Instead, it is likely to stay high for at least the next five months because Bengal has optimal yield this year and it didnt turn out to be a bumper crop that often pulls down the price.Asurvey of the city markets  Gariahat market, Lake market and Maniktala market  on Wednesday shows the tuber prices vary between Rs 14 and Rs 16 a kg, depending on the variety, S1, Jyoti and Chandramukhi.But farmers have made a killing this time, the best in the last eight years, with farm prices at Tarakeswar going Rs 8-9 a kg on Monday, at least 2.5 times more than the Rs 3.30-Rs 3.60 a kg rate last year. Accordingly, the wholesale prices stood at Rs 500 for a packet for 50 kg, which comes down to Rs 10 a kg.The surge in potato prices has an economics and perhaps a dose of politics behind it. The untimely rain after the onset of winter took its toll on production, bringing the yield down to 100 lakh ton, 15 lakh ton less than 115 lakh ton last year. Moreover, 90% of the states aggregate storage capacity was full by Monday. Traders collected potato packets from farms early.According to the agriculture department, the state consumes 5 lakh ton potato a month, the annual consumption being 60 lakh ton. Of the 100 lakh ton yield, about 63 lakh ton have already reached the 453 cold storages in the state, leaving about 20 lakh ton in farms. A chunk of these potatoes may go outside Bengal to UP and Punjab The other part is political. With the panchayat polls being round the corner, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is keen to see farmers get a good price. She is keeping a tab on the potato prices and farm prices. But a cold storage owner doesnt see the surge in potato prices as a reflection of demand and supply. Farm price for potato  Rs 500 for a 50kg packet  is arbitrary. It was fixed without going into the economics. The Trinamoolrun panchayats spread the rates ahead of the polls. The farm price and consequent wholesale and retail prices need correction. The government committee doesnt seem interested, a cold storage owner said.Refuting the charge, Pradip Majumdar , agriculture adviser to CM, cited at least three factors behind the surge: The production is optimal this year. There is a slump in supply from Punjab and UP that added to the overproduction problem last year. Traders took the initiative to buy potatoes they couldnt in 2017 after demonetisation."

With vegetable and fruit waste dumped on roads round the clock coupled with poor enforcement in levying penalties for offences, residents question the implementation of the solid waste management (SWM) and civic bodys ability to recycle waste.Apart from causing frequent traffic snarls, the seven-acre large Gandhi Market has always been a vulnerable zone for sanitary officials to ensure cleanliness. With 250 to 300 shops including exclusive ones for onion, potato and fruits, civic body sources said that Gandhi Market on average churns out 40 tonne of waste per day. The quantum might increase by 10-15% during festival days.Though eight vehicles are involved in removing the vegetable waste mounted along the streets of Gandhi Market, to nearby micro compost yards, irresponsible dumping of waste is a regular scene in the locality. Gandhi market is an eyesore to the city. Until the politics in relocating the market to the city outskirts is resolved, the district administration and civic body should at least ensure cleanliness in the locality, said H Ghouse Baig, secretary of consumer protection council, Ponmalai branch.Dharbarmedu and Thaneerpandhal on Thanjavur Main Road passing through the Gandhi market are the epitome of this problem. In Dharbarmedu, fruit stalls often dump their unsold and decayed fruits, while the civic body instead of streamlining the traders, collect and dispose the waste. Garbage dumped on roads often invites stray cattle. Though Trichy Corporation can levy penalty between Rs 250-500 for irresponsible waste dumping, imposing penalty is a rarity as traders seldom oblige to instructions.A section of traders in Gandhi Market are not cooperating with us to keep the ambience clean. At least 200kg of fruit and vegetable waste are dumped on the road, a corporation official told TOI. Though the civic body purchased a pulveriser machine for disposing banana bunches safely, they were found dumped on roads. Corporation officials assured that alternative measures would be chalked out to ensure hygiene in Gandhi Market."

With just a month to go for the test, many of them have enrolled with private coaching centres for crash courses, which have got underway in the city this week.While coaching classes for both JEE and NEET are in demand, the latter seems to be the most sought-after. Sources with Winners Academy, Chennai, said several students from Rajapalayam, Coimbatore, Erode and Puducherry have joined them for NEET coaching classes.We are surprised to see students from different states and countries enrolling with us. Students from Pune, Calcutta, Dubai and Malaysia have approached us for the course, said Sanjay Gaglani , who runs the academy. The centre had about 50 students last year. With 140 students this year, they have three batches now, instead of one last year. Slots are full for the next two years, Gaglani said.Representatives of private NEET coaching centres in the city said there has been a 20% increase in the number of students enrolling for the crash course, compared to the last year. They attributed it to the increasing awareness about the exam.Last year, there was a confusion whether the exam would be held or not. But this year, they know that the exam is mandatory, said Gowtham Mohankumar, administrative officer of the city branch of Dearc Academy.Since there is no cap on the number of attempts, students failed in their last attempt have also joined the coaching this year to prepare better for the exam, said R Sivakumar from TIME coaching centre in the city.When MBBS admissions were made based on Class XII marks, students had no option but select courses based on their marks. Now that the admissions are made based on NEET marks, students who attempt the exam for the second time too prefer crash courses, he added.However, there arent many takers for the crash courses among the students from rural areas. They still face the exam with some fear, Sivakumar said.Though some coaching centres offer courses in Tamil, the demand for the same is low as the state conducts free courses in Tamil for government and aided school students. The demand for NEET courses in Tamil is low. We have just five students, said I Mohan, manager of Wisdom Institute.P Kanagaraj, head of political science department, Government Arts, attributed the increase in the number of students enrolling for crash courses to the shock factor of suddenly having to face a national-level exam. Kanagaraj, who has been conducting NEET awareness programmes for government school children in the district, exuded confidence that a large number of TN students would easily clear the test in the future. It is best if they start coaching for the test from Class VIII, he added.(With inputs from Vinayashree J"

Rainwater entered shops and houses in Shimla. Meanwhile, heavy snowfall at Rohtang pass kept the Manali-Keylong highway closed for the second consecutive day. People in Manali, Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and upper Chamba are feeling the cold of winter months and were seen wearing heavy woollens.At -0.3C, Keylong, district headquarters of Lahaul-Spiti district, was the coldest inhabited place in Himachal, followed by Kalpa (2.4), Manali (5.4) and Shimla (9.8).

Higher regions of Kinnaur district also received fresh snow.Meanwhile, a rolling stone hit a car in Manikaran while the rain triggered a landslide near Jagatsukh village, bringing traffic to a standstill on the Kullu-Manali bypass. The landslide has also posed danger to a bridge on the highway as it has weakened its foundation. The debris was coming on national highway at many places between Kullu and Manali, following the rain. Given the possibility of thunderstorm and heavy rain in the next few days, Kullu administration has sounded an alert. Deputy commissioner Yunus has directed schools to stay in touch with the parents of students and ensure their safety during thunderstorm and rain. People, especially tourists, should avoid going close to rivers and water streams as water level may rise any time, he maintained.Rohtang remains closed for civilian movement every Tuesday and so tourists were not allowed to go beyond Gulaba. Two persons, identified as Sumit Sharma and Dinesh, both residents of Mandi district who work in a hotel in Manali, got stuck on a hill above Prini village near Manali on Monday night and were rescued at 1.30am. Despite inclement weather, both persons started hiking along Prini nullah and got stranded at a place.Farmers in Lahaul are sowing peas, potato and other vegetables these days and snowfall has brought worries to them. The forecast of hailstorm has also made apple growers of the state anxious.Meanwhile, Shimla received 58mm rain, Kalpa in Kinnaur 27mm rain while Kukumseri and Bharmaur received 24mm rain on Tuesday.

He said in the trials, the bags were also found to be durable.He added that five companies were manufacturing such bags in India at present, the raw material for which was being imported, as these bags were being made of corn starch, potato starch, and cane starch. The official also informed that an estimated 130 tonnes of plastic carry bags were being used in Ludhiana daily, and 225 tonnes in the entire state. On the revelation by PPCB officials that there was a 10-12% consumption of compostable bags in Punjab, MP Bittu called it an appreciable change, and lauded the role of the Punjab government and PPCB.Addressing the media, Bittu said: With the intensive awareness drive being carried out by PPCB throughout the state, the day will come soon when plastic bags will completely disappear. The supply and use of compostable bags cannot be controlled, as there is a huge demand. He advised plastic carrybag manufacturers to shift to making compostable carry bags by using starch derived from maize and potatoes. The MP added that the same machines that manufacture plastic carry bags could be used to manufacture the compostable variety, with some minor changes.MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh told mediapersons that MC was regularly issuing challans against the use of polythene carry bags. Later, mayor Balkar Sandhu also joined the meeting and assured full support in creating an awareness drive among people about compostable carry bags."

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

The daily retail prices available in the consumer affairs ministrys price monitoring cell show there was an increase of Rs 10 and Rs 7 per kg of potato in Delhi and Mumbai on Friday as compared to the prices a year back.The consumer affairs ministrys data also show major increase in the prices of the staple food items across Uttar Pradesh and the maximum in Agra (by Rs 13 a kg) despite the state being the largest producer of crop. UP also has the maximum installed cold storage capacity to keep potatoes.The retail average prices in some of the cities in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have also increased by Rs 10 a kg in comparison to the prices of last year.Officials said the issue of increasing potato prices came up for discussion at the weekly meeting of an inter ministerial committee on Friday. NHB officials briefed the panel that there is enough potatoes in stock to meet demand despite a minor dip in harvest during last season.There can be no reason except nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen for the increasing prices. We have been producing 46-47 million tonnes of potatoes while our average consumption is around 40 million tonnes. We have cold storage capacity of 35 million tonnes, which is enough to meet our demand, said an official, who did not wish to be named.Sources said that since movement of agriculture produce is free between India and Bangladesh substantial quantity of potatoes has gone out of the country as domestic production in the neighbouring country was less during last season. Similar, potato production in Nepal also got impacted last season and there are indications of potatoes from India going to Nepal.Officials said prices will moderate in near future as supplies increase."

5b1f4a119855b74cfa8ca02d,"Hiking crop MSP impractical, say UP farmers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/hiking-crop-msp-impractical-say-up-farmers/articleshow/62752911.cms,2018-02-02,"MEERUT/BAREILLY: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday announced that the minimum support price (MSP) for notified kharif crops would be 1.5 times the cost incurred by farmers for its production. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh , however, said increasing the MSP was impractical as there was no way to calculate the exact cost of the crop. Industry associations, too, were unhappy with various provisions.National convenor of Azad Kisan Union , Rajendra Singh, said, Government says it will give one-and-a-half times the cost incurred by the farmer on his crop. But there is no way that cost can be calculated. Will it include yearly wages? Will the rent of land be included for landless farmers? If not, then this promise will be an empty one.""National spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait said, Raising MSP isnt the solution. The government needs to look into farmers basic problems. A national committee on agriculture to look into these problems is yet to see the light of day.VM Singh, national convenor of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, said, We have several doubts over the governments intention. First, raising MSP of crops was a poll promise of the BJP in the 2014 LS polls. It has come four years late? Second, there is no mention of marginal farmers who grow vegetables and suffer the most. UPs recent potato crisis is a case in example. Yashpal Malik , a farmer-leader in west UP, said it was more important to ensure that benefits reach farmers rather than raising the MSP. MSPs were increased by previous governments too. But red-tapism didnt allow farmers to sell their crops at those rates. Those leakages need to be plugged first, he said.Chairman of Meerut chapter of Indian Industries Association, Atul Gupta, said, There is no mention of simplification of GST provisions which have crippled the industry. Though the FM has announced a package of Rs 3,794 crore for credit support in the MSME sector, there is no talk on the much-needed simplification of archaic laws and tedious procedures. Is that the ease of doing business?"
