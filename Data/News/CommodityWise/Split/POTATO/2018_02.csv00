Kumar took the action after learning about the incident where a 4-year-old boy died after swallowing a toy that came along with a packet of potato chips in Andhra Pradeshs Eluru town. In October, another 4-year-old had choked to death in Kandivali area of Mumbai.Subsequently, the Prime Ministers Office directed the representation-cum-public grievance to the Hazardous Substances Management Division which is under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), for pursuing the matter.The division has written to the joint secretaries of ministry of health and family welfare and department of commerce (under the ministry of commerce and industry) as well as to the director of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for initiating action as appropriate. The January 4 letter, a copy of which is with HT, is signed by Amardeep Raju, a scientist at the division.Kumar, who is based in Dudhli village on Dehraduns outskirts, said several companies selling childrens food items were providing plastic, rubber or spring toys to allure them. Children are unable to differentiate between edible things and toys, leading to such tragedies. I hope after the PMOs intervention, action is taken by the authorities to prevent such incidents from recurring, Kumar, who has raised other important issues in the past as well, said.Sharda Tripathi, a member of Uttarakhand state commission for protection of child rights, recommended an immediate ban on such items. Children get attracted to such toys after watching TV ads. Precious lives are being put at risk by such toys every day. Action should be taken immediately on this front."

They yielded prodution of ginger, spinach (palak), bottle gourd (lauki), ridged gourd (torai), green potato (parwal), bitter gourd (karela), lady fingers (bhindi), papaya etc.Momi Dey, who spearheaded the initiative and formed the group of 12 women told TOI, We have been successful in growing different varieties of vegetables and fruit in four layer of organic farming. She further added that, We have produced crop of ginger in first layer, green potato, bottle guard, ridged gourd, and bitter gourd in second layer, papaya in third layer and spinach on ground level. The crop of bottle gourd, ridged gourd and green potato was produced through machan (platform) cultivation.Dey further said, We have used only vermi-compost to maintain the taste of vegetable and fruits. Multi-layer farming is the best way for utilisation of field to grow many crops in a limited space.Vandana Gautam, another volunteer said, More and more women have come forward to learn the basics about multi-layer farming in Kaushambi and Allahabad villages. She further added that this was the first time when local women in the district had used the multi-layer organic farming technique.The women focussed on the quality of the crops and vegetables and for that, seeds were sown on different heights in the same field. Dey, meanwhile, said under multi-layer farming different crops of varying heights and rooting pattern are cultivated together. She has also been imparting training to other farmers of the block briefing them about advantages of the techniques.Dey had learnt about multi-layer crop production while training agricultural-expert Akash Chaurasia in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh. Chaurasia is one of the experts who is credited with introducing multi-layer farming in the country.City based Agro experts, however, said, The objective of multi-layer farming is to utilise the vertical, horizontal and underground space more effectively. In this method, the tallest components have foliage of strong light and high evaporative demand. The shorter components with foliage require lesser shade and or relatively high humidity.Currently, majority of farmers opt for multi-layer farming using only cow urine and dung as manure. More importantly, The income of farmers have increased substantially. Besides, the multi-layer technique also ensured a steady supply of farm products throughout the year.Multi-layer farming helps maximise the use of land and all growing space is used as crops are planted together vertically, horizontally and underground, said an agricultural official adding, that it also enriches the fertility of the soil and adds organic nutrients to soil."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do? Our stock comes from outside, so the Modi government has to listen to the farmers demands.Khan confirmed the high prices of tomatoes and said that rates had almost doubled on June 2 due to the perishable nature of the produce.(With inputs fromUrvashi Sharma)What will the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee do?

Adityanath, despite the jinx, went to Noida recently for the inauguration.Read: What Noida jinx, Modi asks as he praises Yogi AdityanathAkhilesh also asked Adityanath to call a cabinet meet on Monday and re-introduce Samajwadi Party Pension Yojana so that women could buy sweaters for their school-going children to whom the government could not provide school uniform sweaters.What can one expect from the government that failed to provide even sweaters to children? The BJP is the biggest party in the country with crores of members. Had each member of the party either weaved or provided a sweater each, then none of the children would have been without sweaters, he said.The BJP and the SP had engaged in a war of words over the state governments delay in distributing pullovers to 1.54 crore students of state-run primary and upper primary schools (up to class 8).

But the government is not looking at its own negligence that forced the farmers to do what they did.Referring at Adityanaths Himanchal Pradesh polls rallies, he said: He had announced there that government made arrangements for better prices to potato farmers. What happened to that?On the issue of saffron paint on UP Haj Committee offices boundary wall in Lucknow, the SP leader took a dig at the BJP, saying they turned jittery and overnight restored the original cream colour.The government should concentrate on changing the heart of people by doing development and welfare works than changing the colours of buildings, he said.When asked to respond on SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavs comment that he will contest Lok Sabha polls from his original Mainpuri seat, Akhilesh said: He will contest the polls from whichever seat he wishes to. Entire party and I will rally behind him and for him to win.Mulayam had contested Mainpuri and Azamgarh seats in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He won both, but vacated Mainpuri to let his grand-nephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav contest and win it.I know from where Tej Pratap will contest in that case, he said."

(File)The summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations was ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. (Reuters)The lunch menu for the historic summit involving President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the opulent Capella resort in Singapore suggests both sides got what they wanted from Tuesday's sit-down: concessions, in the form of dishes designed to appeal to both a meat-loving American and a North Korean with more international tastes.The menu should have come with pencils for circling choices. Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""

It is worth noting that this action will have a disproportionately high impact on the growers of Red Delicious - which has composed nearly 90 per cent of Washington's apple exports to India this season,""""India is the number one market for Washington's Red Delicious apples this season. With so much at stake, we urge the administration to make it a priority to prevent this additional 30 per cent tariff from going into effect,"" the lawmakers said, urging the USTR to take up the matter with India.Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu is in the town for meetings with Lighthizer and other officials of the US government, lawmakers and members of the industry.The letter dated June 11 was among others signed by lawmakers Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Dave Reichert, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, Suzan DelBene, Senator Maria Cantwell and a bipartisan group of Members of Congress from Washington State.On June 5, in response to the administration's decision to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on several key allies, including Mexico, Mexico announced it will impose tariffs on a range of US agricultural products, including potatoes and apples.Last year, Washington State potato growers exported over USD 37 million in frozen potatoes to Mexico.And as the top export destination for apples, valued at approximately USD 215 million last season, Mexico is currently the second largest market for Washington's Red Delicious apples.In fact, this season, Washington's apple growers have shipped over 10 million cartons of apples to Mexico, making up 27 per cent of apple exports.""As our trading partners take steps to restrict their markets to American exports, we urge the Administration to address these retaliatory actions that are harming our communities, constituencies, and local economies,"" the lawmakers wrote.""The impact of these retaliatory actions on Washington's thriving agricultural industry would not only significantly affect the agricultural industry, but also workers, families, and small businesses throughout the state,"" they said.The lawmakers urged the administration to make it a priority to negotiate a solution that shields ""our speciality crop growers from retaliatory actions"" in the form of tariffs or other barriers to trade.Among other signatories are Senator Patty Murray, Congressmen Rick Larsen, Jamie Herrera Beutler, Dan Newhouse, Derek Kilmer, Adam Smith , and Denny Heck."

The former Indian Youth Congress president added, I humbly request Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar to fulfill Rahul Gandhis promise during the elections.Later, Warring told TOI, My only contention is that instead of Congress leaders who fought the assembly election on a party ticket, successfully or unsuccessfully, workers at the ground level, who worked for strengthening the party, should be considered instead. I am not against anyone. The way Rahulji had done in making me the Youth Congress president, picking a district president or a local Dalit leader for headship of a PSU would send the right message and enthuse the cadres. It is my humble submission to the two leaders.In May, Warring had said that even if he was offered the post of legislative secretary or headship of a PSU, he would rather work with people in his constituency. This had followed Warring losing out in getting a cabinet berth in the cabinet expansion.With reports of resentment among the aspirants who were hoping to get the coveted posts soon after the Congress government was sworn in last year, the focus has shifted to accommodating the senior leaders, instead of those who were in the race for a party ticket in the run up to the assembly elections.To ensure that there were no dissidents in the party who may have gone on to contest as independents and eaten into the Congress vote share, the party leadership had repeatedly said that those who work for the party nominee and contribute to his victory will be accommodated as head of the boards and corporations. But now the party seems to be facing a problem of plenty with 78 MLAs in a house of 117, said a Congress leader.During the previous government, while 45 boards and corporations were headed by political appointees, the rest 12 had bureaucrats as chairpersons. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal headed the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (Puda), Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB), the Punjab Rural Development Board, and the Punjab State Planning Board.

Express CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. ExpressJaspal Singh (40), a farmer sitting at the local grain market along with his maize crop, sees no hope for getting a good price for his spring maize crop. The price being offered is Rs 800 to Rs 850 per quintal, the same as the last two seasons; and 40 per cent below the rate fixed for crop by the Commissioner of Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).Jaspal grows maize on 45 acres, including around 24 acres on lease in Salempur village of Jalandhar. Harvesting of the spring maize crop has already started in Doaba region, the main belt for crop that is grown after potato harvesting in February-March.CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. Also, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during his Budget 2018 speech had said that under the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, the MSP for the crops would be fixed and farmers will be given 50 per cent more return over their production cost.We are waiting for the price under Swaminathan Commission report, said Jaspal, adding that at least Rs 1,200 to 1300 per quintal minimum price was needed to make the crop viable.Now the new crop is already in the market and the rate is still very low. Government must act as per its promise, he urged.Ajit Singh, a farmer from Kishangarh village, said: We need fair price to survive. Spring maize is gives 36-39 quintal yield per acre due to its hybrid seed and a farmer can earn around Rs 55,000 if sold at the rate of Rs 1,425 per quintal which is recommended by the central government. This year around 38,000 hectares was dedicated to spring maize in Punjab which is sown between February 15 to March 15 after potato harvesting. This maize is mostly grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, and some parts of Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Ludhiana districts.Director, Agriculture Punjab, Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, said that department mostly recommends the rainy season maize, but several farmers in Punjab go for spring season maize because it is is quite remunerative due to high yield.

Moving across the ocean, with little prospect of ever coming back, is daunting. One of the characters is reluctant. But one young man insists: at home, there is nothing. Even if they survive, he says, all they can look forward to is potatoes. More and more potatoes.This little scene got stuck in my head. I couldnt understand why somebody would object to a steady diet of potatoes. Could one ever have too many potatoes? I didnt understand because I had never had to live on a potato diet. No bread. No corn. No rice. It was only recently that I finally understood, once I started reading about the great Irish famine of 1845. It was also called the great potato famine, because the big disaster was a failure of the potato crop.A potato blight meant that suddenly, the vast majority of people had nothing to eat at all. An interactive map released by the Queens University, Belfast, shows that along the west coast, nearly half the population was wiped out.How could this happen? The answer lies in a complex mix of bigotry, oppressive feudalism, and imperialist policies. By the eighteenth century, Englands rulers were largely Protestant. England also controlled Ireland and Scotland in direct and indirect ways. Certainly, the Irish and Scots had their own distinct language and culture. Ireland also had a significant Catholic population that faced discriminatory laws. Catholics could not own property or join the army or hold public office.Many of these laws were repealed before the famine. But land ownership was deeply skewed against the tiller who was being squeezed tighter and tighter. They worked for very meagre wages in exchange for being allowed a tiny plot of land on which they could grow the food that would feed their own families. The only thing that would grow abundantly on small plots was potatoes.The big lords often lived far away, in cities. They neither knew nor cared about the difficulties of their tenants. They appointed middlemen to deliver their share of money. These middlemen further divided and sub-let the land in a way to extract maximum rent.Already, vast tracts of land had been cleared to make way for cattle, to feed the diary and meat needs of England. But the poor did not own this cattle.And once they had been made paupers, their landlords evicted them and flattened their little huts.Worse, there were laws that kept the prices of food artificially high. Cheap grain imports were not allowed, but traders kept exporting grain and livestock. Through the worst of the famine, as millions perished, hundreds of thousands of gallons of butter left Ireland. This is how we ride up to famine: because theres money to be made that way.This story is familiar to Indians who know about the Great Bengal Famine of 1943. Millions died.With reference to Bengal in 1943, we speak of imperialism and racism at work. But the truth is, any shade of difference is enough  a different language or accent, a different religion or sect  once you set out to create inequality, to institutionalise it, and to profit from the devastation of others.The author is a writer of essays, stories, poems and scripts for stage and screenWar and famineThe ongoing famine in Yemen is threatening over 17 million people, including a huge number of women and children."

Growers of vegetables, cereals, pulses, and maize are worried over losing their crop due to incessant rains. The condition of coffee planters is no better as they are anxious about coffee plants attracting disease, besides dropping of flowers in the heavy showers.Around 10 to 15 potato growers had called up our office to inform us that the seed potatoes have become rotten, said A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department. In the last one month, farmers have sown potato seeds in little over 12,000 ha in the district. In fields, where sowing operation was done in the early days of May, the germination was over before the heavy rains started. Farmers who sowed early need not worry, but those who opted for delayed sowing are worried. Seeds do not germinate when the moisture is high, the official said. The department has sent officials to the field to assess the situation. We need a couple of more days to get the exact picture on the ground, he added.This has been the problem with all other crops as well. Since June 1, Hassan district received 143.8 mm of rainfall, whereas the normal expected in this period is only 40.2 mm. The departure from the normal is around 258%. On Sunday alone, the district received as high as 38.8 mm of rainfall, while the normal rainfall, as per the past records on the day was only 3.6 mm.Parts of Sakleshpur and Alur taluks received heavy rainfall, forcing the district administration to declare holidays for schools and colleges in both the taluks. Similar was the situation in Koppa, N.R.Pura, Mudigere and Sringeri taluks of Chikkamagaluru. In both the districts, coffee growers have been reaching out for assurances. I have been receiving calls from coffee planters about the impact of rains on the plantations, said B.S .Jairam, president of Karnataka Growers Federation. This is the time when coffee plants attract soft rot ( kole roga ) and pepper flowers drop due to heavy rains. If rains stop for a day, we can spray medicines to protect the crop, but rains have not stopped for the last one week, said Mr. Jairam."

(REUTERS/Natalka Levina) The highest levels found were about 500 Becquerel per litre  five times over the limit for adults and more than 12 times that for children. (REUTERS/Natalka Levina)Milk in parts of Ukraine has radioactivity levels up to five times over the countrys official safe limit  a consequence of the catastrophic Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant explosion that took place over 30 years ago, scientists say.Scientists from the University of Exeter in the UK and the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology sampled cows milk from private farms and homes in the Rivne region, about 200 kilometres from the site of the Chernobyl explosion in 1986.They found levels of radioactive caesium in milk above Ukraines safe limit for adults of 100 Becquerel per litre at six of 14 settlements studied, and above the childrens limit of 40 Becquerel per litre at eight sites. The highest levels found were about 500 Becquerel per litre  five times over the limit for adults and more than 12 times that for children.More than 30 years after the Chernobyl disaster, people are still routinely exposed to radioactive caesium when consuming locally produced staple foods, including milk, in Chernobyl-affected areas of Ukraine, said Iryna Labunska, at the University of Exeter in the UK.Many people in the area we studied keep cows for milk, and children are the main consumers of that milk, said Labunska.Though the level of soil contamination in the studied areas is not extremely high, radioactive caesium continues to accumulate in milk and other foods, such that the residents of these villages are chronically exposed to radioactivity that presents health risks to almost every system in the body  especially among children, she said.Some simple protective measures could be taken to bring radiation exposure levels below limits at a cost of less than 10 euros per person per year for the 8,300 people living in the six villages with the highest contamination.Such measures include applying a caesium binder, called Ferrocyn, to cows, mineral fertilisation of potato fields and feeding pigs with uncontaminated fodder.The cost of this would decrease each year as radiation levels fall  but if no action is taken, the experts warn that milk contamination will continue to exceed the 100 Becquerel per litre adult limit in parts of Ukraine until at least 2040.This situation should also act as a warning and a reminder of just how long the legacy of nuclear accidents can be, said Labunska.Without adequate countermeasures, what may now seem a purely historical event will remain a daily reality for those communities most impacted, she said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Police sources said state police chief S.P. Vaid personally directed Kathua police to lodge the FIR.BJP spokesman Brig. (retd) Anil Gupta said such language was ""completely unacceptable"" to the party.Lal Singh had to resign as forest minister after he took part in a rally in March. The rally had been organised to oppose the arrest of those accused of raping and murdering an eight-year-old girl from a minority community.The MLA has since been leading a campaign for a CBI probe, saying the state police's crime branch, which is investigating the case, couldn't be trusted.PDP sources said the MLA was turning out to be a political hot potato for the Mehbooba government as he has been trying to cash in on the polarisation over the rape and murder."

Calloused. Caked with earth and awash with blood. The skin torn in one place, flesh exposed - raw and red, screaming. It was one among 50,000, probably many more, pairs that covered 180 kilometres from Nashik to Mumbai for rights - the rights of the farmers of Maharashtra.The march that culminated a fortnight ago ended with the BJP-led government in Maharashtra acceding to the key demands of farmers. The man behind this massive long march, however, remains steadfast in his refusal to take any credit for it. ""I was just present in solidarity with them. Leaders such as Ashok Dhawale, J.P. Gavit, Kishan Gujar and Ajit Nawale made this happen,"" says 44-year-old Vijoo Krishnan, joint secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the largest Left-affiliated farmers' organisation with 1.6 crore members across India.It has been difficult to catch Vijoo who is based in Delhi but has been on the move continuously. ""The biggest thing is, it was the march of the farmers for their survival,"" he says, as he leans back in the white plastic chair in his office in central Delhi. His words are forceful, without being aggressive. The pleasant smile never quite leaves his face.You would not be blamed for thinking this mass protest was really easy to pull off, except that it was not. This long march didn't become historic overnight. It was the result of a concerted effort of the AIKS for many months to organise farmers against the neo-liberal economic policies of the state and the Centre. ""Our leaders have been preparing people to walk in this heat for months. Collecting grain, firewood and essentials for making this a success,"" says Vijoo, who is also a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).He tells us how one of the comrades put out on social media a 40-second video of the rally, which caught the imagination of urban Indians. ""Many social media enthusiasts, even those not belonging to our party, shared the video. Some even asked us for images which they shared on Twitter and Facebook - this forced mainstream media to cover it.""Vijoo's engagement with farmers' woes is no one-off. For the last one decade, he has been proactive in raising agrarian issues related to minimum support price for crops, waiver of loans, land rights and land acquisition. And since the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, he has been more busy than usual.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to bring 'acchhe din' or good times for farmers during the 2014 general elections campaign has fallen flat. He had promised cheaper loans, pension and insurance for farmers, fair and remunerative prices for crops as stated by the National Commission on Farmers but nothing happened. Instead, there has been a drastic cut in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Yojna, public investment in agriculture has been reduced, and cattle farmers have been lynched in the name of cow protection,"" he says.Speaking of lynching, didn't the AIKS recently organise a two-day meeting under the umbrella of Bhumi Adhikar Andolan, a conglomerate of 300 grassroots organisations, to address the issue? He nods. ""Attacks by cow vigilantes are not just attacks on minorities and Dalits but also attacks on agriculture and the economy of the farmers.""Has the AIKS been able to garner support of the farmers of Bengal who moved away from the Left parties following the Singur and Nandigram land acquisition controversies? ""Attacks on cadres by the Trinamool Congress workers have led to a considerable fall in our membership,"" says Vijoo.The AIKS apparently had one crore members across Bengal until 2011 but the numbers dropped to 60 lakh in 2013. ""It has gone up to 80 lakh now,"" he points out. According to him, the farmers of Bengal are in distress under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee. His Bengal-based colleague, Amal Haldar, also told The Telegraph that reeling under huge debt since 2011, 208 potato and paddy farmers across the state have committed suicide.Vijoo continues, ""Plus, the minimum support price announced by the central government is Rs 1,550 per quintal for paddy. In Bengal, the farmers get around Rs 800-1,200 per quintal because there is no government procurement. The traders procure it, so they eat up the money.""In one corner of Vijoo's spartan office room is a red martyr's column - meant to commemorate comrades who have died. It is a mobile structure and scribbled on it is the red salute - "" Amar Shaheedon ko Lal Salam"". It brings to mind the recent bloodbath between the Left and RSS workers in Kerala. According to one estimate, 85 CPI(M) workers and 65 RSS workers have been killed between 2007 and 2017. ""RSS has opened shakhas even in Kannur, where the Left has the strongest base. But they have not been able to gain prominence,"" says Vijoo, who originally belongs to Karivellur village in Kerala's Kannur district.He talks about the RSS' violence in Tripura, how its workers have been torching CPI(M) offices there. ""They started by demolishing Lenin's statue, then they demolished statues of B.R. Ambedkar and the Dravidian icon Periyar - their intolerance makes them want all those ideologies opposing theirs to perish.""But he doesn't believe the Left is going to perish anytime soon? The success of the recent farmers' rally in Maharashtra - wherein the state government agreed to waive their loans, stop forceful acquisition of farm lands and compensate farmers hit by natural calamity - is proof for Vijoo that it isn't. ""These struggles ensure that an atmosphere is created for the defeat of communal forces. We may have had electoral reverses but nobody can write off the Left just yet.""But given the recent electoral performance of the Left, it doesn't look like it can defeat ""communal forces"" by itself. Then again, the top CPI(M) leadership has refused to establish an alliance with BJP's biggest opposition, Congress. Since the Left withdrew support for the Congress-led UPA-I government in 2008 over the Indo-US nuclear deal, the two haven't seen eye to eye. ""We have to channelise all energies to defeat the BJP in all seats, whether we are directly in the contest or not. We need not have an alliance or understanding with the Congress,"" he says. Then adds, ""Yet our position against the BJP as the main enemy may indirectly benefit the Congress.""Vijoo stresses that the Congress should be clear about its strategy, especially on the recent violence by the Sangh and affiliated forces. A fact-finding report - titled ""Divide and Rule in the Name of Cow"", brought out by Bhumi Adhikar Andolan this month - criticises the Congress for not taking a stand on lynching.What does he make of Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his temple run? Does he think Congress is adopting a soft-Hindutva approach? ""That also is there,"" Vijoo says. ""This is a hypocritical position - they have to give it up.""And the Left's own niggling issues - how does he see the Prakash Karat vs Sitaram Yechury fight resolve itself? ""It is media hype,"" he says. ""Ours is a democratic party. For us, there could be different opinions but we go by what the party congress decides.""At this point, a buzzing wasp enters the scene making Vijoo nostalgic. He recalls how a wasp stung him during his JNU days. Those days he was campaigning for the Delhi University Students' Union elections. ""I couldn't recognise myself in the mirror for many days,"" laughs the former JNU students' union president, thus taking the sting out of an otherwise intense discussion.We get chatting about his student days, JNU then, JNU now. The conversation turns to the current crop of student leaders from the institution - Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Shehla Rashid. Vijoo says that individual leaders get a lot of attention these days. ""In our times, it was always the organisation that got precedence."" Could it be that this seminal philosophy defines his characteristic reticence, the reluctance he expressed earlier on at being credited with the success of the farmers' rally? Perhaps.We are still on JNU. And he says after a minute's thought, ""There should be better linkages between the similar ideologies that have cropped up."" If you ask him, even beyond the campus, the band of young leaders - Jignesh Mevani, Chandrashekhar Azad and Akhil Gogoi - should come together. He says, ""They should be part of the issue-based unity against the communal BJP. They should organise into a new, unified force.""As I get up to leave, I spot a poster with the visual of a blood-soaked trident and the nib of a fountain pen. The message scrawled on it reads: ""Choose which side you are on"". That's for us, not him. His choices couldn't be clearer."

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

We had sought to effect a paradigm shift, Jaitley said.Our emphasis is on generating higher income for farmers. We consider agriculture as an enterprise, and want to help the farmers produce more from the same land parcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realise higher prices for their produce, he said.To this end, one initiative will be a food processing thrust called Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to promote tomato, onion and potato cultivation and availability around the year.Operation Green shall promote farmer-producer organisations, agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional managements.I propose to allocate Rs 500 crore for this purpose, Jaitley said, pointing out that seasonal and regional production of these commodities make it difficult to connect farmers and consumers.Among other measures: Rs 10,000 crore corpus for animal husbandry infrastructure fund, and an aquaculture infrastructure fund. Kisan credit cards to be extended to animal husbandry and fisheries sector. National bamboo mission to be restructured, with outlay of Rs 1290 crore.

Men and women carrying huge shopping bags haggle with the vendors for their dose of this season's sweetness. Indeed, in the grand Eid spread of sheermal paratha, galauti kababs, biryani, mutton chaanp, sewai is the lone sweet note.The scene at Zakaria Street is no different from Mullickbazar that evening. There is still a week to go before Eid. Shop owner Mohamad Eiyaz is taking an iftar break. His son, Shahnawaz, a college student, is filling in for his father. The shop that sells stationery all year also sells sewai during this time.Shahnawaz tells us that they source it from a factory in Metiabruz on the outskirts of the city. And not just them, the paanwala, the man frying samosas, another manning a bag shop, all jump onto the sewai bandwagon at this time.Qudimi Karkhana Sewai is different in that it sells sewai throughout the year. ""What do you want - bhuna, mota, Banarasi, lachcha,"" asks Syed Feroze, who works at the 200-year-old shop, in between measuring a heap of lachcha for a customer. The lachcha is very fine of texture, looks like a heap of hay. It is basically made of rice or refined flour or semolina kneaded with ghee.""The mota sewai comes from Lucknow, the Banarasi one from Benaras and the lachcha is made right here in the city,"" says Feroze, as he stashes the payment into a tin tiffin box. The finest and the most expensive of the lot is the Banarasi sewai. ""What Basmati is to rice, Banarasi is to sewai,"" explains Shahanshah Mirza, a food connoisseur. He adds, ""An Eid without sewai is considered incomplete.""Athar Ali, the 25-year-old owner of a garment shop in Chitpur, says that most people start to stack up sewai before the beginning of Ramzan, and consume it intermittently that whole month. Mirza says, ""Chand raat marks the end of Ramzan and a lot of people buy sewai especially then because the next day is Eid.""The menu at most Mughlai eateries comprises firni and shaahi tukda and not sewai; it is the preserve of home kitchens and makes an appearance only on special occasions.There is no one way of preparing sewai, we are given to understand. The lachcha is usually doused in a bowl of milk and had with a sprinkling of sugar. ""A lot of people have it thus during sehri. It is filling and keeps one going all through the day,"" says Athar Ali.We learn from homemaker Shagufta Bano, a resident of Howrah, that every family has its own version of the sewai, most of them going back several generations. ""You could boil it in milk, cook it in chashni or sugar syrup, or deep fry it in ghee..."" she rattles away.Shagufta adds a generous pinch of jafran (saffron) to her version. First, she adds sugar in desi ghee, then water and, thereafter, some jafran for an orange tinge. Then she adds the raw sewai to this mix, throws in kaju, kishmish, pista, badaam and khoa. And a drop or two of meetha attar.What Shagufta prepares is called the qimami sewai. There is also the sheer khurma, a sweet pudding made of milk, sewai, dried dates and sugar. Be it meethi sewai, sheer khurma or rumali sewai, the slight variations are most likely in the DNA of the dish - place of origin and consequent availability of ingredients.Manzilat Fatima, a preserver of royal Awadhi family cuisine and a food curator, tells us about a sewai dish called muzaffar. ""It is an age-old preparation, not so common in every home. One needs considerable expertise to achieve the balance of moisture in the sewai and at the same time maintain the individual strands of vermicelli,"" says Fatima.Vermicelli does not have much of a flavour of its own, and so it readily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with. That is why it can be added to dishes sweet and savoury alike.Chef Deepak Raj Srivastava of Pukhtaan, a restaurant in Patna specialising in Awadhi cuisine, tells The Telegraph over phone that sewai is also used to make savoury items, cutlets and potato rolls. In these cases, the vermicelli acts as a coating, lending a certain texture to the dish.A dessert usually comes at the end of a meal. But in a manner, the sewai is an exception. Something sweet is partaken of before namaaz on Eid. Says Athar, ""Having something sweet before the Eid prayers is sunnat, which means respecting the Prophet. Some households have dry dates and milk without sugar and some prefer sewai."" It is also among the first few dishes offered to guests on Eid day, we are told - to sweeten relations."

The starch bags would be similarly priced as plastic bags available commercially.Food starch may have traditionally found uses in cooking preparations and starching clothes, but starch from potato and maize may soon find a new use: bio-degradable utility bags. City-based Science and Technology Park (STP), run under the aegis of the Department of Science and Technology, in possibly the first-of-its-kind attempt, is planning to come up with starch bags that can even dissolve in water. Since March 18, the state government has imposed a blanket ban on the use of plastics  polythene bags, plastic sheets, flags, flexes and banners, plastic and thermocol items like plates, cups, glasses, forks, bowls and spoons. Though milk pouches have been exempted for now, the government is mulling supplying milk in glass bottles instead.Polymer experts are of the view that starch and Polylactic Acid (PLA) materials can be suitable alternatives to plastic. However, PLA being expensive may find less buyers, they suggest. Speaking to The Indian Express, Rajendra Jagdale, STP Director-General, said, Being bio-degradable in nature, starch bags can be an alternative to plastic utility bags. These bags can take weight up to 30 kilograms without experiencing any stretching or the possibility of tearing apart unlike polythene bags.Jagdale said starch from all food were suitable for manufacturing these bags but added that his team was in talks with companies in Pune mainly for starch from potato and maize, both of which are sufficiently available in India. With this, we will also be able to address some issues of farmers, who can supply the starch, he said. Since these bags are water soluble, they can best be used to store or package dry products.Vitthal Kate, corporator from Pimple Saudagar in Pimpri-Chinchwad, welcomed the move and said it would lend greater urgency to stop the use of plastic utility items. Kate along with his team has managed to replace plastic bags with cloth bags in the area in the last three months. Its definitely a positive step by the state government. It will boost efforts towards replacing plastic bags, containers and other materials with environment-friendly ones, he said.He, however, has a word of caution. While a ban on plastic has been imposed, the challenge ahead lies in providing appropriate alternative materials that will perform the function as efficiently as plastic. Peoples participation will matter equally as plastic can be completely removed only through awareness about its harmful effects, he said.On the cost of starch bags, Jagdale said they would be similarly priced as plastic bags available commercially. Since starch is available in plenty, these bags will cost between Rs 120 and Rs 130 per kilogram, similar to that of commercial plastic materials, he said. STP is in talks with companies with which it plans to set up manufacturing units estimated to cost Rs 8 crore. Up to 70 tonnes of starch bags would be manufactured in each of these units.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Image used for representational purpose) Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. (Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
