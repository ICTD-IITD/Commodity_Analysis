There are times when you are tempted to watch the news for entertainment.He is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, advertisers of TV news, Hindi and English. He owns a TV channel. He has been a mentor-judge on a reality show. And now, he is the subject of a TV show devoted to his life. No one else is spread across the length and breadth of the television universe the way he is.Who is he? Who else but Baba Ramdev.This week, Swami Ramdev: Ek Sangharsh led Discovery Jeet into the entertainment firmament. Its the newest Hindi general entertainment channel on air and has chosen Ramdev as a mascot to escort it across the popularity line, ahead of other channels. Can it achieve its goal? Well, anything is possible when you have a rousing tag line like, Hai Mumkin. And that appears to be the credo: To tell stories of people who face and clear the hurdles in their way to succeed against the odds.Alongside Baba Ramdev on the obstacle race of life is an aspiring hip hop singer (Gabru), a scooter rickshaw driver father who does everything for his adopted daughter (Mere Papa Hero Hiralal) and the 36th Sikh Regiment of the British forces in India, circa 1897 (21 Sarfarosh Saragarhi).Undoubtedly, Ramdev leads the charge. The biopic begins, well, from the beginning, in the Haryana village of his birth. At this stage of his career, his fate is decided by the all-powerful high-caste head (priest?) of the village who ensures that his parents are ostracised and compelled to flee their home. The former tramples (almost literally) on the latter with the full weight of the caste divide in his favour. Although set in Haryana, this caste-outcaste narrative is relevant to the entire country  the first few episodes make for compelling TV as a tale of the powerful and the powerless.Too early to say much more, except why is it that we must impose loud music on word and action?21 Sarfarosh Saragarhi 1897 is too musical for words. So much so that often we couldnt hear the dialogue in the opening episode. Add this to the strange accents of the English (?) soldiers, our hero Ishar Singh shouting to be heard and you have a very difficult time hearing anything and comprehending even less. Foreign characters in Hindi serials (think Porus, Sony) often sound like they have a potato obstructing their vocal passages: Theres a sort of soft strangulated sound that emanates from their mouths like Indians trying to speak Hindi like foreigners.Which is a pity because you want to watch 21 Sarfarosh, based on the actual battle between 21 valiant Sikh soldiers led by Havildar Ishar Singh (Mohit Raina) and thousands of marauding Pashtuns marshaled by Gul Badshah (Mukul Dev). The action alternates between the two camps to establish the ensuing conflict. Historical dramas shot on location are a welcome relief from the stifling interiors of soap opera mansions. Hope this one doesnt become history re-imagined as mythPart of the myth-making is that in the historicals or the epics, the evil invaders are mostly unkempt, bestial with long uncombed hair, crude habits, sweating profusely for example  Gul Badshah and his band of men fit the stereotype at the moment, but he is compelling nevertheless.Gabru is all about hip hop country Punjab where three youngsters collaborate and contest to be the best hip hopster in town.Jeet has other shows on offer including the horror-crime show Anjaan and Comedy High School starring funny man Ram Kapoor.Can it succeed? Well, at a time when most Hindi entertainment is stuck in a soap formula, a new approach to entertainment is worth watching out for. Alas, what happens all too often is that new shows are forced into old bottles in order to appeal to viewers who dont seem to have much of a taste for novelty. Sam Dam Dhand Bhed (Star Bharat) began as a promising story about local politics, between a David and Goliath, but it has quickly descended into a twisted love triangle tale  a pity.Meanwhile, the English entertainment channels are not offering serious competition to the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar, although there is a new season of Homeland (Star Premiere). Its into its seventh year and Claire is looking more tired than usual this time she has a female American President to contend with too.Amongst the rest, you have Masterchef US which has just ended  not nearly as good as Masterchef Australia (Star World)  Survivor (AXN), Chance (Star World Premiere), American Ninja Warrior (AXN) Americas Got Talent (Colors Infinity) and a dose of Hannah Montana (Disney International) whenever you fancy Miley Cyrus.There are times when you are tempted to watch the news for entertainment.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2d65e19855b723c6f45de0,Union Budget 2018: A Step Forward,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arun-jaitley-union-budget-2018-a-step-forward-5048248/,2018-02-02,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before presenting Union Budget 2018 before the Parliament (Express Photo by Renuka Puri) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before presenting Union Budget 2018 before the Parliament (Express Photo by Renuka Puri)All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Civil works to club the 500 shops on the ground floor into 250 shops are under way. Earlier, the traders were hesitant to move to the new facility citing inadequate space. Authorities said that they were expecting at least 100-150 traders initially to occupy the integrated market.The over century -old Gandhi Market, which is a commercial hub of at least 10 districts in the central zone, was expanded last during the pre-Independence era. Situated in the heart of the city, the market also happens to the epicentre of frequent traffic congestion. Earlier, to decongest the market, Trichy district administration, at an estimated cost of Rs65 crore, took up the construction of an integrated vegetable and fruit market on 9.7 acres on the city outskirts at Kallikudi in 2014. The works were apparently completed in mid-2017. Even though the facility was formally inaugurated last year, it was lying unoccupied owing to the resistance from traders in the existing market to shift their business. Authorities said that the agriculture marketing department recently obtained the administrative sanction form agriculture department to make the required structural modification in Kallikudi integrated vegetable market to address the demand of the traders for more space.""After completing the ongoing works, we would invite traders to occupy the facility. We expect 100-150 traders who are operating on rental space, will make use of the modified facility,"" an official source with agriculture marketing department said. Sources added that the structural modification works are expected to conclude in a month.Traders alleged that they were not consulted during the construction works of the integrated vegetable market complex. Stating that the whole episode, including expenditure incurred to modify the facility would have been avoided, if they were assured of adequate space in the new facility. ""We do not have any issues in moving to the new market. Our concern is that we need adequate facilities for shifting our base. Traders who are operating from rental shops in Gandhi Market may shift to the new place. It has also got practical difficulty, our sales and profit would remain intact only if all of us stay nearby,"" N Saravanan , secretary of Onion and Potato wholesale dealers association in Gandhi Market told TOI.It seems that even the traders do not have many options as the efforts made by the traders to construct their own market went in vain owing to the high cost of land in city. Authorities claimed that making a few wholesale traders to occupy the refurbished integrated vegetable market post completion of the works would invite other traders in Gandhi Market to shift to the new facility."
5b2d77ec9855b723c6f46563,Weighing scales go for a toss in floating market,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weighing-scales-go-for-a-toss-in-floating-market/articleshow/62650456.cms,2018-01-26,"The floating market of Patuli, inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday, threw up a weighty problem within the first 24 hours of operations. None of the weighing scales of the 228 hawkers on the 114 boats is working properly. Since the boats are rocking at the slightest movement or the hint of a breeze, items are showing different weight readings within seconds. This has left the buyers and sellers a harassed lot.Funnily enough, no one had taken this unexpected problem into account when the market was inaugurated. The issue with the weights became apparent only on Thursday morning, when business at the market started in full earnest. As soon as the boats swayed a bit, the reading of the scales  both manual and electric  kept changing. The greater the weight of the goods being measured, the higher the difference in reading.A couple of physics professors we spoke to explained why this was happening. The mechanics of any weighing machine works on the laws of gravity and inertia. And the weighing machines need to be levelled properly on the surface where it is standing. Since a boats surface is never still, the machine is never at the same level, said a physics professor from St Xaviers College. When the boat is bobbing up, the weight shows greater than actual, and when the boat is pitching downwards, the weight shown is lower than what it should be.This mismatch in weights soon led to some dissatisfaction among the customers on Thursday morning, with some of them even refusing to buy the goods. The weight of goods Im paying for is not right. How can I buy anything? asked Samaresh Nath, a retired government official. Bapan Sardar, a potato and onion seller was bewildered with his malfunctioning electric weighing machines. He said, I never anticipated this would happen. Now I think I will have to buy a new machine.There are three probable solutions. The first would be to place the weighing machine on the axis of the boat. If you join two pointed ends of the boat with an imaginary line, that line would be the axis and its the most static position on the rolling boat, said a physics teacher. The second would be to tie the boat as tightly as possible to stop it from moving. The third would be to use a crane scale weighing machine, the kind used on big fishing boats. Those machines give a correct reading even on a moving boat."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Farmers are habitually great raconteurs. My grandfather would often narrate an episode, when he encountered a farmer sitting by a heap of potatoes in the middle of the night. On investigating what compelled the farmer to guard potatoes when there were no buyers, he was astonished to learn that the farmer was, in fact, keeping a watch to deter anyone from dumping their unsold spuds in his field. This 40-year-old episode got a rerun recently when farmers dumped their unsold produce in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home and office in Lucknow.The genesis of the potato crises in Lucknow, however, is more recent. In June 2014, soon after the BJP won a stunning mandate in the general elections, one of the first acts of the Union government was to rein in the price of potatoes (refer to my article, Making a hash of it, IE, July 5, 2014) by imposing a minimum export price (MEP), which was followed by bringing potatoes under the essential commodities Act (ECA) and permitting duty-free imports even though imports carried the risk of new diseases. Farmers were harassed and cold stores raided. The euphoria of the electoral victory celebrations drowned out the farmers sorrow. Farmers took home meagre profits, substantially less than they could have easily made. The presumptive loss to 50 lakh potato farmers on a very conservative basis was Rs 30,000 crore (total production 42 million tonnes X R.7/kg, the subdued price) amounting to Rs 60,000 per potato farmer.Profits from the previous harvest usually determine the acreage under sowing for the next season. Consequently, in the following year, India had a bumper crop of 48 million tonnes of potato in 2015 and prices crashed to Rs 2.75/kg. The government ignored the plight of farmers who subsequently failed to even recover the cost of sowing.2016 was a normal crop year in India, with 44 million tonnes of potato production. Without credible data, fearing inflation, the government overreacted and again imposed MEP. Without access to international markets, the prices faltered. Unfortunately, demonetisation in November that year made matters worse. The presumptive loss of Rs 22,000 crore (Rs 5/kg) was incurred by farmers, amounting to an average loss of Rs 44,000 per potato farmer for 2016 year alone. Our export restrictions were a bonanza for farmers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Importers seek reliable business partners and India has become an unreliable supplier due to arbitrary policy decisions. Our produce now sells at a substantial discount compared to our neighbours.In 2017, due to the relatively firmer prices of 2016 and boosted by good weather, farmers produced 48 million tonnes of potato and prices literally crashed through the basement. When, even after 10 months of storage, prices were hovering between 50 paisa to Rs 2/kg, farmers completely lost hope. The cost of growing potatoes being Rs 6.50/kg and the additional cost of storage is Rs 2.50/kg, it became infeasible to even reclaim stocks from cold storages and potatoes were strewn in Lucknow and elsewhere.Do the farmers math: In two of the four years of the Modi government, when an opportunity arose to double farm incomes, the governments inflation targeting strategy kicked in and each potato farmer lost approximately Rs 1,04,000. The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. There is no denying that controlling food inflation has to be a priority. I confess, as a potato farmer, I have a vested interest in the issue but it is this experience that gives me insight. Our demand is fair and simple: Should the government intervene to subdue potato prices in a bad crop year, it is morally bound to give a minimum support price of Rs 9/kg in excess production year. Logically, a farmer allowed to make money in one year, would be better prepared to bear the losses on the farm in the next. If not, the farmer gets into a perpetual debt cycle and is compelled to seek financial sops. Consequently, most farmer organisations are content to limiting themselves to what the farmer understands  farm loan waiver and venture no further into the policymaking quagmire.In 2018, the planting is lower by a mere five per cent, and potato prices are expected to be remunerative. But historical data indicates that a short-sighted government may respond by imposing MEP/ECA. The solutions to the farm crises arent limited to budget allocations but rooted in a system where interventions to control food inflation are not harmonised with crop-price compensation. As far as the farmer livelihoods are concerned, state governments and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare are becoming less relevant, as decisions of the Ministry of Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs are demolishing the prime ministers grand plan for doubling farmer incomes.Farmers are demoralised. The promised sab ka saath sab ka vikas rings hollow, because its starkly evident that the government has decided to focus on the urban vote bank as a part of the strategy to win the parliamentary elections in 2019. About 50 per cent of the population is financially dependent directly on agriculture, but religious, caste and ever-changing narratives divide farmers across villages to the extent that farmers arent considered a political force to be reckoned with any more. The Opposition is in an equally sad state, without a farmer face to galvanise the community. Nevertheless, farmers could change fortunes in the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, allowing the Opposition to bask in the farmers misery.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Photographs have appeared of pack animals gorging on mountains of potatoes tipped out of cold storages.They went unmolested, for the potato is the humblest vegetable  even if it changed the worlds culinary traditions and food preferences when it burst out of the New World. But in November, it may be recalled, the Orai police had put eight donkeys behind bars for refreshing themselves on more expensive plants grown by the horticulture department.Political intervention was required to secure their release. After strenuous investigation, the police believe that the potato-bombing, in which the approach roads to government buildings from the Assembly to the chief ministers residence were strewn with potatoes, was politically motivated.

The state government has ordered a probe into the violence by Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor and Patna zone IG N H Khan.The video footage, photographs and statement of local officials as well as that of the arrested villagers make it clear that it was not a spontaneous attack spawned by popular anger, but a pre-meditated criminal act, said a state official in the know of the initial findings of the probe.According to sources, the arrested villagers have told interrogators that a meeting was held even a day before the CMs visit to discuss the nitty-gritty of the attack.The probe has also taken note of the fact that the attack was executed from a point where the road had a curve due to which the vehicles in the cavalcade had to de-accelerate. Off the road on both sides are potato fields where huge quantity of big stones were found to have been stocked.People were also pelting stones from their terraces, which shows that stones had been stored on terraces as well. All these requires planning, a Buxar official told TOI over the phone on Tuesday.That the assailants intended to target the CM is clear from the voice in the video clips that prevents attackers from stoning policemen, said the Buxar official.The officials also sought to debunk the theory that the ugly protests had to do with the resentment among a section of Nandan villagers over the neglect of their ward by the local authorities while executing development schemes. Both the wards of the village have electricity and piped water connections. The approach road has been readied in one ward and the construction of the approach road in the other ward is going on. This neglect theory is bunkum, said another official.The sources said the probe team was currently poring over the call detail records of the arrested people. The commissioner and IG have been asked to probe if there was any political group or liquor mafia behind the attack, the senior official said and recalled only days before the CMs visit, police had seized liquor from Nandan.At least 28 people have been taken into custody and FIRs lodged against 99 named and 500 to 700 unnamed accused in connection with the violence."

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Bringing up the issue of 'saffronisation' of state buildings, Akhilesh said the BJP took a U-turn by repainting haj house walls after giving it a saffron cover. Sarkar ka rang ab pheeka hone laga hai aur peeche bhi hat rahi hai (the bright colour of the ruling BJP is now fading and it has started retreating from promises),"" said Akhilesh. In a message to boost party cadres, he said he had undertaken 'rath yatras' and 'cycle yatras' to dislodge wayward ruling parties thrice in the past and would do so again to reach the masses.On efforts to unite the opposition against the BJP in the forthcoming byelections and 2019 general elections, the Samajwadi Party president reiterated he would continue efforts in that direction to put up a strong fight against the BJP.In reply to a question, Akhilesh blamed the BJP for imprisonment of Lalu Yadav. ""He is a victim of BJP conspiracy,"" he said. He also condemned the BJP government for charging toll tax on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.Mounting a vitriolic attack on the BJP government, Akhilesh said, ""Starving farmers are committing suicide but are being gagged by the administration on the orders of the government"".Raising the issue of farmers throwing potatoes on the streets of the state capital, the SP president said that by suspending police personnel for not preventing the farmer protests, it was clear that the government was applying administrative machinery to suppress them.""I dare the government that even if it had announced MSP for potato growers, can it give data on how much was purchased by it,"" said Akhilesh, claiming that GDP figures, demonetisation and poor implementation of GST had collectively ruined the economic progress of the country leading to acute depression among the farming community and widespread unemployment.Questioning the existence of the anti-Romeo squads announced by the government, Akhilesh said criminal assaults on women and young girls had become the order of the day and the government was fooling the state in the name of anti-Romeo squads.""Where are anti-Romeo squads when girls are assaulted,"" he said. Reinforcing the political superstition that a UP chief minister who visits Noida is ousted from power, Akhilesh said it was good that both the PM and the CM had inaugurated the Noida Metro because now their departure from their positions was imminent."

The plan never took shape.In 2015, then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had announced at a programme that least one vodka brewing factory would be set up in Kannauj and Farukkhabad districts each, which will ensure remunerative prices to farmers.While Akhilesh has represented Kannauj in Lok Sabha for two terms, his wife Dimple Yadav is serving her second term from the same constituency. Kannauj is part of UPs potato belt, along with Farrukahabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and Aligarh, stretching up to Meerut.With 31% production, UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and more than 8 lakh farmers plant potato every year, with production increasing every year.UP produces nearly 46 lakh million tonnes of potato a year in nearly 5 lakh hectares of area. Farmers, however, have no other platform except local mandis to sell their produce and trade some portion outside the state.Demonetisation and souring relationship with Pakistan have further dealt a blow to potato growers who were earlier able to get cash in hand by trading it off to other states and Pakistan.Unlike the adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana and far off Gujarat and Maharashstra, Uttar Pradesh does not have major food processing units to process.This leads to distress selling by growers in local markets at low prices and frequently dump produce on streets in anguish.Official records of the horticulture department reveal that the food processing industry in Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom as compared to any other state.While potato prices have touched an all-time low in the past two years, there was none to educate farmers to shift to other cash crops.Glut in the market in the past two years has resulted in farmers getting into distress, said RK Singh, senior scientist at Central Institute of Potato Research, Shimla.Farm crisis would not be solved unless the state government makes efforts for a food processing industry. Unfortunately, it has not developed in the state, said SK Shukla, principal scientist at the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture in Lucknow.Potato growers keep their produce dumped in cold storages for months as they cannot even afford the rent.If we collect the potato from cold storage and take it to the market, it would cost us Rs 30 a kg while potato is already available at Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kg in the market. This does not make economic sense, said Naresh Dixit, a regular potato grower in Unnao."

Picture by Animesh SenguptaJamshedpur: Potato prices in the steel city rose sharply from Rs 10/kg on Saturday to Rs 15/kg on Sunday registering a 50 per cent hike in a single day. In Ranchi, tuber rates went up marginally from Rs 10 to Rs 12.""I have been buying potato at Rs 10 per kg for the past one year. Its price remained the same even when onion was selling at Rs 50/kg around four months ago. I was quite surprised by the sudden hike,"" said Subodh Chaudhury, a Tata Steel employee who stays at Bistupur.Sonari resident Rita Sharma said she was also taken aback by the hike. ""Every year, some factor or the other causes potato prices to go up gradually. This was for the first time that its rate jumped from Rs 10 to Rs 15 in a day,"" said Sharma.Shopkeepers are, however, selling the new variety at Rs 12/kg to Rs 13/kg since it's demand is much less compared to the old variety.While the hike has pinched the pockets of consumers, potato sellers justified the rise. Shopkeeper Awadhesh Kumar Shao said they had no option since the price of the item at the wholesale market had spiralled. ""Customers prefer the old variety of potatoes which was in short-supply. Sensing this, the wholesalers raised the price of a 50kg packet from Rs 300 to Rs 450. We had no option but to increase the rate,"" Shao, who runs a shop in Bistupur market, said.On an average, 10 truckloads of potatoes come to the steel city from Bengal every day. On Saturday, only five trucks came. On Sunday, only four truckloads of the tuber were unloaded at Krishi Utpad Bazar Samiti at Parsudih from where its sold to city retailers.Wholesaler Rajkumar Shah said prices have gone up because traders have started stocking the item in cold storages having bought it directly from farmers. ""The stock of the old variety in cold storages has finished and traders are now filling the cold storages with the new produce. They would soon release the fresh stocks and sell it at higher prices,"" said Shah. He hinted that prices would spiral further in coming months.In Ranchi, the wholesale rate of the new variety ( laal aaloo), which was priced between Rs 700 and Rs 850 per quintal on Friday, is now selling at Rs 800-Rs 1000. Similarly, the old variety (sada aaloo), which was priced between Rs 500 and Rs 600 per quintal, is now selling at Rs 700 to Rs 800.In the retail market, prices have gone up by Rs 2 for both the variants. ""I am selling the old variety at Rs 12 compared to Rs 10 last week. Lal aaloo, which was Rs 10, is now being sold at Rs 12 to Rs 13,"" said Vijay Kumar, a prominent seller at Harmu market."

Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: The extreme weather has claimed its first casualty: the potato.Farmers on the fringes of the state capital say low temperatures have ruined more than half of their crops and a supply crisis was imminent in city markets, which by default will jack up prices of the otherwise humble vegetable.Deepak Mahto, an elderly farmer from Boreya, said they often brought stocks from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to bridge the demand-supply gap and ensure price stability, but the yield in the neighbouring states had suffered as much as in Jharkhand.Kishwar Sahu, who owns a few fertile decimals of land in Chandaghasi, near Birsa Munda Airport, said the plummeting Celsius had reduced his potato production to one-eighth of last year's crop.""Every year, I sow potato in four decimal land and the yield is at least 400kg. This time, I am not expecting more than 50kg. The numbing cold at harvest time is pure bad news. We also have smaller sized potatoes this year,"" he said.Arun Sahu, a resident of Argora, echoed him. ""I do not depend on farming for a living, but I do sow potato in a small plot on my premises. The cold has taken a heavy toll on the crop this time.""Director of research D.N. Singh at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke, where the Celsius notched the freezing point for two consecutive days last week, said the potato needed moderate temperature (10-25 degree Celsius) for proper growth. ""But, the past fortnight has been unnaturally cold even by Ranchi's standard. No wonder the crop yield has suffered,"" Singh said.Director of horticulture Rajiw Kumar, however, said it was too early to anticipate a hike in potato prices owing to low production.""Around 7 lakh metric tonnes of potato is produced in Jharkhand against the average annual requirement of 16 lakh metric tonnes. We depend on supply from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh too. Let me study district-wise yield reports and access production data from neighbouring states before I can comment on prices,"" he said, but conceded that extreme cold had a negative impact on potato production, especially in the absence of proper irrigation.A potato vendor in the city, Bablu Kumar, said currently, the price of a kilo ranged between Rs 8 and Rs 14. ""Now, that is because old stocks are still available. Once that is exhausted, the price will rise because as far as I know crops in Bengal and UP have suffered too,"" he summed it up."

Prakash said the criminals fled with the CCTV hard disc and biometric machine to avoid detection.Sasaram town police station house officer (SHO) Ram Vilas Paswan said efforts were on to identify the criminals. The police quizzed employees who were on duty at the time of the incident, he said. They have registered an FIR on the statement of assistant manager Prakash. The shop came up in November 2013. ""This robbery at an upcoming locality is shocking,"" said a resident.A report from Motihari said the police arrested a criminal, Madhurendra Kumar Singh alias Madhu Singh, for alleged involvement in the loot of Rs 2.20 lakh in cash and a motorbike from Raju Prasad Gupta, a potato dealer, on February 25. Acting East Champaran superintendent of police P.N. Mishra, said two country-made pistols, a cellphone and two live cartridges were seized from Gupta, a resident of Phenhara village."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar SinghPatna: Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav on Monday started a Jan Aahar Canteen near Patna College on Ashok Rajpath where one can have food for just Rs 20.The purpose is to offer food to the poor, students and slum dwellers who cannot afford good meals at low prices. The name of the Jan Aahar is Pappu-Ranjeet Jan Aahar Canteen which already has a branch in Madhepura (Ranjeet Ranjan is the wife of Pappu and an MP from Supaul).It is not a permanent structure and has been opened in an open van which has been converted into a kitchen. At one time, at least 16 people can have food sitting on chairs as arrangement of tables has also been made.People can have as much as they wish to but they will have to eat the food there itself. Only vegetarian food will be served and the timing would from 10am to 9pm. There are three cooks and two helpers who are looking after the entire set-up in which Rs 5 lakh has been spent.The canteen will remain closed every Sunday and the quality of the food will be regularly checked through random inspections by Pappu. The cleanliness has also been taken into consideration and two big garbage boxes have been placed near the van apart from safe drinking water.Every day, the menu will change and breakfast, lunch and dinner will be served, all available for Rs 20. At one time, it has the capacity to serve food to at least 500 people.On the first day, around 150 people had food till evening, including the Madhepura MP, who also ate puri, mixed vegetable and a potato preparation.""The idea of opening the canteen for the common man came to my mind when I was informed that under the food security bill, only 4 per cent foodgrain reach the common people. Even students are unable to afford nutritious food. Then I thought of opening this canteen,"" Pappu said after inaugurating the canteen.Pappu said in the coming days, four more Jan Aahar canteens will be opened in the state capital at different locations where people can have sumptuous food at low price.On politics over opening the canteen, Pappu said: ""Amma Canteen and Indira Canteen were launched with political motives but I am only serving the poor. There is no politics behind opening the canteen.""Even students and passersby praised the initiative saying Pappu had done a good thing without any vested interest.Bimal Kumar, a student of BN College, said: ""In today's time, it is not possible to fill your stomach for Rs 20. Even the roadside food costs between Rs 30 and Rs 50. It is a very good initiative by the leader."""

He accused Modi of forcing the farmers to commit suicide because they had no option but to sell their production at low prices.""In the last four years, 12,000 farmers have committed suicide. Condition of farmers is so pathetic that their sons are not getting married because of poor finances. All of the Prime Minister's promises are nothing but jumlas,"" said Raghuvansh.The senior RJD leader also claimed that around 8,000 hand pumps are defunct in Bihar. Addressing a news meet at the RJD office in Patna, Raghuvansh said farmers earlier would get subsidy of 90 per cent for borings but that has now been brought down to 50 per cent. This has meant farmers cannot install their own borings and irrigation is hit.He also attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar over paddy procurement. ""As the government did not procure paddy, farmers had to sell their produce at very low prices. The worst affected are potato farmers who have run away after dumping it in cold storage. In states like Uttar Pradesh, farmers threw away their potatoes on the road. The crop insurance and subsidy on diesel are just promises,"" Raghuvansh said.He asked the Prime Minister that if bank loans of farmers in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were waived off why weren't Bihar farmers'.At Kisan Melas, farming machines are so expensive, Raghuvansh said, that farmers get no benefit of subsidy. So, he demanded pension for farmers on the pattern of government employees."

The price rise in the fuel and power basket was at 4.70% in March from 3.81% in January due to rising crude prices.India Inc hailed the ease of inflation and the governments supply-side response.Consistent decline in WPI indicates that the government has undertaken effective measures at the ground to address the supply side problems of the economy during the last few years. A significant decline in the inflation of food articles including cereals and pulses is an indicator that the government has rightly focused on the agriculture sector, said PHD Chamber of Commerce.Earlier, the data showed retail inflation too slipped to a five-month low of 4.28% in March on account of decline in food prices providing comfort to the RBI for its next monetary policy review."
5b2e5af89855b72640115a86,FSSAI plans to regulate GM food,http://www.deccanherald.com/national/fssai-plans-regulate-gm-food-668936.html,2018-05-08,"In what appears to be a classic case of putting a cart before the horse, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has released a plan to label genetically modified food in India, months after informing the Supreme Court that genetic foods are not allowed to be sold in India.Last month FSSAI came out with a set of draft rules on labelling and display of food items. The draft carries a section on how food items containing genetically engineered elements should be labelled.The proposal looks straightforward enough except for the fact that genetically engineered or modified foods are not legally allowed to be sold in India till date.The FSSAI had informed the Supreme Court in May 2017 that manufacture, distribution, sale and import of GM food are not allowed in India and could not be regulated till the government opens up the gate through an official notification.The food regulator submitted its response to the top court in connection with a public interest litigation that began in 2006.It is inconsistent and ultra vires for FSSAI to issue a draft notification that allows for GM ingredients, at a time when any selling, stocking, distributing of GM foods itself is illegal, as per FSSAIs affidavit in the Supreme Court. FSSAI must remove this entirely, said Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor, on behalf of Coalition for GM Free India  an alliance of NGOs that oppose GM technology.The draft rules state: All food products having total genetically engineered ingredients 5% or more shall be labelled. The total GE ingredients shall be of top three ingredients in terms of their percentage in the product. The labelling shall be: 'Contains GMO/Ingredients derived from GMO'.While GM food is not allowed in the Indian market, way back in 2001, environmental group Greenpeace had alleged that two food products purchased from a prominent south Delhi market contained GM elements. One of the products was a popular potato chips brand and the second one was baby food.Greenpeace charges were on the basis of testing the food items from a food testing laboratory in Hong Kong.In its affidavit in the Supreme Court, FSSAI admitted that the issue of labelling GM food is a very complex one that may lead to product cost escalation and the government discussed it multiple times since 2005-06."

We want voluntary co-operation from people in this mission,"" said horticulture secretary Bhutia. He added that unsold non-organic vegetables brought till Saturday will be seized.""The ban should be total. If it is selective, we will also get vegetables from outside. When people cannot differentiate between organic and inorganic vegetables in the market, how can the department seize our stock? This is a worry for us,"" said a vendor at Lall Bazaar, the main vegetable market in Gangtok."

Ahluwalia on Sunday, calling him a man without ""passport"" in his own constituency and accusing him of returning to the hills ""without shame"" to stoke up more troubles.The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which is politically opposed to the JAP, has already demanded the BJP parliamentarian's resignation.Observers believe the JAP's strong-worded comments on Ahluwalia, despite being opposed to the Morcha, is indicative of the growing disenchantment in the hills with the role Ahluwalia and the BJP played during the statehood movement last year. ""The resentment against the BJP is at an all time high in the hills,"" said an observer.Amar Lama, a bureau member of the JAP, said: ""Mr Ahluwalia is like a man without a passport now. He has nowhere to go. The only honourable thing for him to do is to resign.""Anmole Prasad, another bureau member of the JAP, said: ""Mr Ahluwalia is absolutely right when he says (Bimal) Gurung was a victim of a conspiracy. Mr Ahluwalia should know he is one of the key conspirators, along with Mr Narendra Modi who famously uttered the words, ' Gorkhaon ka sapna, mera sapna'"".While campaigning for Ahluwalia in Siliguri in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi had said the dreams of the Gorkhas were his --- a statement that was used to the hilt by the BJP-Morcha alliance to garner votes.""After misleading Gurung and the people for five years, our MP fled Darjeeling to avoid some hard questions from his constituency in its hour of need. Now, he is creeping back into Siliguri, without shame, in order to stoke up more trouble in the hills,"" said Prasad.The Darjeeling MP was in Siliguri, which is part of his constituency, after a hiatus of almost eight months, to inaugurate a Passport Seva Kendra on Saturday.""It would be best if Sri Ahluwalia, (who has described himself in Lok Sabha as a staunch Bengali), left the hills alone without meddling further in our affairs,"" Prasad said in a written statement.Calling up the hill people to elect one among them as the next MP, Prasad said: ""It is time that the people of Darjeeling and Kalimpong learnt that hired MPs will always betray us. Unless we learn to represent ourselves in every institution of democracy, we will continue to be the pawns in the hands of the central and state governments, over and over again,"" said Prasad.Amar Lama said Gurung would be dropped by the BJP like a hot potato soon. ""Gurung should realise that he is only useful to the BJP until 2019, after which he will be dropped like a hot potato. Bengal is far more important to the BJP than one seat in Darjeeling,"" said Lama."
