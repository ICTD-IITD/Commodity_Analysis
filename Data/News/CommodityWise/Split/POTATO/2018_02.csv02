I have the last exam, if Im not mistaken, Im not sure, on May 17,"" the Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil forward told a press conference in Sao Paulo.""Ill be cleared to play. Then Ill see, it depends on how things develop, it depends on my next exams.... It has not been decided,"" he said.The timing leaves the world's most expensive footballer in a tight race to feature again for PSG with the freshly crowned French champion's season ending on May 19 with a game against Caen.However, his prospects for starring in Brazil's much fancied side at the World Cup in Russia, which runs from June 14 to July 15, look much better. Brazil open their campaign on June 17 against Switzerland in Rostov.""I hope I won't watch the World Cup on TV,"" Neymar joked, calling the tournament a ""dream"".""I will have enough time to prepare,"" he said at the press conference, where he walked with crutches and his foot immobilized in a medical boot. ""It's evolving well.""With the enforced rest period Neymar added, ""I will arrive better than I was before.""Neymar, 26, broke a bone in his right foot on February 25 in a Ligue 1 game against Marseille, before returning to his home country for surgery and rehabilitation.Brazil's national team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar, performed surgery on March 3 and then estimated that Neymar would be out for ""two-and-a-half to three months"".In his absence, PSG were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid in the last 16 in March.Brazil will also face Costa Rica and Serbia in their group, as they target winning a sixth World Cup, four years after the nightmare of their 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals on home soil in 2014.For now, Neymar said he spends much of his time playing poker, his ""favorite pastime,"" and ""playing video games and going on the computer"".Not that he enjoys the couch potato experience much.""There are doubts, of course. I feel them too. But it's normal for a guy who ended up injured. This was the first surgery in my career,"" he said. ""It's really hard seeing my team score and becoming champions without me being with them.""""Still, I am more rested,"" he said. ""We have to look on the bright side."""

Pictures by Sudeshna BanerjeeA sense of space and old world grandeur are what one experiences when stepping into Sly Fox Gastro Club in Sector V. Housed in Globsyn Crystals, known to be a hub of eateries, the restaurant started operations in mid-April and had a formal opening last week.We wanted to build a classy place with good ambience and pocket-friendly menu, said Rahul Dalmiya, a partner in the venture.The high ceiling and the filigree wood work on the walls as well as the ornate chandeliers with metallic finish do convey a charm of the bygone era. Part of the side walls are glass, allowing a view of the foyer outside. We used to pull the curtains to prevent a crowd gathering outside during the IPL matches, laughs Rahul.Indeed, the giant screen (16ftx9ft) installed over the bar counter makes watching sports an exhilarating experience.Neither Rahul, a Xaverian now involved in the manufacturing sector in Nagpur, nor his partner Karan Chhawchharia, a real estate man, has any experience in the food and beverage sector. We share a passion for good food, Karan says. And Sector V is the best place to be in. There is a demand for class with a bit of quirkiness.And they have deliberately not kept hookah as an option. You cant breathe in a hookah place, Rahul exclaims. A resident DJ plays club music but on a weekday lunch, when The Telegraph Salt Lake visited the place the volume was soothing to the ear. Conversation was possible. The music will be amped up a bit on weekend nights. Though there is no dance floor, we have kept ample space between tables so one can just break into a gig right here.

From 4pm to 6pm, we are serving high tea. There is a set meal available, for Rs 245 (non-veg) and Rs 225 (veg), with six kinds of savouries  kathi roll, sandwich, cutlet, fruit cake, cookies and pakodas. The tea is unlimited to keep conversation flowing at business meetings and kitty parties, Karan explains.The menu, with a nod to fusion, is a mix of Continental, Indian, Chinese and Thai. An unusual element is added to the presentation of some of the dishes by way of molecular gastronomy. The mint chutney with Malai Broccoli for instance is in the form of caviar, smiles chef Naresh Kumar. It costs Rs 310.In Butter Chicken Jacket Potato, the chicken tikka sits atop a bed of scooped out potato with a thick skin. On each piece is a bit of white foam which is jalapeno-flavoured.

Das, director, IMD, Calcutta, said on Friday.There are two developing weather systems that may cause thunderstorms and rain, Das said.A cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and Gangetic Bengal and a trough of low pressure stretching from the eastern parts of Bihar to southern Odisha and passing through Bengal are likely to bring rain to the city, he said.The weather system is likely to strengthen over the next two days with embedded cyclonic circulation over east Jharkhand and adjoining Gangetic Bengal.The cyclonic circulation is likely to reach south Bengal by Saturday and that will increase the chances of rain and thunderstorm, the weatherman said.These two systems will pull the air from the sea to land because their atmospheric pressure is lower than their surroundings.Once the moisture-laden air reaches Jharkhand, it will mix with the hot and dry air and the confluence should lead to the formation of thunderclouds.""We can expect rain and the temperatures are likely to drop by two or three degrees,"" Das said.The maximum temperature on Friday was 33.8 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The minimum was 26.7 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.As the systems are in the formative stages, moisture incursion has started and it has led to the formation of a layer of clouds over Calcutta.When there are clouds the sunrays are filtered on their way to the earth's surface; so, the solar radiation is less and the temperature tends to slide, a weather scientist said.On Friday, there was a layer of cloud but Calcuttans still felt uncomfortable.""I was travelling around 11am... it was humid. I felt relieved only under the AC in my office,"" Sanjeeb Mukherjee, who took a Metro to Dum Dum from Kalighat, said.The maximum temperature was a degree below normal but the feeling of discomfort was high because the minimum relative humidity was high at 56 per cent.The maximum relative humidity was 83 per cent.Minimum relative humidity denotes the moisture content in the air during the hottest period of the day.The temperature is highest in the afternoon.North Bengal saw hailstorms and thundershowers on Friday. In Alipurduar's Falakata, Tapy Roy, 11, was killed in a lightning strike in the morning when he was out on the potato field.Sandakphu received more than an inch of snow early on Friday. The weatherman attributed the snowfall to a western disturbance.The Met office has forecast squalls over the weekend in Bankura, Birbhum, East and West Burdwan, Murshidabad, Nadia, Jhargram, Purulia, East and West Midnapore, Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas districts."

The elephants that entered Jhargram around 48 hours ago could scare the tiger and drive it away to another forest, wildlife officials said.The forest department laid two traps with live bait for the tiger on Sunday but now capturing the animal seems a daunting task.""Capturing a tiger is in itself a tough job. But we had zeroed in on a broad location. The elephants have made things even more challenging. We might have to expand the area of operation,"" said Ravikant Sinha, the chief wildlife warden of Bengal.Two of the elephants, one of them a tusker, were separated from the herd and ran amok in nearby villages and Lalgarh town.""The elephants uprooted several trees and trampled over small bushes and twigs. The cameras were placed inside tree trunks and other hidden spots,"" said Rabindranath Saha, the divisional forest officer of Midnapore. ""They destroyed potato farms and crushed two-wheelers. The walls of a few buildings were also damaged.""Forest officials and villagers managed to drive the elephants back into the forest by evening.Elephants from Jharkhand's Dalma region often enter Jhargram but the presence of the tiger in the jungle has complicated things this time.No fresh pug marks were spotted in Melkhedia jungle on Sunday, prompting some officials to suspect that the predator may have moved to Kamrangi forest, less than 5km from Lalgarh. ""Kamrangi forest is covered with layers of dried sal leaves. It will be difficult to trace pug marks there,"" said Saha."

Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker.

""There are close to 200 American companies operating here through direct investment, joint venture partnerships, distributorships and dealerships and franchisee and licence agreements. These US businesses operate in a range of sectors, including IT, with companies such as Cognizant and IBM, food processing with Frito Lay's state-of-the-art potato processing plant and its successful partnership with local partners, chemicals and petrochemical, with substantial investment from The Chatterjee Group, and business consulting with the Big Four and other firms having significant operations in Bengal....all these examples of the enormous potential of our mutually beneficial economic relationship - especially if we view it through a strategic lens.""Juster declined to share a view that socio-religious strife in India would impede investment of US companies. ""You have to see what the situation, regulatory climate, governmental policy, growth opportunities vis--vis complications.""He marvelled at the diversity, multi-ethnic and multi-religious, pluralistic nature of both democracies but pointed out that they also create challenges.

Because Calcutta was the capital of British India, various people settled here, from the Marwaris of Rajasthan to the Iranians from Baghdad. That is why our cuisine has so many influences, he said, adding how in his childhood days youths were asked to go eat tadka roti in Punjabi dhabas to build bodies like Punjabis.One factor that decided the menu was the seasonality of vegetables. In those days, things would not be available round the year. Also, every part of a vegetable would be put to use. Nothing went waste. Film editor Rabiranjan Maitra recalled potato peels being served fried when he was a child. That was because the economic conditions of families were not good after Partition, Ghose explained.The filmmaker had voyaged down many a river in Bangladesh while shooting for Padmanadir Majhi. In those days, because of poor communication, fishermen could not find buyers immediately if a large shoal of hilsa was caught. One day, at the confluence of Meghna, I found a fishermans wife placing dozens of hilsa pieces on a giant kadai. She said she was extracting the oil from the hilsa to light lamps!The illustration by Debashis Deb in course of the adda. (Sudeshna Banerjee)Singer Manoj Murali Nair said the fish cooked in his ancestral home in Kerala were different from the ones in Bengal. My Malayali grandmother used to cook those fish in wooden utensils on coal ovens. The taste was so different. Siddhartha Chatterjee of Machhlibaba mentioned Meen Curry served on banana leaves in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.Cartoonist Debashis Deb joked about a vegetarian Tamil acquaintance who settled in Calcutta and fell in love with the hilsa but was crestfallen at having to forego fish once he was transferred back to his home state.Ghoses restaurant Bhojohari Manna once received an order of fish curry from a vegetarian family. The man had been prescribed regular protein intake by doctors. So we decided to send him a light katla curry. After a few months, I heard he was merrily having all kinds of fish!The relish of choosing and buying fish from the market is also a part of the pleasures that fish affords Bengalis. My father would check under the gills to check if it was red. That indicated freshness of the catch, Ghose said, adding: These days, the sellers use paint to dupe customers.Ghose is a good cook too. Sudipa Mukherjee of Sudipar Rannaghar asked why he carried rice, daal and pressure cooker wherever he went shooting. I like to be prepared for eventualities, smiled Ghose. Once during the shooting of Mr and Mrs Aiyar, the south Indian cook of the unit prepared such spicy food that Ghose had to cook khichudi 10 times over to feed half the unit, including Aparna Sen, the director. Maitra recalled the unit demanding alubhaja from Ghose at the end of the films shooting in Chalsa. He sought rum from a unit hand and adding a few drops from the bottle, made us memorably tasty fries.Ghose pointed out that cooking was much like making films. Phoron is the most important aspect in any cuisine. Just like you need to know how much or how long to fry, boil or steam, in films you have to decide what and how much to show.Sudipa was embarrassed when asked which her favourite fish were. Katla and tilapia. People laugh at me, she said, defensively. I have seen tilapia on sale in New York. They were originally from Africa. It came to India from the US. Thats why in our childhood, tilapia used to be called American koi, smiled Chatterjee.The programme ended with Nair singing not Rabindrasangeet but a couple of Hindi film songs at Sudipas request while Deb worked on a fish-related sketch."

But officials and lawmakers say the outlook could change if the unpredictable U.S. leader turns his attention to Tokyo's 7 trillion yen ($63.62 billion)trade surplus ahead of U.S. congressional elections in November.""Naturally, America wants an early conclusion to what to do about its trade deficit (with Japan). Of course, they are concerned about the mid-term elections and may say various things, said a ruling party lawmaker well-versed in U.S.-Japan economic ties, one of eight officials and lawmakers interviewed by Reuters who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.""Suga is worried,"" he added, referring to Abes close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.Efforts to showcase the US-Japan security alliance in the face of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats will probably take precedence over trade when U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Japan from Tuesday, officials on both sides said.Pence will not hold a formal third round of the so-called ""economic dialogue"" with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso while in Tokyo. The two last met for a second round in October, when, among other things, they agreed to lift restrictions on Japanese persimmon exports and US Idaho potato imports as well as streamline noise and emissions testing for US auto imports.""Japan's strategy could be said to be very simple - keep this channel of economic dialogue open,"" said one Japanese government source familiar with the government's thinking.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments late last month that a weak dollar would help US trade imbalances in the short term boosted the yen sharply against the dollar. It was a reminder of how currency could come into focus if trade friction revives.Japan is waiting to see what decision the White House takes on an inquiry into steel imports under Section 232 of a 1962 U.S. trade law allowing restrictions to protect national security. Action against an ally like Japan or South Korea, two of the sources said, could be problematic.Japan's largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, has said Japanese exports are not hurting U.S. rivals. ""We hope the U.S. will make a wise decision,"" a company official said.William Hagerty, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, has said Washington wants to see progress on cutting Japan's trade surplus and forging a bilateral framework - which Tokyo opposes - by spring.Hagerty, in an interview with NHK last month, flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG), medicines and farm products as sectors where Washington wants to boost exports.Increasing LNG exports to Japan, however, could be tough: Japanese buyers have already agreed to buy more U.S. gas than they need. And boosting pharmaceutical exports would run up against Japan's efforts to cut drug prices to curb the rising medical costs of an ageing population.Washington also pushed again for fewer restrictions on beef shipments and auto exports during working-level talks in late January. Japanese officials argue such problems would have been resolved if the United States had remained in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal forged under Trump's predecessor.""We can say, 'Why did you leave TPP? If you were in TPP, these wouldn't be a problem,'"" the ruling party lawmaker said.Trump surprised many last month by saying he might be willing to rejoin the multilateral trade pact - if it were renegotiated to benefit the United States.Abe has rejected the idea of reopening talks on the delicately balanced pact, though some sources said Tokyo might eventually act as a bridge to lure Washington back with minor changes that Trump could sell back home as a victory.One option, sources said, is to present plans already in the works to buy more U.S. military gear as a gesture to please Trump, who brought up the sector during a November visit to Tokyo.Japan plans to buy 410.2 billion yen worth of US military equipment in the year starting in April and is working on a new five-year overall procurement plan that would start in 2019.Still, some politicians expressed frustration with a U.S. playbook that appears to hark back to the 1980s, when Japan accounted for a much bigger chunk of the U.S. trade deficit and its companies had yet to step up their direct investment in America.Trade in Japanese goods accounts for less than 10 percent of the U.S. deficit, compared with China's more than 40 percent.""When it comes to what to do in concrete terms, everyone is at a loss,"" the lawmaker said. ""The situation is completely different from the trade friction of the 1980s."""
5b2f4f589855b70eb7de7e7a,"Budget 2018: Why record harvests, government spending not enough for farmers",http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/jan/27/budget-2018-why-record-harvests-government-spending-not-enough-for-farmers-1764050.html,2018-01-27,"Shreehari Paliath ByExpress News ServiceINDIASPEND: Indian farms produced record harvests in 2017, and the governments agricultural budget rose 111 per cent over four years to 2017-18. Yet, prices crashed, 8,007 farmers committed suicide in 2015, unpaid agricultural loans rose 20 per cent between 2016 and 2017, and 600 million Indians who depend on agriculture are struggling to get by.This is the situation that faces the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as it heads into its last full budget before general elections in 2019, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised doubling of farm incomes by 2022.The agriculture sector will not just watch how much money is set aside in the 2018-19 budget but also how it is used, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also tries to woo disaffected farmers before upcoming Assembly elections in eight states  Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura.Agriculture is the governments top priority, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on January 15, 2018, admitting that farmers were not getting the right price for their produce. That is an acknowledgement that record harvests and government spending are not significantly improving Indias agricultural crisis.Record harvest, falling incomeIndia has seen a decline in the proportion of cultivators  as the census calls farmers who own or rent land  from 50 per cent in 1951 to 24 per cent in 2011, as IndiaSpend reported on August 8, 2014. Yet, nearly half of Indias population, or about 600 million people, still depend on agriculture.India harvested a record 276 million tonnes  all-time highs were reported for rice, wheat, pulses, tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram) and coarse cereals  4.01 per cent higher than the previous record in 2013-14, according to the fourth advance estimates for the rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon) crops for 2016-17.Similarly, horticulture output was a record, nearly 300 million tonnes, or 4.8 per cent more than 2015-16, with potatoes  now experiencing a glut, leading to unrest among potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh  recording an 11 per cent rise over the previous year.Over a decade ending 2014-15, Indias agriculture sector grew at 4 per annum compared to 2.6 per annum the previous decade, according to the 2017 Dalwai Committee report that explored how farm incomes could be doubled, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in 2016and IndiaSpend reported on March 30, 2016, as being unlikely.An indicator of growing problems in Indias agricultural economy is a drop in the growth of gross value added (GVA)  a measure of income to farmers before their produce is sold  to 2.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent the previous year, according to the first advance estimates of national income 2017-18.The slowdown could be witnessed in Indias agricultural exports, which dipped to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, after growing more than five times over a decade ending 2014, while agricultural imports grew five times over the decade to 2015-16, Down To Earth reported on January 11, 2018.An agricultural slowdown has evident political implications: 49 per cent of landowning farmers voted for the BJP in 2014, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. A reminder came in December 2017 from Gujarat, where the BJP won by the narrowest margin in 22 years, winning fewer rural seats (43) than the Congress (62).Further evidence of farm distress is evident in rising agricultural loan defaults, loan waivers by state governments and farm suicides.Defaults, distress & suicidesAlongside record foodgrain and horticultural output in 2016-17, many Indian states were swept by farm agitations demanding higher prices for their produce from government and farm-loans waivers.One example is tur dal. After the monsoon of 2017, imports and a record harvest caused a glut that led to a fall in minimum support price (MSP)  the price at which the government purchases crops from farmers leading to unrest and stress in rural Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat, IndiaSpend reported on June 8, 2017.A similar glut in potatoes crashed prices in Uttar Pradesh (UP), prompting farmers to dump produce on roads statewide, The Hindu reported on January 13, 2018. Such situations spur agrarian unrest. India witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in agrarian riots between 2014 and 2016, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. In July 2017, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest seeking farm-loan waivers and higher produce prices, the Hindustan Times reported on July 17, 2017.As distress grew, so did farmer suicides, which increased 42 per cent in 2015 over the previous year, IndiaSpend reported on January 2, 2017. Indebtedness was a major reason for farmer suicides. Nearly four in ten of 8,007 Indian farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were in debt, compared to two in ten in 2014; more rural households went into debt over 11 years; and the average rural household had borrowed Rs 1.03 lakh, according to a January 2018 IndiaSpend analysis of government data.Nearly 70 per cent of Indias 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on average each month, IndiaSpend reported on June 21, 2017.In 2017, with farmers in eight states demanding loan waivers, Indias potential cumulative loan waiver was Rs 3.1 lakh crore ($49.1 billion), or 2.6 per cent of Indias gross domestic product in 2016-17, almost equal to Indias defence budget of Rs 3.6 lakh crore ($53.5 billion) for 2017-18.The loan write-offs caused non-performing assets (NPA)  or bad debts  related to agriculture to increase three-fold over three years to 2012-13, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the government.A major reason for persistent farm distress and the debt-and-death cycle is that 52 per cent of Indias farms depends on increasingly erratic monsoon rains.Despite normal monsoon, 8 states drought-affectedAlthough 2017 was classified as a normal monsoon, eight states were declared drought-affected, The Economic Times reported on April 6, 2017, revealing the vulnerability of Indias farms to uncertain rainfall in an era of climate change. Despite spending Rs 3.51 lakh croreequivalent to the farm-loan waivers demanded in 2017over 67 years, no more than 48 per cent of nearly 201 million hectares of farmland is irrigated.The government intended to invest about Rs 50,000 crore over five years to 2019-20 through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojanathe Prime Ministers Irrigation Programmeto reach its target of water for every farm.But the programme was modified to revive 99 moribund small and medium irrigation projects in 2016-17, Down to Earth reported on January 19, 2018.As production rises, so will the demand for water for irrigation, estimated to grow from 910 billion cubic meter in 2015 to 1,072 billion cubic meter in 2050. Irrigation requires more water than drinking water, industry and energy needs. Over a decade to 2011, water available per capita fell 15 per cent, IndiaSpend reported on August 2, 2017.Without a long-term budgetary plan, planning for sustainable groundwater management and conjunctive use using ground and surface water  India will face a water shortage.As the water crisis grows, programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Programme  started in 2016 to insure farmers and provide financial support after natural calamities, pest or disease outbreaks, could be redundant.As excessive extraction of groundwater makes water scarce for agriculture, it may be outside the ambit of schemes like PMFBY to provide farmers insurance against crop failure.There is a need to ensure that farm production is linked to various markets for farmers to recover full value of the quantity produced. This will incentivise the farmer to adopt improved farm technology and management practices for higher productivity, according to the Dalwai Committee report. This requires better storage and warehousing facilities.Better storage will reduce foodgrain wastageAbout 60,000 tonnes of foodgrain was wasted between 2011-16 in warehouses run by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI). This means the grain either rots or is eaten by rodents and other animals.FCI stocks classified as damaged dropped from 18,847 tonnes to 8,776 tonnes over two years to 2016-17, according to this August 8, 2017, government response to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. That is still 731 truckloads  using a 12-tonne truck  of wasted foodgrain every year.Indias cold-storage capacity for fruits and vegetables increased by 8 per cent to 346 lakh metric tonnes over three years to 2017. This should allow farmers to reduce time to market and ensure better quality.(Paliath is an analyst with IndiaSpend, a data-driven, public-interest journalism non-profit)"

The other two women survivors were still in critical condition.Earlier, doctors had indicated that two of the Cuban survivors of Friday's crash were fighting for their lives at Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital.A Boeing 737 leased to national carrier Cubana de Aviacion crashed shortly after taking off from Havana's Jose Marti airport on Friday with 113 passengers and crew aboard.The Cuban government is investigating the cause of the crash and has so far identified 33 of the dead, some of whom have already been buried.Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo has said one of the plane's two black boxes had been recovered in ""good condition,"" and the other was likely to be found. Their data will be key to determining what happened.The 39-year-old plane, leased from a Mexican company, Global Air, was on a domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin, where most of the passengers were from.In Mexico, Global Air's operations were suspended so that Mexican aviation authorities can run inspections of the aircraft it leases, on the heels of the tragedy in Cuba.The review will double inspect aircraft already certified as safe to fly, and assist as needed in the investigation of the accident in Cuba, a company statement said.Built in 1979, according to the Mexican government, the plane last passed inspection in November 2017.The accident happened at 12:08pm (1608 GMT). The plane crashed in a potato field close to Havana's airport. Witnesses and airport officials told AFP that the aircraft plunged as it was making its first turn after take-off.Almost all of what remained of the plane was a mangled carcass of burned metal. It came down just 200 meters (yards) from houses between the Boyeros and Santiago de Las Vegas districts south of Havana.A day of mourning ended early Monday, the Communist Party leader and former president Raul Castro said. Flags were flown at half-mast throughout the country.President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded Castro as the communist island's leader only last month, appeared aghast as he surveyed the recovery efforts, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and surrounded by officials.He visited the capital's morgue where the bodies were taken for identification, and met relatives who were being put up in a city hotel. He also visited the survivors.Prior to Friday's crash, Cuba's most recent air accident was in April 2017, in which eight military personnel died when a Russian-made AN-26 transport aircraft went down in western Cuba."

Nine of them are in prison in Spain.According to his lawyer Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, Puigdemont was on his way back to Belgium, where he had been living in self-imposed exile.A ruling on extradition must normally be made within 60 days under German law. A spokeswoman for the German prosecutor's office told AFP it would ""probably not come this week"" ahead of the four-day Easter holiday.- Protests in Barcelona -The ousted Catalonia president's detention marks the latest chapter in a secession saga that has bitterly divided Catalans and triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.Tuesday's road blockades followed protests in Barcelona on Sunday, when Catalan riot police shoved and hit demonstrators with batons to keep the crowd from advancing on the Spanish government's representative office.Nearly a hundred people were slightly injured during the protests, including 22 police officers, emergency services said.The case lands a diplomatic hot potato in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's lap less than two weeks after her new government was sworn in.Her spokesman insisted Monday that the decision on Puigdemont's extradition rested solely in the hands of the German regional justice authorities.On Friday, Spain's supreme court issued international arrest warrants for 13 Catalan separatists including Puigdemont and his nominated successor Jordi Turull.The court said they would be prosecuted for ""rebellion"", a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.Twelve more face less serious charges such as disobedience.- Fresh elections? -Issuing the warrant for Puigdemont on Friday, Judge Pablo Llarena accused the former Catalan leader of organising the referendum in October last year despite a ban from Madrid and the risk of violence.That vote had been swiftly followed by the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence on October 27.Meanwhile the lawyer for a former Catalan minister wanted by Spain for her role in last year's independence bid, Clara Ponsati, said she will surrender to police on Wednesday in Scotland where she had fled.While separatist parties won Catalonia's regional elections, which were called by Madrid in December, they have been unable to elect a president and form a government as their chosen candidates are now either in exile, in jail or facing prosecution.Fresh regional elections will be triggered if a new leader is not elected by May 22."

At present, the children are given daliya (porridge), Kher and Panjeeri (Nutritional Indian snack).Now the Department of Social Security and Development of Women and Children is planning to change the menu of the ananwadis as the minister Aruna Chaudhary feels that one cannot have the same item to eat day in and day out as the elders also get fed up eating the same thing.Thus it has mulled that Karha-Puri (sweet-pudding-fried Indian bread), Rajmah-chawal (Rice and Kidney Bean) and Allo sabzi (Potato vegetable) should be served to the children who come to these anganwadi centres. So that the children will also get to eat something different every day.It is learnt that every year the state government spends around Rs 140 crore on the diet on the children going to the anganwadi centres. A little more than eight lakh children between 3 to 6 years come to the 26,836 such centres daily.An officer said, ""daily this menu has been served to the children for last ten years and on each child around Rs 8 is spent daily on just the food and for expecting mothers it is Rs 12 daily.''""Also we are mulling to give khichdi in the new diet besides Karha-Puri and Rajmah-chawal and potato vegetable (allo sabzi) and presently we will stop giving daliya for the time being but the other items like kher and panjeeri will continue,'' he said.Sources said that on Wednesday the Social Security and Development of Women and Children minister Aruna Chaudhary held a meeting with the department and Markfed (Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation) official in which she directed the cooperative to supply the item items as per the new proposed diet plan prepared by the department, a few of these will be packed food items.This will save the department from going through the tendering process for supply of raw material for meals from private contractors and ensure transparency. Thus, with supply of maximum fortified items, including flour and oil the calorie and nutrition content of each meal will be enriched as additional nutrients will be added in fortified items to improve nutritive value.Punjab Women and Child Development minister Aruna Chaudhary said, ""daily three items ( daliya, kheer and panjeeri) are being served at anganwadi centers for many years. Now we have prepared a new menu as we want to change the existing menu.''"

A regular day in an Indian household is incomplete without the humble potato being part of at least one meal. Now a survey says that a majority of Indians eat potatoes every day.To decode India's affinity for the vegetable, Taco Bell that has conceptualized and introduced an all new potato taco to their menu named The Crispy Potaco with the aim to #MakePotatoGreat, and Food Talk India conducted a survey across New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chandigarh and Hyderabad.The survey focused on evaluating how often Indians eat potatoes and measured their love for the vegetable and the findings revealed that 65 per cent of the people surveyed feel 'super' love for the potato, said a statement.Conducted among 15-40 year olds across cities, the survey found that almost 51 per cent people eat potatoes every day. In fact, 73 per cent respondents said they loved potatoes the most when fried and marked their love for potatoes as 5 on a scale of 1-5 (0 being hate and 5 being super love).An interesting aspect around the potato love also emerged from the survey.Respondents to the survey felt that the potato is one of the most versatile vegetables and yet doesn't get due credit, thus creating a need for making potato great amongst the Indian consumers by giving the much-loved vegetable its own identity, after years of starring as the sidekick in most meals."

Ramadoss to decide on alliances.The former Union Health Minister said the transfusion of HIV-infected blood to a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district was unpardonable. The incident had resulted in people losing whatever little confidence they had in government hospitals, he said.Resolutions passedDetailing the resolutions passed during the partys special general council meeting, he said the party urged the Central government to withdraw the permission granted to Karnataka to study the feasibility of constructing a dam at Mekedatu. The present water-holding capacity of the dams in Karnataka was 104.59 tmcft, and Karnataka seldom shared water with Tamil Nadu. If the Mekedatu dam comes up with a capacity of 67.14 tmcft, the water-holding capacity of Karnataka would rise to 171.73 tmcft, spelling disaster for Tamil Nadu and turning the State into a desert, a party resolution said.It urged more powers for the Cauvery Management Board, especially the power to take over dams. The rain this year forced Karnataka to release water, and this may not be the case every year, the resolution added.Claiming that not a paisa of relief was received from the Centre even 45 days after Cyclone Gaja, the resolution stated that the central committee was yet to submit its report, adding that the callousness was highly condemnable.The party urged the State government to drop a proposal to lay high-tension power lines along farmlands. It sought the convening of a special Assembly session to prevent the re-opening of the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi. It also called for the scrapping of the Salem-Chennai green corridor project and demanded that the local body polls be conducted immediately.Another resolution called on the Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) to drop its third mine project. It said that already, the existing mines were excavating 28.50 million tonnes of lignite, and the NLC had 10,000 acres of idle land.
