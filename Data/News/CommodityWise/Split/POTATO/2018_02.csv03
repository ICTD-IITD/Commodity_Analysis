These officials are trying to project the crop insurance scheme as the Centre's contribution. I vouch that this is a travesty of truth,"" she said. ""The Centre is trying to showcase the scheme as its own when it pays only 20% of the liability while the state bears 80%. I am telling AIC officials the state will withdraw its deposits with AIC if they continue with such misinformation. We can very well bear entire liability if we can pay 80% of insurance premium,"" she said.State officials pointed out that Bengal was the only state where farmers didn't have to pay crop insurance for rabi crops other than potato and onion . The state government pays its own share and also the beneficiary's share, which adds up to 80% of the insurance premium.The Centre uses the PMFBY tag by paying only 20% of the premium share. According to state officials, the CM has introduced a crop insurance scheme called Bangla Fasal Bima which is aimed at covering rabi crops, with the state bearing the entire cost of the premium. ""Now, when the CM has mentioned it, beneficiaries under PMFBY are likely to be transferred to the Bangla Fasal Bima scheme,"" a state official said.The CM also listed government bounties in the agricultural sector. ""We have abolished 'khajna' (land rent) on agricultural land. The owner of agricultural land doesn't have to pay a mutation fee to get it registered. We are giving farmer pensions to 1 lakh beneficiaries and have increased monthly pensions from Rs 750 to Rs 1,000,"" she said."

They pour liquor in their spraying machine, mix water and spray it on the crop  which they believe increases the size of the potato considerably and readies the crop in a shorter period of time. According to farmers, liquor works as insecticide on the cane crop. While the agriculture department authorities have denied that alcohol can help in potato production in any way, farmers are gung-ho about it.Lokesh Sharma, a farmer in Bohich village of Bulandshahr, said, One quarter of a country-made liquor bottle is sprayed on potato crop spread in 6 bighas. A quarter costs me Rs 50, and I have 10-acre land  so the cost comes to some Rs 500. This helps in increasing the size of the potato and the crop takes lesser time.However, the quantity of liquor per bigha varies from farmer to farmer.Gyani Singh, a farmer in Jamalpur village of Bulandshahr, said, When I first got to know about it, I was a little apprehensive. So, I tried it as an experiment in my field, I sprayed liquor on one bigha land and used fertilisers and insecticides on the remaining five bighas. I saw that the potatoes on which liquor was sprayed were bigger in size and grew in a shorter span in comparison with the potatoes on which liquor was not sprayed. That is when I was assured of liquor spray on the potato crop.Singh uses two quarter bottles of liquor on one bigha of land mixed with 10 litres of water.In Bijnor, liquor is being used as an alternative for costly pesticides.Dharmendra Singh, a farmer in Mandawar town, said, I have been spraying liquor on my sugarcane crop for the past some years and have found that it has a positive impact on the crop. Alcohol protects the crop from bacterial and fungal diseases.Bijnor is an agriculture-rich district. There is over 2.2 lakh hectare of sugarcane cultivation area while 6,000 hectares are under potato cultivation in the district.Agriculture scientists and officials have dismissed the farmers claims and have even warned them of the liquors harmful effects on the soil. Bulandshahr district agriculture officer Ashwani Kumar Singh said, There is no scientific research to support the claim a crop grows better if alcohol is sprayed on it. Farmers are unnecessarily wasting their money on liquor which in turn might harm the soil quality. I have asked the horticulture officer to look into the matter and spread awareness among farmers.Horticulturists have said that alcohol evaporates in 10 minutes and there is no scientific basis to believe that it will have any impact on the crop yield or its duration.Nonetheless, use of alcohol as a crop yield enhancer and an alternative for costly pesticides has been popular in various parts of Maharashtra where pests often cause considerable damage to crops. In parts of Haryana too, farmers have used liquor on brinjal crop for years."

But have you ever wondered how these dishes found their way to their festive menu? This Christmas, we trace the origin of a few traditional Kerala dishes that have been making the festival a delectable affair.According to veteran chef Rasheed Abdul Khader, Christmas fares are essentially Syrian Christian dishes, and there is nothing now that is exclusively cooked for the festive season. Once upon a time, those like appam, stew and more were made only on festive occasions, but that has changed now. Regardless, most of the Christian household dishes have a English or Dutch influence, he says.Appam, Rasheed says, is found to be born out of the Europeans efforts to make bread out of the ingredients available in this region. Instead of wheat and maida, they used rice, and instead of yeast for fermentation, which again is a Western practice, they used toddy. Even the appachatti is traditionally modelled after the Dutch oven, which heats the item from both sides, he explains.Meanwhile, renowned chef Roy Pothen and researcher-cum-chef Soju Philip from Kochi say that appam had its origins in Sri Lanka. As per records, South Indians who went to work in Sri Lanka brought it here, says Soju, while Roy adds, It is even cooked in more or less the same manner in Sri Lanka.According to Rasheed, the influence of the missionaries were equally prevalent in both Sri Lanka and Kerala, from whom the region borrowed the dish.The stew, that goes along with appam, is something that clearly has a European connection, though the stew prepared in Kerala is different in many ways. Soju says that it is the Jews in Kochi who introduced it to the Malayali community. There are many varieties of stews here and abroad and the Christians here just added coriander and garam masala powder to it, to make it their own, he says.Rasheed explains that instead of their practice of adding cream, we added coconut milk. Stew, similar to ours, can also be found in Sri Lanka. They call it white curry, says Rasheed. The original stew, meanwhile, is light and soup-like, different from how we cook it, says Roy, adding, We thickened the gravy to suit our taste, using potato and coconut, as per records.Many might have wondered how the authentic Kerala dish fish moilee has a surname that doesnt sound quite desi. Historical studies offer a variety of explanations for the same, the chefs say. Fish moilee again is said to have a Jewish and Anglo Indian influence and from there, those in regions like Kuttanad borrowed it and made it their own, explains Soju.However, Rasheed says that some of the veteran cooks of Kerala offer a different explanation too. In Western countries, North India and sometimes even in our region, there is a practice of naming a dish after the person who made it the first time. For example, the dishes like murg wajidali, chicken narengo and Birbal ka shorba. Many veteran chefs and regional cooks say that fish moilee is actually fish molly and it is named after a woman named Molly, who cooked it for the first time. It might sound too good to be true, but there are enough reasons to believe this as well, he says.Karimeen and chicken mappas are other sought-after items on the Christmas menu. Interestingly, the term mappas apparently originated from pappas. Soju says, I grew up in Kuttanad region and we still call it pappas. Pappas means potato in Portuguese and it simply refers to a curry in which potato is added.Rasheed has another interesting take. The term pappas also refers to Christmas papa. It is the dish for the papa and thus the name pappas, which later got tweaked as mappas, he explains, adding that our traditional duck roast is also a westernised preparation in which the meat is cooked dry in the oven along with potato like in the case of turkey.Despite their non-desi roots, these dishes continue to rule over our festive spreads and if their popularity is any indication, they arent going anywhere for long."

The growers are not coming forward to procure the crop from the cold stores due to very low prices and the cold store owners are worried over facing losses. The rent for storing potatoes at the cold stores is normally given at the end of the season in November, which is already over with no trace of potato growers at the cold stores.Nearly 4.5 lakh bags of 50kg each are still stored in the cold stores in Bathinda region, which has 35 cold stores with a capacity to store 30 lakh bags of potatoes. The seasonal rent charged from growers is Rs 100 per bag and nearly 20% is charged as advance and 80% is charged upon completion of season. Of the total produce, 30-35% is stored by traders, who eventually have to pay up to continue dealing with stores. The owners of cold stores aiming to create space in stores for fruits, dry fruits and other items for four months till March are expected to start throwing away the potatoes in a few days if the growers doesnt turn up to pick the produce. The season for storing potatoes is counted from March 1 to October 31, extendable up to November end with mutual understanding.Potato was grown on 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) in the last season in Bathinda area and 1.65 lakh metric tonne potato was produced. Nearly, 110 quintal of potatoes were grown in one acre. Potatoes are grown till middle of November and the harvesting is done in February end. Potato growers on their part are feeling highly aggrieved and feel they will have to incur losses. They claim that the input cost turns out to be nearly Rs 40,000 per acre whereas the potatoes are fetching only Rs 300 per quintal and the growers have failed to even cover the input cost.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon said that, Cold store owners are facing imminent losses. A 1 lakh bag capacity store has a running cost of nearly Rs 50 lakh per annum with Rs 35 lakh being spent on electricity. We charge rent from growers at the end of season, which seems doubtful this year due to losses faced by farmers. Another cold store owner Ramesh Kumar said that cold stores will have to incur losses with farmers not picking the produce. We will have to throw it away and face the cost of storing these, he added.Potato grower Jaspal Singh said that, The prices have crashed to Rs 3 per kilogram with which we failed to cover even the input costs. Most of the growers are not going to cold stores to pick the produce.Bathinda deputy director, horticulture , Gurkewal Singh Dhillon confirmed that potato growers were facing losses and due to it potatoes have been grown on over 10% less area as compared to previous year. Most of the growers not even are picking produce from cold stores."

Whats worse, some of the leftover stock of last year is still lying with them.The farmers claim that they are unable recover even their cost of production and harvesting as the price is down to Rs 3 per kg. When the harvesting of potatoes started, which are supplied directly in the market for domestic consumption, the price was at Rs 20-25 per kg. That was three weeks back, now it has crashed to Rs 3 a kg. While, Jalandhar is largely a seed producingbelt for the country, farmers here also harvest part of their crop for supplies in the local market, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.Cost of production, harvesting and packing ranges from Rs 6 to 8. With selling price tumbling to Rs 3, and would not be surprising if farmers start ploughing their produce in their fields, said Kulwant Singh of village Qadianwal on the outskirts of Jalandhar.He said that some part of the last year crop meant for supply as seeds was still lying with them. Market for us has just not revived since demonetization. For third year in a row, we are set to fave huge loses, he said.Demonetisation was announced in the days when season for receiving orders was about to start. After the announcement, we received no orders from traders. The entire business was based on cash transactions and our biggest buyer is West Bengal. Even 2015 was also not very good for us, but last two years have been the worst as our buyers from other states were left with little cash, he said.Village Uggi resident Gurdeep Singh said that while he would be harvesting his entire crop in February for supply as seeds to others states but some part of his last year crop was still lying with him.Meanwhile, Sangha said that they had last year demanded that export to Pakistan be opened in the summer. Pakistan does not have cold storage facility and in the summers there potato prices remain high and we could have finished our stocks of previous season by supplying the produce to Pakistan. Now, there would be no benefit as their own fresh crop would flood the market, he said.Since demonetization, there has been no reprieve for potato growers and they are continuing to suffer. We cant give up potato cultivation easily as we have invested on implements and appliances, said Sangha and Kulwant.When contacted, deputy director (horticulture) Satbir Singh confirmed that prices were low.Doaba belt of Punjab mainly produces potato seed for major parts of the country and they did not receive good returns on their produce in the last two years. In these days only a part of the crop is harvested for supplies to local markets and their prices have also come down after the glut in the market, he said."

It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."

Earlier, it was confined to Rohtas and Kaimur, but the farmers of Patna and Nalanda districts have also started stubble burning, which must be stopped at all costs, the CM said after inspecting the contract potato farming model by women self-help groups at Sonbarsa in East Champaran.The CM asked Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project CEO Balamurugan D to take Jeevika didis help in creating awareness against stubble burning.Speaking at Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi, the CM said the state government had already decided to open an engineering college in each district and paramedical colleges and polytechnic colleges in each sub-divisional headquarters for imparting technical education to the deprived sections of society.He said the government under him opened 22,000 new schools in remote villages but 12.5% children were still out of the education system and most of them belonged to the unprivileged sections.He recounted how his government schemes like poshak and cycle yojana, student credit card and scholarship initiatives minimized the dropout rate of girls students in schools.Earlier, the CM unveiled two busts of late Rameshwar Mahto and Mahavir Prasad on the Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi. While Rameshwar was the father of former minister Awadhesh Prasad Kushwaha, Mahavir was the father of district BJP chief Rajendra Prasad Gupta. Nitish also inaugurated the first digital panchayat of the district and a panchayat bhawan in Sonbarsa.Ministers Pramod Kumar, Rana Randhir Singh and Vinod Narayan Jha were also present on the occasion."

Every year, sometime in autumn, our two friends take us out to dinner to a place that they recommend, or one that we want to go to. This time we were late in keeping our date  thanks to my own preoccupations. But then, a few nights ago, we met at a restaurant they suggested  Tres in the Lodhi Colony Market  and had a good time together.Tres opened up some years ago and there was a time when everyone was talking about it. But this and that happened, and somehow I never went there. I was disappointed when I heard that it had shut down. Then, some weeks ago, it opened again  much to my joy.It is a cosy place, with the right kind of lights, though perhaps not the right kind of chairs. Their servers are cheerful and eager to help. The prices are on the higher side (a meal for two should cost about Rs. 3,000) but the menu is interesting. For starters, we asked for king prawn and kalamari with radish cucumber salad, smoked duck breast with peppered barley kimchi and Josper-baked Camembert with red grape and pepper preserve and grilled sourdough.For mains, our friends had the tenderloin steak with a baked potato mash, wilted greens and sauted mushroom, my wife asked for the pork belly (from the small plates section) and I, the crispy skin salmon fillet. For dessert, there was tiramisu.The starters were superb. I am not allowed to eat much cheese, but Camembert is one of my favourites, so I had a bit of that, and sang that old Hindi film song, Tu cheez badi hai mast mast to myself. A Josper oven is a grill-cum-oven, and helps professional chefs control temperatures to a t. The cheese was just right, I thought  neither too melty, nor too hard. The red grape and pepper preserve added to the taste, as did the grilled sourdough.Crunchy and tangyThe prawns and calamari were crunchy and tangy, and had been tossed with a lime chilli drizzle. I liked the smoked duck breast, too. The salty taste was balanced by a ginger plum gel and herbed salad.My salmon fillet with a crispy skin was excellent. It came with dill risotto and charred morning glory, but I concentrated solely on the fish. The fish had been cooked just right  so it was neither flaky, nor rubbery. The pork belly, I am told, was delicious. I am not allowed red meat yet (I am still trying to convince my doctors that in some quarters, pork is not considered red) so I could only look at it with sad eyes. It was served with a vegetable marmalade, which complemented the taste of the pork belly while the pickled mustard seeds gave it a nice and sweet kick (or so I was told).What was really disappointing was the tenderloin that my two friends were so looking forward to. They wanted the steak medium rare, but it was pretty tough and they had to struggle with their steak knives. I tried a piece and found it much too chewy. To top it, they charged extra for the truffle oil that the steak came with. That, I thought, was rather mean.The deconstructed tiramisu  mascarpone mousse, Kahlua jelly, coffee soaked savoiardi sponge and chocolate crisps  was okay. I am not much into tiramisus, and I would have preferred it constructed rather than deconstructed.But on the plus side, we were together, and I was dining out after a while. The steak apart, it was a nice meal, and it was good to be with close friends. There is something to be said about tradition, after all."

She said that it develops due to bad nutrition.Dr Kotchea was speaking at the 8th World Ayurveda Congress organized in the city. The four-day event, taking place in the city for the first time, will conclude on December 17.Majority of the diseases occur due to our deviation from normal practices of living, eating and exercise, she said. Compared to allopathy, Ayurveda looks at diabetes with a different perspective  we never ask the patient to stop consuming ghee or oil as it increases vaat prakriti, causing further problems. We also advise two meals and nothing in between. The meal has to be taken at 9-10 am in the morning and around 7.30 pm in the evening. The person can take fruits or juice.She suggested Trikonasana, Chakrasana and Dhanurasana in asana and practice of Bhramari and Kalapbhati pranayam.One should not have chapati, rice and potato together. If you are eating one, avoid the other two for the day. We also suggest use of coarse grains such as pearl millet, corn, jowar, etc. in making of chapatis, she said. One should keep changing the grains for the maximum health benefit.Dr Gurudatta Amin, a diabetes expert from a Mumbai, said that they have devised a concept of diet kit and the patients are advised to reduce their food intake at 800 calories daily.Along with techniques like Panchkarma, diet control seems to have the best effect on the diabetes patients , he said. In many cases, we also see the reversal. The patients have to follow the regime. More and more India-based Ayurvedic facilities are conducting scientific research in the field with increased interest from foreign scholars who look at the method as complementing conventional remedies."

Over 130 food stalls from 26 states are spread, rather randomly, across the complex.You can end up gorging on the regular and the familiar  pao bhaji, masala dosa, aaloo tikki, chholey bhature, pizza, momo, chowmein, honey chilly potato  and miss out on the joy of being surprised.How about Jaipurs tandoori chai? Watching it being prepared and served is a fascinating experience. Or, eating pathar ka gosht, chunks of chicken cooked on stone.Theres much more, if your palate enjoys the thrill of the unusual. At stall 43, you can wolf down Malabar snacks such as meat pathiri (fried pastry filled with chicken), chicken cutlet and chicken cake, which looks and feels more like a quiche. Then theres kilikoodu (birds nest), a famous iftaar dish of the region, which wasnt available in the evening but stall owner Mohd Ali of Calicut promised to serve it during the weekend.To counter the general perception that street food is unhygienic, National Association of Street vendors of India (NASVI) organised a day-long programme on hygiene and cleanliness.About 500 vendors attended the training conducted by FSSAI. At the festival, all vendors and cooks wore plastic gloves.One of them was Sanjiv Gupta, who makes uncommon omelettes, some as large as an eight-inch pizza. His cheese-chicken omelette (Rs 240) is a complete meal. Setting up a stall at a food festival like this establishes your identity, makes you known to a wider group of people, says Gupta, who owns a stall in Dwarka-7.Some years back, litti-chokha used to be a top draw in the Bihar pavilion at the annual trade fair because it wasnt readily available in the capital. That was then. Now Bihars most well-known dish is served both in modest pushcarts and swish restaurants across the city. But Devi Prasad of Patnas Kanker Bagh colony has come up with a sizzling non-vegetarian variation of what was once a poor mans staple: chicken-litti. In Prasads concoction, the litti and the chicken are not offered separately but sloshed together in a fierce curry on a hotplate and served for Rs 180 at stall 55. I sell one quintal of chicken every day between 4pm and 9.30pm in Patna, he says.Patori, served with kadhi, is a popular snack in Nagpur. Prakash Vyas (stall 78), who has brought the dish to the festival, explains what makes it different, if not special. Patori is a deep-fried pastry stuffed with coriander leaves, peanuts and sesame seeds. Its a rare dish that serves coriander leaves as a stuffing rather than as a chutney, says Vyas.An Afghan stall provides international flavour. Mantoo, the Afghan variation of the momo, is topped with curd and split chickpea lentil (chana dal). It is on offer along with kabuli, the traditional Afghan pilaf served with raisins.An interesting sidelight is Bapus Thali, four items that Mahatma Gandhi loved to eat. For Gandhi, food was about fulfilling a need, not satiating a desire. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but to keep the body going, he once said. At the festival, theres a small exhibition outlining his philosophy of nutrition. To summarise it in five simple points, it goes: Eat to live, raw is good, eat more greens, whole grain is good and chewing is essential. Between 1 and 3 pm, you can sample Bapus thali for Rs 60. It comprises four dishes: Gujarati snack muthiya, sprouts cutlet, millet khichadi and ragi-teesi laddoo, with jaggery as a sweetener."

He was intervening on the reply given by rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, to a call to attention notice raised by MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala. Amarinder said the state had already raised with the Centre the demand for allowing export of potatoes and sugar to Russia, UAE, Iran and Sri Lanka for fetching better prices of these crops. He said that once the Centre gives clearance to the state government for export of these crops, the farmers would immensely benefit in terms of lucrative returns and assured marketability of their produce."

The former deputy CM said earlier paddy farmers had to suffer a loss of Rs 1,100 crore because the government postponed paddy transplantation and the same resulted in lower yields.The SAD chief said, At present, potato farmers are suffering with their crop selling for less than Re 1 per kilogram but the government is not making any effort to rescue them. The state farmers were being subjected to kurki, he said, adding that Captain Amarinder Singh had fooled people with the slogan karja, kurki khatam, fasal ki poori rakam in the run-up to the last assembly elections.Addressing the mediapersons in the legislative assemblys press lounge, Sukhbir flagged various other issues where the state government had alleged failed like social welfare schemes for which Rs 55 crore was pending towards shagun beneficiaries. He also highlighted the delay in clearance of post-matric scholarship and old age pensions, pendency of four instalments of dearness allowance amounting to Rs 4,000 crore to state government employees, and delay in implementation of the pay commission since two years.Audit system for DSGMC fundsSAD president Sukhbir Badal on Friday claimed that once a new committee of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) was elected, a complete audit system would be put in place to check gurdwara funds embezzlement. Sukhbir had on Thursday dissolved his partys Delhi unit, which ruled the DSGMC. On the same day, a Delhi court had ordered FIR against SAD leader and DSGMC ex-president Manjit Singh GK and other officials in Rs 51 lakh gurdwara fund embezzlement case."

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

During the lunar day, also lasting 14 earth days, temperatures soar as high as 127 C (261 F).The rover's instruments must withstand those fluctuations and it must generate enough energy to sustain it during the long night.Yutu conquered those challenges and, after initial setbacks, ultimately surveyed the moon's surface for 31 months. Its success provided a major boost to China's space programme.Beijing is planning to send another lunar lander, Chang'e-5, next year to collect samples and bring them back to earth.It is among a slew of ambitious Chinese targets, which include a reusable launcher by 2021, a super-powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle, a moon base, a permanently crewed space station, and a Mars rover.""Our country's successful lunar exploration project not only vaults us to the top of the world's space power ranks, it also allows the exploration of the far side of the moon,"" said Niu Min, an expert on China's space programme.The project, he said in an interview with local website Netease, ""greatly inspires everyone's national pride and self-confidence""."

In a statement, Venugopal Dharmalingam, honorary director of the NDC, said that such a move appears to be ignorant of the fact that potato cultivation is two centuries old this year and potato research in the district is a century old.The NDC stated that farmers in the Nilgiris were increasingly shifting to cultivation of potatoes and other vegetables due to uncertainties surrounding the tea industry, and as such, any outbreak of diseases that would hamper vegetable cultivation should be prevented.Mr. Venugopal said that potato cultivation was now two centuries old and that the Government Agricultural Research Station in 1917 at Nanjanad was established to provide quality seeds. Over 30 years of research by brilliant agricultural graduates, several popular, high yielding varieties of potatoes such as the Great Scot, Royal Kidney, Bencruachan, Kerrys Pink Edward, Golden Wonder and Bressie were developed at the Nanjanad farm. The researchers also developed a fertilizer called the Nanjanad Mixture which remained the standard manure for years, he said.He added that the potato was almost wiped out from the Nilgiris by a European disease known as the Late Blight which first broke out in Darjeeling in the 1880s. The survival of the potato since then has largely been due to the work done by the subsidiary of the Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, set up in 1957 at Muthorai in the Nilgiris."

Yashpal was arrested from his home in Mahisagar on Wednesday night by Mahisagar police and handed over to the Gandhinagar police. Nilesh Patel, a coaching centre owner, and two other key accused are still on the run, said a police official.According to the police, despite strict warning and a watch kept by bouncers of the Delhi-based gang, Yashpal managed to sneak out of the hideout with a hand-written answer key in a potato wafer packet.SP, Gandhinagar, Mayur Chavda said the gang members have been identified and they would be arrested soon. A group of 28 candidates were taken to Delhi by Nilesh Patel to memorise the answer key of the question paper set for the Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) recruitment. The key was leaked probably by a mole in the printing press located in South India. The group was asked not to take with them any written material.The candidates were first driven to Gurugram in four vehicles and from there in other vehicles. The vehicles were driven for about hour and half in the dark through several roads to avoid the route being tracked by the candidates. They were then taken in groups of four to five each to different locations, some of which were auto garages, makeshift metal sheds and under-construction houses, said Chavda.On directions of Nilesh Patel and Indravadan, Yashpalsinh tore the piece of paper given to each candidate by the gang to practice the answers and copied the answers. He then hid it in a wafer packet. Yashpalsinh was frisked by the bouncers when he was leaving the venue but they couldnt detect the paper in the wafer packet, added Chavda.Yashpal flew back to Vadodara on the ticket booked by Rajendra Vaghela and Indravadan. He gave the handwritten answer key of the LRD exam paper to Indravadan, who used to work initially as a medical representative and then as a distributor, Chavda said.Indravadan allegedly sold the answer key to several candidates for Rs 5 lakh each in Vadodara and nearby areas. The answer key is suspected to be sold in Ahmedabad, Surat, Siddhpur, Patan and other areas of North Gujarat, added an investigator. Chavda said they would write to different recruitment boards to blacklist the candidates who had got the leaked answer key."

Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday against the closure of the Central Potato Research Station (CPRS) at Muthorai in the Nilgiris.After media reports suggested that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) decided to shut it down, he said: The closure of the CPRS at Udhagamandalam will have a detrimental impact on the interest of the potato farmers of this State and entire South India.Potatoes are primarily grown in the hilly districts of Dindigul, the Nilgiris, Krishnagiri and Erode, covering nearly 5,500 hectare.The CPRS, founded in 1957, has been serving potato farmers for the past 70 years in coordination with the State as well as with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU).This is the only station in South India researching potato cyst nematode and potato early blight which were major diseases affecting potato cultivation and help the farmers to keep these maladies in check and grow the crop profitably, the Chief Minister said.Cost of cultivationThe Central Potato Research Station was one of the two Institutes where potato farmers were getting disease-free seeds.If the research station was closed, farmers in south India would have to depend on the Potato Research Station at Jalandhar, Punjab to access disease-free planting materials, which in turn will increase the cost of cultivation.Moreover, the varieties of north India are not suitable for the south, he added. Mr. Palaniswami asked the Prime Minister to direct the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research not to close the station.Only station in South India researching diseases affecting the crop and helping farmersEdappadi K.

Reasserting this horrendous truth, Harvard professor Eric Rimm has formulated the ideal serving size for French fries -- six. Yes, SIX scanty sticks of delightful potato goodness.According to reports, Rimm calls a French fry a ""starch bomb"" and says there is no healthy amount to be had. There arent a lot of people who are sending back three-quarters of an order of French fries, Rimm told The New York Times.I think it would be nice if your meal came with a side salad and six French fries, he added.But never mind that fried, starchy potatoes may lead to health issues like obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.COIMBATORE: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) decision to shut down the Central Potato Research Institute at Muthorai in Udhagamandalam has sent shock waves among the scientific and agricultural research community in the region.The institute, which is known for its pivotal role in developing potato varieties resistant to cyst nematodes and white blight, is the only research institute for this staple vegetable in South India.The institute was founded in 1957 to serve the potato growing region in the hill station. The centre is known for its work in constantly developing pest-resistant varieties of potatoes. We are continuing to do so. A variety which does not get affected by pests will automatically provide a high yield, head of the institute Venkatasalam said.When crops get affected by pests like late blight and nematodes, it eats away almost 80% to 90% of their yield, he said. If they shut down this cesntre, this whole region will become sick again, he said.The centre, which has 12 permanent staff and around 60 to 70 contractual staff, is working on projects for quality seed production, different cropping systems and crop production.The institute is equipped with a hi-tech laboratory, seed production and multiplication facilities and 45 acres of land. We do not know what ICARs plans are regarding the institute and 12 research scientists, said another senior scientist. The only institutes from where farmers can get good quality seeds of resistant varieties are Jalandhar and Ooty . If they close this institute down, then Jalandhar will be the only option left and those seeds may not be well suited for the South Indian region, said Venkatasalam.The seeds we breed in this institute are more suited for this region, he added.Senior horticulture officer in Coimbatore Uma said even today with sale of potato seeds from Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand being banned because of the nematode problem, it is the potato research centre in Ooty that is being looked to for guidance because they have been dealing with the problem from 1961. They had advocated kufri giridari, a nematode resistant variety.During a review meeting conducted by the ICAR in October, they had reportedly taken a decision to ensure each crop had only one research centre and shut institutes studying crops which were not preferred, like tobacco.The regional centres included CPRI in Muthorai, Ooty. The decisions taken at the meeting came out through WhatsApp and reached us. But it is official. But we do not know the time frame, confirmed Venkatasalam."
