This included nearly 3,000 hectares of coffee plantation, 1,500 hectares of vegetables such as carrot, beans, garlic and peas, 1,000 hectares of hill banana and 1,000 hectares of potato and nearly 300 hectares of pepper vines.Deputy director (in-charge) of horticulture for Kodaikanal, K Narayanasamy said that this was apart from the nearly 1,500 hectares (3,706 acres) horticultural produce such as coffee, banana, pepper and vegetables destroyed in the plains  especially at Adalur and Pandrimalai that come under Dindigul region.Horticulture department officials said the final stage of data entry is being done and the work would be completed by this weekend. A sum of Rs 500 has been fixed as compensation to clear a tree. Officials said that farmers cultivating vegetables and banana on dry land dependent on rains would get Rs 7,410 per hectare and those irrigating their fields would get Rs 13,500 per hectare.Farmers with smaller landholding will get a minimum compensation of Rs 1,000 and the maximum compensation per farmer is Rs 36,000 even if the farm holding is manifold bigger. Perennial crops such as coffee and pepper will get a compensation of Rs 18,000 per hectare, where the minimum compensation will be Rs 2,000 per farmer. Maximum compensation has been fixed at Rs 36,000.Officials said that heavy rains close to 150mm and 200mm that lashed the hills when the cyclone crossed the region caused landslides badly damaging terrace cultivation on nearly 125 acres. On Tuesday, assessment of terrace cultivation due to landslides in Upper Kodaikanal Hills will be undertaken by a team comprising officials from all government departments. Efforts will be taken to compensate or help affected farmers rebuild it, he added.Farmers have strongly criticized the compensation, saying that it would not even make up the seed cost for plantation. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) state secretary V Asokan said that vegetables are mostly grown in the upper hill where most farmers own as small as 50 cents to four acres. We need 300kg garlic seed per acre (750kg per hectare) at Rs 200 per kg, he said. He also pointed out that the seed input cost per hectare is Rs 1.5 lakh whereas compensation announced by the government is just 9% (Rs 13,500)."

So, a huge amount of potatoes reach the market  much more than the demand  and have to be sold off at distress-price levels. In December 2016, the retail prices dropped to a ridiculous Rs 2.50 per kg.Farmers, who incur huge losses, then strike back in February-March, controlling the amount being released to the market. This inadequate supply always leads to a price surge. Potatoes were sold at retail prices of up to Rs 30 a kg in March 2017.The governments move this year, say officials, is likely to stabilise retail prices.The minister for agricultural marketing, Tapan Dasgupta, told TOI: Potato prices rise in January-February and to control the surge, we have decided to extend the storage facility by another month to maintain a price balance.Though the state production of 8.5 million tonnes this year is higher than the annual requirement of 6.5 million tonnes, poor supply management keeps prices high at the beginning of the year. In the last three years, we have produced a huge quantity of potatoes, but we noticed that before the new produce hits the market in February, there is a shortage of supply. For the last two years, we have been trying to develop an effective demandsupply management system so that the price remains stable. This year, we hope to keep the price under control, Dasgupta said.Asked about this, agriculture minister Ashis Banerjee said: We still have 11.5 lakh metric tonnes of potato in the cold stores and that is enough for three months. If we can manage the supply effectively people will not face any problem. Asked about the maintenance of the cold stores, Banerjee said: They will have enough time.The state government still has a spot of bother  the huge difference between the retail and wholesale prices. When the Jyoti variety of potato is sold at a wholesale price of Rs 7 per kg, it hits the market at Rs 16 to Rs 18 per kg.It is true that we are getting good prices but the middleman are pushing up retail price. There are no checks and balances. This has created a gap between the wholesale and retail prices, Tapan Samanta, a farmer who has been cultivating potatoes for the last 40 years, said. When asked about it, Dasgupta said: We will control retail prices also but before that we need to ensure that farmers get their due and the supply line is fine."

May not be able to contact after one or two days... Local security hired by company are armed. They are with locals only."" It's an anguished cry for help from Neeraj Raghuvanshi, one of the seven employees of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd held hostage by unpaid workers in Ethiopia Raghuvanshi, who TOI managed to contact, has been surviving on a diet of rice and potato for the last six days, with little help from his company. His colleagues, C Chandra Sekhar and KP Singh, who have managed to stay free in Addis Ababa, said the situation was very grim and they feared water supply would be snapped in the next few days. The seven employees are under ""house arrest"" and are not being allowed to venture out of their rooms, said one of their colleagues.Raghuvanshi, Sekhar and Singh are part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction.They are now facing the consequences of the mismanagement of former IL&FS chief Ravi Parthsarathy and his ousted team of executives. The Indian expats themselves have not been paid salaries for months, with some of the dues dating back to April.With funds drying up, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has terminated the contracts and there is a fear that the joint venture may leave behind unpaid dues.IL&FS Transportation Network was unable to pay salary to its 500-600 local staff in October and the dues for November, too, have piled up. The demand is for an immediate payment of around $300,000. ""But the problem will not stop there. Under local laws, the company has to offer severance packages for six months and there are unpaid dues of vendors,"" Chandra Sekhar, the country coordinator for ITNL Elsamex JV told TOI.What has compounded the problem is that even Ethiopian authorities are worried that the company may not clear its dues, creating distress in the African country as the local employees are very poor and depend solely on their salaries for survival.While the problem has been building up, the IL&FS management has refused to provide any help, alleged some of the employees taken hostage. IL&FS refused to comment on the hostage crisis, with a company executive saying that the issue was being handled by the external affairs ministry."

Let Karam (trade) follow Dharam (religion). Our only wish is that Wagah is opened for trade. It holds immense potential for Punjab and for other neighbouring states as well as for Pakistani Punjab, said Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, chairman of Punjab chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce.Industry sources said that due to restrictions only a few items can be sent through land route. Importers and exporters on both sides have to send or receive items through sea route. First industrialists from Punjab send products through Kandla (Gujarat) or Nhava Sheva (Maharashtra) ports to Dubai from where these are sent to Karachi port and then to Punjab in Pakistan. What can reach there just by covering 40-50 km covers thousands of kilometres. It would not only help the business thrive but the environmental impact would also be good with things reaching there through very short route, he added.An exhibition and trade fair is being organized by the chamber from December 6 to 10 at Amritsar. It was started in 2005, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. This is the 13th edition of the fair,Sachdeva said.However, earlier exchange of business delegations was better. For the last three years, both the countries are not giving visas easily. This time also we are getting only 4-5 exhibitors directly who have SAARC visas and others would be holding their stalls through their local contacts or dealers. The businessmen from there now have stopped applying for visas as the wait for visa was being made torturous, Sachdeva revealed.Echoing similar sentiments Chamber of Industry and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, whose unit at Ludhiana manufactures auto components, farm machinery and bicycle components, said that there was immense potential of trade with Pakistan. We have been demanding for the last 20 years that trade with Pakistan should be opened, he said.Trade with Pakistan holds key to huge markets further and Punjab cen benefit from it immensely, said Hand Tools Manufacturing Association secretary Ashwani Vitcor.Farmers also raise voiceIf export of potatoes is allowed to Pakistan then all the growers can be saved, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha. Here we are going in losses for third consecutive year while prices of potato are very good in Pakistan. We are not getting orders from Indian market and opening Pakistan can save the situation, he added."

The phenomenon is a throwback to previous years when farmers had dumped huge stock of potatoes on the streets of Deesa or fed them to cattle due to plummeting returns.This year, the demand from states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra has slumped over the last fortnight and the prices of potatoes have fallen by 20-30%. As a result, nearly 40 lakh bags (each containing 50 kg potatoes) are lying in the 200 cold storages in and around Deesa. The prices have fallen from Rs 1,000 per quintal to Rs 700-Rs 800 per quintal in the last fortnight, said Ganpat Kachwa, president of Cold Storage Owners Association.If the same position persists and the stock does not get cleared by the end of December, prices will plummet further and the farmers will have no go but to repeat what they do as a mark of protest - dumping their stock or donating it to cattle-sheds (gaushala), Kachwa told TOI. As a mark of protest, all storages had observed a bandh on November 18.However, the sources in agriculture department say that the total cultivation may not be at par with 2017 when the tuber was sown in nearly 66,000 hectare area. This year, the sowing has begun and, by November 22, the cultivation was completed in 37,755 hectares. During the corresponding period last year, the cultivation was done on around 40,000 hectare land in Banaskantha district.Deputy director of agriculture P K Patel said the cultivation usually gets over by first week of December."

Once you press the lotus button here, you elect a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh and automatically a BJP-led Narendra Modi government returns to power in 2019, Shah told a rally in Madhya Pradeshs Balaghat.Shouldnt it be done? One vote, double sarkar (two governments)? Will you do it or not? Shah asked the crowd repeatedly till it responded with a yes.Many party leaders in Delhi felt that with this line, Shah had linked Modis fate with the outcome in the state polls. If Shah is saying a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh will automatically elect a Modi government in 2019, then the converse should also be true, said a BJP leader, who is feeling sidelined under the current regime.Shah had put Modis image at stake in a desperate bid to pull off a victory in the state, they said.The BJP president, who is leading the election campaign from the front, addressed four rallies and undertook one road show in Madhya Pradesh that votes on November 28.Many others in the BJP, however, argued that Shah was tapping into Modis popularity to offset the impact of anti-incumbency the three-term-old BJP government in the state was facing. Party leaders believe that Modis personal credibility among voters was still very high and that people would think twice before voting for the Congress if they thought the BJPs defeat in the state would hurt his chances in 2019.Despite accumulated grievances with the BJP governments, voters preference for Modi in 2019 is overwhelming. No voter in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh wants Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister, another BJP leader said, describing Shahs strategy as clever.In all three states voting now  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh  the BJP has gone into the election by projecting the face of the respective chief ministers, not Modi, in contrast to previous Assembly polls. The billboards and posters are dominated by the faces of the chief ministers, with Modi and Shah in inset. Modi is not carpet-bombing the states with his rallies, as in past elections.However, as the poll dates draw closer in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, party managers seem to be realising the need to pitch Modis name. Shah, party leaders said, fears that a debacle in this round of polls would damage the BJPs prospects in 2019.In his poll speeches, Shah repeatedly tore into Rahul Gandhi for his pro-farmer pitch, indicating the Congress presidents stand on farmers issues and rural distress could be hurting the BJP. Rahul is going around saying farmers, farmers. What does he know about agriculture? Does he know whether potato grows over or under the ground or is it manufactured in factories? Shah said. He even challenged Rahul to come up with the names of 5 Rabi and 5 Kharif crops.Rahuls chowkidar chor hai slogan and Opposition unity also appeared to dominate Shahs mind. He likened the coming together of the Opposition parties to that of thieves on bail. Thieves who went to jail caught by a chowkidar have come out to cry chowkidar chor hai. People, however, aware of everything and they will elect the chowkidar once again for their safety and security, Shah said."

And if we delay their payments or default, then our regular workers dont turn up for work in the next season. We also need cash to buy diesel for pumps, to hire tractor and for other inputs, he says.Now, the government has allowed part cash payment.The anger among farmers that the Congress wants to exploit can be seen from 40-year-old Sanjay Yadav, a potato grower in Simrol.We will vote against this government as they have made our lives miserable. Everything is more expensive  diesel, fertilizer, sand for construction. But when we go to sell our produce, what do we get? We get anything between Rs. 2-4 a kg. There has to be change this election, he says.The note ban has ruined the lives of our farmers. Now they dont have enough money to buy even seeds. But Modi ji continues to mock the misfortune of our farmers. Even his own Agriculture Ministry has admitted that demonetisation broke the back of farmers, tweeted Mr. Gandhi on Wednesday to underscore the findings of a panel on agriculture.Decisive factorOf the 230 Assembly seats, rural and semi-rural voters can be a decisive factor in 160.It is this constituency of voters that the Congress is targeting with its promise of Karza maaf, bijli ka bill half aur BJP saaf (Loan will be waived off, electricity will be halved and BJP will be wiped out).All this is pre-election promise, but the reality is always different. We are small farmers who neither get loans from banks nor any waiver benefit, says Arun Gawli, another farmer in Simrol."

I was reminded, well, not of the story, but of the title when we sat down to dinner at Rustoms  a restaurant that serves delicious Parsi food in the Capital  a few nights ago. You could have named our table Seven Hungry Men and Women.I was just making a list of all that we ate, and felt rather embarrassed. We ordered enough for a party of 15. And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."

Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

Later, hundreds of protesters entered the bottom of the street dotted with luxury shops where the palace is located  and where Macron lives  before being pushed back by security forces with shields.In a similar scenario, police cleared out the huge traffic circle around the Arc de Triomphe, paralyzed for hours by protesters.French Interior Ministry officials counted nearly 283,000 protesters, mostly peaceful, throughout the day at more than 2,000 sites, some setting bonfires or flying balloons.However, some demonstrations turned violent. In Troyes, southeast of Paris, about 100 people invaded the prefecture, the local representation of the state, damaging the inside, Interior Ministry officials said. In Quimper, in Brittany, security forces used water cannon to disperse hostile protesters.The protester who died, a 63-year-old woman, was killed when a driver caught in the blockade accelerated in a panic at Pont-de-Beauvoisin, near Chambery, in eastern France, according to Louis Laugier, the prefect, or top state official, in the Savoie region. A confrontation with protesters ""got heated up for no reason"" and the driver accelerated her minivan after ""people started rattling her car,"" a protester who witnessed the incident told BFMTV, identifying himself only as Philippe. He said the woman told them she was taking her daughter to a doctor.An investigation into the death was opened.Eight of the 227 people injured were in serious condition, ministry officials said at an evening briefing, without providing details. A police officer and a firefighter who intervened when protesters attacked a closed service station were among the eight.A total of 117 people were arrested with 73 of them held for questioning.The protesters had pledged to target tollbooths, roundabouts and other strategic traffic sites. They called themselves ""yellow jackets"" because most were wearing the fluorescent yellow vests that must be kept in vehicles of all French drivers in case of car troubles.The daughter of the woman killed called for calm as she protested in Cavaillon, in southern France.""I really want people not to let themselves become submerged by anger,"" Alexandrine Mazet told RTL radio. ""The yellow jackets must understand this is a peaceful movement,"" she said. The young woman appeared later on BFMTV still wearing her yellow vest.The nationwide protest was unusual because it arose from within the citizenry, backed neither by unions nor politicians, although some took part in a clear bid for supporters. It was unclear whether the upstart movement, without a leader, would survive, and what problems it might pose for Macron.The grassroots nature of the protests, which drew supporters angry over an array of issues, made it a political hot potato for Macron's government. Security officials treaded lightly, ordering police to use dialogue rather than force but to stop protesters from completely blocking major routes or endangering lives or property. About 30 canisters of tear gas were fired to disperse protesters at the entrance of the Mont Blanc tunnel.""They have sent a message,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. ""It is heard. The government is attentive to all demonstrations and, of course, we must continue to answer the expectations of the French including those about their purchasing power.""The planned increase in fuel taxes, notably for diesel fuel, spoke to those French who feel the president has asked ordinary citizens to make the largest efforts in his bid to transform France. Those French who have a hard time making ends meet often rely on cheaper diesel fuel.Macron wants to close the gap between the price of diesel fuel and gasoline as part of his strategy to wean France off fossil fuels. A ""carbon trajectory"" calls for continued increases. Taxes on diesel fuel have risen 7 euro cents (nearly 8 U.S. cents) and are to keep climbing in the coming years, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne has said. The tax on gasoline is to increase 4 euro cents.Many drivers see this as emblematic of a presidency they view as disconnected from day-to-day economic difficulties and serving the rich.Macron's popularity has plunged, hovering around 30 percent. Robert Tichit, 67, a retiree, referred to the president as ""King Macron.""""We've had enough of it. There are too many taxes in this country,"" he said.More than 1,000 protesters congregated at the Place de la Concorde at the bottom of the Champs-Elysees, shouting ""Macron resign"" as police looked on."

Even in minute amounts, they help make potato chips tasty or give fruit candy that twang.The food system we have is unimaginable without flavour additives, said Nadia Berenstein, a historian of flavour science based in New York.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is giving companies two years to purge products using any of these six artificial flavours even though the FDA made clear it believes the ingredients are safe in the trace amounts they are used.The six artificial flavours in question, with names like methyl eugenol, benzophenone, ethyl acrylate and pyridine, are used to create cinnamon or spicy notes, fruity or minty flavours, or even hints of balsamic vinegar.The FDA and the Flavour and Extract Manufacturers Association, an industry group, did not respond when asked for examples of products the six ingredients are used in.But they noted in statements that the compounds have natural counterparts in foods like basil, coffee, grapes and peppermint, and that the action does not affect the naturally derived versions.The FDA said it had to order the artificial versions out of the food supply because of a lawsuit by consumer advocacy groups that cited a 60-year-old regulation that prohibits additives shown to have caused cancer in animals, even if tested at doses far higher than what a person would consume."
5ce6e0eee8e3fc56af415aa3,WPI inflation hits 4-month high; RBI may maintain status quo in next policy review,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wpi-inflation-rises-to-5-28-pc-in-oct-on-costlier-fuel/articleshow/66616862.cms,2018-11-14,"NEW DELHI: Inflation-based on wholesale prices spiked to a four-month high of 5.28 per cent in October mainly due to rise in fuel prices, but the RBI is likely to maintain status quo in its next monetary policy review as crude prices and currency are stabilising.The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.13 per cent in September and 3.68 per cent in October last year.Food articles witnessed softening of prices with deflation at 1.49 per cent in October, against 0.21 per cent September, government data released on Wednesday showed.Vegetables too became cheaper with deflation at 18.65 per cent in October, compared to 3.83 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in 'fuel and power' basket in October spiked to 18.44 per cent, from 16.65 per cent in September. Individually, in petrol and diesel it was 19.85 per cent and 23.91 per cent, respectively, and for liquified petroleum gas (LPG) it was 31.39 per cent during October.The WPI inflation is in contrast to the retail or consumer price index-based inflation data released earlier this week. The October CPI inflation had cooled to a year-low of 3.31 per cent.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the uptick in the WPI inflation in October reflected the impact of the pass through of higher commodity prices and the rupee depreciation. The disinflation in food prices had a much smaller impact on wholesale inflation than the CPI, given the difference in weights for food items in the two indices.""Despite the change in the monetary policy stance to calibrated tightening and the uptick in the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears likely to maintain a status quo on the repo rate in the December 2018 policy review, following the decline in the October 2018 headline CPI inflation, the deep correction in crude oil prices, and the pullback in the INR,"" Nayar said.The RBI is scheduled to come out with its fifth bi-monthly policy review statement on December 5.She said that the easing in the crude oil prices and the recent strengthening of the rupee, would keep WPI inflation range bound between 4.5-5 per cent in October-March period.Nayar said the core WPI inflation hardened to a three-month high of 5.1 per cent in October, reflecting the impact of the rupee depreciation on the landed price of imports.""While the uptick in both the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018 warrants some caution, the recent pullback in the rupee and crude oil prices has softened the risks to the inflation trajectory,"" she added.The Indian rupee had touched the record closing low of 74.39 in October, and ended the month with total losses of 104 paise or 1.43 per cent due to a strengthening dollar, firming oil prices and trade worries. Since then the currency has recovered and is now trading around 72.2 to a dollar.Brent crude, the international benchmark, was trading around USD 76.25 per barrel in October. The brent crude futures is now trading at USD 65 to a barrel.To cushion the impact of global fuel price rise, the government had, with effect from October 5, cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre and asked state-owned oil firms to subsidise the fuel by another Re 1 a litre.The 5.28 per cent inflation is the highest in four months, and a higher inflation than this level was last seen in June at 5.68 per cent.Among food articles, potato prices continued to rule high with 93.65 per cent WPI inflation in October. While onion witnessed deflation of 31.69 per cent; the same for pulses stood at 13.92 per cent.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mainly takes into account retail inflation data while formulating monetary policy.In its fourth monetary policy review for the fiscal, released last month, the Reserve Bank maintained status quo on the benchmark interest rate but warned that volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation.For October-March, the RBI pegged CPI-based retail inflation to be between 3.9-4.5 per cent."
5ce7064ae8e3fc56af416abd,A rendezvous to remember,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-rendezvous-to-remember/article25459545.ece,2018-11-10,"It was the day before Deepavali and we had planned to go out and have some salads at a new place I had been hearing good things about. But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"
