The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

He lived up to the billing by saying: ""Madhya Pradesh no longer needs Shivraj Singh Chouhan, it needs Kamal Nath .""It was a sort of counterattack of sorts by Congress a day after a former Digvijaya Singh loyalist, Premchand Guddu, switched to BJP. And it's a repeat of what happened in December 2003 - less than a week after Congress was routed in the election, Digvijaya's brother walked out of Congress and joined BJP (he is now back with Congress).Sanjay Masani joined Congress in the presence of PCC president Kamal Nath and party MP Jyotiraditya Scindia at the AICC office in Delhi. Flanked by the Congress heavyweights, CM Chouhan's brother-in-law said, ""Thirteen years (Chouhan's tenure in office) is a long time, and now someone else should get the opportunity. It's time for Kamal Nath.""BJP is fielding those with big names, rather than those who work for the party. The dynastic rule that BJP opposed is now flourishing within the party. Workers hard work is being ignored and leaders children are being given tickets to contest. Shivraj Singh Chouhan did not listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is opposed to dynastic rule. Other workers should be given opportunity. Unemployment is the biggest problem in MP and for the past 15 years the BJP government promised to bring industries to give jobs but made little difference, he added.Masani has for 13 years been an eyesore for Congress. All this while, Congress had been accusing him of being part of various irregularities in the state.BJPs reaction was a shrug of the shoulders. We cannot stop anyone from going. This is a democracy and everyone has rights. In which party was Vijayaraje Scindia and in what party was her son Madhavrao Scindia? asked BJP national vice-president Prabhat Jha.Who is Masani targeting by mentioning dynastic rule? In the first list of BJP candidates announced on Friday, there were three sons and a brother who got tickets  forest minister Gauri Shankar Shejwar stepped down for his son Mudit in Sanchi, Union minister Thavar Chand Gehlots son Jeetendra has been fielded from Alot, and MoS Harsh Singhs son Vikram will contest Rampur-Baghelan in his place. Harsh Singh has been unwell for two years.State Congress media committee chairperson Shobha Oza said, Shivraj Singh Chouhans bad governance is making everyone, including the partys MLAs, ministers, district panchayat presidents and even his family members, to rush towards Congress. Even BJP workers are tired of the mafia raaj and corruption, and see new hope in Congress and its ideology. The brother-in-law has left his Jijas side. At this hour, when defeat is imminent, even Chouhans family has lost faith in him. She said this development will make no difference to Congress promise to put culprits of Vyapam scam and illegal mining in prison if the party comes to power.This happened just four days after Congress tried to rope in another Chouhan kin, OBC leader Gulab Singh Kirar, but dropped him like a hot potato within a few hours after protests within the leadership since Kirar is an accused in the Vyapam scam."

5ce746b0e8e3fc56af41853a,Quick and easy recipes for Diwali parties,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/quick-and-easy-recipes-for-diwali-parties/cid/1673711,2018-11-03,"Since people are hungry when they arrive at a party, they tend to load up on appetisers. So, its a good idea to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger food. Source: `www.cucinamiabynatasha.com`I love how the festive season in India stretches for so long. In Bengal it starts with Durga Puja and in other parts of the country with Dussehra. Once that is done, the countdown to Diwali begins and then theres bhai phonta or bhai dooj.It goes further on to the New Year for some communities. So its a long time before people are back to normal life! And this means parties, celebrations and more eating and drinking. And lots of hosting! Heres a guide to make you shine as the host at your festive celebrations.DECIDE ON DECORYou do not need to spend a fortune to decorate your home to reflect the festive spirit. Diwali is all about light. So simple diyas and tea lights around the house can create magic. Pair those with fresh orange and yellow marigold and you have a gorgeous traditional look.The entrance to your home should give a positive first impression. Do it up with floating candles and flowers in a large bowl of water or a simple rangoli on the floor adorned with diyas.For me, the dining table is always the highlight as food is an integral part of any party. I love doing up the table based on the occasion and theme. At my own Diwali party in Bangalore, I added a south Indian touch with banana leaves, flowers from the local market and classic earthen diyas. All for less than Rs 200!PREP IN ADVANCEWe all host parties and get-togethers because we want to share these happy moments with our loved ones. However, most of the time, the host ends up running around and getting stressed during the party. This would not happen if you organise yourself and also reduce the number of unnecessary tasks.Choose a menu which you can prepare a day in advance. Dishes which have to be made or assembled just before serving are a complete no-no.For garnishes like fresh herbs, lime wedges and other fresh ingredients, prepare them just before the party and keep them ready on a tray in the service area of your kitchen. That way you dont have to go rummaging around in your overcrowded fridge for the dhania while the hot food is waiting to be served.Use disposable crockery and cutlery to reduce washing up. These days you get lovely bamboo and paperware which are eco-friendly and look nice as well.Ice, ice, baby! How many times have you been at a party getting your drink from the bar, only to be told Sorry we are out of ice! There is nothing more putting off than a warm drink, be it a whisky or a cola. Do remember to start stocking up on ice cubes a couple of days in advance so that will be one big job out of the way.Sweet potato chips www.cucinamiabynatasha.comSWEET POTATO CHIPSGet healthy and gourmet with these oven-baked sweet potato chips.Ingredients4 sweet potatoes2tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperChilli flakesMethodPeel the potatoes and cut into chips.Steam half-way.Heat the oven to 180C.Combine the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.Bake on a baking dish or tray for about 30 minutes, tossing in between till crispy.Serve warm with any dip, sauce or chutney.Minted pea hummus/ beetroot hummus www.cucinamiabynatasha.comMINTED PEA HUMMUS/ BEETROOT HUMMUSWhen the classic hummus bores you, you revive it by adding vibrant colours and veggies! You can use either peas and mint, or beetroot in this recipe for some gorgeous hummus.Ingredients1 cup chickpeas (boiled)2 beetroots, cut in large cubes, or 1 cup of boiled peas and some mint leaves1tbsp tahini2 garlic clovestsp cumin powderJuice of  lemonChilli flakesSalt and fresh pepperToasted pine nuts or walnuts for garnishMethodSteam the beetroots/boil the peas or bake in the oven.In a blender, blend together the boiled chickpeas, beetroot/peas and mint, tahini, garlic, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and 2tbsp of water till you get the right consistency.Garnish with toasted nuts and seeds. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil just before serving.GET THE MENU RIGHTIt is incredible how much food gets left over at parties and then the host family ends up eating the same thing for the next couple of days or distributing it to neighbours and domestic staff in the justification that they are not wasting food. Well, why not just make less of each with the idea that if one dish finishes there will always be something else to eat.In my opinion, the appetisers or finger food and the dessert should be the main focus. The main course could be very light or just a one-pot wholesome dish for those wanting something more. People are hungry when they arrive. So they tend to load up on appetisers.A good idea is to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger foods which people can have while playing cards.Try out some healthy appetisers like sweet potato chips with beetroot/pea and mint hummus or curried peanut dip which you can make in advance. These are regulars on my party menus by popular demand. You can also make them for your post-Diwali visits or bhai phonta gatherings as, by then, people are really done with all the heavy eating of the season.So go on, get cracking to make your festivities super special.Wish you all a shining and enjoyable Diwali!The dining table can be a highlight; decorate it in the traditional way with diyas, flowers and banana leavesCurried Peanut Dip www.cucinamiabynatasha.comCURRIED PEANUT DIPThis is a new addition to my recipe stash with an interesting desi touch of spices, peanuts and coriander.Ingredients1tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion chopped1tbsp garlic, mincedtsp coriander powdertsp turmeric powderRed chilli flakes to taste2 large carrots, finely chopped cup toasted peanuts4tsp fresh lime juice1tbsp soy sauce1tsp brown sugar1tbsp crushed peanuts (for garnish)1tbsp chopped fresh coriander (for garnish)1tbsp crumbled feta cheese (optional)MethodIn a pan, heat some oil and cook the onion and garlic.Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and red chilli flakes.Add the carrots with salt and pepper and saute until carrots are half-cooked.Add in the toasted peanuts, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.

5ce746b4e8e3fc56af41853f,Ways to keep your eyes bright and sparkling,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/ways-to-keep-your-eyes-bright-and-sparkling/cid/1673718,2018-11-03,"I have always believed that the eyes are the most alluring part of a persons face. There have been innumerable verses dedicated to them and an unaccountable number of hearts that have lost their way in someone elses eyes! I believe beautiful eyes reflect a beautiful soul. So, its important to take care of your eyes and the area around them.The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and delicate. So, stretching and rubbing this area causes wrinkly creases. Sparkling and clear eyes show that your eyes are healthy. Just as the rest of the body requires certain nutrients, the eyes need vitamins A, B, C and E as well as proteins. Crunchy carrots, apples and oranges are excellent for keeping the eyes healthy. Dairy products like butter, milk, cheese and yoghurt, and meat products are high in vitamin A. A high-fibre diet, wholesome grains, fresh fruit and green vegetables will provide vitamins B and C.Sleep is very important for the eyes and the lack of it can lead to dull, puffy eyes and the much-dreaded dark circles. I am astounded when I see women waking up in the morning without having removed their make-up. This can lead to infection and puffiness.Here are some simple ways to keep your eyes healthy and shiny:Avoid using harsh astringents and masks around the eyes.Do not attempt to read under dim or flickering light. Never read in a moving vehicle, especially buses and cars.Try and restrict TV viewing.Vitamin C is essential for the eyes and extreme smoking robs the body of this. It can also cause wrinkles around the eyes.Cotton wool dipped in cold milk and rose water is excellent for removing eye make-up and soothing the eyes.Always use sunglasses when out in the sun.Avoid long hours in front of the computer and try and take regular breaks if thats not avoidable.Signs of ageingThe eyes are the first part of the face that shows signs of ageing. Lines, wrinkles, crows feet at the sides and creases are all signs of ageing. Dab a few drops of olive or almond oil or honey under the eyes and massage gently in a feather-like circular motion.Follow up with a cold compress made of 1tsp grated cucumber, 1tsp grated raw potato and 1tsp china clay. Keep this refrigerated for 10 minutes, apply the compress on both eyes and relax.To soothe tired eyes, you can use any of the following washes:A mild solution of one glass of cold mineral water with 2 pinches of salt. Pat dry with an extra-soft towel.Add 4tsp of rose water to a glass of chilled mineral water and wash your eyes with it.Blink your eyes in a small bowl of chilled mineral water. This will help release hidden pollutants and dirt from the eyes.Dark circlesDark circles around the eyes can be a result of many things such as lack of sleep, stress, tension, internal weakness, lack of water intake and prolonged illness. It is important to sleep restfully and without disturbance. Increase your water intake and make lifestyle changes to reduce stress.Massage the eye area with a teaspoon of almond oil to which you have added 10 drops of lemon juice. You can also apply an eye pack of 1tsp of freshly-extracted mint and 1tsp of fresh-grated cucumber. Keep it on for at least 20 minutes and wash off with chilled water. You will have to do this on alternate days for two weeks before you can see results.Tackling wrinklesTo keep the creases at bay, keep the eye area well moisturised. Mix 1tsp olive oil and 1tsp petroleum jelly and store in a small glass jar. Dab a little on the eye area and massage gently around the eyes. You need to do this every day.Puffy eyes: Eyes usually get puffy because of lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, water retention or even crying!

Apply it under the eyes.Dip two cotton pads in icy cold milk and place over closed eyelids.Splash ice-cold water on lids. Blot dry and relax with slices of potatoes over closed eyelids. This is extremely beneficial for puffy eyes.Dip cotton pads in hot water to which 1tsp of salt has been added. Place on eyelids to reduce puffiness.ExercisesPalming is one of the classic eye exercises. Cup your eyes with the palm of your hands. Do not let your hands touch your eyelids. Slowly close your eyes and remain that way until you begin to see a clear black screen. Open your eyes slowly. This exercise will help you strengthen the eye muscles and improve eyesight.Blinking is good as it refreshes the eyes. The natural cleanser of the eye is a tear film that spreads across the cornea. Blink whenever you can. If you are reading or writing for long hours, blink your eyes several times to relax them.Another excellent eye exercise is to hold a pencil approximately 10 inches away from your eyes. Look at it and then slowly look past it, preferably towards the end of the room. Repeat at least 10 times to feel eye strain vanishing.A good exercise to improve eyesight is to walk barefoot first thing in the morning on grass. Dew has its therapeutic qualities and the blades of grass provide acupressure massage to the entire body.Suparna Trikha is a nature care expert and a columnist. Find her on Facebook @suparnatrikha."

The issue had also taken political colour with people announcing to hold a massive demonstration at district headquarter Keylong on November 3.Markanda said while the ban is continuing on other potato producing areas of some states, Lahaul-Spiti farmers would get good price for their produce as only they would be marketing the quality seed potato.He said besides lifting ban on potato, the Centre has also agreed to provide Rs 37 crore compensation to the residents of the district in lieu of damages suffered due to heavy snowfall. During the meeting, I informed the Union minister and other officials about the damage to 80% of apple crop and trees, he added."

Rohan V. Mehra, son of late actor Vinod Mehra and homemaker Kiran Mehra, grew up never meeting his father and not knowing how he charmed the audience. If thats not enough, as a child he planned to become an investment banker because in Mombasa (Kenya, where he grew up), every child, he says, dreams of becoming a banker or a professional in the investment business. A chat with The Woods:The Woods: Baazaar was ready last year and the release got delayed. How nerve-wracking was it, as a newcomer, to wait for the release?Rohan: As a newcomer, you have so much energy and prepared for anything. So, maybe it was not as difficult, though frustrating. But then I kept reminding myself that the product we made was really nice. That thought of having a good film just kept me going.How did this film happen?Funnily enough, some time ago, I put a photo of mine on Instagram. And Gauravv Chawla, who is the director of our film, saw it and called me up. He asked me if I would be interested in an audition for his film. The film I auditioned for ended up never happening, but he called me back for Baazaar .. Rohan, you have a complication with the name. There is one more actor called Rohan Mehra. So even when one Googles your name, he appears at this moment. How do you plan to deal with that?Lets not discount the work he has done. He has done really well for himself and for that I must congratulate him. But yes, it is a little difficult to explain to people that there is one more Rohan..About Baazaar , the first thing that comes to my mind, is its similarity with Oliver Stones Wall Street .It sounds familiar when you talk about the premise but there are so many films like that. And again what we usually do is, when we have a familiar story we like to tag it.I believe you grew up in Mombasa!Yes, I did. Mombasa, a small town in Kenya, east of Africa. It was amazing. Very simple lifestyle.Would that also mean that you did not grow up watching too many Indian films?You know, two things you can guarantee when you go anywhere in the world  potato and Indians. And you have to remember that running a cinema is a business and you have to cater to demand. The richest people in Mombasa were the Indians and they demanded Indian films.We cannot not talk about your father. You never really got time with him. But I am sure you watched his films. Probably you discovered your father through other peoples memories.Yes, it is a strange situation. Having not met my father, he passed away when my mother was pregnant with me, and I was taken to Kenya where I grew up with my grandparents. I did not feel the lack of something because my childhood was great. When I moved to Mumbai when I was 21, I started meeting people who knew my father and I started discovering this man through others experience of him. And stories that people would tell of him.So, when was the first time you experienced his stardom?I am not the person who would go out and tell people my father was an actor. I find that very strange. But people who knew him would speak of him. And initially, it felt like wow! I did not know how to react.When worlds collideActing, Rohan says, was a faraway dream at the start. I knew dad was an actor as my mother used to tell me about him. I watched his films like Bemisaal, Anurodh and Ghar. When we came to Mumbai for holidays, a lot of people spoke about dad. Like him, I enjoy photography, music and films. Much later I shifted to UK for a job and there I realised that the world is really big. I started writing and directing short films. It was later in 2012 that I shifted to Mumbai and joined an acting school. Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Khamoshi made the biggest impact on me. Much later when I came to Mumbai I assisted him for Bajirao Mastani."

The ban was imposed following detection of Nematode virus in the potato samples of districts, including Una, Kullu and Shimla . According to agriculture minister and Lahaul-Spiti MLA, Dr Ram La Markanda, no virus was detected in Lahaul-Spiti potatoes and, therefore,ban should be lifted for their region. On Monday, a high level team from the state, headed by Markanda, would meet Union Agriculture Minister in New Delhi in this regard.The seed potatoes of Lahaul-Spiti is in great demand not only in West Bengal, Gujarat and other parts of India but also in Pakistan. At present, they are grown in 747 hectare area in the entire district.According to Markanda, the residents of Lahaul-Spiti have already suffered extensive damage because of untimely snow due to which 80% of apple crop has been damaged and plants broken. Now this decision of Centre has left the residents in a lurch.State government has formed a four-member committee headed by director, agriculture to submit a report on the repercussions of the ban. In the committee formed by the government, experts from Central Potato Research Institute and CSK Agriculture University Palampur have also been included. The committee will suggest whether the seed potato is suitable for further distribution or not, Markanda said."
5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

Already, President Donald Trump, who has not been shy about translating his conservative views on immigration into harsh policy measures, has fuelled fears that the caravan may harbour terrorists from West Asia; he has also attacked Mexico for not stopping the onslaught. This, besides the usual sloganeering around illegal immigration that will purportedly steal American jobs and threaten the security of an otherwise peaceful American society. In truth, most members of this caravan, not by any means the first of its kind but certainly one of the largest in recent history, are either economic migrants seeking escape from grinding poverty in places like Honduras or fleeing persecution, trafficking or gang violence in the region. Unlike previous such caravans, whose members numbered in the hundreds and which dissipated along the way or upon reaching the border, this one has gathered momentum from sheer media attention and support from advocacy groups. It is not going away any time soon. This puts candidates from both the major parties in the U.S. in a tricky position. Democrats are wary of committing too much political currency to the caravan or undocumented migration as a phenomenon, given the prevailing mood in the country. And the Republican mainstream harbours concerns about the strident anti-immigrant rhetoric against the caravan, and what it stands for, emboldening far-right groups associated with racism and Islamophobia.At the heart of the shrill debate on immigration is the weight of history. Americans can never get away from the fact that they are and will probably always be a nation of immigrants. As President, Barack Obama took a hard line on undocumented worker deportations, whose number soared through his two terms in office. But he sought to toe a moderate line when it came to delaying the deportation of childhood arrivals, and policed borders with a relatively light touch. Mr. Trump, contrarily, has made every effort to deliver on his radical campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., although he faced numerous legal setbacks in that mission, and then made even immigration hawks squirm over his decision to separate undocumented child migrants from their families. Ultimately #CaravanaMigrante will seek to cross that line in the sand which Mr. Trump and his supporters hope will one day become a high wall. Liberal-progressive Americans who hope that these asylum-seekers will not be rudely rebuffed at that point will have to regroup and focus their energies on the November campaign and use any newfound power they win in Congress to chip away at the immigration agenda of the Trump machine."
