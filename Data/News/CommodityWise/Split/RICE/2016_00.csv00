This is against an age-old practice of serving hot bhajjis, bondas and puff pastries in plates covered with newspapers or wrapping them in newspapers for parcels.""Studies have shown that the ink or dye used in newspapers is made of hazardous chemicals which could even be carcinogenic,"" said a statement from district collector, T N Hariharan.""Also newspapers lying unused and stacked up in closed spaces for a long time could also have formation of bacteria and fungus which could cause indigestion and many infections to the intestines,"" he said.As an alternate, the food safety department has suggested the usage of non-hazardous chemical products like "" banana leaves"" to wrap and serve food.Many roadside eateries are bewildered by the new rule. ""Old newspapers cost only Rs 15 for a kg, and if we are smart enough to cut them into the right parcelling size or serving size earlier in the day, they are much easier,"" said T Dhandapani, who runs a small lunch serving push-cart on Puliakulam Road.""As a backup we could buy brown paper covers from Big Bazaar Street for around Rs 40 a day, but banana leaves are far-fetched and expensive. They also get cut easily and so we should wrap newspaper around the banana leaves too,"" said an eatery owner.Most of the biriyani outlets and restaurants serve their rice portions in banana leaves which are in turn wrapped in newspapers.However, environmentalists and health experts said this trend would only lead to more usage of thin plastic. ""If you ban plastic, besides brown paper, they will start using thin plastic of low microns,"" said Puducherry-based environmentalist D Saravanan.""They have to clearly ban newspapers and plastics,"" he said. ""Plastics not only harm the environment but is also dangerous when it comes into contact with hot food, because the toxic components can leech into food,"" said Saravanan."

Judge JR Patil observed there was no enough evidence against the arrested persons.The incident took place in the village located on the Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border, around 110km from Bengaluru, on August 2, 2011.Most of the accused are from Yerrakota village in Chintamani taluk, Chikkaballapur district , while the others belong to neigbouring villages like Muramulla, Barlahalli, Kagati, Bynahalli, Gandaganahalli and Reddyhalli. Though several women were among the arrested persons, their names were dropped from the chargesheet. Seventy men were named in the chargesheet.The court said the photo evidence provided by police was not helpful since the pictures didn't identify the accused. It wasn't clear who attacked whom, the court added.""Some photos claimed to have been clicked from mobile phones during the lynching were submitted as crucial material evidence. The pictures were not clear and it was impossible to identify the faces,"" advocate R Chandrashekar, who followed the proceedings closely, told TOI.The police team led by then Chikkaballapur superintendent of police , TD Pawar, arrested most of the men from Yerrakota and surrounding villages. ""Scores of men had fled from Yerrakota and neighbouring villages and returned home after weeks,"" he recalled.CASE IN A NUTSHELLOn August 2, 2011, Yerrakota villagers picketed a white Tata Sumo parked on the outskirts and questioned around 12 men sitting in it. A few days earlier, residents of surrounding villages had complained that a group of men moving around in a white Sumo had cheated them of money and gold using tricks like the rice-pulling jug. It's an old method of cheating in which miscreants sell a copper jug saying it pulls rice like a magnet and brings fortune to its owner. While selling such jugs, miscreants would stick magnets beneath them and place them near heaps of rice mixed with tiny iron beads, which would naturally get drawn towards the jugs.During questioning, the villagers realized they were the same 12 men who had taken the other villagers for a ride. They began to thrash them mercilessly. They allegedly lynched 10 men, while the two othes managed to escape."

But he would not have any money to pay the shop owner till the 10th of this month when his wages will be credited into his bank account. But the 24-year-old will have to take a day off to withdraw some money, part of which he will send home, and keep the rest to meet his expenses.""I have no problem standing in queue, I think whatever is happening is for good,"" he says. ""But the irony is that I will not be paid Rs 500 on the day I take an off to go to the bank to get money,"" he says, claiming the sum translates into survival for more than a week for him.Vijay, a resident of Ullawas village, is not the only one. Most construction workers in the city are facing the brunt of demonetisation. While payments have been kept on hold for some, many will have to do away with one day's wage to go and stand in queues to withdraw money from bank when they get paid this month.Ramesh, 20, who is originally from Malda district in Bengal, says he is already living a ""cashless"" life. His money is directly sent to his family in his village, while his thekedar (contractor) gives him around Rs 500 a week for daily needs. ""Now this money has started coming down, two weeks back he gave me Rs 200, and has not given anything since that,"" he says.Mohan Pehan and Nirmal, both working for a construction company, have similar stories to share.

Both he and his wife came to Gurgaon two months ago and haven't been paid yet, even though they were promised to be paid on the first. ""We don't know how to survive. We are very new here,"" says Mohan's wife.Nirmal says that his employer told him that he will get paid in the old currency this month, so he will also pay his workers likewise. On an average each worker gets around Rs 11,000 per month in the project, making the sum more than Rs 40 lakh, which will be paid in old currency this month at this site alone.At another construction site near Mayfield Gardens, Vishwanath is working hard to start a green old style concrete mixer. He says he gets his ration from nearby Samaspur village, which is where he lives. But there is a catch to when he goes with the old currency. ""The shopkeeper charges commission for accepting old currency notes,"" he says.Most construction workers have accepted the troubles they are facing as a result of demonetisation as a given. As there is no decline in work, at least in construction work in large townships, they see it as a good sign. But their day to day finances have been badly affected, with mounting debts and declining salaries by standing in bank queues. There are also unaware of being used as pawns in converting large sums of old currency, which might not be necessarily legitimate, by accepting payments in these currency."

This means the profit margin for the next two times will be higher as the input costs involved will be much lower,"" Rai said.He said that many others in his village were keen to use some part of their land for growing various medicinal herbs which have good commercial value.The traditional grain-growing farmer, however, did put in a few hours of training to master the cultivation process of Shalaparni.Rai took part in a special training programme conducted by Dabur India Ltd, as part of its Environment Sustainability strategy.The Head of Bioresources group at the Dabur Research and Development Centre, Sarvepalli Badri Narayan, said the initiative involves both farmers and tribals and would benefit around 2,500 households spread across eight states.""We focus only on marginal farmers and tribal communities and encourage them to grow medicinal herbs on only a part of their land. We give them technical assistance as well,"" Narayan told IANS.""It engages them to a large extent, providing them visible economic opportunities while helping the conservation of the natural resources in wide ranging eco-systems,"" the official said.This IANS correspondent visited the fully automated state-of-the-art greenhouse in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, dedicated exclusively for medicinal plants, including Akarakala, Ativisha, Taxus, Shalaparni and many others.The facility caters to the supply of ""elite"" planting material to the farmers enabling them to cultivate and supply well-standardised medicinal plants on a large scale.""We create artificial environment -- of the Himalayas to that of the Thar -- in this facility to grow different kinds of plants that have different requirements,"" he said.After initial germination stages, the saplings are shipped to different parts of India and given to farmers for further phases of their cultivation.On harvest, they are bought back on mutually agreed terms. Dabur has grown and distributed close to 7.5 lakh saplings of rare medicinal herbs to farmers in 2015-16 from its greenhouse.""This continuous engagement with the community has helped revive a host of endangered plant species and established a sustainable source of livelihood for the farming and forest-based communities,"" Narayan said.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 80 per cent population in developing countries is dependent on traditional systems of medicine, which are mostly plant-based.""We have identified around 100 rare and critical medicinal herbs. Today, we are cultivating 23 of these herbs and have drawn up a road map to initiate cultivation of another 27,"" Narayan added.Dabur has embarked on a journey to become the largest bulk grower of rare medicinal herbs, with 2,700 acres of land currently under cultivation of these rare medicinal plants. Their strategy would be to increase the number to 3,800 by the end of the 2016-17 financial year.Narayan said that the company is also establishing herbal gardens across ayurvedic colleges and universities in India. ""These would make available rare ayurvedic medicinal plants for the coming generations,"" he said."

It was previously thought that rice farming originally developed in China from where it came to India around 2000 BCE. But new finds at Rakhigarhi in Hissar district, Haryana show that local variety of rice was being cultivated more than 400 years before that.The new research was led by scientists from Cambridge University, working in collaboration with colleagues at Banaras Hindu University and the University of Oxford. It is published in the journals Antiquity and Journal of Archaeological Science.The research also confirms that Indus populations were the earliest people to use complex multi-cropping strategies across both seasons, growing foods during summer (rice, millets and beans) and winter (wheat, barley and pulses), which required different watering regimes. The findings suggest a network of regional farmers supplied assorted produce to the markets of the civilisation's ancient cities.""We found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process in ancient South Asia, likely based around the wild species Oryza nivara. This led to the local development of a mix of 'wetland' and 'dryland' agriculture of local Oryza sativa indica rice agriculture before the truly 'wetland' Chinese rice, Oryza sativa japonica, arrived around 2000 BC,"" says study co-author Dr Jennifer Bates.""While wetland rice is more productive, and took over to a large extent when introduced from China, our findings appear to show there was already a long-held and sustainable culture of rice production in India as a widespread summer addition to the winter cropping during the Indus civilisation.""Co-author Dr Cameron Petrie says that the location of the Indus in a part of the world that received both summer and winter rains may have encouraged the development of seasonal crop rotation before other major civilisations of the time, such as Ancient Egypt and China's Shang Dynasty.""Most contemporary civilisations initially utilised either winter crops, such as the Mesopotamian reliance on wheat and barley, or the summer crops of rice and millet in China - producing surplus with the aim of stockpiling,"" says Petrie.""However, the area inhabited by the Indus is at a meteorological crossroads, and we found evidence of year-long farming that predates its appearance in the other ancient river valley civilisations.""The archaeologists sifted for traces of ancient grains in the remains of several Indus villages within a few kilometers of the site called Rakhigari: the most recently excavated of the Indus cities that may have maintained a population of some 40,000.As well as the winter staples of wheat and barley and winter pulses like peas and vetches, they found evidence of summer crops: including domesticated rice, but also millet and the tropical beans urad and horsegram, and used radiocarbon dating to provide the first absolute dates for Indus multi-cropping: 2890-2630 BC for millets and winter pulses, 2580-2460 BC for horsegram, and 2430-2140 BC for rice."

A group of vegetable sellers, grocers, and sellers of garments, spices and bakery products have turned to barter system to meet their daily needs till the currency crisis is resolved.They said they were doing it to survive and avoid standing in long queues outside the banks.Chowk vegetable seller Razi said since the ban on old currency , there have been only one to two customers who come with lower denomination of currency while rest bring Rs 2,000 note which he was unable to exchange. ""The situation has turned bad with every passing day .

On Monday, Delhi government began providing food at 10 night shelters run by DUSIB (Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board). Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said daily wage labourers had no work and nothing to eat. ""We are taking responsibility so that no one dies of hunger,"" he said, launching the project in the evening at Geeta Ghat and Dandi Park with minister Satyendar Jain. The shelters will serve three meals through the day.There were several labourers at the night shelters who have been devastated by the turn of events. Gopal Singh (29) lives in the shelter at Dandi Park and does odd jobs at weddings to survive. In the past one month, he says, he had to go to sleep without food several times. ""I came here after Diwali from Moradabad, looking for work. This is peak season but work is only one-fourth of usual. And then they make us work and mock us by giving old notes ,"" he complained. ""Around 80% of the people here are casual labourers, cart-pullers and other daily wagers, but for the past one month, odd jobs have become rare. Many are now forced to beg for food near Hanuman Temple,"" said Nishu Tripathi, in-charge of the shelter.The widespread distress is reflected directly in the large number of people eating at langars in Moti Bagh gurdwara, Bangla Sahib and Sikh Sangat in Yusuf Sarai. The managers said the number of labourers, slum-dwellers and homeless has gone up dramatically. ""Most of these people who started visiting the langar after demonetization were labourers and slum-dwellers, who couldn't buy food or have lost their job,"" said Jagwant Singh, who serves food at Bangla Sahib. ""The number of people increased significantly overnight and this continued for a week. Earlier, we catered to around 10,000-12,000 people a day, now we feed almost 15,000,"" he added.Jogender, who lost a leg in a road accident, stays alone at the Sonia Gandhi camp, close to Moti Bagh gurdwara. He turned to the langar here after the local ration shop refused to accept old currency notes with which he used to buy rice. ""I have no other place to go and people often drive me away due to my disability. I do not want to beg,"" he said. Women who work as domestic helps in the colony nearby send their children to eat at the langar. ""I have not received my salary yet and there is no ration at home. We are eating at the langar for over a month now,"" said Sabina Ahmed.Several people sat hunched in front of hotels at Jama Masjid and Nizamuddin. Interestingly, meals for them are sponsored by those who visit these eateries. The rush for seeking help has increased manyfold in the past few weeks. ""All these people are cart-pullers and porters whose work has virtually disappeared,"" said Hazi Muhammad Afzal (44), who runs Garib Nawaz Hotel at Matia Mahal, near Jama Masjid. While beggars used to come even earlier, the number has doubled since demonetization, he claimed. Similarly, Rahman Rahmatuallah (58), owner of Rahmatullah hotel near Jama Masjid, said the number had tripled. ""We are receiving more than 100-150 people everyday now. And despite Eid donors, many go back hungry .""Across the city, at AIIMS, feeding poor patients and their relatives starts early in the morning. Puja Tayal, a homemaker from Hauz Khas, comes here daily with 10kg of rice and curry. These days, the food gets over in 20 minutes with many still clamouring. Balbir, a cobbler who has been sitting outside AIIMS for many years now, says he has never seen such distress. ""Demonetisation was a good idea but look who have become the victims,"" he said.To insulate the most marginalised from such a situation, a Jan Ahaar scheme had been started by the Congress government in Delhi. In these yellow metallic cabins, one can get rice, chapatti, dal and a vegetable dish for just Rs 18. There is a dip in customers now. ""While we used to get about 125 customers for lunch earlier, the number is down to 70-80,"" said Sonu Kumar, who operates one such outlet in Hauz Khas. Irshad Ali, another manager at a similar shack in Green Park said his outlet and another one at Chhattarpur were facing a similar situation: ""We are now sending food back to the NGO."""

By November 25, 55% of paddy is harvested, but only 22% Kharif paddy has been reaped so far. The government is thinking of diverting 100-day job labourers to fields for reaping the crop.Bengal's food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Tuesday said: "" After the paddy is procured, it will go to rice mills . Each entry at rice mill will generate three challans, one of which comes straight to food department in Kolkata. Immediately , the fund will be transferred to the bank account of the farmer through RTGS system. The entire procure ment will be monitored at multiple levels so no corruption creeps in.""He added: ""We have Rs 5,000 crore with the department for procurement. Moreover, we are taking a loan of Rs 1,000 crore from the West Bengal Finance Development Corporation. Besides, the Centre is supposed to give us Rs 2,008 crore this year and Rs 481 crore against last year's due.The state has set the minimum support price of Rs 1,490 per quintal (.1 tonne). It has also set a procurement target of 52 lakh tonne paddy which will yield 41.20 lakh tonne rice. The state's requirement out of the procurement is 32 lakh tonne. Six lakh tonne of rice will be sold to Jharkhand. Rest of the rice will be given to state food safety pool and central food safety pool.The food minister also alerted against a fake job racket in the name of paddy procurement. The racket is playing havoc with the youths in rural Bengal. They are duping job-seekers and charging thousands of rupees in the name of recruitment of civic volunteers by the food department. ""We cannot recruit civic volunteers. Civic volunteers are there with the police department. In case of procurement, the civic volunteers will be roped in from the respective superintendent of police of the district. They floated fake websites and I have ordered inquiry by CID,"" said Mullick.Potato clearance deadline extendedThe Bengal government has extended the deadline for clearing potato stock from cold storage by eight more days.Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta on Tuesday said, ""We have asked all the stakeholders in the potato business to clear the stock immediately. The government will not allow any off-take of potato after December 8. There is 8 lakh tonne of potato stock lying in 480 cold storages in Bengal."

With a keen interest to pursue higher studies, Toppo took admission as an under-graduate student with a major in arts, at SS Memorial College , seven kms away from his residence.""My father died several years ago and my mother works at a construction site as a daily wager. I am the eldest son in my family and I have three siblings, one sister, and the others are all below 12 years. To help my mother with the finances, I make rice beer at home and sell it,"" Toppo said.Due to low income, Toppo was unable to attend college regularly as he found it difficult to meet the travelling expenses. He said, ""I had to pay around Rs 2,500 for admission which my mother borrowed from somewhere. Now I do not have the money even to buy my books and notebooks.""Toppo decided to seek the government's help. In November, he went to meet welfare minister Lois Marandi, but in vain. He did not receive any help from the minister. He also tried to meet chief minister Raghubar Das but was not allowed to.""I met the welfare minister and asked her to help me. I even gave her a letter but no one got back to me till date. I then went to the CM's residence to meet him but instead, I was directed to a project building. I waited for hours. They gave me some snacks to eat but did not allow me to meet the CM,"" Toppo said.Meera Mishra of Ranchi child welfare committee recently met Toppo and expressed her disappointment over the futile incidents. ""This is just one case and it clearly shows how the government is not at all serious about rehabilitation of trafficking survivors. If no one helps him, this boy will definitely fall prey to trafficking again and be exploited,"" Mishra said. She also said that she had written to the social welfare department regarding this case but received no reply."

I recommend my patients to have it for digestion,"" Pujara said.He added that it was a traditional custom to consume pan after lunch or dinner to ensure good digestion.

I will do it',"" said C V Sheela, one of the nurses. ""She smiled at us when we walked in, chatted with us, and, on most occasions, cooperated. When we were around, she made an effort to eat despite difficulties.She would have one spoon for the sake of each of us and one for herself,"" Sheela added.Her diet included her favourite upma, pongal or curd rice and potato curry, prepared by her cook. There was a team of 16 nurses who were posted in three shifts; Sheela, M V Renuka and Samundeeswari were among her favourites.After a condolence meeting at Apollo Hospitals , doctors, nurses and paramedics described how she was sometimes funny, usually cooperative, and occasionally difficult during her 75-day stay.Jayalalithaa was brought to the emergency room on the night of September 22 in severe discomfort. Four hours later, when her vitals were stable, she woke up and asked for some sandwiches and coffee. ""It had been a long journey for her since then,"" said Dr R Senthil Kumar, senior consultant, who led a team of intensive care experts. When she wasn't too tired, she would chat with duty doctors.

""She watched the news on Jaya TV and smiled,"" Dr Bhama said.But everything changed on that fateful Sunday evening. She was watching an old Tamil soap opera when an intensivist (name withheld) walked into her room. Jayalalithaa didn't smile or talk. She seemed breathless.

However, their margins expanded on benign input costs.This July-September quarter, sales growth for companies was lowest in almost a decade. Hindustan Unilevers revenue in the second quarter rose just 2%.While, the companies were hoping for a recovery in the second half of this year, the demonetisation has reduced demand further, particularly in wholesale channels, which drive almost 40% of FMCG business. The cost of raw materials has also inched up following a rise in global crude prices.According to Nielsen, consumer sales declined 1.8% in November versus October, while retailer purchase from trade fell 6.4%. The overall FMCG industry is estimated to be worth 2.56 lakh crore, so in absolute terms, the drop was huge, it said.Despite Diwali-related spends, there is an indication of lost velocity in FMCG. More importantly, we see retailer purchases declining faster than consumer sales, Nielsen said.Impulse foods and personal care products are among the most affected in terms of consumer offtake.The consumer is clearly moving into more daily necessities. ...The fact is that the consumer has got limited cash outlays ... said P Balaji, CFO, Hindustan Unilever, the largest FMCG player in the country.He also said the wholesale sector was among the most affected and so the company would focus on increasing its direct coverage of retail outlets.Religare Securities has cut its sales estimates on companies across the FMCG sector by 1.1%-7.5% for the current financial year, while profit estimates have been slashed by 3.2%-18.6%.Over the last few months, the price of key raw materials is on the rise.For instance, palm oil (key input in soaps) is up 48% year-on-year, wheat 24%, rice bran 16% and sugar 31%."

Other projects which received wide appreciation were a mobile app for dyslexic students made by a dyslexia student. The top three teams will participate in the national CBSE round.Three students of Jaipur-based Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh School in Jagatpura named 'Tiny Mighty Al' is based on the principle of reducing the carbon footprint and to contribute towards the saving earth from the climate change by innovations and technological advances. Students have used algae commonly known as 'Kai' which is generally considered as waste and is thrown away.""Algae also contains high amount of cellulose and negligible lignin which reduces the time, energy and cost of producing paper from it. When we compare it with wood the cost of making paper from algae is half and the output is double thus saving forest and biodiversity,"" said Kartik Chandna , one of the three students.The team worked on the principle that wood contains less cellulose and high amount of lignin which interferes with the process of making paper. The removal of lignin takes a lot of time, energy and money. The output of wood pulp is comparatively half than from algal pulp. ""We have chosen algae because it has the ability to sequester carbon dioxide from highly polluted areas and produces oxygen in the atmosphere far more than that produced by trees reducing the carbon footprint,"" added Chandna.Counting on the benefits, they says that it can be cultured anywhere as it requires stagnant water, sunlight and CO2. It also helps in fixing nitrogen, can be used as biofuel, biofertiliser and high protein rich food. This paper can be produced anywhere and takes only 12 hours to be completed. This paper is further sent to industries for further processing and to obtain different textures and colours of paper.Any type of algae can be used but the best is red algae. Students of MPS Jawahar Nagar in Jaipur have formed an organic farming placed at balcony or terrace. They have prepared our organic soil composed of vermicompost, peat, rice hulls, bagasse and many more organic residues. To add nutrients and minerals, they have prepared organic fertilizers and named it after days so that different liquid can be added in different forms.

After November 8, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs500 notes, he rushed to Kutch, with many others like him, to deposit the scrapped notes, and returned with a meagre amount in valid currency. ""The bank was permitting only limited withdrawals,"" he said.A little ahead, village women working for a highway contractor said they had not got wages since the last two months. Both these places are just 30km away from Nagpur, but life has got a lot tougher due to demonetisation.These two were one of the many hit by demonetisation that TOI met while travelling into a part of the region's paddy belt, which extends from Mouda taluka in Nagpur till Gondia, nearly 200km away. This region has remained insulated from farmers suicide so far, but the economy remains squeezed here too due to demonetisation.Rates of paddy have come down by Rs400 to Rs600 a khandi (1.5 quintals, a measure for paddy). As against Rs3,000 to Rs3,200 last year, farmers are getting only Rs2,600 a khandi, which too the traders are buying reluctantly. The rates are expected to go down further.Earlier, payments were made in cash. Now, being forced to give cheques, rice millers say they cannot afford the old rates. Farmers have no choice but to agree.Even though the cheque might be of a higher amount, once deposited, banks allow withdrawal of only Rs2,000. ""Most of the times, it is a single Rs2,000 note which is of no use,"" say the locals.The cascading effect of the cash crunch has left those at the lowest rung worst hit. With less money from traders, farmers are unable to pay wages to labourers engaged in the fields, who have to settle with whatever little they get.""The last two months have been very tough. Farmers show the Rs2,000 note, saying that is all they have. We used to get a weekly wage of Rs700, but now we have to settle for a couple of hundred,"" said Jasunda Bhongade, a farm hand on her way to work with others.At Borgaon near Bhandara, Harichand Gorle pointed to his paddy field, saying, ""It's time to harvest but the crop has not been cut. Traders, who are low on cash here, are not ready to buy the produce and the rates are already down to Rs2,600 a khandi.""Gorle owns a 20-acre farm. ""Tension with Pakistan has already taken a toll on chilli exports, and the rates have been halved to around Rs300 a quintal,"" he added.""Traders say they can only pay in cheques, but even then the entire dues are not cleared in one go. Giving cheques of smaller amounts, traders claim they don't have any money in the banks too,"" said Vijay Dhoble, another farmer from Borgaon.""The rice millers are cashing in on the situation and have slashed buying rates blaming demonetisation. Farmers are in need of money,"" said Shubham Dharve of Jan Seva Rice Mill at Dawdipar Bazaar village on Pauni Road , a little beyond Bhandara.Nearly half of the people TOI spoke to in villages like Dawdipar Bazaar, Chandor and Pachkedi, 15km past Bhandara city, had not seen the new Rs500 notes. The nearest bank for those living here is in the city. Hiraman Rabade , a farmer who flashed a Rs500 note, said he got it from a trader a week ago.""Farm labourers are the worst hit. A number of women work in the fields or are engaged through private contractors in the forest department, and none of them have not got their wages. Such families have hardly any surplus cash in their hand and are just about managing to make ends meet,"" said Sailesh Nimbarkere , ex-sarpanch of Chandori."

He took the extreme step as he could not find any means to return his loan of `20,000 at 60% interest. As his family tries to move on from the tragedy, only uncertainty hangs over their future. His wife Padmavathi stares blankly when people ask what went wrong.""My father had taken 3.3 acres on lease and borrowed money from the land owner to raise the crop. There was some altercation between the owner and him last Sunday. He came home and said he had consumed poison. He died before he could be taken to hospital,"" said Thiagarajan, Masilamani's son.Masilamani had never shown any suicidal tendencies, but he could have been influenced by reports of deaths of farmers caught in a similar situation in nearby Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts in the past one month, said 'Cauvery' V Dhanapalan, general secretary of Cauvery Farmers' Protection Association. ""About two months of hard work and several thousand rupees of investment are at stake for all those who took to direct sowing. Weeds have outgrown the crop and unless it rains in the next few days, all our efforts will go waste,"" he said.The spate of tragedies started with the suicide of S Govindaraj, 70, of Raghunathapuram near Thiruthuraipoondi on November 3. Since his pregnant daughter-in-law was hospitalised, there was nobody at home when the incident happened. His body was retrieved from a paddy field three days later. Postmortem reports confirmed he had consumed poison.Govindaraj's son Nithiarasan says, ""My father had taken loans from a cooperative society and some people for paddy cultivation. Now, they will come one by one for money"".In the village, for the past five years paddy cultivation has resulted in losses forcing most families to eke out a living by working under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. ""Drinking water comes to our village once a week. All that we ask for is water for drinking and cultivation. We want nothing else from the government,"" said Nithiarasan.For V Murugaiyan, a load man of Thalaingyar in Nagapattinam district, farming was a new venture that ended with his suicide. He had taken three acres on lease. Despite getting `22,340 subsidy from the state, he incurred heavy losses. He was found hanging at the house. His wife, daughter and mentally challenged son now bear the burden of his decision.Meanwhile, more than a dozen instances of cardiac arrests of farmers have been reported in the delta districts in the past one month and if it is any indicator, all of them suffered losses due to crop failure, said Dhanapalan. Farmers are in a debt-trap, which contributes to suicide deaths, said S Janakarajan of the Madras Institute of Development Studies. ""About 70% of debt is due to their dependence on private finances at high rates of interest,"" he said.The solution lies in the government ensuring timely availability of cheap institutional credit, better availability of seeds, fertilizers and water. Groundwater recharge should be ensured on a war footing so that decline of ground water table can be stopped, he said."

About 100 acres in Cheruivady in Kodiyathur panchayat has been turned into a paddy field after about 20 years.

They demanded registering of FIR against the company and stringent action for misleading the consumers.The matter was raised in question hour on Wednesday by ruling party members Sharad Sonawane, Sanjay Savkare and Tarasingh. They wanted to know what action was taken by the government against the oil manufacturer. A food and drugs administration (FDA) raid was conducted on the company's godown located at Ajivali in Panvel taluka of Raigad district in October. The angry members wanted strong action against the company as the said oil packets carried very unrealistic claims about the oil's qualities.Responding to the volley of questions, minister of state for FDA, Madan Yearwar admitted that the raid was carried out and oil stocks worth over Rs94 lakh were seized. Later, from the lab reports it was established that the refined rice bran oil had acid value above the prescribed standards and that Vivo brand oil packets carried about claims that were misleading.Senior member Eknath Khadse demanded that a FIR be filed and the company be charged with criminal complicity. Ex-CM Prithviraj Chavan raised some of the claims regarding the oil's ability to fight diabetes and heart ailments and wondered if the company was selling edible oil or medicine. Vijay Wadettiwar and Shashikant Shinde also sought stringent action against the oil manufacturer.Yerawar informed the house that that notices under section 24 of Food Safety and Standards Act 2006 were issued and necessary legal action would be taken against Adani company for selling substandard edible oil and misleading quality claims."

The coin-sized savoury that closely resembles the puri expect for that it is crisp and crunchy, is now not prepared as much and, if at all, is more local to the villages. ""We used to have voddes as part of the Christmas lunch when we were growing up in Panaji,"" says historian Maria Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, though she adds that even then, the voddes were more popular in rural Goa.There was a reason for this. voddes are prepared from local rice which has not undergone the par-boiling process.""Those who grew paddy would keep a certain quantity of un-husked rice aside, especially to prepare vodde,"" Costa says. This would then be de-husked and made into flour. Back in time, the dantem was used to grind the rice. The coarse flour went into making vodde, while the finer quality was used for dodol, another Christmas dish, but one that continues to remain popular.The preparation is much akin to that of puris only that these are much smaller and they are deep fried till crispy. ""The hardness varies depending on when you plan to serve them,"" says Costa. If you are partaking of it at lunch, then they are slightly softer like puris and a tad bit bigger than the harder variety. But, if evening tea is in mind, then voddes are usually hard. The taste of the savoury is such that it complements almost everything from stew to black tea, thus, making it a versatile accompaniment.""But, some even choose to make it sweet by adding a little sugar or jaggarey,"" say ex-teacher, E Costa of Colva, who shares that sweets such as bebinca were once the closely guarded secrets of the elite and so the lesser privileged made do with items like sweet vodde and mandare.The type of vodde prepared - soft or hard - also depends on the kneading and flattening process, as also the flour used  wheat or rice.

However, even Rs 100 notes were no longer available by the evening of Monday.""When new Rs 2,000 notes arrived, the acute cash shortage problem was eased to some extent, but the unavailability of corresponding Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes continued to create problems for both the consumers and businessmen,"" said Lalhruaia, an Aizawl local.Those who withdraw cash from banks and ATMs can mostly withdraw Rs 2,000 notes, he said, adding that the need was more for Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes.Meanwhile, people in the Khawbung rural development block area, which borders Myanmar, have done away with the use of Indian rupee notes and have adopted rudimentary paper notes due to the cash shortage.Mapuia, an activist in Khawbung village, said the use of unofficial paper money has been discontinued from Friday due to the arrival of lower notes to Khawbung and its surrounding villages.Villagers had been engaging in cashless transactions. Shopkeepers who did not have change for bigger notes had been writing the amount due to the customer on a piece of paper which was being used to purchase other commodities later.The village council president of the nearby Thekte village said the ration shopkeeper has been giving rice to villagers on credit and has resorted to maintaining accounts as there was a dearth of smaller denominations in the remote location."

Public feelings went through a roller coaster ride after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes on November 8.Unarguably the most talked-about and impacting event of the year gone by, the prime minister's announcement first caught the general public by surprise before panic set in. As residents made a beeline for ATMs to withdraw in hundreds and fifties, many others rushed to petrol bunks where the demonetised notes were accepted. The scene shifted to banks from the next day where many wanted to deposit their old notes.Long queues outside ATMs which barely had cash to service less than half the number lined up was a common sight. In fact, a few hapless souls lost their lives standing in these long-winding ATM queues. Hardpressed for cash, women had to go back to the ageold tradition of exchanging goods with many housewives exchanging things in their homes for cash. ""My neighbour purchased rice in bulk and I exchanged my vegetables and other condiments in exchange for rice,"" said K Latha of K K Nagar. In fact this has led to better neighbourhood relations now as it has become a regular practice now, says she.The City Corporation which has been struggling to collect dues was able to garner over Rs 5 crore in a single day, its highest daily earning as it came forward to accept the demonetised notes for payment of taxes.It also resulted in many people, predominantly workers in brick kilns and others losing their jobs, as their employers could not pay them on time. Construction activities came to a standstill for the first three weeks after the announcement. Though it was announced that bankers would work overtime to serve the people, most of the banks downed shutters by afternoon as they ran out of cash. Many ATMS still continue to be shut.The flower market in Madurai, one of the biggest in south Tamil Nadu , ran into hardships after the announcement as the vendors could not be paid and the traders and the flower farmers faced heavy losses.Trade and Industry at first hailed the move declaring that the people would have to bear the initial pain as it was for the larger good of the nation. However, two weeks later, the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated that they were facing losses and that the government should take corrective steps. Many exclusive markets like jaggery in Palani were closed indefinitely as they found it hard to tide over the crisis."

There are reports that he committed suicide due to financial crisis, including a bank loan of Rs15,000 and other debts from private sources. Distress on account of cash crunch due to demonetisation is also being blamed for his death. This could not be confirmed, though, even as the family said dearth of cash had left them in a grave situation.Bhaiyyalal's daughter-in-law was pregnant and a sonography was due in a few days, but the family did not have cash for that, they said.Farmers' suicides are not a problem in the paddy growing belt of Gondia-Bhandara districts of Vidarbha. Bhaiyyalal's body was found on a heap of burned paddy stack. The police are investigating the matter, which has not been registered as a case suicide due to farm crisis.Paddy growers are facing a tough time due to the cash crunch. Despite a good harvest, they are not able to get money from traders, who are pleading lack of cash.TOI contacted Bhaiyyalal's son, Subhash Chawarke, who could not confirm the reason of the death. ""Father left the house saying he would be back soon, but did not return. When we looked around, his body was found on the heap of burned paddy,"" said Subhash.Subhash said he could not figure out any reason, but he believed that it might have been due to the loans and not demonetisation. However, he did say the family was facing a crisis due to the cash crunch, and did not have money for the impending sonography.Pradip Bawanthade, the police patil who reported the incident, said the deceased was a hard working person and did not have any history of mental illness. Bawanthade also confirmed that shortage of cash had hit paddy growers. Rice millers were trying to dole out scrapped notes to cultivators and banks in the village had hardly any cash to exchange or allow withdrawals.The preliminary report by the tehsildar refers to it as a case of death due to burning. It mentions the deceased had a pending loan of Rs15,000.District collector Abhimanyu Kale said he was so far unaware of any suicide by a farmer. He said the district administration is running a three-day drive apprising the rural population about cashless economy, and the response was tremendous. Nearly 200 village level meetings will be held. Though the villagers were not entirely unaware of the concept, but were curious to know about it. ""There is a cash crunch but there have been no complaints as such,"" he said."
58d79ba5a3d24b75f276d437,Farm Loan Waiver: Why It's Just a Poll Sop,http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/farm-loan-waivers-why-its-just-a-poll-sop/story-zwfE3pAe1eqdwTzOBBS4EL.html,2016-12-28,"In the wake of the demonetisation impact on the economy, especially the farmers, a Congress delegation recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding a farm loan waiver.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said since the government waived loans worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore to corporates, it should do the same for farmers.However, most banks are against the loan waiver, claiming that it will encourage farmers not to repay their loans.So far, the Centre has waived farm loans twice: in 1990 and 2008. Under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme of 2008, the government waived entire loans to marginal and small farmers (those with landholding of up to 2 hectares) and offered one-time relief of 25% to other farmers.The government disbursed Rs 52,516.86 crore up to 2011-12 under the scheme, according to International Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).Farmers plightBut farmers are struggling. They are facing decreasing landholdings, high input costs, falling water table, and deteriorating soil quality. As agriculture growth has slowed, farmers income has also fallen, making it difficult for them to pay for the increasingly costly inputs. This then forces them to take loans.With many small farmers still not eligible for bank credit, they borrow money from non-institutional sources, which charge exorbitant interest rates. And it only takes one or two failed crops for them to fall into a debt trap.Prof. Swaminathan highlighted the farmers plight this year, saying, Punjab farmers, at the heartland of the Green Revolution, with an average farm size of 3.79 hectares, growing wheat and rice get an income which is less than the starting salary of a Class Four employee.  That is the crisis in Indian agriculture.Farmers in arid lands face an even more bleak situation as they depend entirely on rains and are not insured against the vagaries of the weather.Considering the many risks involved in farming and little government support, many debt-ridden farmers are driven to suicide. A UN report said one farmer committed suicide every 32 minutes between 1997 and 2005.2008 loan waiver impactOne would expect that two loan waivers would have relieved the plight of the farmers. But they didnt. According to a paper published by the Indian Statistical Institute in 2013, there was deterioration in the repayment of loans after the loan waiver of 2008.It said all three groups  small and marginal farmers, bigger farmers, and farmers who had not defaulted on their loans took longer to repay their loans after the loan waiver.Moreover, the paper says the loan officers will reduce lending after the waiver as compared to before as the punishment for making a bad loan is more than the reward for lending wisely. Since the probability of default is higher for farmers who had done so earlier, loan officers reject their applications. These are mostly small and marginal farmers. In the end, the debt relief results in fewer farmers getting access to credit, which is the exact opposite of what the government had intended to achieve.Other criticismsA 2015 ICRIER paper says the massive write-off of loans in 2008 took its toll on the banks, increasing the non-performing assets of commercial banks threefold between 2009-10 and 2012-13. Moreover, the scheme was criticised for excluding farmers  mostly in arid lands  who owned more than 2 hectares. Those who borrowed from money lenders also didnt benefit from the scheme.Way forwardThe ICRIER paper says generalised loan waivers should be avoided as these impair the agricultural credit channels. It says targeted loan waivers with case-by-case examination may just do the trick. It said the results would be better if waivers were a part of a comprehensive package, including public investment and other incentives."

Most of the artisans in this Maoist hit block make bamboo products for a living and now, these families are neither able to buy raw materials nor sell their finished products in the wholesale market. Denomination of Rs 2,000 currency poses a new challenge for them as it is too big an amount for their petty needs.Mohan Mohali, a resident of the village , told TOI that he along with his three family members manage to earn Rs 6,000 a month but since note ban, the earning has stopped . ""It is a big blow to our livelihood and none of the local leaders, politicians or government authorities have taken pains to see our condition. Now a days boiled rice is our breakfast, lunch and dinner as there is no loose change to buy pulses or vegetables,"" said Mohali.Aasandabur village which is a part of Ojhadih Katania panchayat has nearly 45 houses and apart from one person who has passed Class X, the rest are uneducated and only depend on bamboo-weaving business . Chhatabad, the village adjacent to Aasandabur, has 40 minority families earning their living by making wooden rolling pins and cots and is in a similar plight. ""We usually sell our products in the wholesale market or take our product to Bihar and sell door-to-door. Loose currency is required at every step right from bus fare to daily food expenses. As we belong to a Maoist dominated area, the traders refuse to give us raw materials on loan,"" said Salim Kazi, an artisan who makes rolling pins.Another village of the same panchayat, Rajak Tola, is a hub of broom manufacturers . This village sells brooms across the state and in a few districts of Bihar and West Bengal. Their business has also taken a hit due to the shortage of cash.Tundi block pramukh Kamla Murmu, while speaking to TOI, said that absence of Rs 500 notes is the main hurdle for the artisans. She added that the grievances would be voiced at the zila parishad meet soon. Murmu also said that most of the villagers do not have bank accounts and the usage of plastic money and other alternatives are out of the question as people here are not educated.DC A Dodde said that immediate steps would be taken to help out the poor. He added a team of bankers and district authorities would be sent on Sunday to take stock of the situation and address the grievances."

Whether they are TN cricket fans, relatives of contemporary cricketers, selectors, coaches, Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) administrators or veterans, the only mission that binds them together is to see the TN team lift the Ranji Trophy.And when they come, they come armed. Sharp at 9am, one would see them walk into the stadium with lunch boxes, water bottles, newspapers and even towels  essentials to last the day. The crowd includes first division cricketers who get inspired by watching the likes of Dinesh Karthik and Abhinav Mukund on the field. At times, they are joined by TNCA president N Srinivasan, who too cheers his boys from the vacant stands.But they are unpardonably critical too. ""Why have a deep point for an off-spinner at the start of the day, can't understand it..."" one ardent TN supporter would shout during the match. ""Venkataraghavan, Vasudevan, Sunil Subramaniam would have run through sides on these sort of pitches. But these guys are struggling,"" another would join in, shaking his head in disapproval.For another bunch of loyalists, the post tea session is the time to share interesting stories and anecdotes. They don't care if it's a Vasudevan, a PC Prakash or a Srinivasan sitting next to them. They pour out praises and brickbats without inhibitions - something that reflects their passion for TN cricket and the fact that the state which prides itself on possessing one of the best cricketing leagues in the country hasn't clinched a Ranji since its win in 1987-1988.For these fans, the current Ranji Trophy season, however, has turned out to be a huge dampener because of the concept of neutral venues. Abhinav Mukund & Co have not played a match at Chepauk and have been on the road for more than two months.R Sundaravaradhan, 85, has been following TN cricket since India attained Independence. His words are so team-centric that one would forget that he is the grandfather of TN all-rounder R Malolan. A senior advocate in the Supreme Court, Sundaravaradhan seldom misses out on a Ranji tie at Chepauk and is ""disappointed"" that he couldn't catch any action this year.It's not just the septuagenarians. Twenty-seven-year-old S Pandiaraj, a lower division league cricketer from Vellore, is a constant visitor to every TN Ranji tie. He would bunk classes and head for the ground on all four days with a lunch bag. ""I'm the first cricketer in my family. It's sad that there is no TN match here. There is hardly any interest when outstation teams play here,"" he said.Chairman of selectors S Sharath feels the emotional connect is missing this year. ""Even at 44, I touch my mother's feet before I head for any match as a referee or a selector. As a fan, I feel the emotional connect is missing as our own team is not playing in Chepauk this year. But as a selector, I'm glad that our boys have done brilliantly so far,"" said Sharath, who has played 139 first-class matches.Although they miss the action at Chepauk this year, most fans say they want TN to play hard and win the trophy, whatever ground they are playing on."

We were expecting some help from the government. However, instead of coming up with a solution, the CM chose to pass the buck on Centre and talked about high moisture content. Even if there is no moisture, our produces cannot be procured unless we get revenue rent receipt,"" said Yashwant Singh, a farmer. The Centre has fixed minimum 17% moisture content in paddy.Blaming the Centre for fixing moisture content, the CM said the state government was exploring the possibility of introducing dryer system at procurement centres to bring down moisture content in paddy to the required level.As part of his 'Nishchay Yatra', the CM visited Muradabad Primary Agriculture Credit Society (PACS) on the outskirts of Sasaram on Thursday and inspected overnight commissioned dryer at the rice mill run by the PACS. He said the state government would promote dryer system to avoid delay in paddy procurement at minimum support price.""A proposal in this regard has been sent to the Centre. The state government has no role in fixing the minimum level of moisture,"" the CM said, adding that as a pilot project, some rice mills equipped with dryer system would be attached with the PACS.Farmers and rice millers, however, termed the proposal ""impractical"". Rice millers of Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and other states, who have been camping here for last one month, said the process of bringing down the moisture level through dryer system is very expensive and time taking."

Observing this, city-based Jankidevi Bajaj Gram Vikas Sanstha (JBGVS) has launched the Nutrition Project, which aims at training the tribals about the importance of a nutritious diet and how one can utilise local crops like nachni.Watch What Else Is Making News:The project has already been introduced in two of the villages under Khed taluka  Ghotwadi and Adhalwadi. Other villages covered under the project include Mormarwadi, Khandi, Kusavli, Vadeshwar, Savla, Malegaon, Goregaon, Khamkarwadi, Eklahare and Dehne.Tribal communities mostly do hard physical work and hence need good nutrition. JBGVS is trying to address this issue through its economic development and healthcare initiatives, said Meena Hinge, Project Officer, JBGVS. The Nutrition Project, in line with the priority areas of the Government of Maharashtra, is being undertaken in association with the governments Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme and Primary Health Centres (PHCs).JBGVS work in the field of integrated rural development started in 1987 with focus on five areas  education, healthcare, environment, social development and economic development. It operates in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.Started to help adolescent girls, the organisation has now expanded its focus with the introduction of programmes for pregnant and lactating women, along with children up to the age of six.The project follows a typical standard operating system (SOP), spanning over at least six months. Typically, the work in any village starts off with a scientifically-conducted survey, which helps identify the level of malnourishment. Following which, counselling and training sessions on the importance of nutrition are conducted, which include preparation of nutritious recipes with locally-grown grains and vegetables. Finally, the participants undergo a medical check-up and necessary follow-ups. Moreover, to inculcate healthy-eating habits, a nutritious diet is also provided to most villagers, particularly to severely-malnourished children and women, once or twice a year.These training sessions encourage the consumption of locally-available rice like Indrayani (particularly unpolished or hand pounded rice) and fruits0s like karvand as an essential source of nutrition.Use of unpolished rice has lost popularity even in the villages, in line with the trends in big cities where consumption of local cereals like nachni, jwari, bajri and unpolished rice has been replaced by certain varieties of wheat and polished rice.Talking about a recent session in Maval taluka, Project Officer Sangeeta Walke said, In a recent session in Vadeshwar village, pregnant and lactating mothers were informed about the use of sprouted pulses and local vegetables for making tasty recipes like bhel.Walke said the project has helped in regenerating sustainable traditional-eating habits and use of local nutritious grains. Revival of the use of nachni flour, sukdi (a type of wheat flour) and sattu (multi-grain flour) for tasty and healthy dishes like upma, shira and laddoos clearly indicates that the project has been a success.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Theres not much that can be done when one is bombarded with those moist and boozy plum cakes, crisp rose cookies and warm, addictive kalkals. Sooner or later, youre going to tuck into those sugary treats, throwing your fitness plans into disarray.For those looking to disprove statistics, there are ways to have your cake and eat it too. Celebrities from actors Arjun Kapoor to Kriti Sanon swear that finding the right balance is key, while others like Rakul Preet Singh say that doubling ones hours at the gym works wonders. Read on to find out how to keep it tight and ripped through the party season.Rakul Preet Singh ActorRakul, who owns a franchise of the F45 gym in Hyderabad, is armed with oodles of self-control and wont be swayed by festivals. Even if I cheat, I ensure Im in control and work out a couple of hours extra. I do let go when the occasion demands it and recommend that everybody does so, as nothing happens if you cheat for a day, says Rakul, adding that she has become fitness obsessed of late.The one trick that keeps her in her svelte form? She doesnt eat after 10 pm when shes out partying. Rakul believes fitness is a way of life rather than a means to an end. You have to take it up as a lifestyle change, not a 15- or 20-day challenge for the New Year, says the actor.I believe in the three-bite rule  if I want to have an ice-cream and its not the right time of day, I just take one bite. This helps cut the cravings. You have the second bite as you like the taste, and by the time you have the third bite, you no longer crave it.Every time you feel like indulging, think of the effort you have to put in later to burn it. Stick to small quantities. When it comes to skincare, home remedies are her go-to. I have a combination skin, which doesnt get too dry. I use a face pack made with honey, curd, and papaya. Banana with curd is great for the winter, she says.Rajeev Pillai ActorYou are what you eat. This adage lies at the heart of Rajeevs fitness philosophy. Eighty per cent of my workout mantra is centred on diet. Between shoots, whenever I hit the gym, I focus on 45 minutes of weight training to keep my body fat content below 10 per cent, shares Pillai, who received rave reviews for his performance in the recent blockbuster film Oru Muthassi Gadha.The former dentist and model from Tiruvalla insists there are no shortcuts to get fit quick, and encourages enthusiasts to take up mixed martial arts (MMA).My regimen involves jiujitsu, capoeira, karate, boxing and CrossFit, under the watchful eye of city-based trainer Midhun Jith, a two-time kickboxing world champion and Guinness Record holder, says the actor. For online pointers on workout routines (if only to renew those New Year resolutions), Rajeev suggests the YouTube channel UlissesWorld.Roopesh Peethambaran ActorRoopeshs weight-loss journey is an inspiring one. The director-turned-actor went from 95 to 75 kilos in two months! The 36-year-old took the old-school routegruelling hours at the gym coupled with a rigorous yet balanced diet plan that excludes dairy, sugar, rice and starch. I play the antagonist in the upcoming movie Oru Mexican Aparatha, which is set in the 70s, and deals with college politics.While shooting a promo song, I first saw myself onscreen. Thats when the realisation hit home, hard. My transformation inspired actor Kunchacko Boban to hit the gym as well, claims the director, who helmed popular flicks like You Too Brutus.As he had 60 days before shooting resumed, he took his co-star Tovino Thomas advice and started working out with city-based fitness expert Shyjan Augustine, who also trains the actors Unni Mukundan and Nivin Pauly.I will try to stick to my original workout plan during the holiday season. It involves three hours of cardio  treadmill, ground exercises and cross-training  in the morning, followed by three hours of compound weight training in the evenings, says the actor, adding that before heading out to parties, he munches on honey-infused hazelnut granola bars to stave off the hunger pangs. Hoping to shed a few kilos to fit into that NYE suit? Roopesh reveals his diet secrets  a cup of green tea and a robusta (pre-workout) followed by brown bread and egg whites for breakfast, two rotis, steamed broccoli and grilled fish for lunch, and oats for dinner. Feel free to indulge during social gatherings, especially Christmas and New Year. But remember, moderation is key, cautions Roopesh.Arjun Kapoor ActorThe 31-year-old Arjun, last seen in Ki & Ka, is admired for his weight-loss before his debut with Ishaqzaade. The six-foot tall actor admits that going to the gym is like breathing. Dont you take a shower every day? Going to the gym is similar  it becomes a part of your lifestyle, he says.Arjun, who was last seen walking the ramp for Falguni and Shane Peacock at the recent Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2016 in Bengaluru, shares a few personal pointers on how to stay fit this season. Choose your parties wisely, dont attend all, or else you will end up overeating. The second rule is to eatdinner early. Eat whatever you want, but eat by 6 pm, and avoid bread and rice as much as you can. Plus, drink lots of water to stay hydrated. The actor also insists on working out for a fixed duration of time every day, no matter what time of the day you choose.Dipika Palikal Squash championThe first Indian to break into the top 10 in the PSA world ranking and currently ranked 23, Dipika is one of Indias most loved sportswomen. An adrenaline junkie like her cricketer husband, Dinesh Karthik, the squash player says they work out together and love to try adventure sports. Dipika says the festive season has not changed her fitness schedule. I train every day, except the Christmas weekend. A self-confessed foodie, she has her cheat days too, but they come at a price. I put in an extra hour to work out to strike that balance. When it comes to skincare, Dipika believes in keeping it simple. I dont experiment with products. I stick to Clinique or Giorgio Armani moisturiser and Estee Lauder night repair face oil, she shares."

Fry it and there you go, potato chicken dumplings for your New Year party!Ive been a chef for seven years now and specialise in continental cuisine. But, I want to perfect my hand in my traditional cuisine  Chettinadu! The most difficult dish to prepare and which also turns out to be my favourite is Chettinadu fish curry. A small incorrect measurement can change flavours and wreck it. But someday, I will perfect it!I love sea food and I can live on it, especially garlic flavoured prawns; some delicious sea food on a plaintain leaf while sitting on the floor at my home with loved ones. Blissful, really! And an extra spoon of butter maybe? My favourite ingredient has always been butter. It can take your dish to another level of delicious! You know, as much as Im a jovial chef at my work place, I can get a little tensed and worked up at home when food gets wasted. I wonder whybut I love my food and my family. (smiles) I was very young when I began to appreciate the art.I would help mother make chappatis, dosas and chutneys too! I continued to follow her recipes for a while, then began to learn from senior chefs at work before I began to experiment myself. Once, I tried a dish with polenta pasta and fish. Instead of using cornflakes as crumbs to cover the meat, I used polenta pasta. It came out well and the crispiness lasted for a long time! I also cooked in a silver foil pouch which caused every ingredient to retain their individual flavours.Experimenting with food can bring a lot of surprises!Heres another tip. You must always have your curd rice cold. Try this: Add Sauteed ginger, small onions, chilli and curry leaves to the curd rice mixture and serve warm. The flavours of ginger and shallot will be different and you will love it!"

With farm labourers not trained, precision farming was abandoned by over 50 per cent of farmers.Kamalakannan himself pleaded guilty on that count and said the benefits of the schemes will be adopted only when those at the ground level have been trained properly. Not only agriculturists, but also agricultural labourers should be trained to use modern technologies and this should be assessed periodically.Kamalakannan said farmers and those engaged in water management will have to adopt new technologies because of issues such as increasing population, overdrawing groundwater, intrusion of saline water and water-pollution. The CGWB is taking steps to enhance water resources, he said adding that a map of the underground water resources would be beneficial to those in water management.Kamalakannan said the main crops in Puducherry are paddy and sugar cane, both of which are water intensive crops.He said five lakh litres of water are required for cultivating one acre of paddy. Similarly, 12 lakh litres of water are required for cultivating one acre of sugarcane, he said. So it is essential that farmers should switch over to precision farming.There were 40,000 hectares of agricultural land 15 years ago, which had shrunk to 10,000 hectares because of the conversion of fertile land into housing plots. Encroachments have also brought down othe acreage of agri land, the minister said."

This was the third big seizure in the district in as many months. Officials said they had seized 30 tonnes of ration rice in November and prior to that 22 tonnes in October in the district.They also pointed out that ration rice smuggling has been on the rise in the district as there was a huge demand for it in Palakkad and a few other districts in Kerala. So far this year, the district has reported 68 cases of PDS rice smuggling.Thursday's seizure came after district supply officer G Saravanamurthy and a flying squad led by tahsildar Dhanabal checked the Egmore-Mangaluru express after they received information that some miscreants were smuggling a huge quantity of ration rice in the train.During the search, they recovered more than 15 gunny bags containing ration rice that were kept beneath the seats. ""No one has claimed the responsibility for transporting the rice. We will hand the seized rice over to the civil supplies-CID police for further investigation,"" the officials said.To keep in check the smuggling of ration rice, Saravanamurthy said they, along with the civil supplies-CID police, had intensified vehicle check in the inter-state border areas. ""At times, some smugglers play tricks to divert the officials' attention by providing wrong information. Despite this, we seize tonnes of ration rice every month,"" he said.The civil supplies-CID police and the flying squad, he said, had seized 30 tonnes of PDS rice last month and 22 tonnes in October. ""We have taken stringent action against three ration shops staff for selling the rice to smugglers. People can inform civil supplies department officials if they find any malpractices in rations shops,"" the district supply officer said.Coimbatore district has 1,402 rations shops and 10.89 lakh ration card holders. ""Many people buy ration rice and sell it to smugglers or their agents for 5 per kg. They then polish the rice and smuggle to Kerala where they sell it for 12- 20 per kg. Selling the PDS rice to smugglers is also an offence and those who do so will also be punished legally,"" Saravanamurthy said.The district supply officer said the department has taken several measures to control the ration rice smuggling."

At such a juncture, she came across a post on Facebook  a cabbie was ready to give ride for lunches. ""He was living as a paying guest but had no cash left after the first week of demonetisation,"" said Gupta. ""I got him food from home and he drove me to work.""Bartering is suddenly in focus. People are exchanging simple items such as rice and oil for services on online barter portals. Sahil Dhingra, co-founder of Let's Barter India, reported ""a 60% rise in the listing of need-based items, which is a direct impact of demonetisation. ""There were several listings where people wanted to barter phone recharges for car rides and other utilities,"" said Dhingra.On the whole, Let's Barter India has seen a 150% hike in the number of hits in the last one month, particularly after demonetisation. Similarly, BarterDaddy, another online barter forum, has seen an 8% rise in sales of utilities from nil until a month ago.But why barter? Dhingra explained, ""Primarily because this is one way to get value for money without having to shell out cash. We have the example of a woman who wanted to get a photographer for her bakery show willing to pay for it in the form of baked goodies.""Gupta confirmed this. ""My arrangement with the cab driver was a great deal  he needed food and I needed a ride,"" she reminisced. ""It helped that he and I had a few common friends, which helped in building trust between us. I ended up using his cab for three days.""Harinder Singh, founder of BarterDaddy, claimed food was a hot seller on his portal. ""We have a lot of corporates looking at exchanging services for food coupons which they give to their employees,"" he said. ""We've also had travel agencies bartering services for restaurant coupons or for products made by these restaurants.""Both Dhingra and Singh felt demonetisation had given the barter system a modern-day dimension.

Petitioners said that the Punjab education development board has appointed one NGO  Gram Vikas Educational Society, Ferozepur, headed by rice mill owner Devinderpal Dhawan  as a private partner for running administration of the Adarsh school under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode.The petition said that Dhawan and the rice mill owned by him were facing two FIRs and at least 26 cases for bounced cheques under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1885. The FIRs include one filed by Punjab Markfed also under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC for misappropriation of paddy worth Rs 3.21 crore.

Lined with crammed homes and repulsive odour of dampness, these messes or shared accommodations have become home to thousands of migrant professionals who troop into 'hi-tech' Hyderabad every day with dreams of making it big in IT industry.Bogged down by unimpressive salaries and responsibilities back home, these professionals have made peace with the watered-down 'sambar' and thick-grained rice that kitchens dish out as part of a package deal. So unhygienic are conditions that at times kitchens share a common wall with toilets. Also, garbage bins are often not cleared and there are frequent power outages. But terrible living conditions have not deterred people choosing to live here. Their only objective remains to be able to 'swipe' into office - most of them located within a five-kilometre radius -- by 9 am sharp.""A group of us came to the city two months ago to join an IT company. We had a limited budget and had to meet all our needs within that. This place we are staying in provides all basic amenities including food. It might not be great, but we manage,"" said Lakshmana Rao, who shares his match-box-sized space with four others. For a monthly rent of Rs 12,000, split five ways, he says he couldn't have asked for more. Especially because he has to send half his salary (about Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000) to his parents in the village.Rao is among many others travelling from places, including Tirupati, Vijayawada, Nellore and Elluru who occupy such messes, hostels and PG accommodations.The Nanakramguda region alone has over 50 such pigeonholes. In fact, such is the demand that realty market watchers say there are more such modest homes getting ready soon. That many might be in complete violation of every building norm, is another story.""It is tough for bachelors to find houses as most home owners prefer families. I was rejected several times before I found this working men's hostel. Though small, it is fun to live in a room with other guys your age,"" said Venkat Rao , making light of the stench emitting from the sewerage line running next to this building. ""You can't get everything. At least there is food and someone to wash your clothes,"" the 33-year-old IT executive said.If it were up to him Bondi, an entry-level professional, would have liked to live in the heart of Hi-Tec City. But he couldn't shell out the Rs 10,000 that PGs there demanded for a room with two square meals. ""All of us want to live well, but it must also suit the pocket. Had I opted for an upscale PG, I would have to spend my entire salary only on accommodation,"" Bondi said."

During her 34 years in the AIADMK , starting as MGR's hand-picked propaganda secretary, she went from being media-shy to media-friendly to media-bashing. Early in her political career, she created a coterie to further her public relations. When she realised the futility of presiding over media content, she turned inaccessible. ""If you don't write what I say,"" went the unspoken dictum, ""I say nothing to you.""Then she threw the carrot away and wielded the stick, firing defamation suits by the dozen at reporters and editors. It may not have had a chilling effect on the collective narration of the media, but it did 'cool down' some sections. It also had the counter effect of producing a few Tamil magazines that broke all norms of decency, including calling her names, which got some journalists jailed.During Jayalalithaa's second term (2001-2006) a TV reporter who entered a government storehouse in Villupuram where stocks of rice were being eaten away by worms was arrested, infuriating some journalist unions. Journalists who protested were picked up and locked away near the Vepery police station from monring to evening, without food or water.More recently, she had filed a defamation suit against a TV news channel editor for airing content objectionable to her. The news editor, with 55 years as a journalist, had served as subeditor in the magazine 'Anna', run by M G Ramachandran. The editor is currently unemployed due to the suit. The suit had also been filed against the reporter and the newsreader who worked on the news story. In a meeting with heads and executive committee members of the Madras Union of Journalists, those present recall her scoffing at a print journalist for writing against her. In her political career, Jayalalithaa has filed more than 150 defamation suits, several of them still pending.As an actor, Jayalalithaa was known to keep to herself, interacting with cast and crew only when necessary. In an interview, Telugu film actor Shobhan Babu who starred in one film with her recalled that he was unsure of approaching her due to her reserved nature.When the media hounded her during her second term, famously at the secretariat, the chief minister promised to meet the press once a week after that. Soon she appointed a liaison office for the same. But she never kept her word and remained inaccessible, say journalists."

From giving away cheap rice to free laptops, her schemes struck a chord not just with the people of her state but several others.Karnataka was among the states, which, inspired by Jay states, which, inspired by Jayalalithaa's welfare policies, introduced similar schemes.Chief minister Siddaramaiah said: ""When Jayalalithaa became the youngest chief minister of Tamil Nadu for the first time, she implemented the cradle baby scheme to counter female infanticide, a scheme appreciated by all.""The Congress government in Karnataka launched a similar scheme, Thottilu Bhagya or Mamatheya Thottilu (Cradle of Love) earlier this year for abandoned newborns.In 2011, after she returned to power, Jayalalithaa distributed 20kg of free rice to each of 1.83 crore family card-holders and 35kg to the poorest of the poor. When Siddaramaiah became CM here in 2013, he launched a similar scheme on his first day in office, naming it the Anna Bhagya scheme.Inspired by Amma Canteens , subsidised food outlets across Tamil Nadu, the Karnataka government has readied a proposal for mobile canteens to provide subsidised meals to the poor at night. The government plans to launch its Anna Canteen pilot project in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi and Kalaburgi, with 20 outlets near hospitals and schools.Karnataka is considering emulating Jayalalithaa's controversial but popular decision to provide 69% reservation, above the Constitutionally mandated limit of 50%. At the recent Belagavi winter session, Siddaramaiah said they were making efforts to increase reservation in education and employment from the current 50% to 70%.In 2014, Karnataka started a scheme to give free laptops to SCST students pursuing professional and PG courses, a scheme similar to the one Jayalalithaa launched in 2011. In 2001, she made installation of rain water harvesting structures mandatory in all buildings in TN, legislation that Karnataka has introduced."

And in all of this stood Fidel Castro as the icon of defiance in the post-Soviet world. For those in Kolkata who have been walking the streets since the ""Tomar nam amar nam Vietnam"" days, Fidel was the last ray of hope in this apparently TINA (there is no alternative) age, who could make people dream about what socialism could be. Castro's connect to Kolkata has been strong since the days of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), when he first touched down at the Kolkata airport in 1973. Later, his slogan  'Socialism or death'  became a popular graffiti in the city.Shyamal Chakrabarty, a fierbrand student leader of the Sixties, fondly recollects how youths in Kolkata rushed to the airport though they couldn't see the leader on transit. ""We couldn't reach up to him. They allowed only Jyoti Basu to meet him,"" Chakrbarty said. Later, though, he caught a glimpse of the leader in Havana. ""We had gone to attend the Youth Conference in Havana. Some of us had scampered out to see the park nearby. It was a soggy afternoon and the park had turned muddy. I and some of the delegate friends, including Somen Mitra (later Pradesh Congress president), could hear an uproar at the conference site. Youths were running after a jeep. We too started running through the park before even giving it a thought. The run took us in front of the jeep, in which we could see Fidel. He waved at us smilingly and left the spot. I still cherish the surprise meeting with the towering personality,"" Chakrabarty said from the Citu all India conference venue at Puri.The romanticism and the unalloyed passion later boiled down to a critical support among the Left youths since the late Eighties. Instead, students in elite institutes started comparing Cuba's performance in the social sector  public health and literacy  with that of India before going all the way for the socialist country. Some also questioned the manner in which Fidel ran his government because by then democracy in socialism had already come under question.What's more, a book  'Fidel and Religion'  published during this time gave a jerk to the usual Left view towards religion. While atheism had become a fad among students in those days, Fidel, in this book based on a long conversation with a Brazilian Catholic priest Frei Betto, held that some Christian values that he imbibed while in school helped him a lot in his future. In a public speech in 1998, Fidel said: ""I feel a great respect for all religions. The Christian religion was the one I best knew, for I spent 12 years  as some of you probably did too  as a boarding student in religious Catholic schools... Those schools were more like a convent than a school because that was a type of life we led for which I am even glad today because it taught me discipline, stoicism, spirit of sacrifice, many positive things. In our culture, as a part of the so called western world, there are undoubtedly components of Christian values. I think that among those values there are ethical humane principles that are applicable to my epoch.""Those who are now in their late forties came to know about Cuba closely when they were in the city universities. Cuba was passing through rough weather due to the blockade. Student-youth groups from the country came down to campuses to talk about their sorry plight. They appealed for support from the Left Front government as well. This became a talking point in Left student organisations against US imperialism. Jyoti Basu, the then chief minister, took the initiative to ship rice and wheat to the people of Cuba, despite criticisms from the opposition. And Fidel responded with his 'socialism or death' slogan, sending out the message that he is not going to buckle under pressure. Later, Basu went to Havana to meet Castro.With Fidel's passing away, the dream is gone."

The number of consignments from the major exporting markets in the state -Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur -have reduced drastically as exporters have not been able to pay farmers and labourers in cash. Export associations in the state said several exporters have shut shop for the time being.Rough estimates indicate that the state exports fruits and vegetables worth over Rs 190 crore every month from November to April, which is the major season for export of these items. This has fallen to exports of only Rs 76 crore now. Also, the quantum of exports has dipped from 350 tonne daily to just around 100 tonne, the sources told TOI. Sources in the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), which comes under the ministry of commerce , told TOI that the export of agriproducts from the state has declined drastically as the note ban has affected labour-intensive micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sectors the most. ""Industries like agriculture depend heavily on labourers, who are temporary workers coming from different parts of the country and do not have bank accounts. These labourers, and even transporters, require to be paid in cash,"" the sources said.The sources, however, said the demonetisation effect on exports was temporary and would fizzle out once there is enough cash flow in the market.They said the government should allow higher bank withdrawals for labour-intensive units. ""As of now, Rs 50,000 can be withdrawn per week from current accounts, which is not enough to pay the labourers,"" they said.A major city-based exporter of fresh fruits, vegetables and foodgrains said exports have dropped by around 80% since November 8.Rakesh Dhumal of the Nagpur Perishable Exporters Association said around 350 tonne fruits and vegetables are sent by air daily from Pune, Nagpur and Mumbai to various countries in the November-April season. ""This has come down to 100 tonne daily . Nagpur now send only around 30 tonne vegetables and fruits by air as against the usual 100 tonne during this season,"" he said.Dhumal said an exporter needs to send at least one tonne of produce by air to make a profit. ""For that, he needs at least Rs 50,000 to get the produce from the farmers and pay for packaging and transport. Export consignments sent from one city to another have also come to a standstill as exporters do not have cash to pay the transporters,"" he added.A Nagpur-based exporter that sends agri-products to Dubai told TOI that they are working on a minimum profit margin. ""Our margin was over 20% earlier. Now, however, the margin over one container of 25 tonne rice is less than 10%. Importers in Dubai know that agri-products in India have become cheaper with the currency ban and are importing goods at a lower cost. My exports to Dubai have fallen 70%,"" he said.A top source from the state's Vegetable and Fruits Exporters Association said, ""Even those involved in packaging products need cash as they are dailywage workers. Exports of fruits and vegetables have dipped by over 30% since November."""

One of the boys standing in the patient queue before the ATM kiosk on the other side of the road walked up to him and said, ""Do you take money on Paytm?"" When Akhtar said, ""No"", he replied with a degree of helpless resignation, "" Cash nahi hai mere paas. Paytm hota to achha hota (I don't have cash. It would have been nice, if you were using Paytm).""The scene and dialogue was repeated over the next few days. Several youngsters from the adjacent New Ashok Nagar colony would pose the same query. In regular circumstances, Akhtar wouldn't have spared much thought to the persistent question. For the past two years, the 35-year-old from Bihar's Samastipur district has been peddling vegetable biryani from a mobile food stall near the New Ashok Nagar metro station. For Rs 30 a plate, he serves a decent helping of the flavoured rice garnished with slices of soyabean chop, tiny pieces of paneer, tomato chutney, chopped onion and chilli pickle. And business is generally brisk.But last month his sales plunged after Prime Minister Narendra Moditriggering a sudden shortfall of currency. Daily-wagers, auto-rickshaw drivers, college students and young executives - the bulk of his customers were not turning up. ""I often took back home kilos of unsold biryani. For about a week, I stopped coming here,"" says Akhtar, who goes by the name Aman-ji. When he resumed business, the customers returned but not in the same numbers as in pre-notebandi days. Some would still ask about the option of paying through Paytm.So when an executive from the mobile wallet company came by a week ago and offered him the option of taking payments through the mobile wallet, Akhtar reluctantly decided to give it a try. The biryani seller was uncertain because it meant having to part with a small portion of his earnings as the company's commission. And though, he is ""inter pass,"" Akhtar wasn't fully sure how the technology would work.It is easy to understand Akhtar's hesitance. Like millions of other migrants, the son of a daily-wager came to Delhi in search of a better life about 15 years ago. The third among seven brothers and sisters, he did a variety of odd jobs in the NCR before finding his true calling: selling biryani. The food cart sustains his family- his wife and three kids.He wakes up around 5 am, helps his wife prepare the biryani and sets up his roadside cart by 8 am. The hawking is done by 4.30 pm. A brief rest at home and he sets off to the grocers to buy all that he needs the next day. Has he ever considered selling chicken or mutton biryani? The migrant mumbles something about wanting to sell "" shudh khana .""Akhtar is cagey about divulging details of his daily returns. And he doesn't want to reveal the number of customers who use the mobile wallet. ""About 10-12 customers every day,"" he says after a little cajoling. During the two hours TOI spent interviewing him, four customers paid through Paytm. A couple of others were requested to pay in cash if they were carrying currency. The biryani seller explains why. ""I would have to stand in a bank queue again to get my money. So I prefer people paying in cash. But when they say, they don't have any, I let them use Paytm,'' he says.One such customer is Sumendra Singh, a 26-year-old who works in the customer services division of a mobile phone company. ""I am short of cash. There's too much work and no time to stand in the queue. I haven't even brought my wallet,"" he says.This month, as usual, the company transferred Singh's salary to his bank account. He shifted Rs 1,000 to his mobile wallet. At the food cart, Singh scans the Paytm bar code and transfers Rs 30 to Akhtar's mobile phone. "" Zara mobile check kar lijiye. Mera payment aur number ka message aa gaya hoga (Check your mobile. You would have got a message about my payment and phone number),"" he says. Akhtar asks for the last four numbers of the customer's mobile number, looks into his own phone and serves him.Slowly and cautiously, the migrant from Bihar has embraced the world of mobile wallet business."

The drive was for mobilising food and medicine for Cuba, the tiny neighbour of the United States, which was being strangulated by western countries using economic sanctions.The fall of USSR in 1991 almost orphaned Cuba and world over communist movements launched campaigns to save Cuban citizens who had been fighting all odds to ensure the triumph of socialism. By December 1992, the Indian communists sent 10,000 tonnes each of wheat and rice in a ship `Caribbean Princess' that departed from Haldia in Kolkata. Senior leaders of CPM Harkishan Singh Surjeet and M A Baby flew to Havana to personally hand over the shipment to Fidel Castro . They were accorded a warm welcome followed by a near 3-hour conversation with Castro.The communist parties in India were initially reluctant to accept the identity of Cuba.In fact, Jawaharlal Nehru accepted Castro much before the communist movements. ""The guerrilla warfare used by Castro and Che Guevara was not acceptable to Indian communists. They didn't approve the path"", said RMP leader K S Hariharan. ""By 70's their attitude began to change and Cuban solidarity movement became active in the state"", he said.It was the collapse of Soviet Union that reinforced the love of Indian communists for Cuba.""The role played by Cuba in busting the myth that `socialism is an outdated concept' during post-USSR days is significant. By sticking on to Marxist-Leninist principles, Cuba reinforced the idea of socialism and socialism alone"", recalled chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Matching Scandinavia in health and education was a target of both Cuba and Kerala.When the V S Achuthanandan government took over in 2006, health minister P K Sreemathy was sent to Cuba to study their model of health care. ""The free treatment for all was an unparalleled concept. They were practically unaware of vector-borne diseases as cleanliness was paramount in society. The concept of family doctor was one that attracted me most"", Sreemathy told TOI.After the visit, Sreemathy went on to implement Cuban model healthcare in the state and even appointed a family doctor at Vattiyoorkavu as a pilot project.Recently , Castro unknowingly played a major role in dousing factional fire in Kerala CPM.After the election, when there was the big question of who will lead the government, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury suggested Pinarayi Vijayan's name but not before designating V S Achuthanandan as `Kerala Castro', a title that VS could well regard as a coveted honour."

It is lunchtime at langar hall at Baal Leela Gurdwara in Patna City and over 500 people are being served meal in one go. Another 2,000 people are being served meal at the tent city at Kangan Ghat, just one-km north of Baal Leela.The food is being served by over 3,000 sewadaars (devotees serving free meals), who have come from Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra and other states for Prakashotsava It takes 30-45 minutes to serve the delicious meal, including ghee rotis, rice, daal, sarson ka saag, two vegetable dishes (including paneer), kadhi and kheer to one set of people.Langars, the grand Sikh feast for anyone and everyone coming for Prakashotsava has started round the clock at Baal Leela and Kangan Ghat. Organisers have claimed that so far around 30,000 people are being served the mouth-watering free meals everyday, but the figures are expected to reach around five lakh once langars at all locations are held in full swing from January 1.It would be in fact a record of sorts as the number of people served free meals at the langar at Amritsar's Sri Harmandir Sahib, better known as the Golden Temple , is around 1 lakh daily. While the langar at Baal Leela serves food round the year, the one at Kangan Ghat has been made operational from December 23. Besides, langars are expected to commence at five more locations in the state capital this week.The preparation for the grand feast is equally striking. Large vats are used to prepare 40kg rice and 20kg of sabzi in one go. Long rods are used to stir bubbling vats of dal. Rotis are also prepared almost continuously and it is not served on the plate but the devotee has to raise his hand on which it is served. Hundreds of women can be seen on one side of the langar hall cutting vegetables.Most of the sewadaars are small scale workers, like masons and tillers among others, who are working voluntarily in a bid to seek blessing from Guru Gobind Singh.Satnam Singh, a sewadaar from Anandpur Saheb in Punjab's Rupnagar district said snacks and teas are being served at the langars from 3am to 9am. ""We arrived here around 10 days ago on trucks in three groups of 500 people. It took three days for us to reach here from Amritsar,' said Satnam.Hundreds of youngsters like Satnam serve the free meals to people at the langar with high level of enthusiasm. One has to put a headgear or any piece of cloth on his or her head and the utensils are handed to them at the entrance. People sit next to each other on the ground and the energetic youngsters ladle the food items into each plate without any sort of discrimination, including that based on religion, caste, creed, gender or age. Many of these people are in fact poor and downtrodden, who come here for food.""Serving food in langar is all about service. All are warmly welcome here and given equal amount of food. We worship God by feeding people,"" said Ajit Singh, a mason from Amritsar.Drinking water is served in a bowl instead of glass and people wash their hands on the plate while sitting as volunteers pour water through kettle. As the meal ends, one is offered tea or coffee, obviously in Punjabi-style big glasses.As one lot of people leave the langar hall, the used utensils are washed by another group of youngsters, while several other volunteers mop the floor to ensure spotless langar for the next lot of people."

When your business doesn't move, you move the business. Now, some enterprising Bengalureans have taken this advice to heart, in unexpected ways. Take a look at some of the entrepreneurs who have converted their twowheelers into shops and business establishments - or even mobile barbecue stations, just to be where they're needed, when they areSridhar Jayaram began his career in 1993 from his tailor shop on Oil Mill Road but business turned bleak by 2000 and he was forced to down shutters in 2003.""For some time I was confused about what I was going to do.Then I remembered my brother's words of reaching out to the client rather than waiting for them to come to me,"" says the Kammanahalli resident. He then started a clothes alteration business from a tricycle in 2007.But deteriorating health forced the mobile tailor to look for another option. On a September day in 2008, Jayaram sold his tricycle and purchased a secondhand TVS moped with financial help from relatives. Soon he was at a welding unit in Kammanahalli overseeing his moped being fitted with a workstation along with a sewing machine and facility to hang clothes and work tools. ""I added three-wheels to the rear and the machine was fitted with a facility to put a chair and start work, ""says the 44-year-old.Jayaram also added a tiny folding chair to his mobile shop for his young daughter for the occasions she accompanies him.Mostly on weekdays, Nellore-native Narasimha Rao can be spotted riding around on his mobile bakery in parts of east Bengaluru. For some, he is their favourite provider of snacks and the sound of his TVS moped brings out his clients from their homes.""I came to Bengaluru in 1999 when my rice selling business back home flopped. Here I began selling snacks on my bicycle by hanging the bakery items from both sides of the pillion seat,"" says the 53-year-old whose trade gradually grew.. A resident of Subbannapalya , initially Rao found it hard to pedal his cart around. ""One night in 2010, from nowhere, the image of tricycle crossed my mind. But then again I have to pedal all the weight. Why not substitute the pedals with a motor, I thought"" says Rao. The very next day he approached a local mechanic and asked him to remove the front wheel and handle of his two-wheeler and attach a cart with a provision to display bakery items. He spent Rs 5,500 on the alteration and it worked wonders, he says. Rao, who is the sole breadwinner for his family, is gradually making progress with his bike bakery.Perhaps the most innovative food cart in town is the bike and barbecue, introduced in October by two brothers Arun Varma (22) and Krishna Varma (21). Named the BBQ Ride India, the two, both management students in a city college, purchased two Royal Enfield Classic motorcycles and added sidecars to them. ""It was in September when we modified the sidecars and fitted a barbecue pit, grill pan, gas cylinder area and a storage bay.

Teachers associations have claim that schools in villages are falling short of low denomination currency to purchase vegetables, mustard oil and to pay for the LPG connections. Every school has a School Management Committee (SMC) which looks after mid-day meal operations of that particular school.The SMC is authorized to draw money from the school bank account. As the ban has resulted into long queues, the amount withdrawal from the school accounts have literally stopped. ""The problem has just started as schools have replaced veggies by rice and soup. The SMC members have expressed inability to draw money from the bank due to long queues and dried up ATMs. This has been communicated to district education officer,"" said a school teacher in Barmer.State feeds mid-day meal to 62.50 lakh students from Class I to VIII. Three agencies are responsible for feeding these students. The SMCs account for about 58.58 lakh students, centralized kitchen is for 2.22 lakh students and others for 1.70 lakh students.Prakash Mishra, secretary of Rajasthan Teachers Association, states that if the problem continues then all SMCs will face the same problem. ""It is natural that SMCs members will first draw money for themselves. State should make some alternate arrangements before it becomes a state-wide problem.""Of six days, veggies are served for four days in the mid-day meal which has vanished from the menu in some schools.Ved Singh, commissioner, mid-day meal, said, ""So far, the office has not yet received any complaint from any school.

Provision stores have hiked the price so much that islanders have started mulling alternative ways to procure salt.Cash-strapped farmer Dimbeswar Pegu exchanged pumpkins for a few packets of salt from a 'mahajan' (a term used by Mishing tribes for shop owners) in Barbil. With a poor literacy rate, islanders do not have access to ATMs. Ever since the notes were declared illegal tender, Pegu and his neighbours have been scrambling for notes. The long queues at banks have discouraged them from pursuing the exercise of swapping notes.""We are supposed to be busy tilling the land for Rabi crops, but we are queueing up at banks to exchange notes to buy ration essentials. We have never seen such a crisis. Almost everyone has been hit. We are not able to buy rice. As it is Barbil lost its paddy to floods and now this crisis,"" said Dimbeswar, who resides on the flood-prone area of the island. His residential area comes under the Bihpuria assembly constituency in Lakhimpur district.Before the monetary crunch hit the market hard, the people in Barbil were getting their regular supply of rice and financial help from the mahajans. But with mahajans running out of money, the people have been affected. They cannot buy in bulk from wholesalers.Dimbeswar's wife Premalata described her experience of going to the bank to exchange the old notes as harrowing. ""We have to cross the Luit (the Brahmaputra in local parlance) to reach the bank and grocery shops. After walking for nearly 14 km when you see a never-ending queue, what do you do?"" she asked.Premlata returned home without swapping her notes. She is dejected as she cannot fetch grocery. ""Can people outside the island, imagine our plight?"" she asked in despair.The Rabi crop is the only hope for the farmers of Majuli this year. They are eyeing mustard cultivation this winter to tide over the crisis.Even though mustard seeds cost more than rice, for the mahajans and the people of Barbil, both are of the same value. ""The price of a quintal of rice is about Rs 2,200. But the price of the same quantity of mustard seeds is more. We exchange mustard for rice. But this year the mahajans may not be able to give us rice,"" said Dimbeswar."

""In many sub-divisions of the state, schools are spending money very carefully because the teachers can neither wait in queue to withdraw money from banks, nor can they spend their valuable time in exchanging higher denomination currency notes for buying food for children,"" said Jiban Chandra Borah , president of Assam State Primary Teachers' Association.Though the Food Corporation of India (FCI) supplies rice to government-run schools for cooking midday meal, vegetables and other necessary items need to be bought for cooking food. However, sources in the education department said proper implementation of midday meal scheme is top priority of the government.Apart from teaching, the teachers have to manage midday meals for students up to Class 8. ""Buying pulses, mustard oil and other food items is a costly affair nowadays. It is very difficult to have Rs 100 or other lower denomination currency notes in stock for buying commodities required to serve meal to hundreds of students,"" said the headmaster of a school in Golaghat."

This was the sixth day in a row, when he had failed to get any work. With no money in hand, arranging for two square meals a day for his family of five has become a daunting task.""There is hardly any food left at home,"" said Aakub, adding the last time they had eaten a vegetable was 15 days ago. Since then, the family has been surviving on rice and pulses. Bluntly, he said this was the most difficult time he had faced in his life.In the 35 days since demonetisation, he has managed to get work only on 10 days. ""I have not paid my rent yet, if this continues for another week, I may be forced out of the house,"" said Aakub, adding he usually managed to earn around Rs 10,000 a month, but in the last month, that has come down to a mere Rs 3,000, of which half the amount was paid to him in old currency.""I don't have a bank account, so I exchanged the Rs 500 notes for four Rs 100 notes each,"" said Aakub, blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting people like him in so much trouble. He alleged rich people were exchanging their old notes easily, while the poor like him had been forced into a struggle for survival.He said earlier, labourers like him used to get work within an hour of waiting at Labour Chowk. But now, they are lucky if they land some work after waiting till late afternoon. ""Earlier, we use to get work on 27-28 days of a month. But since 'notebandi', there is hardly any work,"" said Aakub, adding that on Monday, hundreds of labourers had to return home from Labour Chowk without work, as not a single contractor turned up.

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Only Delhi, naturally for the city most affected, has reacted with some degree of urgency.A severe pollution level, as defined by NGT, meant a PM2.5 level of 251 microgram/cubic metre and PM10 level of 431 microgram/cubic metre (the standard safe levels for these categories are 60 and 100, respectively). When these levels reached 300 and 500 respectively, an 'environmental emergency' was in the offing. In such conditions, NGT said on November 10, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan were to consider measures such as curbing crop stubble burning, raining water from the air to sink polluting particles, suspending construction and demolition activities and ordering cessation of carbon producing activities like brick making and thermal energy generationWith crop burning a major factor, NGT had ordered states to provide alternatives to the incineration of the post-harvest rice plant stalks. The two states most liable for this, Punjab and Haryana, reported some action. In both the states, the governments have provided funds to equip farmers with happy seeders, or devices that can be used to plant wheat without the need for the field to be cleared of the paddy stubble. In Punjab, the government distributed 280 happy seeders, while Haryana has promised farmers a 50% subsidy for the purchase of these implements.In accordance with the previous NGT directions, the agriculture department in Punjab has prepared plans to provide farmers with straw management equipment costing Rs 1,602 crore and has approached the centre for funds. Haryana has similarly decided to install straw balers in each block there next year.To stop the burning of field residue, Haryana booked 1,600 farmers for violating the ban and recovered Rs 16 lakh from them as fine in the past 20 days. Delhi too has clamped down on the open burning of leaves and waste, with violators coughing up Rs 63.7 lakh as fines till last week. In addition, the municipal corporations have pulled up other offenders, among them 476 in South Delhi alone.The government in Rajasthan ordered the temporary closure of stone crushing units and brick kilns, while remaining alert to the burning of agriculture residue, garbage and dry leaves. Sanitation workers have been directed to clean the streets only at night, and all construction activities are to be carried out with proper dust management systems in place.Delhi has temporarily closed the Badarpur thermal power plant and stalled construction and demolition activities for 10 days. A committee, which included the chief secretary and environment secretary, will discuss the issue of water spraying with the centre. An official said, ""Since Pawan Hans helicopters do not have the desired capacity, we approached the centre about harnessing Indian Air Force choppers. But the union environment and forests ministry told us it could not help us. Meanwhile, PWD is spraying water along major roads through hose pipes.""Like Rajasthan, Haryana too has stopped stone crushers and suspended brick kiln work for a few days. S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board , said the state was amenable to water sprinkling too. ""In urgent circumstances, we may follow this measure,"" Narayanan said.Directed to start vacuum cleaning of roads in Delhi, PWD had expected tenders for mechanical sweepers to be decided by November 10, but no one put in a bid, mainly due to the uncertainty caused by the demonetisation of high-value currency notes. The tendering process has been extended for some time. The transport department has deregistered 1.91 lakh diesel vehicles, deemed to over 15 years old and polluting, and officials said the list of such vehicles were sent to the traffic police last Friday, with instructions to impound them immediately.Members of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board , which met on November 15, admit that compliance of NGT orders would be tough given the state's geographical area. A senior official said that coordinating with the various government departments concerned would take time. However, the state is indeed thinking of means to reduce carbon pollution, including contemplating asking industries to use high-end boilers and process heaters.The UP government is willing to comply with the National Green Tribunal's orders to control air pollution, senior government officials in Lucknow said. SC Yadav, member, UP Pollution Control Board , said that the state sub-committee on the matter would discuss the draft plan, methodology and procedure that UP would follow to control air pollution on November 24.A meeting of the central monitoring committee has been summoned in New Delhi on November 17, where the states will further discuss NGT's directives."

But at a time when they should be putting all their energies in harvesting crops, shortage of cash is forcing them to sale paddy at a rate which is far lower than the government's minimum support price (MSP).Demonetization has hurt farmers badly and in desperate need for cash to make payments to labourers engaged in harvesting, they are avoiding selling paddy in the market yards run by the government.""We have to make immediate payment to labourers. Instead of waiting for the entire harvest, we have simultaneously started selling paddy to keep the cash flow and. The labourers are reluctant to take old notes. Where is the time to go to the market yards?"" asked Tinu Bhoi, a farmer from Janhapara village in Bargarh district.Sale in the market yards - it is from here that the Odisha state civil supply corporation procures paddy through primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) - means waiting for days to get their payments transferred into their accounts, leave alone the added difficulty of withdrawing cash.The problem is more acute in Bargarh district (termed the rice bowl of Odisha as it contributes to about one-fourth of the total paddy procured annually in the state), because harvesting is at its peak there. In other parts, the harvest is yet to begin in a full-fledged manner.In Bargarh district, peasants are selling paddy at Rs 800 to Rs 850 per gunny bag (which holds about 75 kg of paddy). The government's MSP is Rs 1470 per quintal, which when calculated for 75 kg, comes around to Rs 1100 per bag, resulting in a loss of Rs 250-300 per gunny bag.With demonetization affecting cash flow to co-operative banks, farmers are also apprehensive that if they sell their produce in the market yards, the payment might be delayed.""They are not ready to take a chance. Middlemen understand the situation and are out to exploit them,"" said Lingaraj Pradhan , who is involved in organising farmers' movements in Bargarh district for the past two decades.The government formally began paddy procurement from Bargarh on November 15. For the first two days, there was hardly any purchase because PACS secretaries went on strike demanding clearance of pending dues. On Thursday, around 9,000 quintals of paddy was procured from farmers.Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma said there is no reason for farmers to sell paddy below the MSP. ""I appeal all farmers to sell paddy through the market yards. There won't be any problem. At the same time we will increase monitoring to keep a check on middlemen from exploiting them,"" the minister said. This year, the state government has set a target to procure nearly 44 lakh metric tonnes of paddy."

Amid pressure from the fishermen community, the government had been providing 25kg rice to them at the rate of Rs 2 per kg for the last three years to make up for the lost livelihood in the ban period.The fishermen are, however, apprehensive about the scheme being discontinued after the implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Making matters worse for them, the civil supply officers have not yet received any instruction about continuing the scheme. ""We fear the scheme may be discontinued as the government had announced to discontinue all such schemes after the implementation of the NFSA earlier,"" said K Alleya, general secretary, Odisha traditional fish workers' union (OTFWU).Ajit Kumar Patra, the civil supply officer (CSO) of Ganjam district, said there was no fresh instruction from the government to continue the scheme after the implementation of the NFSA.

Some, apparently, have been even resorting to making advance payment.On November 9, a city-based private organization handed out salaries to its employees in cash, day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The money is normally transferred to their bank accounts but this month it was different. Most of the employees got their salaries in Rs 500 denomination.""Earlier, employees with monthly salary of less than Rs 20,000 would be paid in cash. But this time all of us were given hard cash.

The dietician advised the audience to use ghee or rice brawn oil, as it is good for heart.He also emphasized on the use of rock salt rather than iodine salt and use of black jaggery in place of sugar. ""Jaggery helps in maintaining PH values of your body and is alkaline in nature. Non-vegetarian food items must also be avoided as it takes at least 72 hours to digest and can lead to problems like acidity and constipation.Vegetables are good for body as they are rich in vitamins and potassium,"" Kumar said.

The Integrated District Development Plan report recently prepared by District Planning Committee and District Panchayat said if this situation continues at the end of 2030, Palakkad district will lose 50% more paddy area.""Paddy decreased from 1,60,855 hectares in 1985 to 1,09,208 hectares in 2008, that means an average decrease of 30% within two decades, but productivity has increased from 2.34 metric tonnes per hectare in 2004 to 3.36 metric tonnes per hectare in 2009,"" said Kinavallur Sasidharan in his address.As per the latest figures of the state statistics department, paddy was cultivated in 87,511 hectares in Palakkad during 2010-11.

Still 40.14% of the total paddy area of the state is in Palakkad.""If the current trend of decline in paddy cultivation continues the entire paddy fields in Palakkad will vanish in two decades affecting the surfaced and ground water availability very badly,"" he said."

Considered to be 'heaty', kulatachi pithi used to be consumed widely in the past, particularly in certain regions in the Western Ghats, as it was believed to increase body temperatures during the cold season.Horse gram, known as kulith locally and Macrotyloma uniflorum scientifically, is a leguminous, protein-rich lentil that got its name from being used as a staple for horses and cattle. While it was once grown and consumed in various parts of Goa, cultivation of the pulse crop is presently confined to Mencurem, Sal, Dhumashe and a few other remote villages. Its quick, dense growth is known to play a vital role in curbing soil erosion.Kulatachi pithi is prepared by roasting a cup of dry horse gram until brown and grinding it to a powder along with peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. This mixture is then soaked in water for a while and later boiled with salt, garlic cloves and groundnut oil. Water can be added if the gravy becomes too thick. A garnish of finely chopped coriander leaves completes the dish.Another delectable preparation is kulatacho ros, which involves soaking horse gram in water for 12 hours and then bundling the seeds into a muslin cloth until they sprout. Red chillies, coriander, cinnamon powder, dried garlic cloves, ginger, grated copra, pepper and cloves are then roasted in a shallow pan on low flame. Water and salt is added to these spices along with the sprouted horse gram seeds. Once ready, kulatacho ros can be relished with boiled rice or chappatis.Thanks to the anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of horse gram, several people incorporate the pulse into their cooking, especially individuals suffering from kidney stones, high blood sugar, cold and asthma."

They may not necessarily be the ones suffering in the never ending queues at banks and ATMs, but on Sunday , and also Saturday, when several such citizens produced their debit or credit card at hotels, restaurants and multiplexes, the transactions were refused.Meanwhile, the city continued to suffer the effects of cash going out of the system and very little to replace it. And while the queues at banks and ATMs have only grown longer, people are frustrated that bank branches will be closed on Monday.A popular chain of eateries in the city had its systems crash around 7pm on Saturday. ""I was at the chain's Andheri outlet.When we called for the bill, the staff informed us that their systems had crashed and they could only accept cash. We tried using the ATM, but all we got was long queues.

We cannot simply pass the currency on to the zonal office. If they find it to be fake, they will send it back to us and staff who accepted it will be required to reimburse the treasury from their own pocket. People cannot imagine the pressure we are under.""Those arriving at ATMs were in for disappointment again as most machines were ""out of cash"". A few ATMs in the eastern suburbs were also non-functional or their shutters were down to prevent any harm from angry citizens.

It brings with it several complications and secondary diseases, which results from uncontrolled and untreated diabetes. Therefore, on the occasion of World Diabetes Day (November 14), this year's theme 'Eye on Diabetes' focusses on feasible and cost-effective solutions to avoid risks of costly complications of Type 2 diabetes.The most common yet serious complications of Type 2 diabetes includes micro vascular complications such as development of diabetic retinopathy, a non-reversible progressive vision loss, diabetic neuropathy (tingling, burning sensation in the nerves progressing to numbness and total loss of sensation, bacterial infections in the wound and diabetic foot (where amputation is often resorted to as the blood flow to the vessels is affected). Besides, macro vascular complications such as cardiac arrest, brain stroke, kidney disease progressing to end-stage renal failure and urinary tract infections are also common. Diabetic patients have higher chances of development of heart attack at least five years earlier than a normal person.However, all these can be avoided by following a prudent approach to the disorder and modifying its course through early diagnosis, regular check-ups and thus reducing the risk of complications and other health threats.Nowadays, with Type 2 diabetics being detected at a younger age (in patients in their 30s and 40s), it's extremely important to follow a judicious approach towards controlling diabetes and getting screened at an early age.Dr Triveni Reddy , internal medicine expert at Care Hospital , said, ""First of all, people must be cautious about the warning symptoms of diabetes and not confuse them with general illnesses. Especially if the person if above 30 years of age, obese, or got a family history of diabetes where any family member, parents or sibling already had diabetes, or if the person had gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, then they should get screened for diabetes, every year. The mild symptoms include tiredness, increased urination, high thirst, losing weight despite high appetite and eating. Daily, we see at least four-five new patients. Sometimes, patients also turn up in a state of diabetes coma or extreme drowsiness when the sugar level reaches more than 400.""Once diabetes is detected, one must undergo blood sugar checking every three months and keep the sugar level under control. Checking of the other organs such as eyes, kidneys, heart should be done annually to minimise the development or progress of complications associated with diabetes. For this, drugs, diet and exercise are the three keys to modify the course of diabetes and fluctuating sugar level and keeping the complications away, aver doctors. ""From time to time, after consultation with one's physician, drugs can be changed or doses modified, stress level should be kept in check, undertake at least 30 kilometres of brisk walking five days a week. As for diet, smoking and alcohol should be a total no-no, diet should be low in calories, high in fibre and protein, avoid sugar and sweet rich food and certain fruits as well as too much rice especially at night. Follow the diet chart as prescribed by dietician or doctor,"" added Dr Reddy."

He has organized the rice ceremony of his grandson on Sunday and needs a lot of loose cash now. Unable to spend what he has at hand, Paul is extremely tense. He felt the government should have arranged for an alternative before deciding to discontinue the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.Paul is not alone. The euphoria about receiving the new Rs 2,000 notes was short-lived, especially because some banks started pushing the big new notes since there was a severe crisis of Rs 100 notes and new Rs 500 notes yet to make an entry. People were seen debating bank managers and other officials when they were given all Rs 2,000 notes. They requested for a mix-and-match of notes  both in case of exchange as well as withdrawal  but their efforts were foiled by banks due to ""shortage of Rs 100 notes"".""I was happy that finally I was able to get some money when I exchanged the banned Rs 500 notes. But that was shortlived. I have not been able to use the two Rs 2,000 notes anywhere. I have come back to the bank to exchange at least one Rs 2,000 note . But the manager refused,"" said Biswajit Aich, who runs a small business in Mott Lane.Indian Bank manager (Dharamtolla Branch) Lakshmidhar Nayak clarified that he could not but give Rs 2,000 notes because there was a shortage of notes of other denominations. ""The crowd is swelling and we have to cater to everyone,"" he reasoned.Some people complained that even petrol pumps preferred to take old Rs 500/1,000 notes instead of the new Rs 2,000 notes. ""They told me that they are yet to familiarize themselves with the new notes before starting to accept them,"" rued Mohit Sharma , who had gone for re-fuelling at the Camac Street petrol pump.Some banks, like many branches of HDFC Bank , did not get any supply of Rs 2,000 notes the whole day. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The bank dealt only in Rs 100 notes. As the word spread, people queued up at the bank's branches only to find that several restrictions imposed on non-account holders."

Health-conscious Indians are choosing oats over rice and wheat due to their superior nutrient profile.Indians can't go to bed without carbs  we may have had plates of finger foods like tikkas or chaat but until we have rice or roti, we can't fall asleep. This may be fast changing as the health-conscious are switching to oats for dinner.Oats are a coarse grain, traditionally fed to horses, but new wisdom on nutrition has elevated it to a super grain. It is pushing soft rotis and fragrant rice out of the thali. And it helps that they cook fast.Saurabh Gupta grew up eating rotis but for the past two years, this Delhi-based communications professional, has switched to oats khichdi for dinner. ""I cook regular oats with vegetables and onions and garnish with jeera tadka. I have it thrice a week,"" says Gupta.Oats are not cultivated in India but they have been popular as a breakfast cereal for more than a decade with various brands selling processed oats that can be consumed like a porridge with milk.PIPPING WHEAT AND RICEIn recent years, both rice and wheat have suffered blows to their reputation as the fitness gurus popularised low or no-carb diets. Development of conclusive tests to diagnose Celiac disease made a villain out of gluten, a protein abundant in wheat. People with Celiac disease are allergic to gluten, which is also responsible for poor gut health So what does one have for a meal? Oats, recommend nutritionists and health experts. Compared to rice and wheat, oats have an impressive nutrient profile and the unique distinction of having a high concentration of beta-glucan, a fibre that lowers LDL or bad cholesterol. Consuming 70g of oats a day can provide you the required daily amount of 3g of this magic ingredient.Oats enthusiasts can dig into oats recipes flooding the internet. From poha to porridge and from dosa to dhokla, there is a way to include oats in a variety of Indian preparations.Rahul Mehta, a communications professional in Delhi, adds oats to multigrain atta to amp up the health quotient of rotis and also makes poha with it. ""Oats are pretty filling and you tend to eat less,"" says Mehta adding that he avoids instant, ready-to-eat oats which are not has healthy as the steel-cut variety.""Instant oats have a higher glycemic index,"" explains Dr Shweta Rastogi, chief dietician, Guru Nanak Hospital, Mumbai. However, most consumers may not know the difference and believe all oats are healthy.MARKET FOR HEALTHRecently, Future Group launched oats atta, which can be used to prepare bread, roti, idli, dhokla and sweets. ""It can be integrated into daily food as well as also in all regional cuisines so that everyone can eat healthier meals all day long "" says Devendra Chawla, group president food brands and FMCG, Future Group.Saffola launched ready-to-eat masala oats five years ago and the product now enjoys a CAGR of 50% and a household penetration of 6-8% in major metros, says Anuradha Aggarwal, chief marketing officer, Marico. Aditya Bagri, vice-president, Bagrry's, reports a 40% increase in the sales of the brand's oats in the past year.Despite the buzz around this 'third grain', its market in India is just Rs 350 crore, or around 26% of the entire breakfast market that stands at Rs 1,300 crore. ""In contrast the instant noodles market is much bigger at around Rs 3,500 crore. So in 15 years oats has not really taken off as it's not a part of local everyday cuisine which is where we want to work and there's immense potential for growth,"" Chawla points out.However, replacing a traditional balanced Indian meal comprising carbohydrates, protein, fibre and micronutrients with just a bowl of oats does not make sense to everyone. Well-known nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar argues, ""The human body maintains good health when the food is diverse. This remains the corner stone of maintaining gut bacteria diversity too. Diverse diets are achieved by eating fresh, local and cooking by using regional or time-tested recipes. This works well for small farmers too as they don't have either the budget, reach or vocabulary to influence the influencers."" She explains that patronising local food also means generating a smaller carbon footprint. ""My free advice to food companies is use your massive distribution network, which allows us to have colas, instant noodles and oats on mountain tops and sunny beaches, to collect the garbage that the packaging creates. If nothing, use that profit to reduce the ecological damage,"" she says. ""The idli won't leave behind plastic but oats will.""Oats market in IndiaRs 350 crBreakfast market in IndiaRs 1,300 crShare of oats26%"

If his gambit comes through, she would be the first person of Indian origin to be a cabinet principal. It will continue the more recent tradition of women in that position. Three of the last five people to head the state department were women (Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton).Nikki Haley, 44, was scheduled to meet the president-elect at Trump Towers late Thursday, his transition team confirmed after reports that she was in the running for the top job at Foggy Bottom. Although Haley is among several people Trump is meeting during the day, the rest of the line-up, foreign policy patriarch Henry Kissinger, retired General Jack Keane, and Admiral Mike Rogers among them, appear more like an advisory council being tapped for ideas. In a side lacking in bench strength, Haley appears to be the interviewee.While several other more prominent names have been making the rounds for the Secretary of State post - Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton among them - choosing Haley may be the first sign that Trump will not necessarily appease the slavering mobs of white conservative insurgents who fueled his march to the White House . Picking a female of foreign-origin -- although she was born in Bamberg, South Carolina -- for the key post will send a strong and reassuring message to the rest of the world that his administration is not going to be overrun by racists and xenophobes.For that to happen, Trump will have to navigate a Haley nomination past the white insurrection that made anyone of foreign-origin subject to a suspicious inquisition during the campaign, the treatment of Huma Abedin being an extreme example.Haley though is in a different league - and from a different political dispensation - having won the governorship of a southern state when she was only 38, and winning a second term four years later. In already breaking barriers, she also became the first female governor of South Carolina, besides being its first non-Caucasian and first Asian-American governor.Haley was briefly in the running to be on Trump's vice-presidential ticket after she disdained him during the primaries where she backed Marco Rubio. After criticizing Trump's stand on several issues, and calling him an ''angry man,'' for his vituperative campaign, she backed him with some reservation once he clinched the nomination.Republican strategists who favored her on a veep ticket called her an ''optimistic, sunshine consevative in the Reagan tradition,'' who would help counter the impression of the GOP as a party of grouchy, old, white, rich men. A similar argument can be made for her Foggy Bottom nomination, although arch conservatives and white supremacists in the party will cast aspersions on her ethnic and religious origins, something Haley has not cared to hide.Although she identifies herself as a Christian now, she has not disowned the Sikh religion she was born into and attends gurdwara services even now. She and her husband Michael Haley were married in both Sikh and Methodist ceremonies.Haley visited India as South Carolina governor in November 2014 to promote the state's business interests, and expectedly spend time in her ancestral Punjab, visiting the Golden Temple."

Mishra said he transacted worth Rs 1.5 lakh in ""invalid currencies on Wednesday"" but had to stop business ""yesterday"".

But then, people used the 2000-rupee note and used cards and PayTM and kept 100-rupee notes to themselves. ""Use of PayTMs doubled on Sunday, the day after and there was a significant increase in paying the entry fee through cards,"" the Hidco official added. The swipe machine at the Eco Park restaurant went out of order after consumers insisted on making payments through debit/credit cards prompting the restaurant owner to accept old 500- and 1000-rupee notes.The electronic transfer has taken away a major chunk of the daily business to malls, leading to demand fall in local markets. Offtake of vegetables and poultry shot up to a new high in the city marts and malls, registering distress sale in Jadavpur retail market. Would this liquidity crunch induced demand fall bring down prices? ""The government wants it, but I fear how far this is going to happen. How can one sacrifice his daily rice or fish or even medicines to do so? People are buying essential items either through credit or through electronic transfers. It has led to a lateral shift of buying from local markets to malls and marts,"" argues economist Ajitava Roy Chowdhury.The local kirana shop or the fish vendor doesn't have enough money to keep the credit cycle going. The informal supply chain has already started showing signs of desperation with primary producers at the far end of the supply chain unable to continue with supply of vegetables and fish on credit. This will lead to supply crunch. ""Imagine a situation where people in metros have cash to buy but the cash has not reached the villages to enable primary producers and aggregators resume business. What will happen to prices then?"" says Roy Chowdhury.The RBI, meanwhile, assured the public to spend freely.The layman, however, keeps the 100-rupee notes for the paan shop, for buying milk, for paying tuitions, for kids. Binod Shaw, a vendor selling paan and cigarettes on S N Banerjee Road said: ""I have placed orders of Rs 2200 today to suppliers all in 100-rupee notes."" A medical store nearby has no dearth of 100-rupee notes. ""We are getting 100-rupee notes from customers though the flow is less than usual,"" the man on the counter said.""I feel that Modi government could have given some time, for instance a month. A person having black money can offload it by buying gold or a property. But then the money goes to someone else. It remains in the system. Few have been able to stash the money somewhere outside the country. The one-month time would have at least saved the common man from the trouble imposed on him,"" says Roy Chowdhury."
58d81feaa3d24b75f2773910,French connection: Jagaddhatri's homecoming to Chandernagore,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/French-connection-Jagaddhatris-homecoming-to-Chandernagore/articleshow/55323723.cms,2016-11-09,"CHANDERNAGORE: If Robert Clive celebrated Durga Puja at Sovabazar Rajbari to mark his victory at the Battle of Plassey, the French governors, their families and friends at Chandernagore went a step ahead. They not only participated but also ensured enough administrative support to make the four-day Jagaddhatri Puja a memorable one. Even today, the oldest four Pujas at the erstwhile French colony bear French imprints.Chandernagore was established as a French colony in 1678 and remained so till 1951 till a plebiscite decided a merger with Bengal. Though the 275 years of French rule is now evident only along the Strand in this subdivisional town of Hooghly, Jagaddhatri Puja brings back a lot of memory.The oldest Puja at Nichuputty or Chawalputty is over 300 years old and as lore has it, was started by Raja Krishnachandra of Nadia. At that time, the goddess was worshipped by his family in Nadia. One year, Krishnachandra's ship got stuck at a nondescript ghat at Chandernagore. It being Nabami, it was imperative for him to offer Puja to the deity, and so, he started one near the ghat at Nichuputty with the help of local rice traders.The other three old Jagaddhatri Pujas-the 251-year-old Puja at Lakshmiganj (cloth hub), the 182-year-old Puja at Bagbazar and the 114-year-old Puja at Lakshmiganj (Chowmatha)-touched their gloriest height not only because the French participated in the celebrations but also because they kept the funds flowing. ""Even now, only men help out in the arrangements by chopping fruits, arranging flowers and doing the 'baran' as earlier, women were not allowed to participate in a baroari Puja. The French administration would arrange for special police protection for safe passage of women from their homes to the pandal... We have not broken that tradition,"" said Balai Nandan, who has been associated with the cloth putty Puja for over 50 years now.The French administration would organize huge fireworks display on July 14 to celebrate the Fall of the Bastille every year. ""The flower pots, ground wheels, sparklers caught the local population's imagination and they learnt the art from the French. They also started having fireworks during Jagaddatri Puja,"" said Neline Mondal (nee Colassin), a Frenchwoman who married a Bengali and has been living in Chandernagore for 27 years. With no electricity around, the French administration advised Puja organisers to use lit torches. The porcelain urns in which the torches were put up were also designed by the French. A band of torch-wielding tribal women accompanied the immersion procession, said Neline from her chronicles that talk about this French connect.The French administrators brought all Puja organisers under one central monitoring body, a trend that still continues. The Pujas are still given serial numbers to be followed during the mammoth immersion procession, said to be the second longest after the Rio Carnival."

""We had run out of veggies and our sabziwala did not turn up today, unlike he does at 8am daily,"" said Richa Sharma. Her husband, Ankit said, ""All of us were seeking each other's help and apart from Rs 100 notes, we were ready to share anything.""Most of the local grocery stores refused to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and instead, noted people's names and told them to pay later for whatever they bought. Gomtinagar extension grocer Laxminarayan Gupta said, ""My sales dipped as I had only a limited number of Rs 100 notes. I cannot pay change to every customer.""At some grocery stores, it was being regular customers that worked in their favour. ""I accepted Rs 500 note from people who buy their 'aata-dal-chawal' from us every month. I will deposit this money in my bank,"" said Vinay Keshwani, a store owner in Aashiana. ""But it wasn't an offer open to all,"" he said.Buying milk was a major problem for many residents. Some people had to go without it, while others bought a quantity less than their daily quota. At some colonies, milk booths accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. ""I will pass them on to the agency,"" said a booth owner Vjay Singh in Dalibagh.Some milk sellers complained lesser sales. Ashok Pandey of LDA colony, Kanpur road said, ""Everyday, I sell at least 200 packets of different milk brands. Today, I could sell only 50 packets as most people bought less. Those who bought bread did not buy milk, those who bought eggs did not buy bread.""There were people who had stocked veggies and milk already. ""We bought three litres milk on Tuesday night and stocked onions and potatoes too,"" said Nishatganj resident Alok Pahuja.Families are ready with their emergency plan. ""For two days we have to curtail our expenditure. We will eat only rice and dal and no vegetables. We need to save the Rs 100 notes we have,"" said Rama Tiwari , a resident of Alambagh.""I am happy to see my family prioritising their needs. They are talking only about what they need immediately and what things can wait till banks open and we get Rs 100 or new currency notes,"" said Raviraj Upadhyay, resident of South city."

Displayed in full public view at the Saidapet railway station, the weighing scale of yore, which made people choose between a suitcase full of clothes and a bag of utensils, is now just a slab of iron attached to a curious looking pole.While the weighing scale lies forgotten almost becoming part of the platform like its multiple pillars and benches, serving as a resting place for tired feet, only a discerning eye can probably find the engraving `H Pooley & Son, Liverpool & London'.The firm introduced railway weighbridges in 1835. History enthusiast K R A Narasiah says weighing machines were manufactured by the UK firm for South Indian Railway.""Every suburban station in Chennai had a weighing machine pro cured from Liverpool and London during the British regime. It was meant to weigh goods, and passengers carrying excess luggage were made to pay up,"" he said.The machines acted as a deterrent for carrying heavy goods by train. ""With trains being the quickest mode of transport in those days, people from villages around Chennai had the tendency to take maximum belongings. Weighing machines helped to keep a check,"" he said. It is not known when the scale on the Chennai BeachTambaram section was installed.However, weighing machines started losing relevance over the years. ""In the past, rice and grains used to be transported by (suburban) trains, but this practice has gradually reduced, minimising the necessity of weighing machines,"" Narasiah said.The leftover piece of colonial history now bears no importance and waits only for curious minds who would read the lettering and raise questions that would bring memories of a time gone by.Noticed something interesting of late?
