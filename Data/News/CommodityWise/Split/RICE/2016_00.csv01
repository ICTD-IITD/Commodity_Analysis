Of course, given the large role of cash in every day transaction in India's economy the currency transition would have to be managed prudently to minimise possible disruption,"" the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters at a news conference in response to a question.He was asked to comment on the Indian government's decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes from circulation.""I am just saying that when countries make these kinds of move, which is not exceptional - countries do this quite often - the transition needs to be managed very well,"" Rice said in response to another question."

On Wednesday , 16 hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, he wished he got paid on the first, like some of his fellow drivers.""Since I get my salary on the ninth, the grocery is stocked accordingly . Last night, my wife said there's no daal or rice at home. So, I rushed to the shop as soon as I got my salary , most of which was in 1,000-rupee notes. Now, no one's accepting the money ,"" said Biswas, a father of three, staring at a 1000rupee note in his hand. Staring back at him helplessly was S K Shaw, a grocer at Esplanade.His side of the story: ""I just returned from my native place in Jharkhand this morning. The few 100-rupee notes I have are too precious. I can't part with them. So, it's best to say no."" Sushmita Sarkar, a 30-plus resident of Taltala Lane, had scurried to shops to exchange the 500-rupee notes she had withdrawn from an ATM, hours before the Prime Minister's announcement. Much later, she ended up buying shampoo, soap and oil at Central Medical Stores , managing to spend one 1,000-rupee note. But not everyone could do so. ""Not everyone could afford to buy things they didn't immediately need,"" said Bani Sarkar, a domestic help, who was refused by grocers Santosh Kumar Gupta, Omprakash Gupta and others at Bhowanipur. "" As soon as I heard the announcement, I tried to spend the four 500-rupee notes I had saved up for this week's ration. But no one would take it. This morning, I thought everyone had watched TV and knew by this time that the money could be exchanged in bank and post offices."" She tried -in vain -to persuade them to accept the notes, and dispel fears that the notes would be re-valued by banks and post offices.Suman Mondol, a shopkeeper at Salt Lake, justified his refusal. ""Yes, we know that the scrapped money can be deposited or exchanged in banks. But where is the time to go to the bank and get it done? I am sure there will be serpentine queues everywhere once banks open tomorrow. It's best to ward off the trouble (Rs 500and Rs 1,000rupee bills). At salon Beauty Tips on CIT Road, proprietor Rimi Das was sitting idle. The otherwise busy parlour had refused most of its customers because everyone was offering Rs 500. ""Even for threading, which costs only Rs 100, people are taking out 500-rupee notes. We had no choice but to refuse,"" she said."

But the 30-year-old found herself calling her family and friends, requesting them to lend any foreign currency they had with promises to bank transfer the rupee value of it immediately. ""I had planned to withdraw around Rs1.5lakh on Friday and get it exchanged the same day, but with withdrawal limits being fixed at Rs10,000 a day and Rs20,000 a week from November 11 to 24, I'm in a fix,"" she rued.

Reason? They had bagged the first prize in an outdoor training contest organized by the college and won Rs15,000 as prize money.Before this, the students had cooked pav baji, vegetables and rice for the children of an orphanage in Indora when they had won a prize money of Rs11,000 during the in-house Tripude Premier League (TPL) in 2015. The leftover raw foodgrains too were handed over to the orphanage, said Saddam Sheikh, MBA third semester student.These initiatives are being undertaken as a part of the institutes Tripude Outreach Programme (TOP). The campaign was started after the 2015 flooding of the city.The students had collected and distributed a lot of aid to the victims who had lost their homes and belongings during that time. That proved to be the stepping stone for more good work. The moral these students took home was that it shouldnt be restricted to calamities. Thus, they started reaching out to the poor and orphaned on a monthly basis. And thus began the practice of sharing our celebrations with those who are less privileged, said assistant professor Carol Poonekar, who is in charge of TOP.Not only do the students share the celebrations of their little triumphs, but they also spend festive days like Friendship Day with rickshaw pullers, vegetable vendors, and traffic cops. The students have taught roadside kids, distributed warm clothing and raincoats to the needy and held drawing competitions at orphanages under TOP.With the onset of winter season, the management students are planning to collect clothes, blankets and bedsheets to distribute among the needy. The planning being done on our WhatsApp group that was formed to discuss charitable causes, Poonekar added. Lalit Khullar , director of the institute, said, The programme aims to sensitize the students about social causes and inculcate a sense of community living. It has also helped in personality development and learning important lessons in management.Sheikh said, We are learning crucial lessons of life. First is that happiness multiplies when it is shared with others. Secondly, we should never weigh everything with money. Lastly, good intention ensures success."

Tipu Sultan is not above that and I have not found any documentary evidence to support that he was all good,"" says Udaya. ""He (Tipu) did what he had to as a ruler, but the history what we read is an exaggerated account by the colonial writers to portray Tipu Sultan as a tyrant as he was a thorn in the flesh of the British empire,"" adds Udaya.Udaya does not want to fall in the controversy trap. ""I'm a student of history and should be objective. I am not in the contemporary debate on Tipu Sultan,"" he says. He does not dispute the atrocities on Kodavas and Christians by Tipu. ""But how much objectivity is there in what was written by the British authors which is being bandied about now, is the moot question,"" says the author.For example, he says, British administrator Mark Wilks gives the figures of Kodavas captured by Tipu at 70,000 and historian Lewis Rice arrives at the figure of 85,000. ""The 1836 British census report puts the population of Kodagu at 65,437 - that is 36 years after Tipu was killed. There are inherent contradictions and exaggerations and this is one example,"" he says. He also notes the British historians never wrote anything adverse on Mughal rulers after Aurangzeb as they did not offer any resistance to the British.Udaya's book is written after meticulously studying documents on Tipu collected while he was studying at Oxford, UK, in 2000-01 and later from Indian archives in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka Theological College and Mangalore University. ""There is no dearth of documents on Tipu Sultan. There have been many documents since 1830-40 and he is a controversial figure. It all depends on how one looks at these documents,"" he adds."

India ended all its ties with South Africa in 1948 but when Nelson Mandela was released from jail in 1990 and the African National Congress (ANC) took initiative to bring the two nations together, it seemed a matter of time before the Proteas toured India.But it was the handiwork of the then BCCI secretary Jagmohan Dalmiya and managing director of United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) Ali Bacher to bring South Africa back. Bacher led from the front as South Africa got the full-member status in the International Cricket Council (ICC). The BCCI supported the move and the three-match series was like a return gift.""Our reintroduction into world cricket, at the ICC level, was proposed by India,"" Bacher, one of the main architects of the Friendship Series, had earlier said.But the South Africans didn't have any clue about the reception that they were to get as they reached Kolkata. A 1,00,000 strong crowd on a smoggy Kolkata morning welcomed Clive Rice's men with firecrackers and trumpets to create an atmosphere which South Africa players weren't accustomed with.Javagal Srinath, who was part of the Indian pace bowling unit, remembers the occasion as something ""unbelievable"". ""It was like a festival and it was surprising to see people waiting for hours to have a glimpse of the South Africans. I made my debut in Sharjah about a week back and it was my first match on India soil. I still remember every moment of that match. It feels difficult to believe it happened 25 years ago,"" Javagal Srinath told TOI on Wednesday. South Africa felt the pressure when they batted and were bowled out for 177 with three overs to go. The crowd was a tad disappointed, thinking that it would all get over very soon, but they were in for a surprise.A tall pacer bowled like lightning in and tore through the Indian top-order. In no time, Allan Donald reduced India to 60-4 and it boiled down to a duel between Sachin Tendulkar and the rookie speed merchant. Tendulkar (62) showed his class and weathered the storm as debutant batsman Pravin Amre (55) gave him company to help India win that match by three wickets.""I came into bat after Azhar departed. We were tottering at 60 for 4 and we badly needed a big partnership. I was a little intimidated with the way Donald was bowling, initially I thought I wouldn't last long. But I told myself this is the chance to prove my mettle on s a big stage and I must give it a shot. It was a big advantage to have Sachin at the other end and it felt like batting in a local match at Shivaji Park once we took charge,"" Amre said.Venkatapathy Raju, the highest wicket-taker for India that game, has fond memories. ""I feel lucky to be part of history. Some of their stalwarts like Kepler Wessels, Clive Rice and Peter Kirsten had decent experience of playing in English County, but the atmosphere at Eden Gardens was something else,"" Raju said.Both the countries have come a long way since then, but this is one comeback no South African will ever forget."

With the Krishna-Godavari delta region being the rice bowl, any output reduction is likely to hit both AP and Telangana. The common capital Hyderabad too gets a bulk of its food grain and cereal supplies from East and West Godavari and Krishna district.The failure of northeast monsoon coupled with steep fall in reservoir levels has already affected Rabi activities.The sudden demonetisation of high value currency is the proverbial last straw for farmers. Any further delay in Rabi sowing will affect the total productivity of food grains.Though the farmers wanted to take up cultivation in the second week of November despite the dry spell, the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has left them fearful. While the percentage of area under cultivation increased by three per cent when compared to the previous week, it increased by only one per cent between November 9 and 24.""Since rural banks are not dispensing enough cash, we are using whatever little money we have for harvesting Kharif crop. With this, sowing operations during the Rabi season have dipped when compared to last year's activity during the same period,"" said P Sivaiah of Peda pulipaka in Krishna district.However, sowing is of little use after the second week of December, since transplantation work for paddy will be in the final stage. This is said to have affected total food grain production in the state.The drought across the state during Kharif is estimated to result in a sharp decline of food grain production. The 2015-16 food grain production stood at 13.96 million tonnes of which about 8.5 million tonnes was produced in the Kharif season and 5.4 million in the Rabi.Thanks to the drought conditions in 13 districts between July and September, it is estimated that Kharif food production is set to fall by 30 per cent. If a similar situation prevails even in the current Rabi, the production will further decline.Assuming that the situation would continue for two more weeks, agriculture experts say it will affect the total food grain production. ""There will be about three million tonnes decline in food grain production in the Khariff season due to drought. The dry spell coupled with cash crunch is also expected to ha ve its effect on the overall agricultural production scenario. Though it is too early to predict the outcome, about 20 per cent of produce, especially pulses, will be affected,"" said former member of Indian Council of Agricultural Research M V S Nagi Reddy .Calculations based on above prediction show that there will be a likely slump of 1 - 1.2 lakh tonnes in food grain production in the Rabi season. Therefore, the food grain production is going to be just about 9-10 lakh tonnes this year. It may be recalled that the state targeted 17.9 million tonnes food grain production in 2016-17 as initial reports showed good monsoon this year.As the food grains produced in 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh also meet the needs of Telangana and parts of Tamil Nadu , arrival of grains in Hyderabad and other cities is likely to be affected. ""Drought has played a major role in the decline. We need to wait and see if ramifications of demonetisation will reflect on the total food grain production,"" said a senior official from agriculture department."

The apex court on September 1 directed the state government to return the 997.11 acres of Singur land to its owners. The Hooghly administration has fixed the last and final date of hearing for Singur farmers to ascertain ownership rights for the undistributed land on December 8. What's more is that the government has also extended the supply of subsidised rations (8 kg rice per household at Rs 2 a kilo) and the monthly dole Rs 2,000 till March 2017.Accordingly, the state food and supplies department on Tuesday evening sent food slips to the three panchayats  Beraberi, Gopalnagar and Kamarkundu-Gopalnagar-Doluigachha  surrounding the Singur land. The reason for the extension becomes quite apparent when one takes a look at the erstwhile Nano compound. JCB excavators are still at work levelling the ground there. While a section of land owners at the Gopalnagar has started farming, vast portions of the acquired land still remain vacant.The situation has prompted land agents to lure landowners having their plots along the Durgapur Expressway with very high rates. Sensing the mood, the Singur block land and land revenue office has stopped doing changes in land mutation.However, a small section of farmers is bothered with the nature of land mentioned in the new record of rights (RoR) issued by the administration. There are hundreds who haven't got the RoRs till date.""I am getting SOS from anxious land-owners everyday waiting to get the RoRs. There are at least 1,000 such farmers under the Beraberi panchayat area, leave aside the two panchayats,"" said Trinamool-run Beraberi panchayat pradhan Dipankar Ghosh."

However, the MP had rubbished the speculations as a rumour spread by his rivals.In 2012, Punsup had issued 1.74 lakh sacks of paddy weighing 61,000 quintals for custom milling. Though 2,959.40 quintals of rice was delivered to the Food Corporation of India in the account of Punsup, the remaining 56,639.75 quintals of rice were not delivered.Punsup's Ferozepur district manager, Manprit Singh , said if police did not act against the mill, they would take the legal route to recover the amount of missing paddy from the mill. Refuting the charges, Ghubaya said his wife has nothing to do with the embezzlement of the stocks, as she had withdrawn her share well before the detection of shortage. He claimed that all relevant documents had been submitted to Punsup."

The food and civil supplies department, which has begun seeding Aadhaar cards with ration cards as part of the exercise to weed out bogus ration cards, has started work on setting up a comprehensive web-based, real-time tracking system of PDS trucks .It plans to fit trucks with RFID tags along with weight-based emptiness detection and stock calculator technology to detect diversion of commodities meant for fair price shops.""The objective is to continuously track movement of vehi cles to ensure the commodities are delivered properly and on time to the FPS. The new technology not only tracks vehicles but also gives information about stock in a moving truck,"" said food and civil supplies minister U T Khader He said the government has been receiving many complaints regarding non-availability of sufficient ration for poor families in spite of being supplied with optimum amount of foodgrain from godowns, especially in Bengaluru Urban districts.Around 5 quintals of various essential commodities, including rice and wheat, are supplied from FCI godowns to the FPS. Around 500 trucks are deployed for transportation every month, said a senior official of the Food and Civil Supplies Corporation .

India and the US have improved security and intelligence cooperation in the past few years, including in sensitive areas like AfPak. From frowning on India's presence in Afghanistan, the US has evolved its position significantly . In recent years, the US has openly welcomed Indian participation in Afghanistan 's security sector.The challenges to global security are expected to only increase in the coming years.It would be important for India to gauge the security priorities of the incoming US administration and talk about India's own interests in the neighbourhood. The Islamic State and its implications would play a big role in the security calculations of both countries in the coming years.US-Russia relations are also important for India. While the incoming Donald Trump administration has not taken an enemy approach to Russia, it remains to be seen whether the US intends to reset Russia relations to more normal ones.One of India's interests here would be for the US to wean Russia away from China's vice-like grip.

After a mega aqua park and a pharmaceutical company, the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin is all set to witness experiments on shale gas reserves hidden inside the earth's surface.Shale gas is a natural gas trapped inside shale, a type of soft rock. The Krishna-Godavari basin contains vast reserves of shale gas, which could help the country with fresh supplies of natural fuel. But environment experts and activists warn that extraction of shale gas and oil could kill the delicate ecological balance in the region and even trigger tremors . A public hearing is scheduled for December 6 in Bhimavaram, West Godavari to elicit the views of the residents and experts on the controversial exploration procedure called `hydro-fracking'. The Centre has proposed to conduct shale gas exploration at five places in the KG basin two exploratory wells each in East and West Godavari and one in Krishna district. The public hearing for the Krishna well was held at Mandavalli recently .""Extraction of shale gas through hydro-fracking, which involves sending of water, sand and harmful chemicals under high pressure into the earth to widen natural fractures in the bedrock, is disastrous to say the least. It may trigger tremors, pollute the sea and cause cancers as carcinogens are used in the procedure, which has been banned by several developed countries like France, Bulgaria, Germany and some states in the USA,"" said Kalapala Babu Rao, chief scientist (retired). Babu Rao is speaheading a campaign against shale gas exploration in Andhra Pradesh.The Centre had stopped a similar procedure in Tanjavur district of Tamil Nadu after farmers launched an agitation. Experts also argue that exploration of shale gas from the ecologically fragile delta region will affect the livelihood of thousands of villagers, besides damaging the habitat of various lifeforms including the mangroves. ""Use of large volumes of water for exploration will cause water stress in the delta, which is known for water intensive crops. Any activity involving fracturing of the bed rock is scientifically dangerous,"" said environment activist V Satyanarayana."

Bengal is the biggest paddy-producing state in the country.The government is still undecided on holding 330 procurement camps at different blocks for the Rabi season. ""Demonetisation has dealt a body blow to the state's agrarian economy . If this uncertainty continues, there will be disaster,"" said state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick . He has convened an emergency meeting on November 26 to decide whether the camps should be cancelled.Agriculture experts say if the situation persists, there will be an unnatural price jump with supply going haywire. According to agriculture department sources, the state has recorded a bumper crop of 1.75 crore tonne paddy this year, but much of this is yet to be reaped. With no cash in hand, around 80% of the farmers have not been able to engage labourers for harvesting. Within a few days, the seeds will drop from the shrubs and it will become extremely difficult to retrieve them, explained an officer from the agriculture department.Ironically, the bumper production had earlier led the food department to upwardly revise its paddy procurement target to 52 lakh tonne in 2016-17 from last year's 40 lakh tonne.""The situation is very grave. Over 80% of the paddy has not been reaped. The liquidity crunch has become severe because of the complete collapse of co-operative banks,"" said agriculture minister Purnendu Bose.Given the situation, it would be futile to hold the procurement camps, the food minister said. ""Each camp runs up a cost of Rs 4,500 per day. The total cost for the first round of procurement runs into Rs 12 crore. If paddy cannot reach the camps, the entire exercise will be futile,"" he said.In Burdwan, the rice bowl of Bengal and the highest paddy-producing district of India, paddy has not been harvested in 60% of the land. ""In Burdwan, 4.20 lakh hectare is devoted to paddy cultivation. But harvesting is very low this year,"" said Burdwan district magistrate Soumitra Mohan.This year, the state has fixed the minimum support price of paddy at Rs 1,470 per quintal (1tonne = 10 quintal). Besides, it is also offering farmers Rs 20 per quintal as encouragement grant. The government is also maintaining transparency by transferring funds through the RTGS system directly to the farmers' bank accounts."

""Vegetables were always purchased using cash and many schools did the same for kirana items such as oil, pulses and spices. They have extended their line of credit to the limit now. If things don't change in the next few weeks, we will face a serious problem,"" the official said.The biggest requirement for MDM is rice which is supplied to city schools directly by the government through Food Corporation of India (FCI). A school's principal said, ""But rice is not the only component for a meal. We have to purchase costly things like oil, ginger, garlic, lots of vegetables and packaged spices. Then comes the gas cylinder, remuneration for cook and overheads for washing as well as cleaning of utensils. This was always done through cash and now we all have been stuck.""Another principal said the credit line with vendors has been stretched too much. ""As it is we would get reimbursed by the education department two or three months after submitting the bill, so we maintained the same credit cycle with vendors . But the cash flow cycle is broken and if we don't get access to cash by next month, it can be a problem,"" said another principal.An MDM official admitted that schools have been forced to run a tight ship due to cash constraints, but added that the quality of food served has not been affected. ""Since vendors have been the same for years and they too understand the situation, no one is complaining. Students are being served proper meals without any problem, but if things remain the same till February, then there will be chaos.""""It just takes one person down the vendor chain to stop supply and demand payment. We are hoping that this does not happen,"" the official said, emphasizing that many vendors are still averse to accepting non-cash payment.

For all other purposes, right from the ingredients to the preparation, associating manddare with rice or sago fritters is entirely misleading.For one they are sweetish, and two, these lightly coloured crispies are prepared from red pumpkin, a fruit that grows in abundance during the last quarter of the year.""In the past, manddare were prepared in the economically backward homes,"" says former teacher E Costa of Colva, sharing how culinary ingenuity came into play to create this well-appreciated treat.Historian and author Fatima da Silva Gracias avers by this and says that the preparation, though tasteless, was once a must among the underprivileged, as it was economical and popular in South Goa, particularly Salcete.""Pumpkins are easy to grow. So right after the feast of the Holy Cross, on May 3, people would plant pumpkin seeds,"" Costa says.Our agri-savvy ancestors apparently put a lot of forethought into choosing when to sow the seeds. ""Planting the seeds in May meant they would be saved from the deluge of monsoon showers during the vulnerable sprouting stage,"" Costa says, adding that by the time the monsoon came around, the sapling was ready to soak up the water and bear fruit.By October-end, the pumpkin which had, proverbially speaking, been fattening, is ready for plucking.""Not many know how to prepare manddare anymore,"" says homemaker Senia Costa e Dias of Carmona , adding that it is only the older generation that will be able to share the recipe today. Nevertheless, she just about manages to gather the technique from her sources.""Boiled pumpkin and rice are ground together with sugar to a paste that is neither too slurry nor too pasty,"" she says, which makes it clear that the preparation process requires practice and skill.The mixture is then spread into small, flat pancake shapesnot too thin, not too thickin bowls. These are steamedideally in a konfro (steamer)sun dried and stored. They are brought out on Christmas eve when they are deep fried and placed in airtight containers, ready to be served the next day.""Food colouring may be added to the dough to lend the wafers a colourful look,"" says Gracias.Colourful or not, pushed to the periphery of culinary memory or not, manddare still feature prominently in several cookbooks and blogspots, with a detailed guide to mastering these tricky fritters.So, go right ahead and help the manddare make a comeback."

Arrivals have reduced to just 30%-40% of the regular quantity, of late. A few traders might be accepting the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes but the majority are accepting only other denominations.There are around 250 traders and commissioned agents who are licensed to trade in the market, but not more than 50 such traders and agents are functioning at present.According to the entry logs, the average arrival of vehicles, trucks and trolleys of farmers, bringing in wheat, rice and pulses stood around 60 vehicles per day in the last week of October and the first week of November.However, the number of vehicles now averages around 25, following the demonetisation move. Traders say that the move has hit them hard and they are not able to sell their stocks.Our sales dipped by around 80%-90% from November 8. Farmers are also not bringing the produce; most of them are rushing to banks to get cash and deposit their scrapped notes, Shahzad Ali, a commissioned agent at the market, said.Earlier, we sold 200-300 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of rice on a daily basis but now, we sell around 30-40 quintals per day. Today, we sold Basmati rice at Rs. 2,251 per quintal and Sharbati rice at Rs. 1,600-Rs. 1,700 per quintal. The prices have, however, remained stable and not decreased considerably. There is a difference of Rs. 100, at maximum, in some instances, he said.Others said that they are selling five bags of wheat since the demonetisation, compared to 50 bags per day, earlier.Farmers, who came to the market in search of fertiliser said that they are finding it difficult to procure fertilisers, as it is the right time to sow wheat.Nooran, a farmer from Piplehda in Masuri, said, Shops where we usually purchase fertilisers are now demanding new notes. If we are not provided fertilisers within 10 days, the produce (of wheat) will be affected.Mohammed Mubarik, a farmer from Dhabarsi village in Hapur, said, I am trying to sell the rice I produced in the market but everyone is offering scrapped notes. Else, they tell us to come after the effect of demonetisation is mitigated. How long can a farmer wait? I need money right away for sowing wheat."

We have taken up the matter with the minister. Lets see if we can borrow staff from other departments, Meena said.According to Amrita Johri, an activist working under the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, NFSA in Delhi has been patchily implemented with the needy being excluded. The homeless, the transgenders and the differently abled are the ones who do not have ration cards because they do not have Aadhar cards or ID proofs mandatory in Delhi, even after the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhar cards was not compulsory, she said.Johri said that the Delhi government can allocate funds for the scheme beyond the sanctioned quota financed by the Centre.

Suthar says he used to buy at least five kilos of each vegetable daily. Now, I cant buy more than two kilos. I dont have cashcant give change to my customers, he said.Shahzad Ali, a commission agent at the Navin Anaj Mandi in Ghaziabad, used to sell 200-300 quintals of rice daily. His current sales stand at 30-40 quintals.Traders, both retail and wholesale, in Delhi-NCR are feeling the pinch of Centres demonetisation move. Though prices of essential commodities such as wheat, rice, pulses and vegetables have remained stable so far but traders warned that they may increase if the current situation continues to prevail.Wholesalers in Delhi-NCR mandis say that the supply of grains and vegetables has also been hit because transporters have not been able to pay truck drivers. In fact, the entire supply chain which includes from the main wholesaler at the top to the loader at the mandi at the bottom, have been hit due to lack of cash inflow.Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said,We are taking goods from farmers mostly on credit. The vendors and middlemen are also buying from us on credit. This has ensured that the supply we get is less and the quantity being sold is lesser. We cant get a lot and also sell little, too, on credit. The situation wont improve unless the currency chaos gets stabilised, Sharma said.At Khandsa Mandi, the largest wholesale fruit and vegetables market in Gurgaon, the number of trucks bringing onion have come down from 10 to four since last week. The supply of tomato has also been hit.Inderjeet Thakran, president, Gurgaon sabzi mandi, said farmers have refused sell for lack of cash and it might lead to price rise. We dont have buyers even when the supply has reduced drastically, he said. Vegetables were piling up at Khandsa Mandi on Wednesday as retailers did not turn up. The supply has come down by half as trucks remain stranded in several parts of the country, Thakran said.Read: No old currency please, Ghaziabad man adds note to daughters wedding cardTruck operators in Delhi-NCR said nearly half of their 4.5 lakh vehicles have come to a standstill. The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said about two lakh trucks have not reached Delhi-NCR with supplies in last few days.In some cases, traders are managing transactions through credit and receipts since Friday but non-payment of dues is having a cascading effect. The retailers are not paying wholesalers who are further not able to pay to suppliers and farmers. And, if perishable items like fruits and vegetables are not picked up by retailers, it would cause losses to wholesalers.At Navin Anaj Mandi in Govindpuram, Ghaziabad, the inflow of supply trucks has gone down by at least 60%. We are also not accepting old notes for Mandi Shulk (2% market charge on traders sale) since November 8. Arrival has reduced to 30-40%. Some traders might be taking the old notes but the majority is accepting the other denomination, said Rajesh Yadav, secretary, Mandi Samiti.Farmers are also hit hard. A group of farmers said they are finding it difficult to arrange fertilizer even as the time is ripe to sow wheat.The shops and other markets where we go to purchase fertilizer are now demanding new notes. We have none left now. If in the next 10 days the fields are now provided fertilizer, wheat crop will be affected, said Nooran, a farmer from Piplehda village in Masuri.(Gulam Jeelani, Rashpal in Gurgaon, Peeyush Khandelwal in Ghaziabad and Ritam Halder in New Delhi)"

Also, it is viewed as an attempt to improve nutrition levels in food items in a country saddled with about a quarter of the worlds malnourished population.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued on Monday a new guideline that sets standards for fortification of food products with vitamin, iodine, folic acid and other nutrients across all items, stipulating minimum and maximum levels.The new rule says every manufacturer and packer will have to give an undertaking on quality assurance and submit evidence of the steps taken, including getting the test done of the product from an approved government laboratory.The new norms will be applicable to all fortified foods and the Fssai will push for wholesome consumption in cooperation with government departments.But civil society organisations such as the Right to Food campaign and Supreme Court-appointed food commissioners have opposed introduction of fortified food packets in place of fresh cooked meals in schools and anganwadis  a programme to combat child hunger and malnutrition and provide basic healthcare in villages.They said the rule will do more harm than good while increasing profits of big food manufacturers.It is a clear attempt by government to override Supreme Court guidelines against use of fortified food in government programmes in place of hot cooked meals, said Harsh Mander, a top court-appointed food commissioner.This is part of the governments agenda to promote corporate lobby which sees huge business in government-run food schemes.A health ministry functionary allayed fears, saying the new norms will ensure supply of quality fortified food through government-run schemes aimed at checking malnutrition.Several BJP-ruled states such as Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have introduced packaged fortified food in schools and anganwadis. Opposition parties have alleged that contracts for such food have gone to people close to the ruling party.Pawan Agarwal, chief executive officer of FSSAI, had earlier said the rules will initially cover wheat flour, rice, oil and milk while all food items would be gradually brought under the ambit of a comprehensive regulation.Many companies have been promoting fortified daily food items such as wheat flour, milk products and rice without any quality assurance to consumers. We are introducing a mechanism to ensure that they deliver on their promise, another Fssai official said.Also, the FSSAI had said the new rule would supersede all previous regulations regarding fortification of foods and special dietary uses except those in the law on infant milk and food items.Yes, the rule will override previous provisions by any government department, a FSSAI official said."

The pujas of Hooghly district and especially those in the former French colony of Chandernagore attracts devotees from far and wide.Read: Troublesome Thursday: How the first day of Rs 500, Rs 1000 exchange panned outJust like Durga puja, Jagadhatri puja is held over four days. This year the dates were on November 7 to 10, and the abolition of the big denominations struck right in the middle of the pujas on the evening of November 8.According to Soumen Bit, assistant secretary of Italgacha Nagarik Brinda, located near Kolkata airport, which have been organising Jagadhatri Puja for the past 10 years appeared confused and tense. I just cannot figure out how I will manage to buy 250 kilograms of rice and approximately seven bags of potato so that we could serve pulao and alu dum to the residents of our locality, he told HT on Wednesday.An angry chief minister lashed out at the Narendra Modi government and remarked at a public meeting that she didnt have the money to buy sweets to offer to the goddess and had to borrow cash from someone for the purpose. (HT Photo)Members of the puja committee visited various grocery shops since Wednesday morning but they could buy nothing since everywhere they went they produced R 1000 or R 500 notes, which all grocers refused to accept.We have the cash, yet we cannot purchase anything. We had the same experience when they went to the market to buy flowers and fruits required for the pujas, Bit said.Later, with the help of a local political leader, they managed to get the flowers and fruits on credit from flower and fruit sellers.Read: Numismatists to preserve Rs 500, Rs 1000 samples for antique value in futureWhile puja, anjali and aarti were on, the puja committee organised a meeting at the pandal premises to figure out how they would be able to make payments to artists who were supposed to perform during a cultural programme on Wednesday evening. We had to pay for the folk singer and had to buy various items that were supposed to be given out to winners of conch shell blowing, candle lighting and panipuri (phuchka) eating competition, Soumen Bit said.Similar difficulty was faced by Mahesh Bag who organise Jagadhatri Puja at his house. Locals know me since I have been staying at this locality since childhood, therefore I managed to get everything on credit. I will make all payments once the banks and ATMs open on November 10. Bag told HT.We will need money for the procession which will be taken out for immersion of the idol on Friday, I am confused about what will happen on that day.Read: Stunned over new Rs 1,000 rule woman dies of shock outside bank in GorakhpurThe news of the banning of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes broke at a time (on Tuesday night) when the streets of Chandernagore were full of devotees and revellers. The news prompted an immediate rush towards the ATMs and, in about two hours, there was chaos as many street food vendors refused notes of these denominations.I will land in bigger trouble if I keep accepting these notes, said Atul Baidya, a snacks vendor who preferred to let go a few customers.Visiting the former French colony the next day, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that the note ban effectively spoilt the festive mood in the town.I had to loan to buy sweets to offer the goddess. Many people could not offer sweets to the goddess because they hardly had Rs 100 notes with them, she had said while visiting a Jagaddhatri puja pandal."

Yet, more than a year since the project of installing Point of Sale (PoS) devices at the 2,282 odd FPSs in Delhi took off, only 1.3% of them have it so far.The Centre has set a deadline of March 31, 2017 for setting up a biometric system through which the ration card holders could get subsidised grains. While Delhi was supposed to be the showcase city by being the first to implement it, achieving the target on time seems unlikely.The state food and supplies department has floated as many as three tenders so far, but none could attract bidders for installation, operation and maintenance of the devices.We are adding a new feature of cashless transactions in the PoS devices. The final Request for Proposal (RFP) is ready and tenders will be floated soon. The selected bidder will begin work thereafter. Previous RFPs had several loopholes, a department official said. Owing to repeated delays, the Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) stepped in to revisit the project, and is now co-drafting the proposal.Food and supplies minister Imran Hussain took a review meeting on Thursday. With the installation of swipe machines, ration card holders can make payment for procuring food grains through RuPay Card, Debit Card, Credit Card etc, if they are short of cash. Cash option will remain though, he said.STATE OF THE PILOT PROJECTPoS were installed at 42 FPSsBy June, 2016, five machines were withdrawn due to malfunctioningmachines were withdrawn due to malfunctioning By December, 2016, 13 machines were withdrawn due to malfunctioningmachines were withdrawn due to malfunctioning Problems include: Machines not being user-friendly, poor battery life, problems of mismatching of fingerprints, poor networkThe Capital has 2,282 FPSs, with nearly 72.8 lakh people using them. By now, all of them were supposed to distribute essential commodities like wheat, rice and sugar through fingerprint or iris detection of beneficiaries.However, even the pilot project in which 42 such shops were installed with PoS machines is now gradually being withdrawn. Data accessed by HT revealed that, at present, only 29 FPS have functioning PoS devices.Food and Supplies Officers (FSOs) have complained that the machines installed in the few FPSs are not working efficiently. These are not user-friendly and have poor battery life. Many a times fingerprints do not match and poor network is a big problem, an FSO said on condition of anonymity.The delay is despite the fact that Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding. This means the government did not have to spend anything extra in getting biometrics of ration card holders as Aadhar cards in Delhi are mandatory for getting enrolled under the National Food Security Act, 2013.DIGITISATION PLAN"

In addition, they also complained that whenever they raise their voices against the poor food quality, they are beaten and harassed by jail authorities.The prohibition was implemented with effect from last Friday after it had issued a circular about its implementation in all the 122 jails of the state including central jails, district jails and sub-jails.It came to light after additional district magistrate (ADM) of Guna, Niyaz Ahmad Khan, made a surprise inspection of the sub-jail on Wednesday. The sub-jail has a capacity of 74 people but currently it houses 72 inmates.Jail officials sold pulses to outside peopleThere were many irregularities inside the jail including improper food and unhygienic toilets for the inmates. I came to know about the food after I spoke to some of the inmates. They also complained that they are not getting sufficient food and said they are beaten and harassed when they protest for it (food), Khan told HT on Friday, adding he found the allegations right after visiting the sub-jails kitchen.I found only egg-plants and no other vegetables in the kitchen. In addition, I also found pulses which were not being given to inmates. Jail officials allegedly would sell them to people outside, said Khan, adding that the quality of rice kept in the kitchen was also very bad and he has sent the sample of the same for further inspection.No proper toilet facilities for inmatesKhan also said that apart from food, there were also no proper toilet facilities as only one out of a total of five toilets was usable due to filth.After the inspection I immediately sent a medical team to the jail to provide proper treatment to the sick inmates. I have also submitted a report of findings to the district magistrate and have asked the sub-divisional magistrate to ensure inmates are given proper food and facilities according to the norms and regulations, added Khan.When contacted, director general (jail) Sanjay Choudhary said proper action would be taken in the matter. If the inspection report is given to us, then we would definitely take proper action. There is a proper diet chart for inmates and I will ensure they are given food according to it, said Choudhary."

Jharkhands people, mostly women, suffer from iron deficiency. The DFS salt will help fight against anemia, said food and public distribution minister Saryu Rai.Colour of the salt will be pale yellow, he said.Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh governments too earlier launched the similar double fortified salt.Jharkhand has the highest number of women having iron deficiency in the country with 70% females between the age group of 15 and 49 are anemic, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-III).Head of gynecology department of Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) Dr Pratibha Rai said, Anaemia has been a bane for Jharkhand women. 90% of women visiting PMCH are anaemic. Anaemia causes low productivity in adults, slow development among children, severe anaemia also leads to low birth weight and child mortality.She said state health department took several initiatives such as distribution of iron pills to control anaemia. Lack of awareness among people is proving to be a major hindrance in the success of the programmes. Rural women do not take iron pills regularly. We hope DFS salt could bring some result in controlling anaemia, Rai said.Disbursement of the salt will be made through biometric system like other PDS items sold through the fair price shops. Under the system consumers require to give thumb impressions to get a link to their biometric data recorded under their Aadhaar number to collect the PDS items, said Sanjay Kundu, state general secretary of the Fair Price Dealers Association.He said earlier iodized salt was given to the ration card holders, which was a huge hit among consumers.Distribution of double fortified salt is the second big PDS programme undertaken by the state government. From October last year it started distributing 5 kg of rice and wheat per household for Rs 1 under the National Food Security Act. The scheme covered more than 2.63 crore people out of the states total population of 3.29 crore."

The chapattis come for 3 rupees each with free daal.The canteens launched in 2013, and costing around Rs 300 crores every year, are hugely popular.I walk 3 km every day to have my meals here.

A delegation from Egypt visited the state in 2014 to study the model.OdishaOdias love their dalma  a watery mixture of lentil and boiled vegetables  and the Ahaar centres serving them piping hot with rice at just 5 rupees a plate have proven to be a big draw.Though meant for the poor, the 111 centres serving lunch in all 30 districts of the state have even white-collar employees lining up before them. The rice may be a bit coarse, but the food is tasty, said Biswajit Sahoo, a corporate executive in the town of Bhadrak, who takes off his tie each time he goes to buy a token for a meal.From Balasore in the north to Malkangiri in the south, the Ahaar centres are also fodder for renewed political mudslinging. The opposition calls them a cheap gimmick, a charge rejected by the BJD of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Its our most popular scheme, said Priyadarshi Mishra, a ruling party MLA.Andhra PradeshNTR Anna Canteens are to Andhra Pradesh what Amma Canteens are to Tamil Nadu.Launched in June, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu christened the scheme after ex-chief minister and his father-in-law, N T Rama Rao. But the presence of Anna (big brother in Telugu) in the name suggests he too is eyeing an Amma-like status for himself.NTR Anna Canteens are already feeding hundreds of government employees who have recently relocated from Hyderabad to the states new capital Amaravati. The quality is good, though the taste could have been better, said Krishnaveni, a secretariat employee.Read | Inspired by Amma, Naidu launches Anna NTR canteens in AndhraTelanganaMeals for 5 rupees are available at 50 kiosks in Hyderabad since 2014. At present, they feed to 15,000 people daily and the subsidy per plate works out to 15 rupees, said Hyderabad Mayor Bonthu Rammohan Rao.The meal of rice, sambar and pickle is frugal, but the dividend, apparently, rich. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithis convincing victory in the municipal polls earlier this year, when it won 100 of the 150 seats, is credited to the subsidised meal scheme. It is, therefore, not surprising that the government is planning to start 100 more canteens in the next year.Hyderabad residents with a Rs 5 meal, a scheme being implemented by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. (HT Photo)But government staff is not exactly complaining. Yet to be built, Amaravati is still a cluster of villages and the canteens offer them a change of taste and cheap food. Breakfasts cost five rupees while lunch prices vary from 6.50 to 7.50 rupees.Government subsidy per plate comes to 40 rupees. It is , however, going ahead with plans to set up 35 such canteens in Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur.JharkhandThough not as well known as Tamil Nadus Amma Canteens, Jharkhands Mukhyamantri Dal Bhat Yojana (chief ministers dal rice scheme) has by far been the oldest of soup kitchens run in the country.Former chief minister Arjun Munda started 370 centres in 2011 to feed the poor in the drought-hit state. They mostly closed down some years later for want of money, but the government relaunched them in January this year.The food is cheap plus less oily, said Sunita Kumari, a middle-aged woman savouring a meal at the centre near a prominent Ranchi hospital. Around 22.5 lakh people are being fed and the government spends Rs 25 crore annually.Madhya PradeshChief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is planning to launch his own version of subsidised canteens next year.

The season for sowing wheat is at its peak and we are losing time every day. A farmer will be ruined and left with no option but to commit suicide if seeds are not sown right away, Chaudhary said.Chaudhary, who owns nearly 50 bigha of land, is one among many such farmers.Traders at the markets are paying us in scrapped currency. If we dont accept, they refuse to buy our produce. We dont have enough time to deposit scrapped notes in banks and then stand in lines to withdraw cash. In this season, farmers should be in the fields, Chaudhary said.Another farmer, Mahesh Kumar from Sadarpur village in Ghaziabad, said that he sowed wheat on eight bigha of land without fertilizer.I could not purchase fertilizer with scrapped notes earlier and the eight bigha will hardly yield a produce. Somehow, I arranged 100 notes and bought fertilizer for the remaining seven bigha. I went to the bank but they said that there is no cash. I had to borrow from my friends and relatives to buy some fertilizer. If a similar situation persists for few more days, it would be devastating for wheat production across the belt, he said.He said that he sold his earlier produce of rice for 80,000 on November 5, three days prior to the demonetisation move. I deposited the money in my bank but was not able to withdraw and meet needs for producing another crop of wheat. There are long queues outside banks but no cash available for us, he said.To support farmers, the government on November 21 allowed farmers to purchase seeds with 500 notes from centres, units and outlets of Central or state governments, public sector undertakings, national or state seeds corporations, Central or state agricultural universities, and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), on producing identity proof.This was in addition to the earlier decision to permit farmers to draw up to 25,000 per week from their KYC compliant accounts, subject to the normal loan limits and conditions.Farmers are still finding it hard to buy seeds and fertilizers. They are also not in a position to purchase daily needs. Some traders are arranging goods for them, which they can repay later. We have a withdrawal limit of 50,000 per week, but with this amount, we cannot pay every farmer. The limit should be raised, Sudhir Goel, a trader at the market, said.District magistrate Nidhi Kesarwani said directions from the government in this regard must be complied with to ensure farmers are not affected.Traders cannot pay them in scrapped currency. We will check the problems and ensure that the issues are resolved. We may also hold camps for farmers. On Wednesday, we sent cooperative officers to resolve farmers issues in rural areas and to look into the issues of around 1.5 lakh farmers who are part of samitis (committees), she said."

The story did not have a response from any police or government spokesperson.Kashmir Reader was banned on October 2 for allegedly inciting violence during the ongoing unrest in the Valley that has claimed at least 90 lives and left thousands injured.Read | J-K govt shuts down English daily to maintain public tranquillityReshi, a student of convergent journalism at the Central University of Kashmir, said he was presented before a Munsif court in Magam on Friday and directed to apply for bail from the sessions court in Budgam. I was in police detention during the day (on Friday) and allowed to go home in the evening, Reshi was quoted as saying in a media report.On Friday night when Hindustan Times called the station house officer of Magam police station, Aftab Ahmad, to verify Reshis statement, the officer denied making any arrest. There are charges against him but he has not been arrested, the officer said.Consequently, police also said Reshi circulated fake news and for a normal incident of crop burning he blamed the forces.JK Police had on September 30 released a statement denying the charges but it did not have any specific reference to the Kashmir Reader article.Apropos to the news item published by a section of press under the heading, Forces set ablaze rice crop in Budgam. In this regard district police administration Budgam have clarified that the incident has been maliciously linked with forces.

Society scares her with the spectre of the vicious stranger lurking in dark alleys ready to strike. She is told to be unassuming and be aware of her surroundings.But a far-less asked question is how safe women are within the confines of the four walls of their own homes. This is dangerous, considering statistics show that an increasing number of women face sexual assault inside their houses at the hands of people they know.Incestuous abuse, domestic violence, child sexual abuse and marital rape have become a part of many households dirty laundry but are too taboo to be discussed in public  but this reticence only hurts the victims who struggle to report their abuse.Read | A mothers open letter: Dear son, lets talk about rapeWomen are not safe anywhere, not at home and not when they step out. Abuse at home is not just an aberration, says Anuja Gupta, founder and executive director of RAHI foundation, a one-of-its-kind NGO that offers support to survivors of incestuous abuse.Facts 8 of 10 women surveyed reported sexual abuse during their childhood and adolescence, according to a RAHI foundation survey in 1998.40% respondents said they were survivors of incestuous abuse, ie, they had been assaulted or harassed by at least one family member.Govt enacted the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act in 2012, but its impact has been limited.In Delhi, 82 cases were registered under Pocso in 2015, 107 cases in 2014, and 136 cases in 2013.Indian Penal Codes section 375 says a man cannot rape his wife unless the wife is less than 15 years of age.In 97.7% rapes of married women, victims said their husband was the aggressor: A 2014 Rice Institute studyThe subjugation of women at the hands of men and patriarchal power begins early and inside the home. Many women have their first brush with abuse, harassment and molestation at a young age.There are hidden secrets in every family. Incestuous abuse is the biggest one, says Gupta. Such incidents cut across socio-economic backgrounds, she adds.A study by her foundation revealed that eight of 10 women surveyed reported some form of sexual abuse during their childhood and adolescence.40% of these women also said they were survivors of incestuous abuse and had been assaulted or harassed by at least one family member. In fact, in many cases the abuser is the father, says Ashwini Ailawadi, the co-founder of RAHI.A 26-year-old child sexual abuse survivor recalls her own personal nightmare. I was six when I was first made to touch somebody; 13 when somebody first touched me-- a cousin spent the entire duration of a movie with his hands between my legs. My brother was sitting right next to me, on the other side. But in the darkened movie hall, I was frozen with fear and could not find my voice to call out to him, she says.A 2007 woman and child development ministry study said more than half the child population in India (53.22%) faced sexual assault.To bring the massive number down, the government enacted the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act in 2012 but its impact has been limited.Over the past four years, 15,039 children have been identified as victims of assault under Pocso, the National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB) says.But experts say the numbers dont reflect the thousands of people who dont report their abuse or are silenced by a web of shame and intimidation.It is practically impossible for a child to speak up against an adult; especially if the adult is liked by family members. The silence is built into the abuse itself; the kind of influence the abuser might have on the child. Some might be worried about angering their parents, says Gupta.Child sexual abuse been discussed in movies such as Monsoon Wedding where Shefali Shahs character is left a shadow of her former self after surviving abuse at the hands of an older uncle. In the 2014 movie Highway, Alia Bhatt renders a powerful monologue confronting her Shukla Tayaji who abused her as a child.Shahs character is admonished by her family, including women, who say she is overreacting because she is unmarried. In real life too, this reluctance to believe their narrative can further violate children, who may be discouraged to discuss any assault further.But anyway, it is not the responsibility of the child to talk about it; the question should be what can adults do to create conditions of disclosure, says Gupta. Adults and guardians should take signs of abuse  such as sudden change in behaviour  seriously and try to have open, honest conversations with their children.But it is not just minors but also adult women who face violence at home. Marital rape is still spoken of in hushed tones and not considered a crime because it is assumed a husband has rights over his wifes body.A 2014 study conducted by the Rice Institute showed that in 97.7% of instances of rapes, the victims identified their husband as the aggressor. According to sociologist Patricia Uberoi, this could be because sex is seen as the husbands right, a womans consent be damned.There is this general understanding that marriage entitles a man to his wifes body. The woman is expected to be available just by virtue of marriage, she explains.Most of such cases go unreported  the Rice Institute study said only 0.6% of rapes by husbands make it to the police books as complaints. Last year, the NCRB said just 2% of Indias 34,651 rape cases identified the husband as the perpetrator.Experts say the low numbers are spurred on by the law, which doesnt recognise marital rape -- section 375 of the Indian penal code says a man cannot rape his wife unless the wife is less than 15 years of age.The Verma commission initially agreed on the idea of marital rape but it was not acceptable to the parliamentary committee. This may be because Parliament is predominantly men, and men do not want to accept that this occurs. They argued that you cant bring the state into the bedroom, says Ranjani Kumari, an expert who presented arguments before the Justice Verma Commission set up after the 2012 Delhi gangrape case.Human rights lawyer Karuna Nandy busts another supposed myth around marital rape  that of false complaints.False claims are very few, and convictions based on these are fewer. We need to understand though a womans claims have weight, the court still needs proof and evidence for a conviction, explains Nandy.She also calls the marriage is sacred claim dubious. Marriage may be sacred, but are you also making rape sacred?Such attitudes further discourage women from reporting cases of abuse. In a society that worships women as gods, it is disheartening to know that women are left without support and vulnerable to violence even in the supposed safety of their own homes.Lets Talk About Rape has been illustrated by Liza Donnelly, a celebrated New-York based cartoonist and writer best known for her work in The New Yorker Magazine."

He has exhausted the three Rs 500 notes he had the day the government scrapped two high-value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.The daily wage earner could not get them exchanged at the nearest bank, which is 7 km away in Bithoor, because of the heavy rush but a merchant in Hingupur agreed to pay him Rs 400 for one note.The scene is no different in cities and towns across the country after the November 8 shock announcement took out 86% of the currency out of circulation. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and ATMs across the country, as the first payday since the recall of the high-value banknotes raised fears of more chaos amid the severe cash crunch.Most government and private sector employees get their salaries credited to their accounts on the last day of the month and millions of people were expected to withdraw cash to meet their immediate needs  such as school and medical fees, newspaper bills, and other sundry purchases. In India, 78% of consumer payments are made in cash, which the government is attempting to change.A penniless Lal, however, has a way out. As he has now decided to do what almost everyone in his village has been doing for a week now - barter grains for goods.He offered the village merchant Pooran Gupta a sack full of wheat, weighing 100 kg, in exchange for vegetables, spices, wheat flour, rice and oil. He has another one at his house that he plans to trade sometime later. The owner of the field they had worked on had given them the wheat in exchange for their labour.This is the only way I can make sure my family has food and lentils with their meals. The children dont understand the problem, we cant make them understand either. They want food and we have to arrange (for food), Lal said.Money is no longer available to us. God knows when we will have work.The daughter-in-law of one of his dead brothers, Meena, is worried about arranging for the wedding of her eldest daughter. Sumans wedding has been fixed to be held on December 20 and the family doesnt have much cash to spend on the ceremonies.Meenas husband has a broken hand and her three children are too young to work. However, unlike Lal, this family has one bigha of land and rice  in abundance after the autumn harvest  would be the medium for exchange. As will be wheat for potatoes, flour, vegetables, cooking oil, spices and even for salt.Families like Meenas have been dealing in rice and wheat as currency in the countryside.I will have to trade the rice even for clothes. How will my daughter live in her sasural (in laws house) if we fail to provide right hospitality to the baratis (guests from the grooms family)? She will be teased for any folly of ours. I cannot jeopardise her dignity, we will do the best we can to arrange funds, Meena said.She has struck a deal with a farmer who would give her ghee or clarified butter, vegetables and flour for the wedding feast. In turn, he will keep one-quarter of the wheat crop the family would sow.To earn some cash, she has started working in households in Kalyanpur, 15 km away from Ghazipur, and will barter the paddy for the clothes from local shops.Gupta, the merchant who has struck some goods deals with the villagers, set a reminder. He said the barter system will not work as the villagers are bound to run out of things to exchange.Cash squeeze has begun hurting me. The number of people for barter is increasing by the day and how long I can barter is the question before me? he asked."

All that I have now is this debit card. I earn Rs 200-Rs 250 a day and it is deposited in my Andhra Bank account. I dont give a penny to my husband now, Shyamala says.Whenever I want to purchase anything  provisions or vegetables or even biscuits for my son, I go to the shop and swipe the card in the machine to pay the required amount, she adds.Shyamala, a daily wage worker, who is now using debit card for transactions (HT photo)Last week, the sleepy village about 125 km from Hyderabad officially became the first hamlet in south India to go cashless. Except for school-going children, about 1,200 villagers belonging 370 families - were given debit cards.Ibrahimpur is represented by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Raos nephew and irrigation minister T Harish Rao.There are no cash transactions in the village now. While 70% of them already have their bank accounts, in the last one month we have ensured that all the remaining families have opened their accounts in Andhra Bank branch at the nearby Nararayanraopet village, Kumbala Yella Reddy, son of sarpanch Kumbala Lakshmi, told Hindustan Times.Read all demonetisation stories herePrime Minister Narendra Modis November 8 surprise move to ban Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 banknotes resulted in an acute scarcity of cash, especially across the countryside and millions have had to stand in serpentine queues to withdraw money from banks and ATMs.The demonetisation move, Modi said, was a part of his governments efforts to purge illegal money from the market and cull counterfeit currency. It is also aimed at fast-tracking the country towards a digital, cashless economy nudging more and more Indians to use internet and mobile banking and open bank accounts.All the shops in the village, including provision stores, fertiliser shop, fair price shop, have been provided with point of sale (PoS) machines, where villagers can swipe their cards to buy goods for their daily requirements.I dont accept cash now just to encourage the villagers to use their smart cards, Praveen, a grocery shop owner, says.Most of the villagers own smartphones and have downloaded the Andhra Banks mobile wallet. We are now getting instant messages whenever we do any transaction, 50-year-old Ramulu, an agriculturist, says.However, villagers say they sometimes face the problem of network connectivity and as a result, the swiping machines stop accepting the transactions.But since it is all within the village and we all know one another, we are able to manage. Only for outsiders, it is a problem, Praveen says.To overcome this problem, the village administration has decided to provide free wi-fi connectivity to the entire village shortly. Once we get wi-fi, we are going to be completely hi-tech and smart, Yella Reddy says.K Yella Reddy, son of sarpanch Lakshmi (HT photo)In spite of getting used to cashless transactions in the last one week, some villagers desperately need money. I do not know how to use the cards. I need money for the purchase of rice and vegetables, 75-year-old Muthava, who gets Rs 1,000 every month as old age pension, says.Yella Reddy says that problem has also been taken care of.The minister has asked bank authorities to make an arrangement to disburse cash to villagers in emergency situations by using debit cards, Reddy said.The village also has a drinking water dispensing machine that can be used by swiping smart cards. All the villagers have been provided with Any Time Water (ATW) cards and all that they have to do is to swipe it in the equipment and they will get 20 litres of water at a time, Yella Reddy adds.HT In-depth: Demonetisations ever-changing rules: a complete history"

Please dont confuse people, answer their representatives satisfactorily, he said on Monday while presiding over the first state-level 20-point programme implementation committee (20-PPIC) meeting here.Be active and connect to the people, the chief minister told officials. Its a competitive world, he said, calling upon the participants to remain prepared to meet the challenges. You people have definite roles to play.Suggestions made on issues at the meeting varied from rice procurement, disbursement of students scholarships, night patrolling, MNREGA payments to self-attestations.MPs and MLAs, besides the appointed members, were invited to the meeting. The JMM and the Congress, the main opposition parties, did not attend.The government is looking into minimum wages, Das said, urging the banks to open accounts for all so that payments could be credited into them.He wanted operationalisation of e-banking in 15 days, and directed officials to suspend district labour commissioners if e-payment does not start within the period.On peoples security, he welcomed the suggestion on surprise checks of night patrolling parties and PCR vans. Night patrolling was started to instill confidence and provide security cover to the people, not to harass them or collude with offenders and criminals.On power front, Das reiterated his governments commitment to providing electricity to all villages by March 2017 and to all houses by December 2018. About 30 lakh families out of 68 lakh in Jharkhand are yet come under rural electrification.Das said his government was simplifying laws and would not backtrack on the decisions already taken.State 20-PPIC vice president Rakesh Prasad, and planning and finance secretary Amit Khare said the meeting was successful. They told reporters that a website of the state 20-PPIC would be launched to make it accessible and transparent.Prasad said suggestion on placing advertisements regarding around 400 rice procurement centres and minimum support price of 1,600 per quintal was welcomed.Khare said 48.9% of the budgetary allocations for the current fiscal has been spent till December 17, and employment generation registered a growth in the state.The next meeting will be held after six months."

And, the cafe is doing brisk business in these times of cash crunch.We are an exchange shack, promoting bartering instead of buying. We accept books in lieu of money. There has been a 60 per cent rise in barter of books for coffee and meal in the past 10 days at our cafe, says Dewan, who set up the cafe six months ago.In fact, we have had a steady stream of people who want to barter shoes, clothes, bags, etc, but as of now we accept only books-- fiction and non-fiction in good condition, says Dewan.The caf, which also accepts cash, handled 400 books last month. This month, it has already received over 650 books. The books collected are shared and exchanged among XOC community members.  One can also come and exchange books at the caf,  says Dewan.Paras (L) and Shivam at Xchange Over Coffee in Delhi Universitys North Campus (Saumya Khandelwal/HT Photo)People can also register on XOCs website and list books for barter. And if the books are exchanged between two people listed on the website, they get a coupon that can be redeemed at the cafe for a range of drinks and snacks.Not just XOC, barter platforms and communities such as Barter Daddy and Lets Barter India, which work both online and offline, have never had it so good thanks to the demonetisation of high value currency notes. There has been a 150 per cent rise in the number of users on Lets Barter Indias app in the past 10 days.Post-cash crunch, the items that people are bartering on these platforms have changed too.Post-demonetisation bartering has gone up by 50 per cent on our platform. Before the currency ban kicked in people were bartering electronics, phones, headsets, play stations and treadmills. Now, they are offering grocery, heater, microwave oven, phone recharge, events passes, etc for barter, says Sahil Dhingra, 25, founder, Lets Barter India.The other day, one of our Facebook community members paid one kilo rice to an auto-driver in Mayur Vihar instead of cash. Another user listed 5 kg rice for barter on our app, he says.Both Dhingra and Dewan have one thing in common --their unflinching faith in a world without money.Dewan quit his job last year as an energy efficiency engineer to do something meaningful in life.I was fascinated by the idea of a world without money. There is cash and then there is something called human capital-- skills, knowledge. I often wondered if there could an alternative to money, says Dewan.To find an answer, he along with his friend -- Paras Arya, also 23 and an engineer like him -- set out on a quest in March this year. Paras shares his buddys fascination with a moneyless world.For two months, Dewan and Arya, both residents of Paschim Vihar, took lift from bikers and car drivers, ate at the gurdwaras. Shivam spent several nights in the dormitory of a city monastery. It was a perfect place to live when you are experimenting with an alternative way of life. Though they (the monks) did not ask me anything in return, I voluntarily swept the halls and helped with the cleaning of utensils, says Dewan.There were days when I faced moments of despair. I felt frustrated, wondering if what I was doing was right, confusion clouding my mind. I realise monastery was a perfect place to retain my patience and peace of mind, the young entrepreneur says.So, is it possible to live without money? It is hard but not impossible, says Dewan.He says that a majority of people were kind and generous, and it was indeed possible to use your servicesincluding knowledge and skillsinstead of paying currency. We set up XOC so that people can experience that they need not always buy things. They can barter. Our objective is to create a society where your services, knowledge and your skills have more value than money, says Arya.Sahil Dhingra and Pooja Bhayana, partners in Let's Barter India in New Delhi. (Sushil Kumar/HT Photo)The story behind Dhingras Lets Barter India too is as compelling as his reason for promoting barter system. Last year, Dhingra was shutting down his business a start up-- and he was not getting good value for various items put up for sale-- furniture, computers, tablets, etc.So, a friend of mine suggested that I should try barter. I exchanged three tablets with PS4 CDs with a friend. I realised the value of barter and launched Lets Barter as a Facebook community, he says.Within four hours, he says, the community had 5,000 members. Right now it has 1 .83 lakh members, making it perhaps the worlds largest barter community on Facebook.To promote barter, Dhingra also organises events such as the Book Barter Social, where book lovers barter books in various cities such as Chandigarh, Bangalore, Jaipur, and New Delhi.Sahil Dhingra and Pooja Bhayana at Let's Barter India in New Delhi (Sushil Kumar/HT PHOTO)A few days ago, he organised a barter campaign, Lets Barter, for exchange of services at Connaught Place A young woman exchanged her baking services with a photographer who would click pictures of her products. Harinder Singh, 34, founder of Gurgaon-based Barter Daddy, wishes to take the barter culture to the next level. I have created a real estate category on our platform, where people can swap their homes, and I am sure this will happen soon.The traffic on his barter platform has increased almost five times in the past few days and people want to exchange everything from ACs to washing machines, says Singh. We should not forget that there was barter before there were coins and currency. Barter is staging a comeback, thanks to the demonetisation boost, he says."

It has been published in the journals Antiquity and Journal of Archaeological Science.Evidence for very early rice use has been known from the site of Lahuradewa in the central Ganges basin, but it has long been thought that domesticated rice agriculture did not reach South Asia until towards the end of the Indus era, when the wetland rice arrived from China around 2000 BC.We found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process in ancient South Asia, likely based around the wild species Oryza nivara. This led to the local development of a mix of 'wetland' and 'dryland' agriculture of local Oryza sativa indica rice agriculture before the truly 'wetland' Chinese rice, Oryza sativa japonica, arrived around 2000 BC, says study co-author Jennifer Bates.While wetland rice is more productive, and took over to a large extent when introduced from China, our findings appear to show there was already a long-held and sustainable culture of rice production in India as a widespread summer addition to the winter cropping during the Indus civilisation.The archaeologists sifted for traces of ancient grains in the remains of several Indus villages within a few kilometres of the site called Rakhigari: the most recently excavated of the Indus cities that may have maintained a population of some 40,000.As well as the winter staples of wheat and barley and winter pulses like peas and vetches, they found evidence of summer crops including domesticated rice, but also millet and the tropical beans urad and horsegram.They used radiocarbon dating to provide the first absolute dates for Indus multi-cropping: 2890-2630 BC for millets and winter pulses, 2580-2460 BC for horsegram, and 2430-2140 BC for rice."

It has become our largest market outside of mainland China.It was not just a letter to Xiaomis India fans on Facebook, but he was signalling a much larger directional change in the companys operations in the country. The Chinese smartphone maker, which for the longest time sold phones only through e-commerce sites, has a wide variety of products (not phones) lined up for launches in India.It has plans to bring a bunch of smart (internet-connected) appliances, cycles and scooters, rice cookers, and floor cleaning robots and televisions to India. We are beginning to build the product strategy in India. The first product was an air purifier. In a year or two, we will bring in many products in India, said Manu Jain, country head of Xiaomi India.The launches will make Xiaomi the only phonemaker to have a much larger footprint across a large set of smart products. Thats also because, Jain said, the company wanted to focus on China and India.Founder Jun was waiting to get some good sales numbers from India before launching products beyond smartphones. In the July to September quarter, for the first time, the company sold more than two million phones, according to data from research firm IDC.One out of every four smartphones sold in the country was Xiaomis. It made 75% of the phones it sold, locally, and is taking its distribution offline. The phones are now available at about 8,500 outlets.In China, it has four lines of businesses. Selling operating systems, a large e-commerce business (third largest in China), smartphones, and the smart ecosystem of devices, gadgets, vehicles and devices.Jain said, that in the long run, Xiaomi hopes to make more revenue from selling operating system, not smartphones. There are some products specific to India, too. A large number of people use dual-SIMs, so it launched a dual-Whatsapp feature. The Mi OS is available for download on the Android app store.A larger variety of products also allow Xiaomi to build its e-commerce business, which is limited to smartphones and air purifiers in India. Still, it is already one of the top-10 e-commerce companies in the country.Jain said that the company is taking sometime, as the team was small and focused on selling phones. However, it has increased its headcount three times to 150 people, over the last year.We have built this without spending money on marketing The gap between the number two player and us is 50,000 units, and few years ago the gap was a few million, said Jain. The two brands (Smasung and Micromax) have been here for 10 years Look at any parameter, and look at their growth, versus ours."

Its cold outside, but her sleeping toddler is heavy and warm in her arms.Travellers swarm around: Himalayan trekkers load up expedition backpacks. A Chinese tour group boards a bus. A dozen flight attendants in crisp blue suits and heels click by.Saro Kumari Mandal, 26, covers her head completely, a bundle of grief.Hundreds of young Nepali men excitedly wave final goodbyes to friends and family. On this day 1,500 will fly out of the Kathmandu airport bound for jobs mostly in Malaysia, Qatar or Saudi Arabia  jobs that are urgently needed by the people of this desperately poor country.But on this day, too, six young men will come back in wooden caskets, rolled like suitcases out of baggage claim on luggage carts.On the wooden lid of one someone has written in black marker: Human Remains, Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, Male  26 years  Nepali.Saros husband  another victim of a hidden and escalating tragedy.A coffin, which brought home the body of a Nepali migrant worker from Saudi Arabia, lies on the ground after cremation rituals at Swayambhunath stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)The number of Nepali workers going abroad has more than doubled since the country began promoting foreign labour in recent years -- from about 220,000 in 2008 to about 500,000 in 2015. Yet the number of deaths among those workers has risen much faster in the same period.One out of every 2,500 workers died in 2008 while last year, one out of every 500 died, according to an Associated Press analysis of data released by Nepals ministry of labour and employment.In total, over 5,000 workers from this small country have died working abroad since 2008 more than the number of US troops killed in the Iraq War.The causes, in many cases, have been mysterious. Natural death, heart attack or cardiac arrest are listed for nearly half the deaths. Most families are notified that their loved ones simply went to bed and never woke up. Thats exactly what Saro was told.But now medical researchers say these deaths fit a familiar pattern. Every decade or so, dozens, or even hundreds, of seemingly healthy Asian men working abroad in poor conditions start dying in their sleep. It happened in the US in the late 1970s, in Singapore about a decade later and more recently in China. The suspected killer even has a name: Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome.Read: In-flight beer a rare treat as Nepali migrant workers leave families for jobsNext year, an international consortium will be launched to investigate and hopefully, offer solutions.For todays arrivals, theyre too late.Extreme conditionsNepal exports iron and steel, carpets, some vegetables  but mainly, Nepal exports men. It even advertises them.Nepalese workers are well known for their hard work, dedication and loyalty, boasts the Nepalese embassy website in Doha, Qatar, where a pre-World Cup construction boom employs about 1.5 million migrants. The Nepali workers are comparatively cost effective, says the embassy, and they are experienced at working in extreme climatic conditions.The unskilled workers fill a host of global demands: building highways, stadiums and houses in Gulf states and guarding shopping malls, sewing sweatshirts and assembling televisions in Malaysia. Anyone who has bought imported sportswear or electronics, or who plans to go to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, may be using the products of their labour.A Nepali migrant worker with his son before departing for Qatar at Tribhuwan International airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)Nepali law bans recruiters and employers from charging fees. Qatar, where Balkisun was working, prohibits the fees too. But in reality, everyone has to pay for these jobs. The men borrow at 36% interest rates from money lenders or sell off family land to get the $1,100 stake needed for recruiters, airline tickets and more.Conditions vary by country and employer, but it is not uncommon for workers to find themselves living a dozen or more to a room, sleeping stacked on three-tiered bunks, working 10 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, for years.If they are lucky  and some are  they can send home wads of cash, about $300 a month. Often, however, they are tricked or cheated out of their earnings.About 10% of Nepals 28 million residents are working abroad. They send back more than $6 billion a year, amounting to about 30% of the countrys annual revenues. Only Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are more dependent on foreign earnings.Some come back maimed or disabled, like Salit Mandal, who rolled off a third-level bunk in Malaysia and smashed in his skull. He is in debt, partially paralyzed and lives with his parents.I have no idea what I am going to do or how I am going to raise them, because I cant move, he says, gazing at his three children. If my hands and legs could move I would do something, but I cant do anything.His family had pinned their hopes on him after he returned from an earlier stint in Qatar with enough money to build a five-bedroom house. Now his mom takes a visitor aside and says the situation is horrible  Salit cant squat by himself over the pit toilet, she says, and she has to clean him up afterward.His little brother Jamun Mandal, 24, is next in line. He has abandoned his aspirations of going to college and has paid the recruiting broker. He holds up a passport.I know it sounds weird to be planning to go, because people die, disappear, they come back in comas, he says, But what to do?Sitting behind her tidy desk at the department of foreign employment, spokeswoman Rama Bhattarai shrugs off the death toll.Im not trying to be insensitive but we have sent millions of workers to more than 100 countries, and so yes, sometimes people will die. They die as foreign employees, they die here when a bus goes off a cliff, she says.Others are more incensedKrishna Dawadee, acting director of Kathmandus one-stop work permit center, waves an arm at the hundreds of young men gathered at the service window seeking final work approvals. Outside the gates, life insurance salesmen grab at the prospective workers arms and sweaters, trying to pull them into their offices to sell policies.These are our youth, draining out from our country, Dawadee says. I am very much worried about these people.Six weeks after Balkisun Mandal Khatwe made the long journey from his village to the employment office, his wife travels back across the country to retrieve his body.His casket arrives on a 7 pm flight. It takes more than three hours to get paperwork sorted out between his barely literate family and the airport bureaucrats who needed a death certificate, identifications, work permits and more.A coffin carrying the body of Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, a migrant labourer who died in his sleep in Qatar, lies outside the Tribhuwan international airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)Finding transport is less complicated: The casket slides easily into a custom-welded coffin rack. The government of Nepal arranged to have 10 trucks equipped after labour exports  and deaths abroad  began to rise.The badly rutted and cracked road from the Kathmandu airport to Belhi village is closed after dark because too many buses have plunged off the narrow, steep, sharp curves. But under starry skies, the truck was waved past checkpoints by the police who spotted the rooftop coffin while warming their hands over small fires. After death, Hindu funerals must take place as soon as possible, hopefully by the next dawn.Saro and her son, just 3 years old, jolt around the backseat for a precarious eight-hour journey. They jounce in their seats as the truck bottoms out in potholes, jerk side to side as it races around corners.When the truck reaches Belhi, hundreds of women in traditional saris, men in their work clothes and children pour into the narrow dirt street, tears streaming down their faces. Everyone pushes and shoves to get close to the coffin. Some stand on rooftops. Others crowd a balcony.Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, and Belhi is one of its poorest places. The Mandals live eight people to a room in one of about 700 mud-and-stick homes set among dry, sparse rice paddies. A shared cellphone is passed from house to house. People are chronically hungry, living on less than $1 a day.The Mandals and their neighbours are marginalised in every way. Ethnically, they are from the untouchable caste, and they speak Maithili -- a language more common in India, just a few miles south.No options leftFamily members wrestle Balkisuns coffin off the truck. Mohammed Tohit, 28, watches from across the street, then looks at his hands, the cloudless sky, a distant mango tree. He wipes a wet cheek.I knew this guy, and the thing is when you see people coming back in a coffin like this, it is hard, he says.He adds quietly: Im leaving for Saudi in 10 days.Tohit is the envy and inspiration of the village. He worked in Malaysia for almost six years sewing clothes for Nike, Lacoste and Columbia Sportswear, saving more than $20,000. That was enough to build a sturdy, cement two-bedroom house with plaster walls and a brick foundation. He bought a piece of farmland and a television set. Theres a cow staked outside his woven fence, among the goats and chickens. His round-cheeked, 6-month-old daughter, Saieha, is shy in the arms of his wife, Jarina Khatun.Mohammed Tohit sits in front of his house holding his passport in Belhi Village, Nepal. (AP photo)I am scared, sure, but I have no way to earn anything here, he says. I have no choice but to leave again.Balkisuns brother Ramasis, 35, went for work to Dubai but returned three months later with a debilitating mental illness. Bidhya Nanda, 25, the youngest, is still in the Gulf, working as a janitor in Saudi Arabia. Another brother, 30-year-old Ramkisun, flew back from Malaysia, where he was working in factories making Sony and Panasonic products, when he learned of Balkisuns death.Their father, Kalaru, hates to see his sons go, but has no option: We are poor and we dont have any way at all to earn money in our village. The news of his sons death came in a morning phone call two weeks earlier.Balkisun was working for Habtoor Leighton Group in Qatar, loading trucks to build new highways. The highway was being built as part of broader infrastructure improvements for the 2022 World Cup, said his supervisor Ganesh Khang Mandal.Dubai-based HLG did not respond to requests for an interview. Australia-based CIMIC, a 45% owner of HLG, said in a statement that it did not want to comment.Saro had chatted with Balkisun through Facebook Messenger just the evening before his death.Although he confided to friends he was having a difficult time with his job, money and housing, he told Saro that everything was going well. He took a selfie in his yellow work hardhat, eyes grinning through protective sunglasses, his face covered in a blue scarf to fend off the harsh climate. He told her about a big festival that day.OK, Ill call you tomorrow morning  the last words her husband said to her.A woman breaks down after seeing the body of her son Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, a migrant worker who died in his sleep in Qatar, at Belhi village in Saptari district, Nepal. (AP photo)This is what happened, according to his supervisor: After work he went to dinner at 7 and bed at 10. In the morning we tried to wake him up but he didnt respond. We took the body to the hospital where they did an autopsy and said it was cardiac arrest.He had been in Qatar less than a month.A similar patternAuthorities in Nepal say their citizens seem to die abroad more frequently than their equally vulnerable Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Indonesian co-workers, but the explanation for the increased mortality has been unclear.Its usually sleeping disease, said Kumud Khanal, vice president of the Nepal association of foreign employment agencies, which represents more than 400 registered agents. We get the report that he was talking with friends in the evening, had dinner and went to bed, and in the morning he was found dead. The deaths are reported as a hypertension problem, he said, like a heart attack or cardiac arrest.But medical experts say there have been waves of deaths before among young, rural southeast Asian men working abroad in physically stressful conditions.Nepali workers stand in queues at the departure gate for migrant workers at Tribhuwan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. About 10% of Nepal's 28 million residents are working abroad. (AP photo)I see some familiar patterns here with Nepalese workers, said Patrick Clarkin at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who has written about the biology and epidemiology of Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome. I suspect that there would be little harm in improving the diets and living conditions of these young men. Something as simple as a multivitamin could go a long way and with little risk.In rural Nepal, people eat rice, lentils and seasonal greens around 10 in the morning, and a second meal of rice and vegetables in the evening. Milk and eggs are almost always available as well.Abroad, Nepali workers also eat twice a day, but the mainstay is whole meal flour flatbread with some pickle or a vegetable, and once a day they have chicken. Some in the Middle East say they drink less water at their desert worksites than they do in mountainous Nepal because, as Hindus, they are not allowed to use Muslim bathrooms and are forced to wait for hours.No one has identified a single cause of SUNDS fatalities  medical journal discussions include genetics, infection and nutritional deficiencies. And in Nepal, the syndrome is not being considered at this point. Instead, Nepali authorities say it could be stress, even homesickness, brought on by physically demanding jobs in extremely hot climates.Utah State University professor Ron Munger studied heart scans of migrant workers in Thailand after hundreds died in their sleep in Singapore, where they had gone for jobs. He said the Nepali deaths sound like exactly the same thing.While the causes of the previous strings of deaths have never been pinpointed, the number of fatalities dropped in each case when workplace safety, housing and diet were improved.A Nepali man , 23, takes a selfie while he waits for his flight to Malaysia, where he will work in a warehouse as a cleaner, at Tribhuwan International airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)It is tragic and terrible, and for me this is personal, said cardiac epidemiology researcher Nirmal Aryal, a Nepali native at University of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand.He recently published a Call for Public Health Action in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health, demanding with colleagues in the United Kingdom and Nepal that universal labour laws be enforced and accurate mortality records kept. He is forming a consortium to investigate migrant deaths across borders. Its first focus, in 2017, will be on workers from Nepal.It is critical we find out what is happening, he said.Last ritesArriving in their village, Saro steps out of the truck, sees the coffin and falls screaming onto the dusty road. Two sisters scoop her up and carry her, howling, into the family home.In Hindu mythology, if you dont see the face of a loved one, you will not believe they have died.

Clerks ignored her, then a date on the death certificate was deemed unacceptable. Eventually, with help, she received $2,777 from the foreign employment promotion board.Saro Kumari Mandal gives her fingerprint to receive compensation from the foreign employment promotion board in Kathmandu, Nepal after her husband died as a migrant worker in Qatar.

The private players have imported more than 1.7 million tonnes of wheat so far and more shipments are expected at zero customs duty.Asked if the government would undertake wheat imports, Paswan said: That situation may not arise as we have adequate stock in the central pool to meet the PDS requirement.As on December 1, state-owned Food Corporation of India had 27.55 million tonnes of foodgrains, of which wheat was 16.4 million tonnes and rice was 11 million tonnes, he said.

The village with a 1,200 population has been declared a 'cashless transactions village' after the district administration opened accounts for all villagers who did not have them, gave them debits cards, set up swipe machines in shops and micro ATMs in ration shops.The village was declared 'cashless' after a formal event in which a local resident Muthaviah along with four others purchased 12 kg rice and other provisions from a ration shop in the village in the presence of irrigation minister and local MLA T Harish Rao on Monday.Village sarpanch Kumbala Yella Reddy said all residents of the village contributed in making in a 'cashless village'.Interestingly, Ibrahimpur village has a distinction of having 100 per cent water harvesting facilities and toilets in every house.It also planted a staggering two lakh saplings during the Haritha Haram programme. The village was adopted by Harish Rao.Ibrahimpur will get a Rs 10 lakh incentive in the form of development fund from the Constituency Development Fund given that the irrigation minister had announced incentives to first, second and third villages that go cashless. The second and third villages will receive incentives Rs 5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh respectively.It may be recalled that the state government resolved to make entire Siddipet assembly constituency cashless by opening bank accounts, providing debit cards and swipe machines to people and establishments apart from installing micro ATMs at some locations such as gram panchayat offices and ration shops. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had fixed December-end as the deadline to achieve this goal. The district administration had been conducting orientation programmes to various groups of people along with making other necessary arrangements.Leading cancer specialist Dr Raghuram, MLA Babu Mohan and MLC Pathuri Sudhakar Reddy were present at the declaration programme."

In the backdrop of the severe financial crisis plaguing the nation, the state is planning to make its villages cashless.The Modi government which is pushing for a cashless economy to make demonetization a success, has been drawing parliamentarians and banks to focus on villages with the help of panchayats.""Whether its buying a Re 1 candy from a confectionery or rice from a fair price shop, villagers may have to compulsorily use debit or credit cards,"" said Udupi-Chikkamagalur MP Shobha Karandlaje, who has adopted Udupi district.Plans of making all 158 panchayats in Udupi district cashless have already been chalked out and the process will start soon. ""We have zeroed in on five villages in Byndoor taluk on an experimental basis. Based on the response, the initiative will be extended to all villages,"" she addedBanks will train villagers and panchyat officials to use credit/debit cards and mobile wallets over the next three months. Vijaya Bank has already adopted eight villages in Mandya and four in Ramanagara to digitize all financial activities.To begin with, banks will install Point of Sale (PoS) machines at Digital Seva Kendras in all village gram panchayats for smooth and cashless transactions. They will also train villagers in Aadhaar-enabled payment systems (AEPS), Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and USSD-based mobile banking (on basic mobile phones).This apart, banks will also set up ATM kiosks and high-speed Wi-Fi facilities. While account holders will be provided debit cards and Rupay cards, vendors and merchants (even petty shopowners and pavement vendors) will be given swipe machines. ""We are confident of making about 100 villages in Karnataka cashless in three months under the first phase. All villages will make the switch by 2019,"" said an official from the rural development and panchayat raj department.The lack of awareness about e-banking and mobile banking is proving to be a major hurdle, particularly in remote villages. ""We initially wanted the villages to go cashless within a month but it looks like the process will take time as many people aren't familiar with the internet and some even don't possess basic cellphone. So we have extended the deadline till March 31,"" Karandlaje said.She said all government-related transactions, including payment of tax, water and power bills would will be accepted only through cards after March 31 at panchayat offices. She said the process of providing swipe machines to all shopkeepers, petrol pump and gas agencies will also be taken up by banks.Banks lead initiativeVijaya Bank made Chandagalu the first cashless village in Mandya district in April this year. Halladi village in Kundapur taluk, which has 321 families, will soon be declared the first digital village in Udupi district. While Syndicate Bank has taken the initiative in Udupi, Vijaya Bank has been spearheading it in Mandya and Ramanagara."

A resident of Electric Veng area here lodged an FIR on April 21 alleging around eight gun-toting soldiers waylaid his car on the southern outskirts of the capital last December and decamped with 52 gold bars worth Rs 14.5 crore which he smuggled from the Mizoram-Myanmar border.The complainant claimed he did not file the FIR earlier as the soldiers, belonging to Assam Rifles, threatened him of dire consequences if he approached the police.In the investigation, the eight Assam Rifles personnel reportedly told the interrogators that the dacoity was committed on the orders of the then battalion commandant and they submitted the gold bars to him at his official residence in Aizawl.At least 14 people, including the officer, an Aizawl-based non-tribal businessman and a former student leader were arrested in this connection along with a Naik Subedar, four Havildars and three jawans of Assam Rifles.The officer denied the charges and said he was at Silchar when the dacoity took place and claimed gun runners smuggling weapons from Myanmar were behind the hiest.The State government subsequently decided to hand over the case from the Special Investigation Team to the CBI though the investigating agency is still to respond.Mistakes in ration cardsThe launching of the National Food Security Scheme was marred by widespread mistakes committed while printing 2.45 lakh ration cards inviting attacks from the Opposition parties. In some cases, date of birth of all the members of a family was shown as January 1, which prompted the State government to reprint the ration cards.Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) outbreak hit the State in the early part of May causing death of almost 4,000 pigs and piglets.Mobs attacked district court buildings and official residents of judges in south Mizorams Lunglei district on September 22 resulting in the Gauhati High Court withdrawing all the judicial officers from Lunglei.The repatriation of Brus lodged in six relief camps in neighbouring Tripura which was scheduled to begin from November 30 could not take off due to a series of problems.Demonetisation saw people in Khawbung area in Champhai district along Myanmar border adopting a novel way to beat the cash scarcity by using paper notes in which the value of what was owed was written.The lottery scam caused quite a furore after the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said that the Mizoram government lost Rs 11,808.77 crore during 2012-13 to 2014-15 fiscal due to non-deposit of Minimum Guaranteed Revenue and Administrative Expenses by four lottery distributors. Following pressure from the people, Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla initiated peace talks with the Manipur-based Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) rebel group. - PTI"

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows. Some buy a couple of acres just outside the city and head there on weekends. An easy, and popular compromise: rooftop and terrace gardening. A tomatos tastier when you grow it on your own.Mesmerised by pancakes: Food videos became big this year, as they got slicker than ever before. Faintly hypnotic and surprisingly relaxing, they easily sliced across geographical and age barriers. Everyone was watching them, though hardly anyone was actually trying the recipes in real life. Among the most popular videos this year were mozzarella stick onion rings, ice cream churro bowls and pizza puff pastry twists, which got a mind-boggling 159,908,933 views.Single origin everything: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla Local artisan produce got better than ever this year, thanks to determined entrepreneurs and an audience that was willing to not just pay for quality, but also educate themselves.Try The Indian Beans Monkey Bitten Coffee, cultivated in the forests of Andhra Pradeshs Araku Valley. Or Blue Tokais roastery, where they simultaneously grind beans, make cappuccinos and hold workshops.Prefer chocolate? Earth Loaf in Mysore, Mason & Co in Auroville and Pascati are creating gourmet, hand-made, organic, locally-sourced, single-origin, bean-to-bar, proudly desi chocolate (phew).Geeking out on coffee: If youre still using capsules, go sit in a corner with your finger on your lips, and think about the impact on the environment. This was the year of responsible handmade coffee. The AeroPress became popular, as did the Moka pot. Need something trendier? Buy and learn how to use the Chemex, vacuum siphon, bee house dripper or filtron cold brewer.A latte a day: Turmeric lattes, coconut lattes, pumpkin lattes... Mornings got a lot more interesting this year. Turmeric lattes, made with almond milk, fresh turmeric and honey, ruled. For the paleo and keto nuts, it was all about bullet-proof coffee made by whipping together coffee, butter and coconut oil. If youre less intense, try a cold brew coffee with coconut, almond or cashew milk.Soup in light bulbs: Unusual platters ruled. We ate cheese on the lid of a wine barrel. Dessert in a flower pot. Breakfast on a spade. Coffee in a waffle cone.We even saw a burger served on a weighing scale!IN: Gin. Also called vodka for grown ups. Watch out for a pink strawberry version as part of 2017s ginnaissanceOUT: Carb-heavy, creamfilled, decadently sweet desserts. Watch a Tasty video instead. Then eat an apple"

Satheesan has demanded the resignation of Minister of Food P. Thilothaman in the wake of the crisis facing the public distribution system.Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Satheesan said ration supplies in Kerala had gone for a toss in the last 48 days. While the State government blamed the Centre for not supplying the States share of rice, the fact was that apart from the ad hoc rice share of two lakh metric tonne, the Centre had given 14.25 lakh metric tonne. However, the State government was not able to ship the rice from the warehouses of the Food Corporation of India to the PDS shops. This was what created the crisis, he said.The State government had announced that it would implement the Food Security Act from November 1, but it was only on November 14 that it asked District Supply Officers to receive rice from the FCI. Labour issues related to loading cropped up exactly two days later. A month later, the government was still unable to resolve the crisis, he maintained.As per the law, 1.54 crore people on the priority list should have got 4 kg of rice and 1 kg of wheat free of cost. Some 1.24 crore people in the APL category would have got 2 kg of rice at the rate of Rs.2 a kg. Each family should get 35 kg of rice per month as per the Anthyodaya and Annayojana schemes. But the share of rice due for November had not been supplied, the MLA said, criticising the Chief Minister for not intervening to improve the situation."

He passed away when Jayalalithaa was hardly 2 years old. Elders of Melukote do not have memories of her as a child.Her mother Vedavalli shifted to Bengaluru with her children (Jayalalithaa and Jayakumar) after Jayaraman died, and Jayalalithaa completed her primary schooling there. She would visit her grandparents in Mysuru.Later, Vedavalli moved to Chennai at the behest of her sister Ambujavalli who worked in films as Vidya. Vedavalli joined the industry with the screen name Sandhya.There are claimants to kinship such as Mr. N.J. Vasudevan, a resident of Srirangarajupura in T. Narsipura taluk who identifies himself as the late Chief Ministers half-brother.He claimed to The Hindu that Jayalalithaas paternal grandfather was Dr. N. Rangachar who was the personal physician to Maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and his son Jayaraman married Vedavalli.Jayalalithaas grandparents had properties in Mysuru  in Lakshmipuram and Saraswathipuram, named Jayamahal and Lalithamahal  from which Jayalalithaas name was derived, according to Vasudevan. He says they have never spoken to each other.Though I saw her in 1983 in a studio in Madras, I was not able to talk to her. I made many attempts soon after she was sworn-in as Chief Minister but was unsuccessful, Vasudevan claimed.Jayalalithaas Mysuru links were severed soon after the family shifted to Bengaluru sometime in the early 1950s. After her entry into the film industry, she did visit the region as scenes of some of her Kannada and Tamil movies were shot at Brindavan Gardens and popular places along the Cauvery river. But she is not known to have visited Melukote, a priest at the Sri Cheluvanarayana Swamy temple said.Aided a schoolResidents of Naguvanahalli of Karnatakas Srirangapatna taluk remember her gesture of performing at a charity fund raiser to help the local school.The performance at University of Mysore on March 19, 1967 raised Rs. 70,000.At Bishop Cotton Girls School in Bengaluru, where Jayalalithaa was a student in the 1950s, classmates remember her as the girl with a sparkle in her eyes.Fatima Jaffer, a teacher at Bishop Cotton who was also Jayalalithaas classmate, was responsible for distributing sweets every year on her birthday until she retired in 2007.Rice for KGF workersJayalalithaas passing left the Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) region, which has a sizeable Tamil population, in gloom.The Assembly constituency at Kolar returned an AIADMK candidate in 1983, 1989 and 1999. When the fortunes of the gold mines in KGF eroded, she stepped in to help.The AIADMK candidate who won from Kolar, M. Bhaktavatsalam recalls that when he met Jayalalithaa and explained the plight of the workers following closure of Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. in 2001, she arranged for distribution of 25 kg rice to all the 3,850 workers.Though it was a one-time assistance, it was testimony to the large-heartedness of the late leader, Mr. Bhaktavatsalam said.Jayalalithaa never visited KGF but was very popular and revered by a large section of people, the former legislator recalls.It was her charisma, adding to that of MGR, that helped the party, Mr. Bhaktavatsalam, who is now in the Janata Dal (Secular) said.In New Delhi, Tamil Nadu Bhawan and Delhi Tamil Sangam had a steady steam of visitors all day paying floral tributes.P. Ramesh, a retired school teacher, said I have come to meet other people from Tamil Nadu who understand what a loss her death is. Delhiites do not seem to understand how big an icon she is.(With R.

58e4a659a3d24b1c91ede4c1,Tel Aviv on tenterhooks,http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/Tel-Aviv-on-tenterhooks/article16955092.ece,2016-12-29,"more-inOn December 23, the United States Ambassador to the UN abstained on UN Security Council resolution 2334, which condemned Israels settlement activity in the occupied territory of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The language is tentative. It does not call the settlements illegal, but only having no legal validity. In the world of international law, the difference might not be significant. Israel pressured Egypt to withdraw the resolution, which it did, and it pressured the U.S. to veto it, which it did not. Malaysia, New Zealand, Venezuela and Senegal sponsored the resolution, which passed with 14 votes in favour and one abstention (the U.S.). Ambassadors around the table hoped that the vote would push towards the two-state solution, the common aspiration of the international community, said Chinese Ambassador Wu Haitao.The resolution and the occupationFive years previously, during the high point of the Arab Spring, the U.S. had vetoed a similar resolution. Then U.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice said that her country rejects in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity. So then why veto the resolution, which the U.S. would abstain on five years later? In 2011, Ms. Rice said that the resolution would not further the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel, the subtext read, would lash out against the Palestinians. This is precisely what the Israelis now promise to do: build more settlements, fully annex the West Bank and East Jerusalem and thereby annul any prospect of a two-state solution.The UN resolution  important as it is in itself  is not what Israel fears. What troubles Tel Aviv are the steps that would come after this resolution, particularly from the International Criminal Court (ICC). In January 2015, the ICCs Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda opened a preliminary investigation into Israels actions during the 2014 bombing of Gaza and into the illegal settlements. Ms. Bensouda has since made it clear that she would not move forward to a full criminal investigation without substantial political clarity from the UN Security Council. Resolution 2334 produces the political will for such a move by the ICC. With Palestine as a recognised state in the UN as of 2012, and as a member of the ICC since 2014, and with this resolution now in force, the ICC could move in the next few months to a rigorous investigation of Israeli criminality. This would threaten the settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but it would also pressure Israeli soldiers to refuse to serve in any future criminal bombardment of Gaza. Whether the Palestinian leadership has the courage to insist on this remains to be seen.In 1967, Israel seized the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  parts of Palestine that had been outside its control. The UN Security Council passed a series of resolutions (242, 252, 298) within the next decade, asking Israel to withdraw from this land and  in resolution 446 (1979)  to desist from building settlements on the occupied territory. The U.S., which had already become the shield for Israel, abstained from the major resolutions.It was on this occupied territory that it was then assumed  against Israeli opinion  that a Palestinian state would be built. The two-state solution, the international consensus for the Israel-Palestine conflict, is premised on Israeli withdrawal from this land occupied in 1967. No wonder that the UN has periodically returned to censure Israel for its ongoing occupation and  in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention  the construction of settlements on occupied land.The first major UN resolution to define the terms of the Israeli occupation was 242, sponsored by the United Kingdom and passed in November 1967 with unanimous approval. There was no abstention and no veto used by the permanent members. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk said at that time that despite the U.S. and Israel being sharply divided on the issue of territory, the U.S. made no commitment to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the 1967 war. Even when the administrations in Washington defended Israels annexationist policies  such as during the term of Ronald Reagan  the U.S. did not veto to defend the settlements.The element of criminalityThe Oslo Accords (1994) put in place the possibility of a Palestinian state, although it did not have an explicit statement to end settlement activity. Israel continues to eat into the potential Palestinian state. Neither does Israel want a two-state solution nor a one-state solution. This negative approach to the peace process means that Israel is committed to a permanent occupation of the Palestinians. It continues to harbour dreams of a Greater Israel (Eretz Israel).Four years after Oslo, the international community passed the Rome Statute for the establishment of the ICC. It was this new development  the ICC  rather than the Oslo Accords that increased the vetoes exercised by the U.S. in the UN Security Council to protect Israel. The Israeli establishment worried that the ICC would legitimately turn its gaze on issues such as population transfer and war crimes. The ICC  under pressure to investigate crimes outside the African continent  could find that Israeli actions provide a legitimate site of inquiry. The vetoes from Washington prevented any legal foundation for ICC action against Israel.Prosecutor Bensoudas investigators visited the West Bank and East Jerusalem in October this year. The ICC said that this was not part of its preliminary investigation, but it is hard to imagine that this is true. The new UN Security Council resolution harkens back to more radical postures from it in 1979 and 1980 as well as to the International Court of Justices 2014 finding that the apartheid wall that entraps the West Bank is illegal. Pressure will mount on her to take her investigation forward.Tel Avivs triumphalismThe tone of Israels rejection came when Ambassador Danny Danon said that Tel Aviv has the right to build homes in the Jewish peoples historic homeland. The settlements, for the Israeli government, are essential for their own project. They see nothing short of  as Ambassador Danon put it  a Jewish State proudly reclaiming the land of our forefathers. Ambassador Danon is fully in agreement with Washingtons incoming Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who believes in a Greater Israel and denies the existence of Palestine. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to undo the resolution and threatened to end U.S. funding to the UN.Antnio Guterres, the UNs new Secretary-General has indicated that he will send a UN Support Mission to push for a two-state solution. Mr. Guterres and Ms. Bensouda will have to thread the needle between the consensus of the international community (a two-state solution) and Israels own illegal territorial ambitions. Optimism for progress would be unwarranted.Vijay Prashads most recent book is The Death of the Nation and the Future of the Arab Revolution."

The Tamils of Vathuruthy, known as mini Tamil Nadu on the outskirts of the city, on Tuesday went into mourning, a day after the devastating news of their Chief Ministers demise.Amma gave us everything. She was like God to us and will remain like that forever, said Kaliyamma sitting amidst a group of disconsolate, chest-beating women. Fluttering in the gloomy atmosphere was a flag of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), albeit at half mast in reverence to the tallest leader of the party after M.G. Ramachandran (MGR).And playing in the backdrop over a loudspeaker was the hit song Adho Andha Paravai Pola, pairing MGR and Jayalalithaa, from the movie Aayirathil Oruvan though the fast-paced number wasnt exactly in tune with the sober mood.Markendayan, a labourer and a native of Madurai, said Amma always stood for the poor. She gave us goats and cows to make a living, 35 kg of rice free a month, helped in the marriages of our daughters and the education of our children, he said.Azhakeshan and Thavumani, who settled down in Vathuruthy years ago, and 75 others are going to shave their heads to show their respect to Amma. We are like her sons and its our duty to pay our homage to Amma, said Nagarajan, a labourer.A wailing Sarasu, who was hoping that her Amma would come back to life, was heartbroken. For women like us, she was a saviour. Amma gave us gold for our thali (mangalsutra), free cycles to our children. We are now like orphans who have lost their mother, she said.The likes of Shankar, a migrant worker with a political bent of mind, were sceptical about future prospects of the AIADMK without the unmatched leadership skills of the Thalaivi. I will continue to support new Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and the party. However, we have doubts about how things may shape up in the coming days in Tamil Nadu, he said."

The chip contains a unique identification number that is registered by an electronic reader. Based on the response from dog breeders the project would be expanded to other municipalities in the Union Territory, said K. Coumarane, Veterinary Medical Officer of the Puducherry Municipality.The abandoning of dogs by owners is the most cited reason by the municipal authorities for the spurt in the number of stray dogs.The alpha numerical microchips will help the authorities to maintain complete information about the dog, including its age, details of anti-rabies vaccination, owners name, address and telephone number.The microchips will help the authorities maintain complete information aboutthe dog"

From loading containers to one vessel in January this year, the facility is now stacking the loads to three ships a month.A joint venture of the Kakinada Seaports Limited (KSPL) and the Bothra Shipping Services Private Limited, the company waited for a couple of months to commence the operations after its formal launch. Since then, the exports graph has been surging with more and more small-time rice exporters from the region booking the containers.We accept a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes, as the average capacity of container is 26 tonnes. Since there has been a steady increase in the frequency of vessels, there is not much delay in the loading, says M. Subramanian, terminal manager of the KCTPL.In the last 11 months, containers have been loaded to 26 ships, including the coastal (domestic) and international ones. The Food Corporation of India formed part of the initial clientle, as it sent rice to Kochi from the terminal located in the KSPL.Marine productsDenmark-based Maersk Line, Singapore-based BLPL and the Mumbai-based SRS are the three carriers that handle containers from here every month.The KCTPL is eyeing marine products being exported through Visakhapatnam port from Bhimavaram region in West Godavari district. Over 1.2 lakh tonnes of prawns are being sent from the region, in addition to other marine produce. Our terminal is closer than the one in Visakhapatnam for the marine exporters from West Godavari district. We have made consultations with them and most of them got convinced with our container plans, Mr. Subramanian says.In the absence of imports, the company is forced to call empty containers from different destinations, which, in turn, has been escalating the export tariffs to some extent. Imports, however, are expected to begin in a couple of months as the ground work has already been completed. The container service is for sure a boon to the small exporters. However, the traders are expecting the tariff to go down and the frequency of loading to be increased. Going by the market potential, it wont take much time for the terminal to reach out to these expectations, says A.V. Ranga Rao, proprietor of Ganesh Traders and director of the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce."

They were all looking at the possibility of getting the outstanding payment for the work they did under MGNREGS months ago.A month ago, the outstanding was about Rs.120 crore, as per official sources. However, due to the concerted efforts taken by District Collector Prashant M. Wadnere and DRDA Project Director G.Loganayagi the major part of the outstanding was disbursed before Deepavali. Now, the wage outstanding stands at Rs.30 crore, sources said.Speaking to The Hindu on the state of agricultural labourers whose MGNREGS wages are pending, M. Prakalanathan, District Secretary, All India Agricultural Labours Association, said since neither agricultural work nor MGNREGS jobs are easily available these days the agricultural workers are looking for the whatever little amount they would be getting from the government towards their pending wages.In addition, the demonetisation situation had caused them anxiety, he said. They feared that it might take longer time before they could get their money.Government should take into account their condition and give priority in disbursing money for the MGNREGS workers. It should also give them some job regularly in order to help them manage at this time, he added.Agricultural labourers of Kiliyapattu village near here said demonetisation had nothing to do with them, as they had no notes of higher denomination. Gopal (65), a landless agricultural labourer, said he could not get work as there was no water in wells.He had no currency in higher denomination, but was worried about the development because it might further delay disbursement of their wages under MGNREGS.When asked how they managed their lives without work, Thayamma, another landless worker showed bag of rice she bought from Public Distribution System shop, under free rice scheme. This only saves us, she said."

The confusion and uncertainty over the implementation of the new ration scheme, scheduled to have been rolled out on November 1, coupled with ration retailers agitation over remunerations, caused the deadlock.The government had promised to get the November quota soon, Kadmpuzha Moosa, chairman of the ration retailers associations, told The Hindu. But, this has not happened yet. He said the Food Corporation of India was refusing to deliver the November quota to the wholesale dealers. The FCI insists that there is no provision in the Food Security Act-driven new ration scheme for middlemen; the stocks should be door-delivered to the retailers. Earlier, the FCI supplied the foodgrains to 330 wholesale dealers and 11 Civil Supplies depots who passed on the stocks to the retailers.Hasty announcementThe government had hastily announced the roll-out, without necessary preparations to handle such a huge restructuring in ration supply while implementing the Food Security Act. The card-holders were divided into priority and non-priority. Only 1.53 crore people got included in the priority group, triggering peoples protests as well as huge rush at government offices to get the extensive errors on the list rectified. Adding to the governments trouble, the retailers launched a non-cooperation drive, demanding a revised remuneration package and insisting that the government door-deliver the stocks to them.PostponedThe government has now postponed the roll-out of the new ration scheme to April 1. It has also set up a committee consisting of retailers leaders and government officials, to find a method to compensate the retailers. T. Mohammedali, convener of the coordination committee, said the committee would devise a formula to pay the retailers for five monthsfrom November 14 to April 1, when the new scheme would be launched.No rice in outletsHowever, while the retailers concerns have been addressed and they are now cooperating with the government, the card-holders are deeply concerned that there is no rice available in the ration shops. The demonetisation came as bolt from the blue for the below poverty line people as they are unable to purchase rice from open market because of cash shortage. For workers, on the one hand there is no work and income because of the demonetisation; and on the other, no rations."

Thilothaman said on Thursday that the government will set up rice sales counters soon at the ongoing Christmas fairs in a bid to bring down the rising prices.The government has set apart Rs.1,171 crore for rice distribution, he said while inaugurating the district-level Supplyco Christmas fair here.Steps were being taken to sell rice, available from the Centre, at a price lesser than the market rates in various districts. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) would provide rice, with Central support price, at Rs.21.50 a kg. The State would incur additional expenses and could sell it at Rs.23 a kg. The government was trying to procure the locally milled Kuttanad rice from the Oil Palm Indias rice mill for distribution at affordable rates.The Minister expressed the view that the Andhra Pradesh-based rice mill lobby was trying to create artificial scarcity of rice to increase the price. Certain merchants in Kerala were colluding with the lobby.Supplyco was providing 13 commodities, including rice, at 21 to 68 per cent subsidy. Once the rice distribution system got regularised at the public distribution system, the prices would come down. The Centres cut in rice allocation had put the supply at public distribution system outlets in disarray. The States request to restore the quota was not considered favourably by the Centre.The Minister said the rice provided by the Centre was being collected from the FCI. It was the duty of the FCI to hand over the commodity. Th Loading and unloading workers were demanding Rs.1,500 to Rs.2,000 for stacking each load, which was unjustifiable."

Local traders have scaled down their business operations and will swap merchandise for small currencies while the new Rs. 2,000 currency  already in the market  is not being accepted. However, the disruption is perceived by the public to be temporary.With the Union government demonetising the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency , small-time traders in the villagers are at their wits end. People are hoarding the small denomination notes to meet any exigencies as change is in short supply. A few road side eateries on the outskirts of Mysuru on Bogadi Road tend to serve only if one produces small denominations. A few grocery merchants too are refusing to trade on production of the new Rs. 2,000 currency.Most people are hesitant to use up the small change at their disposal unless it is absolutely essential and hence business turnover has been affected, said Rajashekar, a shopkeeper at Beerihundi Circle.Earlier my daily turnover was around Rs. 4,000 ... it has now declined to Rs. 500 to Rs. 800 per day. Problem is small denomination. Customers come with Rs. 2,000 notes. But I do not have change and hence turn them away ... business has been hit since Wednesday, he added. Daily transaction in small villages hinges on small denomination notes and traders like Mr. Rajashekar, who purchase commodities from Mysuru which is about 14 km from Beerihundi, have stopped doing so. Sales have come down so there is no reason to make fresh purchases, Mr. Rajashekar said.Even the daily limit of Rs. 4,500 set by the banks has affected the business community who say nothing can be purchased for that amount by small-time traders who do not have credit facilities from wholesale dealers.Earlier, getting change for Rs. 500 used to be a struggle ... so imagine how much more difficulties one will have to endure to get change for Rs. 2,000. Till last week, we could go to the society (local lingo for PDS centres disbursing ration) to fetch rice and other foodgrains for Rs .500. But with Rs. 2,000 entering the market, shopkeepers ask us to get change and refuse to sell, said Shivanna, a resident.The local community feels instead of disbursing Rs. 2,000 notes, the banks should have dispensed Rs.100 notes at least in rural areas.Meanwhile, contractors have put work on hold citing liquidity crunch and this has affected the daily wagers."

The country started growing mushrooms in 1952. A national mushroom industry interface was made possible by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Bengaluru, in association with the Karnataka Department of Horticulture.The meet brought together researchers, banking officials and nearly 300 farmers from across the country involved in the trade. The occasion also saw the launch of the IMGA website and newsletter. Food experts at the meet felt that the National Horticulture Mission, the Karnataka Council for Technological Upgradation, NABARD, and researchers should undertake the mission to bring about awareness on easy procedures in mushroom production.Indian farmers are so uninformed that most State governments and policymakers are yet to include mushroom as a crop in their food mission, said Meera Pandey, principal scientist, Mushroom Research Laboratory, IIHR.She told The Hindu , Mushrooms are packed with vitamins and minerals. They are purifiers with qualities to absorb heavy metals and are anti-cancerous. But we have not undertaken an awareness drive among people and cultivators.Making mushroom available at every home, strategies to make the wholesome crop part of the daily diet, value addition needed for a longer shelf life, and increasing its usage were some of the factors discussed.It is our duty to discuss how the nutritious crop can also be part of the mid-day meal schemes in most schools of the country. If protein-coated rice is being considered for inclusion, mushroom is also a good candidate, said Ms. Pandey.India with enough manpower, raw material, agricultural space, and 10 months of suitable climate but is still reluctant to grow mushroom on a large scale. India has 98 tonnes of agriculture waste being burnt. Even if 10 per cent of this waste is utilised for mushroom cultivation, 5 million tonnes of mushroom can be procured in a year, which would employ 2 million people, said Ms. Pandey.Even China grows 7 million tonnes of mushroom  of 65 varieties  every year, while Indias output is woefully low at 40,000 tonnes, according to the Food and Agriculture Organizations study in 2013. Although mushroom cultivation started in 1952, it has never been a streamlined regular industry because of farmers poor awareness about growing techniques, and peoples mistaken belief that it is non-vegetarian, rued Ms. Pandey."

But, as they waited outside for the third consecutive day on Saturday, they were grimly aware of the three days of wages lost.

Between October 25 and November 6, 2016, crop fires had gone from 4,480 (in 2015) to 7,864, according to the research report, exclusively shared with The Hindu , by Dr. Hiren Jethva, Research Scientist at USRA. Smoke plume originated in Pakistan from fires there and eventually merged with plume produced by Punjab fires before it mobilised over New Delhi and eastern parts of Indo-Gangetic Plain, Dr. Jethva told The Hindu in an email.Government agricultural experts in Punjab said there was a shift in the sowing pattern in the State from last year. Rise in area under the non-basmati varieties of rice has increased this year and its one of the reasons that the number of crop fires has increased, Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser P.S. Rangi said.Sowing patternFarmers tend to harvest non-basmati varieties of paddy with machines, resulting in more paddy stubble because combine harvesters dont cut the crop close enough to the ground, leaving behind stems standing in the field up to one feet The area under non-basmati rice this year has touched 26 lakh hectares, which in 2015-16 was 23.5 lakh hectares.Basmati varieties are harvested manually by farmers, who cut the crop close to the ground, which makes it easy for them plough the residue into the soil through harrows. There is less paddy stubble and chances of stubble burning goes down.Weather conditionsWeather experts said that a weather condition, called an anti-cyclone, was particularly strong this year and that aided to the pollution spike. Anti-cyclones, where wind is virtually absent and no circulation happens, are common after monsoon, said D.S. Pai, Chief Meteorologist, India Meteorological Department. But this time it was spread over a large area and prevented pollutants from being flushed out.Dr. Jethva, however, clarified that his analysis of the smoke plumes from Pakistan was largely based on a visual inspection of images.The air over Delhi has started clearing up substantially with several agencies predicting that there would be an improvement in air quality in the next two days. The Delhi government announced a slew of measures, from shutting down the Badarpur coal plant, to depress pollution levels.Smoke plume originated in Pakistan from fires there and eventually merged with theplumes produced by Punjab fires beforeit mobilised over New Delhi and eastern parts ofIndo-Gangetic Plain"

As part of the move new ration cards with Telangana logo would be released shortly. The officials feel that this would be instrumental in weeding out ineligible.Similarly, biometric system would be established at ration shops and those benefiting from the ration cards should give their finger prints/ Iris which would be linked with Aadhaar cards. If a family is having six members all members have to give their finger prints on biometric system to ensure that there is no duplicity. In addition, CC cameras will be installed at multi-level stocking (MLS) point so that every movement is recorded and checked if necessary. The presently existing system of GPS at MLS points would be extended between procurement centre and rice mills. Tabs were already supplied to the procurement centres so that they can upload the quantity of procurement and name of farmer can be uploaded immediately. Disclosing these details here on Saturday, Peddi Sudarshan, Chairman, Civil Supplies Corporation, told The Hindu that the reforms would be in place in the next six months and the government is expecting huge savings in terms of wastage of rice being supplied through public distribution system (PDS). Literally speaking, ration cards are eating rice. The number of ration cards in Telangana is eight per cent more than the number of families in the State and how it will be possible. We are able to save about 22 percent of wastage of rice in an experiment conducted in city, said Mr. Sudharshan adding that while government is bearing a subsidy of Rs. 28 per kg on rice, it is being sold at Rs. 7 by ration card holders who were not consuming them followed by for Rs. 14 by middlemen when sending it outside the State."

Chidambaresh, president of the Chennai Civil Engineers Association.Wages for construction workers from Tamil Nadu vary between Rs. 500 per day for a helper and Rs. 700 for a mason, while it is between Rs. 400 and Rs. 650 for workers from other States. We are unable to pay the full wages, but we have assured them that they will be taken care of until the situation stabilises, he adds.Builders of bigger projects  special buildings (apartments less than four floors) and multi-storey buildings (over four floors)  say that supervisors are having a tough time distributing wages to the workers. The companies claim they do not have sufficient cash to disburse the entire weeks wages to all of them. Many workers who have managed to save cash have taken a holiday to go to their native villages, but this has not resulted in mass absenteeism and hence construction work has not been affected. The workers would come back the moment the situation eases, they say."

Ramadoss.: The Tamil Nadu government should take efforts to revive the automobile industry in the State, as many automobile companies are now moving to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh or States like Gujarat, PMK founder S. Ramadoss has said.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Ramadoss said though Tamil Nadu was known as the Detroit of India, it was fast losing the tag due to inefficient administration, corruption, lack of long-term vision and doling out of freebies.According to him, land availability, labour, infrastructure and government support were the key reasons that the automobile industry flourished in the State. These four indicators are no longer favourable to us. There is absolutely no support from the State government for any new schemes, he alleged.While other States were giving approvals for new projects in an expeditious manner, in Tamil Nadu, no decision could be taken without Chief Minister Jayalalithaas nod. Experts had also highlighted non-availability of land and lack of infrastructure to set up industries on the outskirts of Chennai..Pointing out that Ford had given up its plans to set up a Rs. 4,000 crore car production facility in Chennai and had gone to Gujarat, he added that companies like Isuzu had gone to Sri City. Hero Motorcorp, which had planned to manufacture 18 lakh two-wheelers annually at an investment of Rs. 2,400 crore in Chennai, too dropped its plans and went to Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, he said.In the last few years alone, nearly Rs. 60,000 crore worth of investments that were supposed to come to Chennai had gone to Sri City, the PMK leader claimed.When the new industrial policy was announced in 2014, the State government had set a target of increasing vehicle manufacturing in Tamil Nadu to 50 lakh vehicles by 2020. But no action has been taken so far, he alleged.Tamil Nadu, which was known for skilled labour force, now had a large number of unemployable engineering graduates. Mr. Ramadoss also alleged that many workers had become lazy due to the availability of free rice and easy access to liquor across the State. As a result, a sizeable proportion of workers working in automobile factories in the State are from other places, the PMK founder added. He urged the government to be proactive so that the State could once again become an auto hub."

Fisheries registered a growth rate of 30 per cent.He said that animal husbandry and livestock had tremendous potential for poverty alleviation. Even those without land could generate a monthly income of Rs.10,000 and surmount even drought if they had livestock.The Andhra Pradesh Government would plan to provide fodder security to livestock . He said plans were being made to provide fodder to sheep and goats at 50 per cent subsidy.The income from livestock in the State was more than that from agriculture and horticulture put together. Though horticulture was being done only in 30 per cent of the land, income from it was more than in agriculture, the Chief Minister pointed out.Food habits changingThe Chief Minister said food habits of the people were changing. Many were changing from rice to millets and the demand for milk, meat and eggs was growing.Lauding the JK Trust, a non-profit organisation for providing technology, know-how and infrastructure, Mr. Naidu said that the facility should be used to promote and protect indigenous breeds like Ongole and Pungunur cattle. He said the population of Pungunur breed had dropped drastically to 700. IVF and OPU would used to protect and promote it. Using IVF and OPU these vanishing breeds would be multiplied by 20 times, he said.Special Chief Secretary Manmohan Singh, Animal Husbandry Director G. Somashekaram and Krishna Joint Director T.

Pinnayi, who had previously served as a ward member of Paapapatti panchayat, said that some of the women in her village, out of panic, took photocopies of the Rs. 500 notes they had as a precautionary measure.There was fear that once they deposited the cash at the bank or post office for exchange, they will not be given new currencies immediately. So, they assumed that the photocopies will serve as a proof, if the situation demanded, that they actually possessed these currencies, she said. Ms. Pinnayi added she was also worried about her sons wedding slated on November 20. I have borrowed from moneylenders to redeem gold jewellery pawned in a co-operative bank.However, officials there say they were yet to receive instruction on whether they can accept the cash, she said.V.R. Muthu Peyandi, a farmer who also runs a small grocery shop in Pullaneri, said that many people in the village approached him seeking help to deposit their cash in his bank account and return in new currencies.Though many have bank accounts, banks, like government offices, frighten them. They mostly rely on Banking Correspondents in the village to get their MGNREGA scheme wages and rarely go to banks. Moreover, when many elderly people still use thumb impressions, the banks are giving the withdrawal slips in English, he pointed out.With the present limits on amount that can be withdrawn, I am not able to help many, he said, adding that for the past two days, people had been buying vegetable and rice from his shop on the promise that they will pay later.Trouble for elderly peopleT. Socrates, a 55-year-old farmer from Paapapatti, said that his elderly mother, who had Rs. 10,000 she has saved in her old trunk suitcase, gave it to him to exchange in a bank. I will return the money to my mother. But I know many families where such savings of the elderly could get appropriated by the family members now, he said. N. Mahalakshmi from Karuppayurani, who works as a maid in a few households in Madurai city, said that she had to plead with three of her employees to get Rs. 100 from each of them to take her son, who had fever, to the hospital on Friday. I had two Rs. 500 notes. However, the local clinic and pharmacy did not accept it., she said.R. Siva, a small landholding farmer from Nattamangalam, said he had trouble issuing wages to those working in his land. For instance, the wage for a person weeding one acre of land is Rs. 500. But the workers, predominantly middle-aged and elderly women who depend on their daily wages, hesitate to accept Rs. 500 notes (which has ceased to be legal tender), he said.Many have accounts.

Between October 25 and November 6, 2016, crop fires had gone from 4,480 (in 2015) to 7,864, according to the research report, exclusively shared with The Hindu , by Dr. Hiren Jethva, Research Scientist at USRA. Smoke plume originated in Pakistan from fires there and eventually merged with plume produced by Punjab fires before it mobilised over New Delhi and eastern parts of Indo-Gangetic Plain, Dr. Jethva told The Hindu in an email.Government agricultural experts in Punjab said there was a shift in the sowing pattern in the State from last year. Rise in area under the non-basmati varieties of rice has increased this year and its one of the reasons that the number of crop fires has increased, Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser P.S. Rangi said.Sowing patternFarmers tend to harvest non-basmati varieties of paddy with machines, resulting in more paddy stubble because combine harvesters dont cut the crop close enough to the ground, leaving behind stems standing in the field up to one feet The area under non-basmati rice this year has touched 26 lakh hectares, which in 2015-16 was 23.5 lakh hectares.Basmati varieties are harvested manually by farmers, who cut the crop close to the ground, which makes it easy for them plough the residue into the soil through harrows. There is less paddy stubble and chances of stubble burning goes down.Weather conditionsWeather experts said that a weather condition, called an anti-cyclone, was particularly strong this year and that aided to the pollution spike. Anti-cyclones, where wind is virtually absent and no circulation happens, are common after monsoon, said D.S. Pai, Chief Meteorologist, India Meteorological Department. But this time it was spread over a large area and prevented pollutants from being flushed out.Dr. Jethva, however, clarified that his analysis of the smoke plumes from Pakistan was largely based on a visual inspection of images.The air over Delhi has started clearing up substantially with several agencies predicting that there would be an improvement in air quality in the next two days. The Delhi government announced a slew of measures, from shutting down the Badarpur coal plant, to depress pollution levels.Smoke plume originated in Pakistan from fires there and eventually merged with theplumes produced by Punjab fires beforeit mobilised over New Delhi and eastern parts ofIndo-Gangetic Plain"

We will bear it as the nation will be benefited in the long run as a result of weeding out of black money and counterfeit notes, says a farmer leader, Jagarlamudi Anil Babu, from the rice-rich Karamchedu village. With only Rs. 2,000 notes made available in banks, there is a huge shortage of notes in Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denomination needed to make payments to farm workers and purchase of farm inputs. We have found a solution to the persistent problem by deferring payments to farm workers and paying partly in the form of rice, he says.We have started paying the workers partly in the form of rice and stand guarantee to small loans extended to them by the local grocery shops to buy other essential commodities, says Palaparthi Srinivasa Rao, a farmer from Nagulapupadu. The trust they enjoy with suppliers of farm inputs have ensured uninterrupted supply of pesticides to their farms on credit. The fertiliser dealers also oblige us by accepting scrapped Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes, says another farmer, G.Veeraragavalu from Chadalavada. With no access to institutional credit, tenant farmers, who are mainly depend upon private money lenders, faced difficulty in raising capital for the rabi crop, says Kuvulu Rythu Sangam State secretary N. Ranga Rao.The farmers needed about Rs. 3,200 crore in cash, particularly lower denomination of Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 notes to pay farm workers and complete the harvest of khariff crop in about 40 lakh hectares in the State without any hassles, according to YSRC farmers wing State president N.V.S. Nagi Reddy."

They feared that it might take longer time before they could get their money.Government should take into account their condition and give priority in disbursing money for the MGNREGS workers. It should also give them some job regularly in order to help them manage at this time, he added.Agricultural labourers of Kiliyapattu village near here said demonetisation had nothing to do with them, as they had no notes of higher denomination. Gopal (65), a landless agricultural labourer, said he could not get work as there was no water in wells.He had no currency in higher denomination, but was worried about the development because it might further delay disbursement of their wages under MGNREGS.When asked how they managed their lives without work, Thayamma, another landless worker showed bag of rice she bought from Public Distribution System shop, under free rice scheme. This only saves us, she said."

He said the Food Corporation of India was refusing to deliver the November quota to the wholesale dealers. The FCI insists that there is no provision in the Food Security Act-driven new ration scheme for middlemen; the stocks should be door-delivered to the retailers. Earlier, the FCI supplied the foodgrains to 330 wholesale dealers and 11 Civil Supplies depots who passed on the stocks to the retailers.Hasty announcementThe government had hastily announced the roll-out, without necessary preparations to handle such a huge restructuring in ration supply while implementing the Food Security Act. The card-holders were divided into priority and non-priority. Only 1.53 crore people got included in the priority group, triggering peoples protests as well as huge rush at government offices to get the extensive errors on the list rectified.Adding to the governments trouble, the retailers launched a non-cooperation drive, demanding a revised remuneration package and insisting that the government door-deliver the stocks to them.PostponedThe government has now postponed the roll-out of the new ration scheme to April 1. It has also set up a committee consisting of retailers leaders and government officials, to find a method to compensate the retailers. T. Mohammedali, convener of the coordination committee, said the committee would devise a formula to pay the retailers for five monthsfrom November 14 to April 1, when the new scheme would be launched.No rice in outletsHowever, while the retailers concerns have been addressed and they are now cooperating with the government, the card-holders are deeply concerned that there is no rice available in the ration shops. The demonetisation came as bolt from the blue for the below poverty line people as they are unable to purchase rice from open market because of cash shortage.For workers, on the one hand there is no work and income because of the demonetisation; and on the other, no rations."

Amma Canteens near Central Railway Station and Egmore Railway Station have started recording more footfalls, officials said. However, the average increase in the number of visitors across the city is only around one per cent after the decision on demonetisation was announced. The Chennai Corporation has sold 39.88 lakh idlis in the first week of November. After announcement of demonetisation, the number of idlis sold has increased to 40.33 lakh. The sale of curd rice and sambar rice has increased from 7.42 lakh to 7.46 lakh in the same period. Chapatti sale has also increased from 10.04 lakh to 10.14 lakh. The rise in sale has been due to an increase in number of visitors to Amma Canteens near major public transit hubs of the city, said an official.Even as officials reported only a marginal rise in the number of visitors to Amma Canteens post demonetisation, a number of visitors to Amma Canteens were not allowed to have food owing to their inability to pay money. Persons who were unable to get food in private hotels rushed to Amma Canteens. Many such persons had Rs.2,000 currency notes. Customers of many private hotels are given change for Rs.2,000 currency note only if they have food at the hotel for at least Rs.1,500 at any point of time."

Indias goods trade deficit with China has ballooned from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16.Beetle fearChina is the worlds largest rice importer. However, Beijing had so far not granted market access to Indias non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its apprehensions included the possibility of the Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) pest getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.Official sources said after numerous requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials visited India in September to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. To export to nations including China, it is mandatory that Indian rice exporters are registered with NPPO, the Indian government agency for inspecting the mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO assisted its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection for pest-risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian Commerce Ministry was also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.They said the Indian embassy in Beijing informed the Commerce Ministry that Chinese authorities, last week, cleared 17 of these 19 mills for rice exports to China. The Commerce Ministry has forwarded the list to APEDA and asked it to inform rice exporters to soon find customers in China."

Lakshminarasimhan Iyer, a Carnatic musican, was forced to leave Keevalur (a corruption of Keezhvelur) near Nagapattinam, for Palani. His crime was that he learnt nagaswaram and started performing at concerts.How can a Brahmin play an instrument with its reed tipped in human saliva, was the contention of the local Brahmins. His teacher and noted nagaswaram player Keevalur Ganesan came under fire from his own community  the Isai Vellalars  for teaching a Brahmin to play the nagaswaram.As we were left with little option, my guru (Ganesan) suggested that I should go to Palani, where he had a friend and nagaswaram player Muniyandi Mudaliar, who would make arrangements for my stay. That is how Palani became a part of my name, said 82-year-old Lakshminarasimhan, who is now living in Gobichettipalayam with his daughter, and still teaches music.Born into a family of musicians in Melattur, known for Bhagvathamela festival, Mr. Lakshminarasimhan learnt flute from his uncle Needamangalam Krishmamurthy Bhagavathar. But his family lived in Keevalur, and originally, Mr. Ganesan, the nagaswaram player, used to learn keerthanas from him.One day, he gave me money as guru dakshina . He was three years junior to me. I refused to accept the money and instead requested him to teach me the nagaswaram as guru dakshina . He hesitated and the local thavil player Govindarajan teased me saying that those who eat raw rice and lentils could not learn the instrument. But his comment made me determined to learn to play the nagaswaram, recalled Mr. Lakshminarasimhan.He succeeded in persuading Mr. Ganesan to teach him the instrument and he learnt from him for six years between 1954 and 1960. I would get up at four in the morning and practise till seven. Then, I will go to the Akshalaylingaswamy temple and play during pooja times instead of Mr. Ganesan, who was the temple musician, reminisced Mr. Lakshminarasimhan, who has cut a disc of his rendering of Aadikondai (Mayamalavagowla), Kandatantri napai (Devamanohari) and Dhanasree raga tillana. He did another recording in Malayasia.He narrated one incident that led him to learn Muthuswamy Dikshitars Akshayalinga vibho keertana set to Sankarabharanam. The keerthana should be played every day during sayraksha (evening pooja) in the temple. I knew only the first two lines and the temple official made it clear that I would not get my share of puttu and vada if I do not play the full song, laughed Mr. Lakshminarasimhan.He belonged to a period when the nagaswaram world was dominated by Karukurichi Arunachalam, Vedaranayam Vedamurthy, Sheik Chinna Moulana, Namagiripettai Krishnan and many others. Mr. Lakshminarasimhan could secure a place in this pantheon of great musicians by effortlessly playing the instrument."

The country started growing mushrooms in 1952. A national mushroom industry interface was made possible by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Bengaluru, in association with the Karnataka Department of Horticulture.The meet brought together researchers, banking officials and nearly 300 farmers from across the country involved in the trade. The occasion also saw the launch of the IMGA website and newsletter. Food experts at the meet felt that the National Horticulture Mission, the Karnataka Council for Technological Upgradation, NABARD, and researchers should undertake the mission to bring about awareness on easy procedures in mushroom production.Indian farmers are so uninformed that most State governments and policymakers are yet to include mushroom as a crop in their food mission, said Meera Pandey, principal scientist, Mushroom Research Laboratory, IIHR.She told The Hindu , Mushrooms are packed with vitamins and minerals. They are purifiers with qualities to absorb heavy metals and are anti-cancerous. But we have not undertaken an awareness drive among people and cultivators.Making mushroom available at every home, strategies to make the wholesome crop part of the daily diet, value addition needed for a longer shelf life, and increasing its usage were some of the factors discussed.It is our duty to discuss how the nutritious crop can also be part of the mid-day meal schemes in most schools of the country. If protein-coated rice is being considered for inclusion, mushroom is also a good candidate, said Ms. Pandey.India with enough manpower, raw material, agricultural space, and 10 months of suitable climate but is still reluctant to grow mushroom on a large scale. India has 98 tonnes of agriculture waste being burnt. Even if 10 per cent of this waste is utilised for mushroom cultivation, 5 million tonnes of mushroom can be procured in a year, which would employ 2 million people, said Ms. Pandey.Even China grows 7 million tonnes of mushroom  of 65 varieties  every year, while Indias output is woefully low at 40,000 tonnes, according to the Food and Agriculture Organizations study in 2013. Although mushroom cultivation started in 1952, it has never been a streamlined regular industry because of farmers poor awareness about growing techniques, and peoples mistaken belief that it is non-vegetarian, rued Ms. Pandey."

Balaram and others, Food Minister P. Thilothaman said the problems in the PDS in Kerala could be traced to the inaction by the previous UDF government. The Centre had cut the States ad hoc allotment of rice from 16.01 lakh tonnes to 14.25 lakh tonnes after the UDF regime failed to take steps for the implementation of the NFSA, he said.The government, he said, had made arrangements for the distribution of ration rice from November 14.

The challenge before the party was to rally all secular sections and to ensure that the faithful did not get swayed by either of the arguments, he pointed out.More youth, womenMr. Balakrishnan said the party leadership wanted greater number of youth and women to come into its fold. The target is to ensure that by the time the party goes in for the next State conference, at least 30 per cent of the members should be aged below 30 years and that women constitute at least 25 per cent of the members.In Kannur and Kasaragod, the target would be to have 30 per cent women membership. Simultaneously, efforts would also be made to strengthen the class and mass organisations associated with the party.All party district committees would meet for two days in January to work out the details of the proposal, the CPI(M) State secretary said.Mr. Balakrishnan said the CPI(M) and LDF would be ready to join hands with anyone in the fight to save the cooperative sector, which had landed in a crisis following demonetisation. This stand of the CPI(M) would be communicated to the all-party meeting being convened by the government and, in case, there was objection to the proposal, the party and LDF would go it alone with their fight.The party State committee, he said, had also resolved to ask the government to approach the Centre to get sufficient rice to be distributed to non-priority category cardholders at least at Rs.8 a kg.State unit plans an exercise to weed out persons who are not sufficiently active in party work."

It can be applied to multiple crops.Using sensors, the solar-powered device collects real-time data on the maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, precipitation, soil moisture content, wind velocity, and wind direction.The data are sent to a central server through a modem and run through a simulator to generate the advisory.According to V.S. Santhosh Mithra, Principal Scientist (Computer Applications), CTCRI, the system is expected to assist policy-makers and planners in tackling market risks emanating from unexpected production and fall in price. If the production can be estimated in advance, precautions can be taken to avoid such risks, he explains.By pooling the data from devices installed in different fields, E-Crop can be used for accurate crop forecasting at the local, regional and national level.Forecasting with the help of satellite data has limitations owing to problems in capturing images or poor resolution of pictures.Reliable forecastsBy collecting data directly from the field, E-Crop eliminates the problem, resulting in more reliable forecasts, Mr. Mithra says.The advisory is expected to give a boost to precision farming and help farmers resort to optimum application of agricultural inputs to maximise production.The first unit, currently undergoing field tests on sweet potato, has been found to generate real-time data with more than 90 per cent accuracy. The CTCRI is preparing to test the device on rice crop."

Chirpy, full of life and a bundle of energy, shes dressed in a black, flowy kaftan, her long tresses tied up in a high pony tail, and a thick line of koel that accentuates her warm eyes. Shes in the mood for a party when we meet her. And of course she would be, Goas most popular restaurant, Thalassa, which she has nurtured for the past 10 years, has opened for business in Khar as Greek taverna, Thalassa.The restaurant is a sprawling 4,600 square feet, divided into two outdoor sections, one inside and a basement lounge with blue and white dcor, topped with a taverna shack ceiling, It was about time I came back, and it was something that everybody wanted. Mumbai is full of young people and has a beautiful atmosphere. Goa is more relaxing, as you visit it when you want to holiday, says the owner and head chef, taking a deep breath to smell the sea. Grana is referring to the time when Thalassa was a pop-up at Olive Mahalaxmi Racecourse two years ago. I like to be near the sea for its smell and the fresh fish. Thats why Mumbai won over Bengaluru and Delhi. Its closer too, and I can control it, she says.Backpacking in IndiaOriginally from the island of Corfu in Greece, Grana first came to India as a backpacker around 30 years ago. At a flea market in Goa, she saw the stalls selling pizzas, pastas and falafels. It hurt me that there were no Greek pita wraps and kebabs. I decided to change that, she smiles at the memory. But it was not that easy getting used to the flour quality to make the pita dough, she admits. A frequent traveller to India, she put up a stall and experimented at the flea market every time she was in Goa, introducing Greek kebabs to the local populace. When my son was born, my parents thought I would give up my hippy life and settle in Greece. On the 40th day of his birth, I packed my bags and came to Goa for good, with my infant, Spiro, she recalls.Our conversation is interrupted by a couple who have just walked in after seeing the board of Thalassa. Goa has come to Mumbai and we couldnt resist coming in, they tell her, as she welcomes them to join the party. She picks up the thread of our chat  after eight years of cooking Greek food at flea markets, Grana moved into her own space in Small Vagator, Goa, now a must visit on every travellers bucket list.Authentic Greek cuisineThe Mumbai restaurant will be run by two souschefs, Meghshyam Sawal and Mohammed Hisham Patel. And the menu will replicate dishes served at the Goa restaurant. You can expect to tuck into warm pita bread served with tzatziki, grilled lamb kebabs, chicken and prawn souvlakis and moussakas, spicy mushroom saganaki. I come from a family of chefs and I knew how to cook. I am no chef, who creates a menu and steps back. I cook for the customers how I would at home. My food is made with love, and a lot of Greek olive oil, says, Grana.Greek food is all about herbs  oregano, mint, basil, thyme, and parsley; feta cheese, garlic, onion, dill apart from olive oil. In the beginning, people would tell me my cheese has gone bad, but I would have to explain that it is characteristic of feta. Whenever someone told me my cheese had gone off, my blood pressure would go up! she laughs.Star performerHer 21-year-old son Spiro, is the star dancer at the Greek performances the restaurant conduct on weekends. I break the plates, and he dances, says Mariketty, as Spiro joins into the conversation. I dont help out in the kitchen, he grins. Dressed in all white, he sports a man bun and a mala around his neck. Having grown up in Goa, he speaks Konkani fluently, and he chatters away with the cops, if they ever stop us on the road, adds Grana.Spiro is not new to Mumbai, as modelling assignments brought him to the city a few years ago. Growing up in Goa are the best memories of my life. Goa is freedom and I loved lazing on the beach, playing football and other sports and having a circle of multicultural friends, says Spiro, who needs his dose of Goan fish, curry rice at least twice a week.Are there more thalassas in the offing, we ask. Thalassa is what it is today because I work 20 hours a day and am in the kitchen at 8 a.m. every morning, whether I have had too much wine the night before or not. It has been a long journey my love, Grana signs off enigmatically.The author is a freelance writerThalassa, 21st Road, Khar West; 9820004018"

Narayanan Unni was invited to present a paper on how he conserved Keralas nearly extinct medicinal rice variety, Navara, in an organic way at a global conference on best practices in agri-food innovation.It was followed by his attendance at the first International Agro-Biodiversity Congress held in New Delhi where delegates from across the world listened to the efforts for many years in protecting and promoting the red rice variety.Chairman of Chittur-based Navara Foundation and the largest cultivator of Navara rice in the State, Mr. Unni feels it would be vital for any modern society to focus more on protecting and promoting traditional rice varieties to face the challenges of growing food insecurity.His 12-acre Navara Eco farm is located on the banks of the Shokanashini river here.The cultivation of this medicinal rice variety was almost extinct when I took it up as a mission. Non-availability of pure seeds, low yield and high production cost were cited as reasons for the lack of popularity of this rice variety among farmers. It was my determination to keep the farm completely organic, said Mr. Unni, in an interaction with The Hindu . He has been running the farm successfully for the last 20 years.Unlike other rice varieties, which are white in colour, Navara is deep red and has been cultivated in the Palakkad region for more than 2,000 years. But it was totally wiped out during the last four decades when several new hybrid rice varieties were introduced.In the initial years, I had to struggle hard to collect and segregate enough seeds. Sourcing pure seeds was indeed a challenge.Many of my friends warned that it may be a sheer wastage of time and energy, he recalled.In most parts of Palakkad, the rice variety was contaminated by hybrid varieties. In addition to the low yield, about 200 kg from an acre made the cultivation commercially unviable, he said. For pest control, he grew tulsi and marigold on the field bunds.Since it is a medicinal rice variety for consumption we decided to adopt only organic methods. We did not want chemical residues in the harvested grains, explained Mr. Unni.Taking inspiration from Mr. Unni, many farmers in Chittur taluk are now cultivating Navara organically.It was only two years ago the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority had conferred the second annual Plant Genome Saviour community recognition award on him.Because of his intervention, Navara has also received Geographical Indication (GI) status.Navara is used traditionally to treat rheumatic patients. Navara rice is in high demand during the Malayalam month of Karkidakam for Ayurvedic rejuvenation treatments."

From loading containers to one vessel in January this year, the facility is now stacking the loads to three ships a month.A joint venture of the Kakinada Seaports Limited (KSPL) and the Bothra Shipping Services Private Limited, the company waited for a couple of months to commence the operations after its formal launch. Since then, the exports graph has been surging with more and more small-time rice exporters from the region booking the containers.We accept a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes, as the average capacity of container is 26 tonnes. Since there has been a steady increase in the frequency of vessels, there is not much delay in the loading, says M. Subramanian, terminal manager of the KCTPL.In the last 11 months, containers have been loaded to 26 ships, including the coastal (domestic) and international ones. The Food Corporation of India formed part of the initial clientle, as it sent rice to Kochi from the terminal located in the KSPL.Marine productsDenmark-based Maersk Line, Singapore-based BLPL and the Mumbai-based SRS are the three carriers that handle containers from here every month.The KCTPL is eyeing marine products being exported through Visakhapatnam port from Bhimavaram region in West Godavari district. Over 1.2 lakh tonnes of prawns are being sent from the region, in addition to other marine produce. Our terminal is closer than the one in Visakhapatnam for the marine exporters from West Godavari district. We have made consultations with them and most of them got convinced with our container plans, Mr. Subramanian says.In the absence of imports, the company is forced to call empty containers from different destinations, which, in turn, has been escalating the export tariffs to some extent. Imports, however, are expected to begin in a couple of months as the ground work has already been completed. The container service is for sure a boon to the small exporters. However, the traders are expecting the tariff to go down and the frequency of loading to be increased. Going by the market potential, it wont take much time for the terminal to reach out to these expectations, says A.V. Ranga Rao, proprietor of Ganesh Traders and director of the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce."
58e4d95aa3d24b281b102e93,Trust in the time of demonetisation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Trust-in-the-time-of-demonetisation/article16544663.ece,2016-11-18,"Leaning on each other:From the neighbourhood provisions stores to roadside vegetable vendors, help has been pouring in from some unexpected quarters. File Photos: G. Krishnaswamy, E. Lakshmi NarayananMany years ago, a man called Francis Fukuyama proposed an economic theory that rested on trust. He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships.In his 1996 publication, Trust , he said: One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nations well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.This past week, weve probably come out with flying colours in Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, thanks largely to trust. At a micro level, people, traders and vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again. For autorickshaw drivers, watercan suppliers, milkmen, tea shops and small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode.Vanessa Peter, who often takes autorickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change.The driver knows me well and I have taken his auto several times. I told him I did not have the money to pay for my ride that day and he readily agreed to take the money whenever I could pay him. She later paid the fare two days later. Shes been lucky though. The vendor who supplies drinking water at her home also left behind three cans, though she could only pay for one at that time.Some altruismIt is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit.For more than half his life, 45-year-old jeweller S. Raman of Perambur has been travelling all over Chennai selling inexpensive costume jewellery made from beads and metal to homemakers and working women. Mr. Raman, called manikaarar, had to make adjustments after November 8. A client purchased jewels worth Rs. 6,500 but asked if he could wait until the first week of December for payment. Dont worry about it. I have earned your trust over the years and I need nothing more, he replied.In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers.With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money, she says.Owners of rice mandis, medical shops, local kirana stores and even water suppliers in Chennai knowing well the cap and difficulties in withdrawing cash are not pressuring their customers to pay immediately.S. Anuradha, a resident of Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, was apprehensive about what to do when she ran out of rice. She was pleasantly surprised when the owner of a rice mandi nearby offered to give her stocks, which she could pay for with a cheque.Retail and wholesale tradeAt Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity. Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money, he said. The same with suppliers. While we are able to pay our suppliers from other states through bank transfers, we have to withhold cash payments to local farmers who supply us small onions, he said. Most farmers accept this, but some have stopped bringing the produce to the market.J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige.Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise. We allow most of our regular customers to pay later and allow credit for new customers. In some cases, I do not even make a note of the purchase when the crowd is heavy. Most people do not cheat and pay up in a day or two. Besides, I often find there is no change to give back if a customer produces a Rs.100 note for one tea. I have to ask him to pay later, said Kumar, who runs a tea stall in Thennur.Trust, a two-way streetTheres also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others.T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit. This is a great help. It is not that clients who approach us for registrations or for filing litigation are without money. They have cash but due to the demonetisation, there are practical problems in converting the old currencies with the prevailing day and weekly limits in force.Particularly, for any kind of registrations involving a immovable property, be it a settlement, gift or a release deed, one would require a minimum of Rs. 20,000 value stamp papers. The alternative is to pay by a DD demand draft, but again it is a time-consuming option given the rush in the banks to deposit old currencies. A vendor confirmed, Yes, we do give them on credit but not for all. We can trust only those who are regularly doing business with us for years.But trust too seems to have a threshold level. With the situation not improving in the last week, and liquidity going from bad to worse, traders and vendors have begun to fret. To avoid embarrassment, provisions are sold on credit to select customers. By and large, we turn away buyers seeking credit purchase, Jebastin Solomon, a grocery shop owner at K.K.Nagar, said, adding that it is simply impossible to conduct business without even a minimal cash flow.Clearly trust too is going to run out if liquidity does not improve. An addendum to Mr. Fukuyamas theory will probably be written in this country.( With inputs from Dennis S. Jesudasan, K.Manikandan, R. Srikanth, Sureshkumar in Chennai,S. Ganesan in Tiruchi,M.

A farmer in Punjab.Photo: AFPDelhi has registered its worst air quality in recent times. This has prompted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to call it a gas chamber. Pollution in different parts of the capital has touched hazardous levels with potentially serious health effects on the rich and poor alike, especially on children, the elderly and physically vulnerable people. Leaving aside the politics, the Central and Delhi governments should take urgent measures to prevent air pollution in order to stem the current impact as well as the future cost of healthcare.It is often pointed out that paddy stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab is a major reason for affecting air quality in Delhi during the onset of winter. Stubble burning is a common practice followed by farmers in these States to prepare the field for sowing of wheat in November as there is little time left between the harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat. Since this practice is followed every year despite some efforts by the State governments to prevent it, the problem of air quality getting affected in Delhi during October-November will recur. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and address the fundamental problems that force the farmers to burn the paddy straw on the field and not utilise it for any productive purpose. It may appear that paddy straw has no economic value for farmers in these States.The rice-wheat rotationHistorically, rice was not a major crop grown in Punjab and Haryana. In Punjab, rice accounted for only 7.6 per cent of the total cropped area during 1970-1973, which increased to a whopping 36 per cent during 2011-13. Similarly, in Haryana, paddy area increased from 5.6 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period. Extensive development of irrigation, assured price (minimum support price) and secured market (government procurement) have induced farmers to grow paddy and expand the area of cultivation considerably over time. Consequently, farmers in this traditionally wheat-growing belt started cultivating rice and wheat in rotation year after year. Various studies have shown that the rice-wheat rotation has put land and other resources under severe strain, resulting in depletion of soil nutrients, decline in water table, build-up of pests and diseases, and micronutrient deficiency. The State governments initiatives to push crop diversification as a strategy to overcome these problems have not convinced farmers to break the rice-wheat rotation. Crop diversification with vegetables and fruits hit a roadblock due to marketing problems.Being agriculturally progressive States, almost all farmers in Punjab and Haryana grow high-yield varieties of rice and wheat. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average rice yield was as high was four tonnes per hectare in Punjab and 3.2 tonnes in Haryana. These States have also experienced a high level of mechanisation of agricultural operations including harvesting. In fact, combine harvesters have been extensively used for harvesting of paddy and wheat due to non-availability of labour at the time of harvesting and increase in labour cost. A rough estimate based on the grain to straw ratio showed that Punjab with an average rice production of 11.1 million tonnes during 2011-13 generated about 16.6 million tonnes of paddy straw. Similarly, in Haryana, the average rice output was 1.3 lakh tonnes and it produced about 1.9 lakh tonnes of straw.Use of machines for harvesting has serious implications for crop residue management at the farm level. The combine harvester cuts the crop well above the ground, leaving behind substantial amount of stubble on the field. The machine leaves the residues in such a state that it is difficult to collect them manually. However, the farmers found ways to collect the wheat residue (bhusa) as it is a highly valuable animal feed and is even traded across districts. Given its economic use, the farmers run a chaff combine (reaper) after combine harvesting to collect straws, cut stubbles and make into chaff for feeding to animals directly or mixed with green fodder. So the burning of wheat residue is not necessary for the farmers because of the availability of technology and its higher economic value as dry fodder. Rice straw, however, is not used as fodder as it is found to be non-palatable to animals due to its high silica content. Because of its little economic value as animal feed and other general uses, farmers are prompted to burn it on the field instead of incurring a high cost on collecting it. In fact, field studies show that even though farmers are aware that the burning of straw is harmful to health, they do not have alternatives for utilising them effectively. Therefore, blaming only the farmers may not solve the problem of air pollution and there is a need to find sustainable technological solutions that can help farmers and simultaneously allow everyone to breathe clean air.Looking through the hazeBiomass provides safe and reliable energy. The available paddy straw can be effectively used for power generation, which will go a long way towards overcoming the problem of disposal of crop residues and power deficit in the region. According to data from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Punjab and Haryana have not made much progress in creating biomass-based power generation plants as compared to States such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Thus, there is great potential for making investments in paddy straw-based power plants which can help avoid stubble burning to a large extent and also create employment opportunities.Incorporation of crop residues in the soil can improve soil moisture and help activate the growth of soil microorganisms for better plant growth. However, suitable machinery for collection, chopping and in situ incorporation of straw is required. Further, initiatives can also be made to convert the removed residues into enriched organic manure through composting.Presently, a limited quantity of paddy straw is used for cardboard making and in packing industries and paper mills. However, new opportunities for industrial use  such as extraction of yeast protein  can be explored through scientific research.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality. Use of such dual-purpose rice varieties will help to maintain food security, farm income and improve environmental sustainability.Elumalai Kannan is Associate Professor at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality"
58e4da00a3d24b1c91ee0410,The warp and woof of demonetisation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-warp-and-woof-of-demonetisation/article16655300.ece,2016-11-19,"Knitpicking in Tiruppur:An employee at the stitching section of a unit in Pandian Nagar; (below) a couple working with a ribbon-cutting machine in Pandian Nagar; and a retailer at Khaderpettai market. PHOTOS: M. PERIASAMYSamundipuram, Wednesday, 7.30 a.m.The yarn bobbins mounted on the creel of the circular interlock machine move seamlessly. A series of bulky movements later, the off-white yarn churns out some more off-white cloth, stretched from under the cylinder of the knitting machine. Venkatachalam, in his mid-50s, stands watching his machines, with his hands crossed behind his back, in his unit in Samundipuram in Tiruppur.The air is thick under the slow grumble of the machines and the steady suspension of off-white dust of the yarn, accentuated by the yellow light bulbs lighting up from underneath each running machine, casting long shifting shadows. Bales of yarn waiting to be fed into the machine and bales of cloth knitted from the yarn ready for the supplier are stacked on the side of the shop floor. This is what remains of the Diwali stock, he says.Venkatachalam had reached the knitting unit at 6 a.m. to run the machines. My first worker will come in at 8.15 a.m, he says. Until last week, this unit of 16 machines ran with two workers on round-the-clock shift. They were paid Rs.3,000 each every Saturday.This Monday, a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes invalid, Venkatachalam had cut down two shifts to one. This has meant only alternate days of work for each of the two labourers. Now, Ill pay Rs.1,500 each to the two workers this week. No fresh yarn has come, and even if it did, I cant run the machines without cash, he says. Last week he produced 600 kilogram of cloth, against the usual 1,500 kilogram per week. He receives cheques from the supplier. But his wages are in cash.Life in the slow laneSome 18 kilometres away in Pandian Nagar, Shakthivel is picking up the last of the cloth bundles he had commissioned Karal Marx for cutting. Marx owns a rib-cutter that cuts fabrics into bundles of ribbons that are then stitched up as folding on collars and sleeves of T-shirts. His rib-cutter occupies a 50-sq.-feet space partitioned off his less-than-modest living quarters. The last of the bundles remaining from the Diwali stock supplied by people like Shakthivel are the ones left for work for Marx.At the foot of the rib-cutter is a can full of petrol. Oh that. I had to fill petrol for my moped. But they refused change and I was forced to buy petrol for the entire money, says Marx.Shakthivel runs a stitching section with seven labourers including his wife. The supplier provides him with cut cloth, and the cloth runs through five machines to emerge as a fancy top. Just my type declares a fair-skinned girl gazing out of a fuchsia printed top, on the bundle just finished.Only two days ago, Shakthivel had asked three of his workers not to come. I only have old cash. And no fresh orders had come, and there were serpentine queues in the bank. He has to pay Rs.4,000 each to each of them. He plans to wind up the remaining work, and lock up the section for the rest of the week. The rent of Rs.6,000 for the stitching section and house rent of Rs.5,000, both due for the 10th, was not accepted with old cash. Bending down to gently pick up her two-year-old son asleep on a cut cloth on the floor, Shakthivels wife Swarnalatha asks him if they should go to Palani, to be with their relatives.Abu Baquar Siddique, Shakthivels chief tailor, is a man of quiet pride. He collects part of his weekly wages daily, the Rs.200 from Shakthivel every evening goes into buying 2 kilograms of rice for Rs.100 and other groceries for a fresh-cooked dinner for his family of four. On Wednesday, Shakthivel gave him Rs.500 of the old note to tide over.When the past week saw households running on credit, goodwill, trust and goodness of the local grocers, Siddique never kept an account of credit with any grocer. I never have before. Thatll push us to buy more, consume more. So, when the outlet refused to accept his money, he simply migrated to PDS rice. But his two young boys are unable to eat the poor quality ration rice.Grinding to a haltThese men (and women) are part of the garment supply chain that swells at the lowest end to include many interdependent household units. This chain train hinged on work orders from the small supplier, to a micro unit, to the last-mile household unit  until demonetisation stopped it in its tracks. Slowly, units are beginning to grind to a halt, threatening to snap this chain.Two domestic suppliers that supplied cloth to Shakthivels stitching section locked down this Monday. The same two suppliers had supplied cloth to 20 other units with workforce of 20 each. Between them, the two suppliers each had a workforce of 100-150 workers. They have to pay me around Rs.20,000-Rs.30,000, says Shakthivel.Small suppliers and dependent tiny units that look to the supplier for work are wary of piling up work commitments and resultant unpaid wages.On Wednesday, the South Indian Collar Shirt and Small Manufacturers Association (SISMA) passed a resolution to downscale from 15 shifts per worker per week to six shifts. Units are already laying off non-salaried workers, says K.S. Babuji, general secretary, SISMA.Eashwaramoorthy is a domestic supplier selling to buyers in Mumbai and Delhi. His unit with a 20-man workforce has now pared down to just three workers. The rest were asked not to come. The current account withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 is not allowed by banks here. How do we pay, he asks.Demonetisation for the garment industry came at a time when the buyers were on the verge of settling payments of the suppliers for the Diwali despatches across the country. The buyers are now unable to make bank transfers to the suppliers beyond Rs.49,000, and that too only after the suppliers courier multiple copies of proof for bank verification.Tiruppurs layered systemThe garment industry in Tiruppur is made of three types of units: exporters, merchant exporters who receive subcontract work from exporters, and domestic suppliers.Exports  a Rs.22,000-crore turnover business  are primarily cashless. Yet demonetisation has tangentially affected exporters because they have to engage peripherally with cash-based subcontracts for job works such as knitting, buttoning, small servicing, printing, packing to merchant exporters. The merchant exporters themselves are small units with a workforce paid in cash.The cash crunch has halted 25 per cent of subcontracts commissioned by exporters, says T.R. Vijaya Kumar, general secretary, Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA), that has over 1,000 members. The exporters will have to deal with penalty of 20 per cent additional costs on shipments that will now be airlifted.Its domestic suppliers who are facing the demonetisation heat the most. They include micro units and sections that are partly, largely or fully run on cash.The garment industry in Tiruppur has 8 lakh employees; 4 lakh in direct employment and another 4 lakh in subsidiary units such as knitting, dyeing, printing, embroidering, spinning, accessories. Of this, 20 per cent or 1.6 lakh workers are estimated to be unorganised workforce. There are 2,000 small, medium and tiny units  now facing the prospect of phased lockout  that provide work to this unorganised workforce.Early this year, the TEA had met the Prime Minister during his visit to Coimbatore to present a Vision 2020 document to him that envisages increasing the garment industrys turnover to Rs.1 lakh crore by 2020.When demonetisation was announced, the exporters had cheered the decision. The TEA estimates the turnover of domestic units at Rs.7,000 crore from accounted transactions and another Rs.7,000 crore from cash transactions. On the other hand, the unorganised units solely run on cash are estimated to have a turnover of Rs.15,000 crore.For the exporters, this is a parallel economy with a cumulative Rs.22,000-crore turnover. This supply chain runs on cash, weeding out taxes. If this economy is integrated, then there will be a level playing field for all, says Vijaya Kumar.Khaderpettai, Wednesday, 3.40 p.m.Jeganathan bears a distant look as he scans through a Tamil paper. He was making daily sales worth Rs.10,000-Rs.30,000 on average out of his 80-sq.-feet shop, stacked with bundles of trackpants, T-shirts of all hues. On Monday, he sent away the only daily wager he had. Yesterday, I downed the shutter by 4 p.m., he says. Not a single sale on Wednesday in the shop he co-owns with his brother.Khaderpettai market represents that parallel economy that Vijaya Kumar was talking about. It has over 3,000 shops, wholesale and retail and godowns, run solely on cash transactions. Khaderpettai lends the retail-end support for the domestic garment suppliers. They lend the rationale for business for the smaller manufacturing units, whose manufacturing orders hinge largely on the business vibrancy of Khaderpettai. Some of the garment godowns are straight extensions of the manufacturing units.The hustle of Khaderpettai is missing since the demonetisation. Many believe things would look up once money circulation picked up.The garment industry has a high labour demand. Attrition rate is 50 per cent, and the average labour shortage is 35 per cent. There is a general resistance both among labourers and domestic units to crediting wages through banks. Wage account entails Employees State Insurance and Provident Fund contribution from both ends. Labourers, with marginal wages, are not enthused at the prospect of deduction, and employers are equally unwilling to contribute.Demonetisation has struck at the heart of this cash mode of payment of wages. Hence, ever since demonetisation, a primarily contractual workforce is migrating from smaller domestic units to export units, which credit salary through wage accounts. But the ability of smaller export units to absorb this preliminary flight of labour will unfold only in the coming days. Also, export units may not fully be insulated as the chain involves cash-based merchant exporters too.Small is no longer beautifulExporters also view demonetisation as a prelude to the nationwide rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), as a move to bring everything into accounting, force small units to migrate to wage accounts. Once GST comes into operation in April, there will less opposition and easy integration, predicts Vijaya Kumar.But on the ground, there is another reality being played out. The experience of micro units and sections so far indicate a possible immiserisation of owners and workers.While labourers just may have the option of flitting to an export unit wherever possible, marginal units such as Shaktivels stitching section or the yarn-knitting unit of Venkatachalam dont have that option. At worst, they will have to close down and move into the labour market themselves.Forty years ago, Vijaya Kumars father had started out with 10 workers and 10 machines. Today, he runs an export business with 1,500 workers. If this had come then, my father would not have survived, he agrees.This churn will decimate small units, which are unable to migrate, have no means or know-how to systemise their business operations. This slowly would also mean that businesses can henceforth be run only by the educated, who can engage tax accountants, auditors, and dedicated personnel for documentation. Todays tiny units are tomorrows larger units. This will also mean nipping start-ups in the bud, concedes Vijaya Kumar.Pointing at three shuttered shops in a Khaderpettai lane, a man, who refuses to disclose his name, says that almost all shops have sent away their daily wage workers. Until last week, each shop had a Hindi-speaking worker to help negotiate with buyers from beyond the Vindhyas.Do you see knitwear in the street shops of Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi? They are from here. The garment units are showroom; we, Khaderpettai, are for the pavement. The poor buy from us, he says. We all started off lifting loads on our back and have come to own businesses. We are not educated.The garment industry is made of three types of units: exporters, merchant exporters who receive subcontract work, and domestic suppliersDomestic suppliers are facing the demonetisation heat the most.

However, the Civil Supplies authorities said that 60 per cent of the purchases are through and are expect the remaining to be bought within the next few days.We are not purchasing fine variety of paddy for which quintal rate was fixed at Rs.1,800. So far, through the paddy purchase centres, 1.40 lakh tonnes were bought and another 60,000 metric tonnes are expected to arrive from farmers, said Krishna Prasad, District Civil Supplies Officer.Mr. Prasad said that Rs.1,510 was fixed for Grade-A variety and Rs.1,470 for Grade-B (common) variety.Since the rate is below the expectations of farmers, many of them kept the produce, waiting for the remunerative price. Those who are in urgent need of money are selling the produce at different rates and traders are taking advantage of it.Joint Collector A. Ravinder Reddy said that the Civil Supplies Corporation has not taken any decision yet on purchase of BPT paddy.Meanwhile, Civil Supplies Corporation chairman Peddi Sudarshan Reddy will be visiting Kamareddy and Nizamabad on Tuesday to hold talks with rice millers on the BPT purchases for supply to the social welfare hostels and fair price shops, he said.He said that there is a huge gap between the demand of gunny bags and the supply. Out of the 75 lakh bags required for packing paddy, only 35 lakh are available, and an indent was put to the Jute Corporation in Kolkata.We are trying to bring them from other districts like Nalgonda. Following which, everyday, two to three lakh bags are being transported, said the Joint Collector.Akula Manik, a farmer of Hunsa village in Bodhan mandal, says that he harvested BPT paddy some 40 days ago and is unable to find buyers.

Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran asked him as to why he chose to file a petition in the court to include him as one of the parties in a public interest litigation petition already filed against the combined drinking water scheme though he happened to be an MLA who was supposed to air his concerns on public issues inside the Assembly hall and not in the court hall.Supporting the PIL petitioner S. Manoharan, a resident of Kanniyakumari, who had challenged the validity of two Government Orders passed on September 5, 2012 and April 12, 2013 for the implementation of the drinking water scheme, the MLA said that the entire Kanniyakumari district was dependant on ponds, bore wells, canals and river water for its survival and the Kothai River was the main source for drinking as well as irrigation needs. The river originates from Valiyamalai hills and reaches the Pechiparai dam, the single largest water spread area for meeting the requirements of the district. Water from the dam was distributed through seven canals, five of which pass through Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluk for the purpose of agriculture, recharging of ground water table and maintaining the storage in the ponds and other water bodies in those two taluks.The two taluks were also fed with water from another river called Valliyaru, and in view of the abundant water supply as well as fertility, the two taluks were called as rice bowls or Nanjil Nadu of the district. On the other hand, two other taluks  Vilavancode and Kalkulam  were completely dependant on the water supplied from two sluices on the check dam above Thirparappu falls for irrigation, drinking as well as recharging of the groundwater table.Without any concern for the issues at hand, the government authorities have decided to draw 191.50 lakh litres of water every day for meeting the drinking water needs of Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluk, much to the dismay of the farmers and other residents of Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks, he said.Farmers in the lurchThe MLA also accused the government officials of misinforming the court as if only surplus water from the check dam would be drawn for drinking water needs.Finding force in his submissions, Mr. Justice Nagamuthu wondered what would happen to the riparian rights of farmers if the government continues to formulate one or the other drinking water schemes and draws water indiscriminately from dams. You should let the water flow down so that it could irrigate the fields on the way and then draw it for drinking water needs. You cannot straightaway take away all the water from the check dam above the falls, he said.The judge also said that the State Government projects the plight of the farmers in the State to obtain share of river waters from neighbouring States and then ends up implementing one or the other combined drinking water project, thereby leaving the agriculturalists in a lurch.Later, the Division Bench allowed an impleading petition filed by the MLA to include him as one of the parties to the case and adjourned the hearing to Thursday for a Special Government Pleader to obtain instructions from the officials concerned."

With pockets empty, frustration began to grow among customers waiting for hours - some had even taken an unpaid day off from work for the task.Jitender, who works as a security guard in West Delhi, said he had borrowed some money from friends, but exhausted it buying essentials for his family.Since Thursday, we have had not a single rupee at home. We have not been buying vegetables so we are making do with our old stock of rice and pulses, he said.On Friday, he lined up outside a bank in Janakpuri in hopes of withdrawing some money after having taken leave from work for the second day. On Thursday also I stood outside a bank, but failed to get any money. I have asked my wife to stand outside another bank so that we have some chance of getting money, Jitender said.Another customer, Kashikant Jha, said that he had been forced to leave empty-handed a second time. After waiting for three hours, he had to leave his spot in the queue as his employer refused to give him a day off.I waited on Thursday as well, but without any luck. Does the government think the cash in my hand is black money, he asked angrily.While most customers complained about the long queues and ATMs not functioning at all, some were more worried about being able to deposit the withdrawn currency into their bank accounts.R.P. Jindal, a wholesaler, said he had issued cheques to his suppliers a few days before the demonetisation was announced. If I dont manage to deposit money soon, the cheques I have issued will bounce, he said.Markets across the city continued to wear a deserted look on Friday, with many commercial complexes voluntarily shutting down for lack of customers and others failing to attract shoppers.Sanjay Bhargava, the general secretary of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that business in the usually busy Old Delhi area had fallen to less than 50 per cent of the norm.Less than a dozen people came to my shop on Friday. Usually the footfall ranges between 100 and 150. Its mainly because customers just dont have any cash in hand and there arent many who use plastic money in this part of Delhi, said Mr. Bhargava."

As per estate norms, workers are paid at the weekend.For the past two days, estate managements have been pondering over ways to tackle the situation arising out of demonetisation of higher-end currency notes. A few of them informed trade union leaders that they would not be able to pay wages.A major estate at Udumbanchola promised to pay workers in old currency notes, but they declined the offer. Some workers accepted the offer since there was no other option. Vimala, an estate worker, said she accepted the offer but did not know what to do with the money. I thought it was better to accept the money as we have to buy food items, she added. Some of the estates have reduced the number of daily workers. Others did not pay wages at all. Agitated workers staged protests in front of closed offices.K.S. Mohanan, general secretary of CITU-affiliated Malanadu Plantation Employees Union, told The Hindu on Saturday that workers plight would become more miserable in the coming days. Talks were on with estate managements. No concrete action was likely, he said. Over 70 per cent of the estate workers are women, the families breadwinners.On tea estatesThe situation in the tea plantations is not much different. On tea estates, managements usually pay a subsistence amount to workers on Saturdays and the total wage by month end.Many estates could not even raise the sustenance amount meant for purchase of rice and essentials for a week. Some estate managements have promised payment as soon as the crisis is over."

These marshes, called Kaipad fields, were once known for traditional rice cultivation and aquaculture.The Agency for Aquaculture Development, Kerala, (ADAK) is the implementing agency of the project aided by the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD).It has already started implementing the traditional brackish water shrimp-cum-paddy cultivation in the Kaipad fields, mostly located on the marshes on either side of the Kattampally river here.NABARD has sanctioned the project under the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change. It envisages integrated farming methods in 300 hectares of Kaipad fields in the district and 300 ha of Pokkali fields in the central parts of the State. NABARD is financing Rs. 33.73 crore for the entire project.NABARD is giving as grant nearly 80 per cent of the project cost and the grant is given for the integrated farming systems in contiguous areas identified for cultivation, said NABARD Assistant General Manager S.S. Nagesh.The project is progressing well, he said, adding that paddy cultivation and maximisation of inland fishery were among the objectives of the project aimed at promoting climate-smart farming practices.Ten self-help groups (SHG) have taken up farming in 50 ha of Kaipad fields under integrated farming system. Under the project, each SHG will be cultivating in 5 ha of Kaipad land.Applications invitedADAK has invited applications from interested SHGs or activity groups of farmers, farm workers and fish workers, having no less than five members each.When contacted, Fish Farm manager R.
