The paucity of cash has forced the plantation owners to postpone the work of de-husking and processing of arecanut, he said.A majority of agricultural labours have remained outside the purview of the formal banking system as a result of which payment through cheque or electronic fund transfer cannot be made to them.Exemot farmersThe government should exempt farmers from the ceiling imposed on withdrawal of cash from bank accounts and from ATMs, Mr. Kashyap said.Suresh, a farmer from Balur village in Shikaripur taluk is also facing a similar problem.The harvesting of maize crop on his land and the work of levelling of land on another plot owned by him, where he was planning to plant arecanut saplings, has been delayed owing to paucity of cash.Decline in ordersThe food industry in rural areas is the worst affected owing to demonitisation. Eshwaran P. Teertha, an entrepreneur from Kudligere village, who runs a food firm involved in producing wide range of products from millets and native rice varieties said, there has been a decline in orders from hotels and supermarkets in urban areas for his products from past three days.The payment for those supplying raw materials such as tender mangoes, lemon, millets, coconut and spices for food industries has also been delayed, he said.Long queuesSiddeshwar C., who runs an outlet of electronic gadgets in Shiralakoppa, said that in Shiralakoppa it was necessary to wait in queue in the banks for at least five hours to exchange currency notes or withdraw of money from accounts.Many in rural areas are postponing the purchase of electronic gadgets and vehicles. Those involved in electronics and automobile business in muffosil centres have suffered huge losses owing to withdrawal of currency of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination, he said.Those in electronics and automobile businesses in muffosil centres have suffered huge losses"

Why should people like us worry about demonetisation, asks construction worker Sangamesh.From Vijayapura, Mr. Sangamesh, who lives in Lingappyana Kadu in Mulky near Mangaluru, says demonetisation had little effect on their lives.Of the Rs. 8,000 he earned last month, Rs. 2,000 has gone towards house rent and around Rs. 3,000 towards agricultural loans and Rs. 1,000 for household expenses. He had saved Rs. 2,000 for his wife and two young children living in Vijayapura. Put together, my savings so far is Rs. 10,000. This is not a big sum that I am keeping with me, he says.Mr. Sangamesh is among the many labourers from North Karnataka who work at different construction sites in Mangaluru and Udupi. They visit their native places for about two months during the sowing season and return to Mangaluru later. He was among the many who attended the camp by various banks helping residents open bank accounts.Wages in old notesMr. Sangameshs neighbour Bheemanna, a native of Basavana Bagewadi in Vijayapura, says despite demonetisation, contractors paid wages in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes citing lack of Rs. 100 notes. Our regular grocery shop owner has accepted the old notes and given us ration, he says.Mobile recharge shopsBheemannas brother Muttappa says some mobile recharge centres have accepted the Rs. 500 note. The only condition was that I had to agree for a recharge of Rs. 300. I did not mind this, he said. Mr. Muttappa says some shop owners also obliged by giving them change for Rs. 500.Vegetable seller Mumtaz (60), who runs a family of nine, says demonetisation led to poor sale of vegetables. This forced her to purchase 20 kg rice for the family on credit from the grocery shop. Two days ago she repaid the money."

He has also been growing 50 paddy varieties which are rare and are believed to be useful for improving human health.He has distributed different varieties of seeds to his fellow farmers which are likely to be cultivated on a large scale in the coming years. Given his enthusiasm for farming, its no wonder that even at 65, he is full of vim and vigour and has undying thirst for developing new varieties via organic farming.Being the district convener of Bharath Krishak Samaj, he has attended rythu sadassus all over the country that not only enriched him with new techniques of farming, but enabled him to collect different varieties of seeds.He was the first farmer to grow quinoa rice in the district and he distributed the seeds to other farmers in his village. Quinoa is a rare variety and has high nutritious value. It is a fibre-rich grain and is healthy for diabetic patients. So is navara, which strengthens the nerves system. Even red rice is a panacea for several diseases, says Gangaram, sharing his knowledge on the crops grown by him on his 2.5 acre farm at Gopanpally on the outskirts of the district headquarters town.These breeds include ancient and modern varieties. The gestation period spans from 80 days (Sat Ka, Budama Vadlu) to 180 days (Raj Bhog and Padma Rekha).As of now, Godavari Uske-II, Kalavat, Kudurath, green super rice, Vishnu Bhog, Govind Bhog, Kunkumsali, Ramyakali, Indrani, Dehradun basmati, Pakistan basmati, Raktashali, Manipur Chakago, Chitti Mutyalu (scented rice), Kerala Sundari and others have come for harvest on his farm.I only use green and organic manure. Though the yield is less, I dont want to use chemical fertilizer. Organic farming will revolutionise the paddy cultivation, stresses Gangaram."

Following repeated pleas, the day train was introduced as a temporary service for five days in a week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday) from September 23 to October 14. Later the operation of this train was extended to November 30.The senior Salem division officials recently hinted that the special train enjoyed only 20 per cent patronage and hence the Railways has decided not to extend its service.This announcement sent shock waves, as the people of Attur town and the other parts of the district were expecting the Railways to make it a permanent feature.Meanwhile, L.R.C.

Apart from ensuring food security, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation is now fully prepared to stock any amount of food produce to be supplied from the Central pool, an official of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation told The Hindu here on Wednesday.The programme on construction of godowns was being implemented with full vigour with effect from 2011, the official added.The number of godowns had got increased from just 180 in 2011 to 292 now, indicating that an additional 112 godowns had been constructed in a short span of less than six years.The new infrastructure was being facilitated by the funds from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development wherever possible to a great extent under the Banks Rural Infrastructure Development Fund, the official added.On the expenditure, the official said that a godown with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes was being constructed at an expenditure of Rs.80 lakh. Presently, the concentration was more in seven districts, including Madurai, Kancheepuram, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, where the paddy production was on the rise.The official also said that the construction of these new godowns had totally eliminated the dependence of the Corporatioin on private storage yards or godowns. So far, we had to move our paddy or rice at their godowns, but the new infrastructure had helped us to be self-reliant, the official said."

In 2014, the government announced that 15 centres would be opened in Visakhapatnam, 10 in Guntur and five each at Tirupati and Anantapur in phase- I. The fact remains that the officials are still studying various models to roll out more canteens across the State. There is no consensus on the food items to dish out to the people.While there is a proposal to serve lunch with all dishes such as curry, chutney and sambar, the officials negate it saying different types of ricesambar rice, tamarind rice and curd rice-- could be served at these canteens. The GoM is, now, also mulling over a proposal to provide region-specific food at the NTR Canteens. The officials would have to study the food preferences of people in the State. It takes back the issue to square one and a Group of Ministers (GoM) on Anna canteens, subsequently, has decided to study the models in Telangana and Tamil Nadu again.A high-powered delegation headed by Civil Supplies Minister Paritala Sunitha already visited Chennai along with a team in 2014 to study how these canteens, taken up by the Jayalalithaa Government in Tamil Nadu function. The delegation studied whether these could be replicated in AP. The officials also studied the model followed in neighbouring Telangana State.The government had planned to initially provide subsidised food to around 1 lakh people in the first phase. The officials are now scouting for places which are labour intensive saying that the government target was to reach out the labourers. We are planning to start 100 canteens at places such as Visakhapatnam, Nellimara, Rajam, Tirupati, SRikakulam, Anantapur, Hindupur, Kurnool and Kakinada shortly, says Ms. Sunitha. The government also plans to supply region-specific food at these canteens. A proposal to provide full meals is also on cards. We are exploring all the options, she adds.The menuThey (the canteens) are modelled on the lines of Amma Canteens that gained immense popularity in Tamil Nadu. An idly costs just Re.1 in Anna Canteens. Two hundred grams of pongal and an equal quantity of tomato bath costs Rs.5 each. Two hundred grams of sambar rice, pulihora (tamarind rice) and vegetable rice costs Rs.5 each, and 150 grams of curd rice costs Rs.3.There was an overwhelming response to the Velagapudi canteen. Not less than700 people visit the canteen every day. About 500 people have meals there. The government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 4.38 lakh as against total expenses of Rs. 7 lakh per month, she explains."

With the demonetisation of these high value notes, they are unable to make donations. They are not so generous to donate their accounted money through cheques and electronic transfer. The major source of fund mobilisation has thus dried up with the demonetisation, an organiser said.Sasikanth S.Senthil, Deputy Commissioner, who looks after the financial matters of the sammelan, is confident of organising the event with the funds provided by the State government. He is of the opinion that the Rs. 4 crore that the government had allocated was a decent amount for smooth conduct of the event. Considering demonetisation and resultant crunch in fund mobilisation, he has approached potential donors appealing to them to offer their contributions in the form of goods and services required for the event instead of cash donations.Hundreds of hotel rooms are booked for providing accommodation to guests. In the normal condition, we would have collected donations and pay for the rooms. Now, upon our request in view of demonetisation, the hotel owners have agreed to provide rooms for free. Other responsibilities and tasks that require money are being entrusted to many people, Mr. Senthil told The Hindu .Vishnukanth Budadi of Shilpa Medicare Limited and the Raichur Rice Millers Association have similarly agreed to provide food to guests and the people for three days, Mahantesh Maski, former district president of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat said.In order to manage with limited financial resources, the organising committee is planning drop many proposals for cutting the costs. We will have to use the funds judiciously. We will put money on unavoidable expenditure such as erecting stage and cultural teams. We may have to avoid providing jackets to mediapersons and other such expenditures, Mr. Senthil said.Using the surplus money after the sammelan, a Kannada Bhavan is normally built for the parishat at the town where sammelan is organised.

And, along with the shortage of water for drinking purpose, the State now faces the spectre of its good run in rice production coming to an end.During 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, the State produced 7.9 million tonnes and 8.7 million tonnes of rice, accounting for about two-thirds of the total production of food grains. Three months ago, the State government described the previous years food grains production of over 13 million tonnes as unprecedented, after considering the production of millets and pulses along with that of rice.For the current year, the government has set a target of 14.8 million tonnes, of which rice will account for 9.3 million tonnes; millets 4.5 million tonnes; and pulses 0.9 million tonnes. The moot question is whether the State will be able to match its its past performance, under the given conditions.Normally, the availability of Cauvery water at the Mettur dam and the northeast monsoon play a major role in the production of the food grains.Availability of Cauvery water, in particular, has a huge bearing on rice production as Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts and parts of Pudukkottai and Cuddalore districts, forming part of the Cauvery delta, account for two-thirds of the States rice production. As of now, the States shortfall in the realisation of Cauvery water stands at about 100 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) . If one takes into account the rainfall received by Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, the deficit is about 60 per cent, which is, in meteorological parlance, large deficient.Still hopefulFarmers and agricultural experts are hoping against hope that the nature will be kind in the near future. In the coming weeks, we badly need a few spells of rain so that the standing samba crop can be sustained for the next one month or so, said S. Ranganathan, general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association. Y.E.A. Raj, former deputy director general of meteorology, has said there are chances of the State getting rainfall in early December.Senior officials of the State Agriculture department emphasise that the area covered under the long-term samba crop (July/August December/January) has not declined much. Explaining the implementation of a Rs. 64-crore package for the crop, they say the share of direct sowing in the overall cropped area has doubled now compared to what it used to be in normal times. The normal coverage of around nine lakh acres under the samba crop has been achieved this time too. The officials recalled how the governments another package helped the accomplishment of 3.16 lakh acres under the short-term kuruvai (June-September/October) crop this year. Their constant refrain is that if the State gets a few spells of rain, it will be able to achieve at least a production of 10 million tonnes of food grains, if not more.Mr. Ranganathan explained that those who are dependent on bore wells or groundwater will be able to save the crop. This can happen, considering that the groundwater position has been relatively good this time in view of last years heavy rain. But, in Nagapattinam and parts of Thanjavur district, the crop situation is very bad he says, urging the State and Central governments to make an on-the-spot assessment at the earliest.K. Ramasamy, Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, expressed hope that there would not be any steep fall in the rice production. After 2012, two new paddy varieties  CO 51 and TKM 13  have been introduced; these consume less water and are of shorter duration. Also, in CR 1009, the features of resistance to drought and flood submergence have been added. As the farmers are using these varieties, the yield is expected to be much higher."

The old age home at Kyasampally on the Kamareddy-Siricilla Road was established in July 2004 on a half acre land given on lease by one Matham Bhadraiah.Born in Karimanagar, Sarada Devi made her childhood dream of establishing an old age home a reality and has endeared herself to all with her selfless service. Her husband Rajanna, who held a district judge rank in the High Court before retirement, lives in Hyderabad due to health compulsions. The Rs. 5 lakh Rajanna gave from his retirement benefits was promptly spent by Sarada Devi on the home and its residents. Not only her husband but also her children, who are well settled, cooperate with her.At any point of time there are not less than 25 women, abandoned by their own children or having no one for them, living under her care. Some 25 women died of old age over the last 12 years and Sarada Devi along with other members of the home performed their last rites.DonationsThe home is run on the donations from philanthropists. Local traders and rice millers like Gabbala Balaiah and Chatla Srisailam give away 20 to 24 quintals of fine rice free of cost every year to the home. Likewise, many donors help in their own way. However, drought in the last two years affected the home as donations came down, says Sarada Devi.People help us by celebrating their birthdays and marriage days at the home. We manage the expenditure on other days. I have two volunteers, Lakshmi and Srinivas, who are dedicated to the service of the destitute women, she says.Appreciating the round-the-clock selfless service of Sarada Devi to the poor women the IIM-D conferred on her the Mahila Gold Medal and a national award in New Delhi on September 30. International Business Council also announced Star of Asia Award which she will be receiving on December 21 in Delhi."

Now owing to demonetisation, I am unable to get fresh loans for the purchase of essentials, complains Shantamma, a midday meal worker of ZPHS Nallagonda village in Thimmapur mandal. Earlier, Shantamma says she used to borrow money from the teaching staff, but now they are also in a helpless situation.The State government provides only rice free of cost for the midday meal scheme and has allocated Rs. 6.13 paise per student for primary schools and Rs. 8.18 paise per student for high schools, from which they have to procure vegetables, oil, tamarind, dal, other essentials and firewood for preparing food as per the stipulated menu.The midday meal workers here are provided honorarium of Rs. 1,000 per month, which has not been released since June this year.Habeeb Begum, a midday meal worker at the Government High School in Sapthagiri Colony says that the government has only increased their burden by asking them to include egg in the menu thrice a week .And on the other hand, they fail to provide us wages. How we can go on without any financial assistance from the government ? she asked."

As many as 219 traditional varieties of paddy are being cultivated at the Rice Diversity Block (RDB) established at Panavelly under the Save Our Rice campaign involving farmers, environmental activists and voluntary organisations.The first aerial photographs of the RDB have been released by Thanal, an environmental and advocacy research group based in Kerala that coordinates the campaign in South India, Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.The project seeks to document and revive the rich diversity of rice and popularise them among farmers. A Seed Saver Network involving farmer collectives has been established and efforts are on to characterize the different landraces. The overhead view of the RDB reveals a colourful tapestry highlighting the rich variety of paddy. The diversity extends to the colour of the stalk, leaf, and flower. This explains the colour difference between the units in the block, explains R.Sridhar, Programme Director, Thanal.To prevent cross pollination and maintain genetic purity within the 1.5-acre block, Thanal has adopted the technique of flowering asynchrony which involves a gap of several days between the flowering stage of the different varieties.It is estimated that India had 1.5 lakh varieties of rice landraces, with about 3,000 varieties unique to Kerala. But over time, many of these varieties disappeared, Mr. Sridhar says.Our aim is to involve all sections of society to conserve rice ecosystems and sustain rice culture and diversity. The campaign also seeks to promote organic farming and prevent GM foods.The campaign has succeeded in conserving 1,006 varieties of rice landraces in farmers fields, rice diversity blocks and seed banks in six States.The establishment of the RDB at Panavelly was preceded by a seed survey to identify different landraces and collect seeds from farmers. Some of the varieties are drought-resistant and flood-tolerant. Many others have aromatic and medicinal properties. Efforts are on to and popularize traditional rice among consumers, says Mr.Sridhar.Another RDB for lowland varieties of paddy has been established at Kozhikode.219 traditional varieties of paddy are being cultivated at the Rice Diversity Block (RDB) under the Save Our Rice campaign"

58e5018aa3d24b4437c4a372,Confessions of a bird man,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Confessions-of-a-bird-man/article16733462.ece,2016-12-01,"I cannot think of a morning without birds. I always need a piece of nature, before my coffee and the newspaper. If the first two are odes to culture, birds capture nature for me. Between walking and watching birds, my sense of the cosmos is renewed. There is an everydayness to birds which is fascinating. For me they do not merely greet the morning, they are the morning. They are the morning rituals of play and therapy where nature reminds you of the enchantment of life. There is an eccentricity about each of them that I found fascinating.My bird of the month is the stork. For gluttons, they are graceful in fight and walk and I confess I find their watch therapeutic. The stork walking the grass, stacking worms has a touch of the comic. It seems to be perpetually rehearsing its steps, imitating itself to see if it can do better. If they realise the lawn is being mowed, they dance in anticipation reeling deliriously behind the lawnmower celebrating the new harvest of life to be consumed.Next to them, the crow is an everyday affair. To call or suggest a flock of crows insults their singularity. A crow, at least in relation to a spectator, is an individualist, an egotist, a performer. The crow reminds me of an everyday philosopher at work; whether it is teasing a trail of water out of a half-punctured pipe or playing near a dustbin, there is a touch of the experimentalist to the crow. A delightfully urban bird that charmed the cartoonist R.K. Laxman into drawing it. The crow is animation incarnate, a living cartoon looking sceptically at itself.The language of kinshipRecently, an American lawyer narrated a legal battle around crows to me. The population of the Hawaiian crow, Alala, once virtually ubiquitous, had been drastically reduced to a mere 21. Stunned by the decimation, Hawaiians argued that merely being labelled an endangered species was not adequate, the Alala should be given the rights and status of a person. I sensed the beauty of the argument.I sensed this same feeling when tribes in Arunachal Pradesh objected to a hydroelectric project on the Tawang river, contending that theriverwas a nesting ground for black-necked cranes. The crane, the tribe believed, was a reincarnation of the sixth Dalai Lama. The court upheld the claim, sensing in a deep way the relation between survival and the sacred, hinting that in a way the language of rights is a poor language for the sacrament.I realise Aesop and the Ramayana might have done more to save birds than any legislation. Myths and festivals do more to sustain birds and other species than legislation. Legislations are contracts, they deal with ownership and property. Myths tap into the unconscious. Rituals play into the tacit understandings of a society. I still remember a Pongal festival where a wide variety of rice was cooked. My sisters used to teach me to make little rice balls, spread them out on a banana leaf, and then remind me one was for the sparrow, the other for the crow. These childhood rituals of affinity and caring did more for me than any later culture in ecology. As a child, I always thought that birds were ritual time keepers announcing the rhythms and seasons of nature.I loved watching birds in flight. They choreographed the sky, mapped out a dream time as a child watched them. Birds in flight suggested deeper mysteries about migration and evolution that one dreamt about. I am glad my generation was allowed its sense of mysteries and riddles. Big questions were not downloaded in instant time and riddles reduced to information  one sat and chewed on them.There was only one bird I was never fond of, and it was the pigeon. The pigeon somehow never seemed a fact of nature. It seemed native to the urban habitat. It seemed at home in flats, on pipes, creating nests and muck, little imitations of urban life I could not quite appreciate. I was envious because the pigeon loved the innards of houses and the city. Its addiction for the urban put me off.As a child I always felt pigeons were born simultaneously with middle-income housing. Even dogs, stray dogs could not quite compete with pigeons in their addiction to the city.A composite identityWatching birds in childhood leaves memory traces behind. Their performance as outlines, stances, tactics remain in ones head and I later realise I often choreograph the world with prototypes of them in my head. Doing this often I suddenly realise how easily a totemic nature with plants and animals develops. One senses a spiritual double in an animal or bird, an affinity, even a kinship one wishes to articulate in ritual ways. The primordial sense of childhood understands the need for these affinities. They tap into some deeper evolutionary unconscious. In India, a person evolves not just in relation to animals, birds, trees, soils. My genealogy is not complete without my songlines to birds. My identity as genuinely part crane, part crow. I can fully resonate with tribals understanding and addressing animals as brother bear. Modern education has amputated these affinities in creating a sanitary idea of citizenship. Today when birds disappear I feel a part of me is already fading away and that I too am doomed to extinction. Yet I cannot speak in the language of sustainability.The science of extinction I grasp but without mourning, all we have is a pathologists report. Without my birds nature becomes a kind of empty time. But as I hear the chorus of sparrows, crows, mynas, cranes welcome the day, while the parrot screeches out a later entry, I feel my sanity returning. I remember a sacred prayer in gratitude realising that as long as birds are out on the grass, to quote a poet, god is not yet tired of the world.Shiv Visvanathan is Director, Centre for the Study of Knowledge Systems, O.P. Jindal Global University.In India, a person evolves not just in relation to animals, birds, trees, soils. My genealogy is not complete without my songlines to birds"

The project, with an outlay of Rs.12.55 crore, will be implemented over the next five years.One of the initial components of the programme is the setting up of a community radio service for farmers in the area. The FM radio station will broadcast farm-oriented programmes from a station to be established at Moncombu.The project is being brought in as part of the Haritha Keralam initiative of the State government, Principal Agricultural Officer A.G. Abdul Kareem told The Hindu .The Kuttanad scheme envisages promotion of indigenous and innovative techniques such as use of transplanting machinery, seed drums, and in-situ composting of weeds and crop residue.Pest surveillance will be fully automated using field-level uploading of data and analysis employing android-based mobile applications, said Mathew Abraham, Agricultural Officer at the Kerala Centre of Pest Management, Moncombu. He, along with Mr. Kareem, had conceptualised the Kuttanad plan. The project was drawn after monitoring the ground realities for several years, he said.We are in touch with about 2,000 people engaged in farming in about 45,000 hectares in Kuttanad, comprising Alappuzha and parts of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts. Though the spraying of pesticides has been declining, there has been an increase in the use of weedicides, apparently due to scarcity of labour, he said.The good agricultural practices to be introduced will include preparation of a codex for rice cultivation, bringing up master trainers among farmers and agricultural officers, nomination of geographical indication registry for Kuttanad rice, and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certification for the farm produce. Management programme and crop scheduling for control of endemic pests such as brown plant hopper and black bug and weeds will be part of the programme.Establishment of automatic weather stations in each panchayat for location-specific forecast, solar-powered automatic light traps for pests, and development of forecasting prototype for major pests and diseases will be among other components of the programme. Sensor-mounted drones will be deployed to monitor plant health periodically.Financial assistance for operations such as additional ploughing and land-levelling will be provided in the initial years.The project will be implemented overthe next five yearsat an outlay of Rs.12.55 crore"

Shop owners now say their business have dipped following the demonetisation drive. They are not able to find either separate funds or other kinds of support owing to the crisis, officials said."

There has been an increase in payments in cheques, given the limits on cash withdrawal. With the government setting a temporary withdrawal limit of Rs. 24,000 a week, which traders say is grossly inadequate for them, both buyers and sellers are now opting to transact using cheques.As against eight to 10 cheque payments a week, I now receive about 25 cheques a day. Exchange of currency has almost completely stopped, said R.M. Satish, a grain merchant and the director of the Mysore Grain Merchants Association. It saves us the hassle of carrying large amounts of cash to the bank and depositing it at the end of the day. We were always in danger of being waylaid or robbed. This is a better way of doing business.Grains are purchased directly from rice mills and the payment is made in cheque. But rice mills source their commodities directly from farmers, with whom cash remains the only mode of payment. Merchants believe it is at this level that greater intervention is required by way of higher penetration of banking services and educating farmers."
58e50ac1a3d24b4437c4a825,The centralising instinct,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-centralising-instinct/article16712866.ece,2016-11-28,"The shock and awe of demonetisation has left no one in India untouched. Equally no one has been left with any doubt as to the fact that the policy originates with the Prime Minister, and that they are being asked to bear with short-term inconvenience in order to advance the longer-term national interest.Reams of newsprint have been devoted to the economics of demonetisation. Here I take stock of the questions raised by demonetisation for the direction of Centre-State relations.Unmediated by the StatesAs a policy initiative of the Central government, demonetisation is unique in recent times for reaching everyone in the country directly, unmediated by the filter of State governments. State governments do not appear to have been consulted ahead of the announcement, and in many cases demonetisation has directly undermined the routine administration of policies under their purview. Many have expressed frustration that they are powerless to address hardships faced by people unable to pay for treatment in private hospitals or of farmers unable to access loans from, or make repayments at, cooperative banks.Unsurprisingly, a number of States have complained that the way in which the policy was enacted violates the spirit of cooperative federalism about which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken so often.Furthermore, the design of the new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India include new national symbols that challenge regional sensibilities. For the first time, the new banknotes include Devanagari numerals, threatening to reignite old settled compromises over the national language within Indias federal union. The use of Devanagari numerals is already the subject of a PIL in the Madras High Court.The back-side of the new banknotes also carry the logo of the Union government policy, Swachh Bharat.All of this is in line with broader attempts to refocus political debates around national questions since 2014. Mr. Modi has consistently called for the strengthening of cooperative federalism, recognising that he is reliant on the cooperation of State governments to achieve national policy goals.A matter of identificationFor decades as Indias polity and economy became more decentralised and the States became the centre-ground of political life, they have been the primary level of political identity for most voters.In a situation where voters found it difficult to correctly identify which level of government was responsible for any given policy and chains of electoral accountability became quite opaque, State governments became adept at claiming the credit for Central government initiatives. Voters frequently give the credit for programmes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) or the National Rural Health Mission to their State governments rather than to the Central government.In the post-poll National Election Study conducted by Lokniti, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) during the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 42 per cent of voters who had benefited from MGNREGA gave the credit for the programme to their State government and only 27 per cent to the Central government. This looks vastly different to the situation in Brazils federal setting, for instance, where over 80 per cent of voters in 2010 attributed the countrys flagship social programme, Bolsa Familia, to the President.Mr. Modis election victory in 2014 challenged, although it has not displaced, the idea that the States serve as the primary unit of political affiliation. It was an election campaign that had a more national character and Mr. Modis candidacy and populist leadership style extended the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to farther-flung parts of the country.Once in office, Brand Modi has involved the projection of the Prime Ministers presence and authority across areas of government activity. Programmes have been carefully rebranded in an effort to better enable the Central government to claim credit for them and to limit the ability of the States to do so.Mamata Banerjees challengeStates have had different reactions to this. The most outspoken critic of Mr. Modis style of government at a regional level has been West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation. Just a day earlier she had raised objections to the fact that the Central government now makes MGNREGA payments directly into workers bank accounts. She has also railed against the naming of Central programmes after the Prime Minister, for which State governments are required to provide matched funding.In August, her counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, explained that his State was right to drag its heels over the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme). He called for the scheme to be renamed the PM-CM farmer insurance scheme, or  Kendra-Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana ( Centre-State Crop Insurance Scheme) if the States were expected to bear half the financial burden.Last month, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav distributed ration cards along with bags of wheat and rice  under the National Food Security Act  that carried pictures of him. The BJPs State spokesperson complained bitterly that the State government was playing politics by trying to claim credit for a policy of the Central government.There has not, however, so far been a resounding critique of the Modi governments version of cooperative federalism from most States. Demonetisation itself has been welcomed by Chief Ministers of both BJP and non-BJP ruled States alike, including Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha and Telangana, although some have criticised elements of its execution and potential to hit State revenues.For those critical of the centralising instincts of the Modi government, demonetisation presents an opportunity to refocus debates on Centre-State relations. Yet at the moment, many regional parties seem more intent on continuing a pattern of Centre-region bargaining rather than building new cross-State alliances that would act as a counterweight to the Central government.Even in the absence of a coordinated inter-State opposition alliance, for the Central government there is the risk that the centralisation of credit claiming for government policies could start to reduce the political incentives of opposition-ruled States to cooperate with the Central government in achieving national goals or implementing Centrally designed policies. This matters since State governments remain crucial for policy implementation. It is even more significant after the enhanced fiscal devolution to States following the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which gives States greater flexibility to decide priorities for government expenditure.A deeper debate neededThe time is right to engage in a deeper debate about Centre-State relations and the operation of federalism. There are major constitutional innovations in the offing such as the GST Council, designed to realise a more cooperative model of federalism in which the Central government and the States pool their sovereignty in order to pursue national economic goals. The counterpart to this platform of cooperation should be a deeper discussion about Centre-State relations and a focus on enhancing the incentives for States to cooperate with the Centre while preserving their autonomy.Louise Tillin is Senior Lecturer in Politics at the Kings India Institute, Kings College, London.An outspoken critic at a regional level has been Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation"

R.M. Satish, director of the Mysore Grain Merchants Association and a wholesale dealer of rice, told The Hindu that trade volume was down by 80 per cent in the first two weeks after demonetisation was announced on November 8. But for the first time since then, we observed a revival on Monday, with a perceptible increase in both unloading and loading of commodities, he said.During the pre-demonetisation days, I used to trade in nearly 100 quintals of rice a day. It slumped to around 20 quintals after [the announcement]. But since Monday, there has been a surge in supply, fuelled by demand, and the trading is around 50 quintals, he said. However, the general feeling is that it will take another two months for trading to touch the pre-demonetisation levels. Merchants at the APMC yard in Mysuru procure rice from Raichur, Siruguppa, Ballari and even Chhattisgarh to meet local demand and to cater to traders from Kerala.Hinting at an improvement in the currency supply, Chetan, a wholesale dealer of potatoes and onions, said this was reflected in the market trading fuelled by demand and supply. Earlier, he used to sell nearly 300 sacks of onions and 200 sacks of potatoes of 50 to 55 kg each. The numbers crashed after November 8, but this week he has seen increased trading. He expressed confidence in his business hitting pre-demonetisation levels within two weeks.Sajjan Raj Mehta, who deals in spices and dry fruits and procures the bulk of his products from Bengaluru, said, We are seeing some positive signs of revival for the first time. But it will take at least two months to get back to normal levels of trading.The APMC yard in Mysuru is a major hub from where commodities are transported to other parts of the district and to border areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The yard used to receive nearly 150 outstation trucks loaded with commodities daily, but the numbers plummeted by 80 per cent in the first two weeks after demonetisation. Though the traffic has increased since Monday, it is still nowhere close to the pre-demonetisation days."

It has become the only village in the entire South India and second in the nation after Akodara in Gujarat to turn towards cashless transactions. You are getting 20 litres of water through Any Time Water (ATW) cards. These cards can be used everywhere, including at grocery stores, hospitals and RTC buses. Do not use cash. This will address your problem of getting change , the Minister said, while addressing a meeting in the village.After demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes, the villagers decided to join hands to tackle the issue head on. A group of 20 youths led by Kumbala Yella Reddy, son of sarpanch Kumbala Lakshmi, took up the task of gathering information on how many persons in the village were having bank accounts and active ATM cards. It was realised that though many of the villagers took ATM cards, they kept them in lockers unused. We visited each and every house (280 houses and 370 families) to enquire about bank accounts and ATM cards. While there were people who did not have any accounts, others were not using the cards issued, said Paddala Raju, a post-graduate in the village, who led a team of volunteers.The local Andhra Bank branch officials responded quickly to the villagers plea and helped in activation of old cards in addition to issuing new cards.In the last few days we may have issued 300 new cards and activated about 700 cards. All those above 18 years were issued cards, disclosed M. Shankar, Manager, Andhra Bank.Mr. Yella Reddy said: About 70 per cent of the villagers have smartphones and all of us have downloaded the Andhra Bank mobile wallet. Once a one-time password is generated, we can transfer money within no time.Ibrahimpur with a population of 1,300 has other achievements too. It had achieved cent per cent sanitation, constructed soak pits, dug trenches for about 600 acres and ensured planting of 2.1 lakh saplings in a two-day span.The Irrigation Minister, pleased with the villagers enthusiasm, said that as an incentive to turn cashless, a Rs. 5 lakh insurance was being offered for those using cards.Bank Mitras will be kept for one week in every village to train people in cashless transactions, he said, while handing over rice for three women using the cards at a ration shop. Micro ATMs were also being established at the ration dealer, Mahila Samakhya and the Grama Panchayat.Irrigation MinisterT.

Laxman Raos declaration of over Rs. 9,000 crore income continued even as Income Tax (IT) officials conducted searches at his Filmnagar residence for the second day on Wednesday.While IT officials remained tight-lipped over their findings, speculation was rife that some powerful and rich persons could be behind the suspicious declaration. Based on Raos declaration, he was issued notice to pay part of the tax amounting to nearly Rs. 1,000 crore by the end of November. Since he failed to do so, the IT authorities raided his office and residence on Tuesday. The inspections, verifications and scrutiny of documents continued till late on Wednesday nightTeams of officials continued to visit his house at Filmnagar to elicit details about the declarations he had made. Normally, genuine persons would be prepared to pay the tax amount having presented documents under IDS. Since he didnt pay the tax till the deadline, surely something is fishy, says Chartered Accountant Krishna Reddy.Inspections held so far indicated that Mr. Rao didnt have sources to generate a few lakh rupees of income let alone Rs. 9,000 crore. The possibility of some businessmen using his declaration to protect their money cannot be ruled out, say investigating officers unwilling to be quoted. They point out to two similar instances reported from Mumbai and Ahmedabad. While four of a family from Mumbai filed a declaration of Rs. 2 lakh crore, a person called Maheshkumar Chmapaklal Shah of Ahmedabad claimed income of Rs. 13,860 crore.Mr. Raos bank accounts, property documents, assets registered in the name of his two sons and daughters-in-law are being verified. While IT officials indicated that it could be a false declaration under IDS, rumours started doing the rounds that another businessman had made declaration of Rs. 3,000 crore income. Inquiries, however, confirmed that no searches were conducted by IT authorities on the other persons house in Begumpet.In a late night twist, Mr. Rao reportedly told IT officials that he filed IDS papers anticipating that he would earn thousands of crores of rupees through a rice pulling coin. Sources maintain that he told the authorities that a godman predicted that he would become super rich with the rice-pulling coin having magical powers."

She dazzled the nurses, doctors and the hospital administrators alike with her intelligence, wit and consideration for others.As with every other patient, they would have liked her to go home, but as they got back to work a day later, those who worked with her intensely over the 73 days, seemed to feel a vacuum on the intensely buzzing hospital premises.King Kong nursesEveryone nearly has a tale to tell about their time with Ms. Jayalalithaa, and they dont need any coaxing to tell it. A team of 16 nurses, working in three eight-hour shifts on rotation took care of her right through, till the end.Three of them, however, were extra special. She called these nurses, Sheela C.V., Renuka M.V, and Samundeeswari King Kong, and would ask for them, keeping track of their duty hours, explains Sunitha, nursing superintendent at the hospital.We were so privileged to work with her. And to think the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu trusted us and smiled to welcome us every day, thats another feeling, says Sr. Sheela. She was really nice to us, shed say, You tell me what I have to do and I will do it. When she was tired, she would ask us if we could do something a little later, she would not refuse to do anything.When physiotherapy was started, she would apparently make a game of knocking little balls around, chucking them at the nurses. And when we started oral feeds, she would say each spoon she took was for a nurse, mentioning them by name, Sr. Sunitha chimed in. She would play old Hindi and English songs from a pen drive, and moments of nursing care were filled with songs. I cannot forget anything that happened these last 70-odd days, says Sr. Renuka. When she could write, she would write down her menu, and seemed to be fond of pongal, upma, curd rice and potatoes. We even had a separate kitchen, where her own cook was brought in sometimes, to make the food. She would tease them sometimes about the food and invited them to Kodanad for the best tea. The nurses even got an invite to the Assembly, when she returns to work.This bonhomie spilled over on to doctors, especially female doctors. Medical director at Apollo Hospitals Sathya Bhama shared one such anecdote. Once she told a doctor that she should change her hairstyle, that it would look better on her. And then, followed it with playful banter: Im the Chief Minister, Im ordering you.Of other women doctors, she would ask about their families, if it was not getting late for them, wonder how they came to work early, and tell them to take care of their health and skin. Her stay here was filled with such moments. Despite her circumstances, irrespective of how she was feeling, she would ask her doctors to be seated, though she did demand that they seek her permission before entering. She would always ask us why we were doing something to her; how it would help her and if there was any other procedure they could follow, says Ramesh Venkataraman, one of the critical care specialists who attended to her. Sometimes, she would tell us to adjust the settings of the ventilator to a particular specification when she was feeling uncomfortable. She followed everything we were doing very intently.Im the bossThere is another story that is now legend in the hospital involving the London-based consultant Richard Beale. It is said Dr. Beale gathered together the younger staff who were completely in awe of her in her room one day and advised them in her presence that in the hospital they would call the shots, even if their patient was the Chief Minister. Though she was unable to speak then, she gestured to Dr. Beale: No. Here, Im the boss with a beaming smile. Everyone burst out laughing then, recalls Babu K. Abraham, critical care specialist.These are just a few tales, there are many more. Surely, these are going to be told and retold, again and again, in lunch rooms, wards, sterile corridors and nurses bays for a long, long time to come."

However, the organisers somehow managed to provide food for almost all of them and avoided possible chaos at the food court. Police personnel worked day and night for managing crowds, controlling traffic, and dealing with security issues.It was one of the best organised sahitya sammelans where the food section was neatly managed despite huge crowds thronging the venue at the eleventh hour, B. Rajendra, a teacher from Shivamogga, who is also a winner of the national award for teachers, said. He has attended at least 10 sammelans in the past.Secondly, people with different linguistic backgrounds came together and played a crucial role in making the event a success. Deputy Commissioner S. Sasikanth Senthil, who led the reception committee and its 33 sub-committees involved in organising the event, is a Tamil. Superintendent of Police Chetan Singh Rathor, who maintained law and order, controlled traffic, and ensured safety of VIPs and other guests leading a posse of around 2,000 police personnel, is a Hindi speaker from Uttar Pradesh. Raichur Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer M. Kurma Rao, who supervised many sub-committees involved in organising the event, is a Telugu. N.S. Boseraju, MLA, and working president of the event, is also a Telugu.Deputy commissioners are the chief conveners of sahitya sammelans. Mr. Senthil, however, made a difference. For the first time in my experience I have seen a non-Kannadiga Deputy Commissioner passionately involving himself so much and relentlessly working day and night make the sammelan a success, Mahantesh Maski, writer and sahitya parishat functionary, told The Hindu . The functioning of the district sahitya parishat, he added, appeared to be dull in comparison with the rigorous work of the officer.Other non-Kannadigas too involved themselves at various levels for the success of the event. S.R. Reddy, MLA for Narayanpet in Telangana, and Vishnukantha Budada, who jointly provided food for delegates, were of Telugu and Rajasthani origin. Many in the Raichur Rice Millers Association that provided food to lakhs of people, including A. Papareddy, former MLA, are of Telugu origin.The huge venues, book stalls, food court, exhibition centres and other temporary structures for the sammelan were built by Tamils. The food for lakhs of public was prepared by a team of Gujaratis led by Babulal Jain, a Pakistani refugee. Besides, many Rajasthani speaking Marwaris and Urdu-speaking Muslims sponsored and served water, cool drinks, butter milk, snacks and other refreshment to artists and the people during the six-km long colourful procession on the first day.Mr. Senthil is leaving Raichur with fond memories and satisfaction as he is transferred to Bengaluru to the Department of Mines and Geology. His transfer order issued a month ago was withheld till the completion of the sammelan."

It is not only cost effective, as the input cost is less, but would also help maintain soil health, conserve water, which has become very precious, and get better yield. Therefore, I appeal to paddy cultivators to give a thought to shifting to DSR technique after seeing the success of the farmers who have adopted it, he said.The Minister was here on Tuesday for a demonstration of ready-to-harvest paddy crop cultivated under the DSR method.A large number of farmers from within the district and also from other districts, including Mysuru, Chamarajnagar, Mandya, Kollegal and also neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, participated.You (farmers) save a lot if you adopt DSR method right from getting the plants from nurseries, on labour, use of fertilizers and pesticides, water and yet get more yield. Apart from that, you would be able to maintain the health and fertility of soil, he said.Stating that the DSR method was gaining popularity in the command areas served by the Krishna and the Tungabhadra, Mr. Byre Gowda stressed that this technique should be adopted by farmers in the upper reaches so that the farmers in the tail-end areas could get water and harvest a good yield.This demonstration is organised to propagate the new technique so that the farmers could see the results and adopt the new method, he added.Allum Veerbhadrappa, MLC, urged the Minister to announce a college of agriculture at the Hagari Agricultural Research Station, which had all the necessary infrastructure.Lakshmikant Reddy, president of the District Krishik Samaj, spoke.N.Y. Gopalkrishna, MLA, who presided over the programme, called upon the farmers to adopt innovative methods to make cultivation profitable.He also reminded the Minister of the promise that he and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had made to the people during the by-election campaign that they would set up an agriculture college here and wanted the government to initiate necessary steps to keep the promise.Sharnappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, welcomed the gathering."

Suraj has a mature head on his shoulders and, unlike many others of his age, a passion for farming. He is clear about what he wants to do and has won laurels with his zero budget farming efforts.Based in Wayanad, Suraj has been engaged in farming since the age of 15, inspired by the teachings of Subhash Palekar, the proponent of zero-budget farming. He grows fruits and vegetables, along with rice of the valichoori variety, and rears cattle, on a 15-acre land.Award winnerWinner of the State governments Karshaka Jyothi Award in 2014, Suraj was the cynosure of many an eye as he rose to speak at a special session on youth entrepreneurship in agriculture at an exhibition-cum-workshop in the city on Saturday. The government, he said, should bring about changes in the present farm management system to incentivise youth to take up agripreneurship.His presentation made multiple references to Vrikshayurveda, from which he takes lessons to generate higher yield and ensure disease-resistance capabilities of his crops. Considered an ancient science of plant life, the compilation of organic farming methods has valuable lessons for everyone who wishes to go the natures way in farming, he says. Kunapa jal is a manure advocated by Vrikshayurved, which battles fungal growth minus the detrimental effects of chemical pesticides. Suraj is now getting ready to launch his own brand of products as Samskrithi Agro."

Now, we produce only 15 per cent of the total requirement, said Mr. Vijayan. The governments special initiatives in the sector had already helped to resume farming in not less than any 3,600 hectares, he claimed.Stressing on the need to use hybrid crops and mechanised production for cost-effective production, the Chief Minister said it was high time the small landholders joined the effort.On December 8, we would launch one more ambitious project to revive all possible water sources, including ponds and rivulets in villages and urban areas, to face the water scarcity challenges, he added.Mission PerambraExcise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan, who chaired the function, said around 450 hectares of land in Avalapandy would be converted as paddy farm with the cooperation of agriculture technicians and the labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. We ventured into the scheme as part of the Mission Perambra-2016 initiative in the Perambra Assembly constituency, he said.On the new venture, Cheruvannur panchayat authorities said the vast kole land area was selected for paddy farming after a gap of 30 years. It was in the possession of various private landholders for long and the effort to bring them under a common roof was materialised very recently through the Mission Perambra project, they said."

The state accounted for about 15 lakh hectares under tapioca.The tapioca is supplied to 350 sago production units functioning in the districts of Salem and Namakkal, which are involved in the production of sago rice and sago flour.About two lakh farmers, loading workers and other daily wage earners are involved in the sago industry. The livelihood of about 1.5 lakh workers is affected as majority of the units have suspended tapioca crushing activities.Due to recurring drought and unreasonable price for the crop, many farmers did not raise it this season.The scarcity of water affected 90 per cent of the standing crop. At present, the tapioca area has shrunk to three lakh hectares in the State. This is expected to increase the price of tapioca manifold.According to K. Sundaram, State general secretary of the Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, Namakkal district had experienced less than 50 per cent of the usual rainfall, the lowest in two decades.Not only has there been a drastic reduction in the tapioca cultivation in areas such as Namagiripettai, Rasipuram, Kollihills, Paramathivelur in Namakkal district, the yield too has remained very poor. The production is expected to come down to 50 per cent of the normal yield when the harvesting season ends by February next year, he said.P. Shanmugam, a farmer of Kollihills, said that due to drastic reduction in the yield, the farmers hope to get hiked procurement price this season, after a gap of eight years.K.A. Govindasamy, president of the Tamil Nadu Tapioca Farmers Association, said the drought had reduced yield to one tonne an acre, from two to three tonnes in the previous years. He demanded that the government fix Rs.450 per point of tapioca to protect the interest of the farmers.Mr. Sundaram urged the government to declare both Salem and Namakkal district as drought hit, launch relief measures, and provide adequate compensation to farmers."

Mr. Gandhi should perhaps be reminded of the days of the Emergency. No Congressperson has the moral right to lecture anyone else on the virtues of democracy and speak against the abuse of power before denouncing the Emergency. This might be a big challenge for the party but its high time for them to do this in order to sound more credible.C.G. Kuriakose,Kothamangalam, KeralaThe Congress party seems eager to erase the general perception that the old guard was loathe to have the straight-speaking Rahul Gandhi at the helm (Congress asks Rahul to steer the party ship, Nov. 8). Mr. Gandhi, who has a significant following among the youth in the party, has to cash in on his image of being pro-poor, secular, and not hungry for power. Though tags such as ineffectual communicator and non-assertive politician may haunt him, he has the opportunity to change for the better the partys prospects. Many Pradesh Congress Committees are in disarray and Mr. Gandhi has to groom able leaders at the State level. He also has to expand the partys youth base and ponder why the youth in the country have shifted their allegiance to the BJP. The onerous task of making the party more lively, bringing in accountability, and fixing responsibilities cannot be stressed more. Sonia Gandhis strength was her ability to carry the non-BJP parties along with her and stitch alliances. Mr. Gandhi should learn from his mother.Ganapathi Bhat,AkolaThe Congress has been lying low in practically every State due to lack of leadership and loss of confidence. Rahul Gandhis proposed elevation as president may bring cheer to his supporters but may not change the partys fortunes in the immediate future. In fact, Mr. Gandhi has squandered too many chances to rebuild and rejuvenate the party. Nevertheless, if made party president, he should first revamp the party at the grass-roots level. He should induct new blood while elevating dedicated workers in each State. Otherwise his elevation will be futile.K.R. Srinivasan,SecunderabadAfter the smogIn order to improve the quality of air in any city, the first thing that is required is a change in peoples behaviour and mindset (Solutions after the smog, Nov. 8). Pollution and garbage disposal are often related to peoples livelihoods. While people think of their livelihoods as their own, the pollution or waste that is generated from the same is seen as the governments headache. People criticise the government for its ineffectiveness in checking poor air quality and pollution while forgetting that they themselves are part of this menace. If we take examples from highly polluted cities in other countries, we see that the governments and the people undertook joint efforts to control pollution. The Indian government should frame polices that require the active participation of citizens in controlling pollution.Mudit Katiyar,LucknowDelhi alone does not have polluted air, the whole of India does. The introduction of CNG-run vehicles, which emit nanocarbon according to some studies, and relentless afforestation have been some of the causes of pollution in the capital. The present scenario calls for more sustainable initiatives with short- and long-term perspectives. Bolstering the public transportation network is an immediately plausible solution. People should carpool, follow the odd-even scheme, use cycles as a mode of travel (for which roads, pavements and general infrastructure need to improve), and so on. The burning of crops can be checked only through administrative intervention involving farmer-support measures. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which is aimed at providing clean fuel, are laudable.Anjali B.,ThiruvananthapuramA Bihar-like allianceThere is no harm in contemplating a Bihar-like grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh. But the SP should not forget that parties like the JD(S), JD(U), RLD and RJD have nothing much to offer to it in the U.P. battlefield (Chasing a grand alliance, Nov. 8). The main reason for the Bihar victory was that both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad buried their differences and consolidated anti-BJP votes to hand out a shocking defeat to the BJP. If the SP wants a similar story in U.P., party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav must first approach Mayawati. This is the only way he can hope to win this election, especially after the Yadav family feud, because the Congress is still a fringe player.Bal Govind,NoidaStunt gone wrongThat two Kannada stunt actors Anil and Uday drowned in a lake after jumping off a helicopter during a fighting sequence for a film made for sad reading (Stunt goes off script during Kannada movie shoot, Nov. 8). It is made even more tragic by the fact that Anil said just before the stunt that he barely knew how to swim! The incident smacks of sheer madness and irresponsibility on the part of the film producer, director and the whole crew. That a boat was not nearby to haul them up after the rescue makes it all the more bizarre.S. Ramakrishnasayee,RanipetFood and nutritionAlthough the public distribution system has provided poor households across the nation accessibility to regular and subsidised food grains, it fails to fulfil nutrition standards. Hidden hunger in India is created due to paucity of essential micronutrients in the body even if a large amount of food is consumed (Linking food and nutrition security, Nov. 8). The rice that is distributed is polished and lacks nutrition-rich barn. Diversification of food distributed in the PDS is the need of the hour. Cereals fulfil our carbohydrates requirement, but protein is required for overall physical and mental development. It is time to increase pulse production and distribution through the PDS. The most important step is biofortification, a process through which the nutritional quality of crops is improved through biotechnology or selective breeding.Gagan Pratap Singh,NoidaD-Day in the U.S.The U.S. presidential election has been one of the most debated events in recent times as the future President will not only impact the lives of Americans but of people across the world (America goes to polls today, Nov. 8). Even if the U.S.s hegemony has come under challenge, whether due to rising anti-Americanism in West Asia or due to what Fareed Zakaria calls the rise of the rest, the election is still important.With the global economy still not fully healthy, the EU facing a crisis, the Middle East in a state of chaos, and with threats from the Islamic State, who becomes President will determine how these issues are tackled.Abhilash Thimmaiah,New Delhi"

She dazzled the nurses, doctors and the hospital administrators alike with her intelligence, wit and consideration for others.As with every other patient, they would have liked her to go home, but as they got back to work a day later, those who worked with her intensely over the 73 days, seemed to feel a vacuum on the intensely buzzing hospital premises.King Kong nursesEveryone nearly has a tale to tell about their time with Ms. Jayalalithaa, and they dont need any coaxing to tell it. A team of 16 nurses, working in three eight-hour shifts on rotation took care of her right through, till the end.Three of them, however, were extra special. She called these nurses, Sheela C.V., Renuka M.V, and Samundeeswari King Kong, and would ask for them, keeping track of their duty hours, explains Sunitha, nursing superintendent at the hospital.We were so privileged to work with her. And to think the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu trusted us and smiled to welcome us every day, thats another feeling, says Sr. Sheela. She was really nice to us, shed say, You tell me what I have to do and I will do it. When she was tired, she would ask us if we could do something a little later, she would not refuse to do anything.When physiotherapy was started, she would apparently make a game of knocking little balls around, chucking them at the nurses. And when we started oral feeds, she would say each spoon she took was for a nurse, mentioning them by name, Sr. Sunitha chimed in. She would play old Hindi and English songs from a pen drive, and moments of nursing care were filled with songs.I cannot forget anything that happened these last 70-odd days, says Sr. Renuka. When she could write, she would write down her menu, and seemed to be fond of pongal, upma, curd rice and potatoes. We even had a separate kitchen, where her own cook was brought in sometimes, to make the food. She would tease them sometimes about the food and invited them to Kodanad for the best tea. The nurses even got an invite to the Assembly, when she returns to work.Banter with doctorsThis bonhomie spilled over on to doctors, especially female doctors. Medical director at Apollo Hospitals Sathya Bhama shared one such anecdote. Once she told a doctor that she should change her hairstyle, that it would look better on her. And then, followed it with playful banter: Im the Chief Minister, Im ordering you.Of other women doctors, she would ask about their families, if it was not getting late for them, wonder how they came to work early, and tell them to take care of their health and skin. Her stay here was filled with such moments. Despite her circumstances, irrespective of how she was feeling, she would ask her doctors to be seated, though she did demand that they seek her permission before entering.She would always ask us why we were doing something to her; how it would help her and if there was any other procedure they could follow, says Ramesh Venkataraman, one of the critical care specialists who attended to her. Sometimes, she would tell us to adjust the settings of the ventilator to a particular specification when she was feeling uncomfortable. She followed everything we were doing very intently.Im the bossThere is another story that is now legend in the hospital involving the London-based consultant Richard Beale. It is said Dr. Beale gathered together the younger staff who were completely in awe of her in her room one day and advised them in her presence that in the hospital they would call the shots, even if their patient was the Chief Minister. Though she was unable to speak then, she gestured to Dr. Beale: No. Here, Im the boss with a beaming smile. Everyone burst out laughing then, recalls Babu K. Abraham, critical care specialist.These are just a few tales, there are many more. Surely, these are going to be told and retold, again and again, in lunch rooms, wards, sterile corridors and nurses bays for a long, long time to come."

It will be a different mode of intervention retailing value-added products with strong indigenous technology base.``We are attempting to find takers for rural technologies and livelihood attempts of the rural poor, especially women, said V G Gopinathan, executive director of Samatha.The e-commerce initiative is being launched a year after the PPC launched its production unit and display section at Mundur, near Palakkad. Other than handmade soaps, the e-commerce portal will soon start selling a number of value-added products, including KSSPs rice cooker, detergents, toilet utensils and washing products.Pesticide-free food items, artefacts and indigenously made household items also would get representation soon.Mr. Gopinathan said the PPC would focus on strengthening local economies and provide job opportunities to youngsters, especially the rural women. The PPC is also now undertaking projects such as installing biogas plants that can reduce significantly the threat from accumulating garbage, pipe compost units and earthworm compost manufacturing units, which would help pesticide-free farming.Such plants are being built by the PPC as per orders for local self-governments, individuals and organisations.Elaborating on the achievements of the IRTC, he said over 8,000 large-scale biogas plants have already been built by it across the State. Over 2,000 pipe compost units and 2,000 other garbage treatment units have also been installed. Our aim is to strengthen the local economies to fight invasion by multinational products. The PPC is also planning to support the potter community by giving value addition to their traditional products and finding better markets, he said. In the energy sector, the PPC will soon come out with user-friendly solar panel-based inverters that can ensure energy self-sufficiency. Many other products are in the experiment stage, he said.

Its a time when the problems of shelter and belonging have been deeply magnified as demonstrated by the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis.Cultural theorist, poet and curator Ranjit Hoskote examines this idea of dwelling and home in the first of the two-part series at the Galerie Mirchandani + Steinrueckes 10th anniversary show, which brings together works by 12 artists.Hoskote took The Hindu on a curatorial walk through the exhibition to talk about the different concerns the 12 artists have engaged with in their works.As a curator, he says, I draw something that works from the practices of the artist. I saw this idea of dwelling, location and belonging in the works of these artists, and thought its a good place to start.We begin the walk with Anita Dubes famous work I 32 Tara, a set of intimate photographs of objects from her home, when she had just moved in years ago.The objects speak to Anita about a sense of belonging in this house in a complex in Delhi designed by Charles Correa. It talks about what defines your personal space, says Hoskote. Alongside the older works are a set of newer photographs from her process of leaving the house. These map the art of her life of dwelling literally.Next to Dubes work is Aji V.N.s untitled work, an image of his home amidst Keralas green landscape. For me, this work is how one deals with nature as a subject. Its amazing how domesticity is set into nature and is not in a classic confrontation as a modernist, in a sense of rupture with the nature, says the curator.Atul Dodiyas triptych Koodal pays homage to the late master Tyeb Mehtas experimental film by the same name. Koodal in Tamil means confluence, coming together. Dodiya relays crucial images from Mehtas film, including a eunuchs made-up eye and the bullet marks left by Gandhis assassin. It ties together with a meditation on the nation and whether it is a hospitable or an inhospitable space for its citizens now.Another provocative work is that by young artist Varunika Saraf, The cries, too, fall like rain in summer. The title comes from German poet Bertolt Brechts poem When Evil-Doing Comes Like Falling Rain, which speaks of the horrors that a tyrannical regime can impose on its citizens. At the centre of the work is Edvard Munchs famous painting The Scream, surrounded by images and titles of all the tragedies that have unfolded in India since 1947.Hoskote says, Her work is like a representation of Shah Jahans Mughal paintings, where the emperor would be in the centre and portrayal of different instances in the kingdom around it. Here, she develops an architecture of contemporary politics, talking of the destruction of Babri Masjid, the Turkman Gate tragedy among others.According to Saraf, Ranjit asked me what does it mean to be dwelling. Its not just about buildings, we must learn how to dwell and only then building is possible. Only then can we think about co-existing.Saraf decided to draw Indias trajectory of political disasters and violence from 1947: When something goes wrong in the nation, it doesnt just happen. It has some antecedence, and hence I decided to build this from Independence, a key moment for all us Indians until now. The Scream as the central image of the detailed work encapsulates the strife that contemporary India is currently experiencing, Saraf says.Moving from the macro to the micro, artist Sosa Joseph imagines a community as a carnival, a procession. In his work What Must Be Said, he also highlights how different kinds of self-performances are played out within the community. He talks about how you craft a sense of collective from differences, says Hoskote.Young artist Siji Krishnan, in her work Portrait of a Hut, partially reveals the mysterious inner lives of her rural protagonists. In Kerala, where I come from, she says, we store rice in this long hut. This portrait and the figures  the mother and father  are all created from memory of living in Kochi. Hoskote was intrigued by how an architectural element is treated as a subject of portraiture in the work. This series of self-portraits makes you think how to craft a portrait of an inanimate [object], he says.Closer home is artist Sudarshan Shettys video work of an old sanatorium in Ghatkopar. Over the years, it was transformed into a chawl, and is now going to be demolished. The work is about precariousness of habitation and also how somehow the space also portrays poetry and music even in difficult circumstances, says Hoskote.The other participating artists include C.K.Rajan, Gieve Patel, N.S. Harsha, Nicola Durvasula and Tanya Goel. Part two of the series will showcase works from 12 more artists.The author is a freelance journalistDwellingis on at Galerie Mirchandani + Steinruecke till January 11, 2017"

Terming Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaacs visit to district treasuries over the past two days as a road show, Mr. Chennithala said he should immediately end his road show and focus on giving relief to people. The government should immediately call an all-party meeting and come up with a disaster management plan, he said.While Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh had moved the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as early as November 20 and got it to make sufficient quantum of funds available to them to tide over the crisis, the Kerala government could not even foresee the magnitude of the crisis that awaited the State on salary day. When the issue figured in the Assembly, the Finance Minister had assured the House that there would be no disruption in payment of salaries and pensions. However, when the salary day came, the situation went totally out of control. He should at least now take steps to provide relief to people, he added.Mr. Chennithala also criticised the government for what he termed the complete breakdown in the distribution of ration articles in the State. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew currency notes, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had withdrawn ration rice.The government could not ensure availability of rice for distribution during December. Although he had drawn the attention of the Chief Minister and the Food Minister to this, there was no response from them.He said the Opposition would chalk out its plan of action against all this at a UDF high-power committee meeting in Kochi on Monday."

Many banks and ATMs are not dispensing enough small value notes in villages.The crop which was ready for harvesting turned yellow. Without thinking about the requirements of the agrarian sector during harvesting season, the government is talking about Rabi crop. How can we invest for the next crop when there is no cash in our hands, said a farmer M. Trimurthulu of Kaikalur mandal.During every Kharif season, we panic due to depressions and cyclones. But this year a super cyclone that came on November 8 in the form of cancellation of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes and shattered our hopes, he added.Labourers have no work and are starving. With the Centres decision we are suffering a lot, said Trimurthulu, who raised paddy in four acres.Agriculture labourers are facing untold hardship. Crop is ready for harvesting, water is ready for the next crop but there is no work for us. Due to shortage of Rs.100, Rs.50, Rs.20 and Rs.10 notes, farmers are not engaging labour for work. Many labourers are migrating to cities to feed their families, said another agriculture labourer B. Papa Rao of Razole.Normally we engage about 10 labourers for harvesting one acre. For men we have to pay Rs. 400 per head per day and women Rs. 350. We have to pay for breakfast and snacks for the labourers. But we are finding it difficult to arrange small denomination notes, said a paddy farmer Yatam Yedukondalu of Narsapuram in West Godavari district.Save farmersRyots are unable to get small notes for harvesting, grading the produce, weighing paddy bags, transporting it to the mill and for unloading. For one acre we have to spend Rs. 5000 to Rs. 7000, said Mutyam Mahalakshmi, a farmer.Paddy crop came for harvest in Amalapuram, Ravulapalem, Kalidindi, Bhimavaram, Palakol, Mudinepalli, Gudivada, Kothapeta, Akiveedu, Kankipadu and other mandals in East and West Godavari and Krishna districts this year, and the produce was good. As usual farmers have big plans on Kharif yield and Rabi sowing. But the sudden decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the big notes dashed our hopes, said another farmer B. Yesu Babu of Gudivada.Due to shortage of small notes, rice mill owners are procuring the stocks but are not giving money immediately. The Government should take measures for rotation of cash and rescue the farmers, said a farmer D. Venkat Rao."

As many as 139 taluks in the State have been declared drought-hit due to the failure of monsoon causing huge crop loss. The severe drought has also extended to rabi due to failure of post-monsoon rain. We have instructed the officials of the Agriculture Department to submit the crop position. After that, survey would be carried out to assess the extent of loss of crops and submit a detailed report along with a memorandum to the Union government seeking financial assistance, he said.Mr. Krishna Byre Gowda was here to participate in the demonstration of Drill Sown Rice (DSR) and mechanised bailing of paddy fodder at Charakunta village in Ballari taluk on Tuesday.He said that the State government has submitted a memorandum to the Union government seeking financial assistance of Rs. 4,702 crore to compensate the loss of crop during this years kharif season and the Union government was yet to take a decision and release the required funds.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi very soon to prevail upon him to release funds. Once we get the funds, steps would be taken to transfer them directly to farmers, he added.To a question, the Minister said that the proposal to set up paddy procurement centres and also announce minimum support price would be decided by the Cabinet sub-committee. Admitting that demonetisation of currency had severely affected trading in APMC yard by 40 per cent besides bringing down the price of agricultural produces, he said that the government was committed to establishing procurement centres and make the payment through bank transfers."

PeriasamyM_PERIASAMYCome Monday, the Coimbatore Corporation will turn its attention towards the Thudiyalur weekly market to stop the use of plastic bags.The civic body was supposed to have taken up the work on December 5 but due to the sudden turn of events in the State, the civic body would start the work on December 12. It had displayed notices warning traders and customers and also held meetings with the former in this regard a couple of weeks ago. Therefore, the move would not catch the two by surprise, said sources.The reason the civic body focussed on the weekly market was that the volume of plastic bags that changed hands was quite high. The estimate was over 50,000 but this was only a conservative figure. Sometimes, it could be as high as over a lakh bags, they said.S. Suresh, who collects cess from traders at the market, said the number of traders could vary from 1,000 to nearly 2,000. Assuming that each trader sold goods to 50 to 100 customers, they would have used 50,000 to a lakh bags.The traders, who begin business around 11 a.m. and wind up by 10 p.m., sell vegetables, greens, groceries, snacks, footwear, farm implements and clothes. But most sell vegetables and they use plastic bags, he added.By focussing on the weekly market, the Corporation would be able to bring around a significant change, for it would be able to work with a number of traders and customers at a venue. Plus, when the traders move to other weekly markets, there would be changes there too, however small, the sources said.What the Corporation was attempting to do was welcome but it should go beyond initiating penal action against traders packing goods in plastic bags. It should provide an alternative and that should be a workable alternative, said K. Senthilkumar, who sold puffed rice.How could I sell puffed rice in paper bags or cloth bags. Will it remain crisp and moisture-free, he asked and suggested that there should be reasonable exceptions.Vegetable vendor V. Rangaraj said that selling vegetables without plastic bags was not difficult but customers, especially while buying tomatoes, insisted that the traders provided plastic bags.To bring about a total change, the Corporation should also penalise customers, he suggested.Former Councillor of the area V. Vathsala said that Corporations drive to ban use of plastic bags in the market on Mondays needed to be welcomed. But the civic body should do more for the market.The traders and buyers did not have public convenience facility.The vendors resorted to open urination and defecation and that too not far from where they sold goods. To improve the hygiene, the Corporation should build toilets and also platforms for them to sell their goods.Plus, the Corporation should strengthen the conservancy work there, especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays because after the traders vacated the market, cattle went there to feed on vegetable waste and their dung added to the sanitation problem.She had raised the issue several times. A comprehensive solution would be in order, Ms. Vathsala added."

File Photo: G. P. Sampath KumarA rice variety that packs more protein to match wheat has been released by Karnatakas University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru.The rice strain, which offers an option to those who are not comfortable switching over to wheat for supplementary protein, is now available for commercial cultivation.The high-protein variety has been under development at UAS-B for nearly 10 years, with Rs. 92 lakh in funding from the Union Department of Biotechnology.Shailaja Hittalmani, who headed the research team that worked on it, told The Hindu that the strain has 12 to 13 per cent protein content, which is higher than the 6 to 7.5 per cent in normal rice. Wheat has about 14 per cent of protein.Using conventional breeding, researchers raised the amount of lysine, an amino acid that helps synthesize proteins, by about 20 per cent among other benefits.The higher protein leads to a decrease in starch, benefiting diabetics, Dr. Hittalmani, who heads the Genetics and Plant Breeding Department of the University, said.Moreover, the rice protein is easier to digest compared to what comes from non-vegetarian sources. It is particularly good for children and the elderly, she says.For the farmer, the new entrant is a lucrative option that can be grown like any other cereal, without extra costs. The health benefits of a stronger rice, however, are not widely known and there is a need to create awareness.The same research team has also released high-zinc and high-iron types, which have double the normal level of the two elements.The high zinc variant has about 50 parts per million of the element, nearly double that of normal rice, and Dr. Shylaja says this rice helps strengthen the bodys immune system.Second varietySimilarly, the second variety developed has 50 ppm level of iron which is, again, double the quantum in normal rice. This rice is particularly good for children, pregnant women and those with low haemoglobin levels.Rice is Indias dominant cereal, with a clear lead over wheat and coarse grains.Those interested in commercial cultivation of the above three varieties of rice may contact Dr. Shylaja on 080-23624967 during working hours."

Initially, he cultivated the rare variety on one cent of land and gradually expanded it to one hectare.He harvested around 1,100 kg of Krishna Kamod paddy from one acre of land this season, despite the district experiencing a drought-like situation.Model farmThe Krishi Bhavan in Nenmeni grama panchayat had selected his paddy field as a demonstration plot last season to promote the rice variety.

FILE PhotoS: B. Jothi Ramalingam, Ramya Kannan, V. GanesanEven years after her rescue from a brick kiln at Red Hills in Tiruvallur district, K. Ranjanis voice trembles when she recalls the violence she and her husband faced in the chamber. Her familys determination to pay back the advance it had taken from the owner for her fathers treatment looked meaningless, as her family was toiling in the chamber deprived of even a few hours of sleep and rest.I am ashamed to tell you the kind of words they used to call me since I left the kiln to go to a hospital in my native as I was unwell. My husband was bleeding when I went back. They had asked him where I was. They didnt even understand if I had wanted to run away, we as a family would have run away, says Ranjani (name changed), who still struggles with the memory of that humiliation.Hers is among the several families who were rescued from bondage from a chamber in Tiruvallur district few months ago. A native of Kavanaiathur in Tiruvannamalai district Ranjani says no one else must suffer her fate. It was in 2012 that she was rescued, nearly four years after she and her family came to the kiln and the nightmare began. Post rescue, she was among some families that benefitted from a rehabilitation programme run by an NGO.But, just like Ranjani, who came to the kiln in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November-December) in 2008, on receiving the advance, several hundred labourers from neighbouring districts and Odisha would be arriving in Tiruvallur, oblivious to the inhuman living and working conditions they would be put through to in some of these chambers.Located adjacent to Chennai, Tiruvallur district is well-connected with the State capital, where the real estate industry is growing substantially. The texture of clay conducive to making bricks, found across Tiruvallur district is a major factor which is considered favourable for the industry.There are two types of kilns: Choolais, the small-time kilns, where the bricks are baked in the open and there are chambers, which are closed facilities with tall chimneys to bake the bricks. The bricks from choolais are often for the local market and for huts and small houses, whereas the bricks baked in chambers are better in quality and shape and are needed in major construction companies, explains a source. Approximately, there are 350-400 chambers spread across five blocks of the district with each of the blocks having anywhere between 80-90 chambers. Bondage is noticed mostly in chambers, where the work chart is target-oriented and make several lakh bricks every season.A researcher from an NGO, who is working with bonded labourers in Tiruvallur, says while labourers were also kept in bondage in rice mills and charcoal units in the area, it was these brick kilns which employed them in large numbers.Modus operandiIn Ranjanis case, the owner of the chamber arrived in a car in her village near Vandavasi with suitcases full of money to lure poverty-stricken families into accepting his advance.In the case of migrant labourers from Odisha from where several hundred labourers arrive every season, brick kiln owners visit Kantabanjhi, a small town in western Odisha and meet middle-men (also called agents or brokers) during October and November, an informed source says.There are specific hotels in this town, which are occupied all through these two months by owners from Tiruvallur for arriving at a best bargain with agents. Based on the agreements they sign with individual families, who take advance amounts usually for the big expense either for a family function like marriages, birth or a death in the family and they arrive in these brick kilns in December, the source says.Though the middle-men are constantly in touch with them, the owners of brick chambers in Tiruvallur blame the middle-men, when law enforcing agencies conduct a raid and find cases of bondage due to debt. Not all owners keep labourers in bondage but some. They say the middle-men took the advance from them and cheated both the labourers and them, which is a white lie.When contacted, V. Sampath, office-bearer of Tiruvallur District Brick Manufacturers Association says: We are giving these labourers jobs, which they cannot get in their native places. These NGOs are making false allegations and these labourers are falling for it only because they can escape the debt and get Rs. 20,000 as relief amount.If they are in bondage, why do they keep coming back every year? Just because some owners are making some mistakes, you cannot blame all of us, he says.Chances of getting outFor some of these labourers, who end up in bondage, their chances of coming out of the facility depends mostly on their luck when and if they are able contact the local RDO or any NGO in the district for help.No, we regularly do conduct raids based on inputs and we release them. We issue them the release certificate after an enquiry to check it is a case of bonded labour. They are entitled to Rs. 20,000 as per norms and are given Rs. 1,000 the very day of their release, says Tiruvallur Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) S. Jayachandran.But there have been instances in the past when intelligence offered to officials by NGOs have been leaked to the chamber owner. An activist claims few years ago, her input about 200 labourers in bondage was leaked and within half an hour, they couldnt be located when a raid was conducted.Caught in betweenThe primary concern which arises when looked into the role of government agencies action is the three different departments are dealing with the issue and none of them have full control.While the responsibility of monitoring the issue of bonded-labourer is presently with the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, officials from the Revenue Department  RDOs, are the field-level officers conducting raids on kilns. There is also a proposal to transfer the responsibility to the Labour Department.According to P. Annamalai, Secretary of Adi Dravida and Tribal Welfare Department of Tamil Nadu government, the responsibility is to be transferred to the Labour Welfare Department any minute now. When asked about his Departments role in rescuing bonded-labourers, he said RDOs have been trained well to manage the issue.The proposal to shift the responsibility between departments was based on the Union governments suggestion that the department dealing with child labour issue should handle bonded-labourers issue. Since most of the victims of bondage in labour were from Irular community, the responsibility was initially allocated to the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare department, an officer explains.Legal pointA major hurdle in dealing with cases registered against offenders and the delay in the trial and the eventual conviction is the non-application of Section 21 of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 in Tamil Nadu, which was struck down by the Madras High Court in June 2014, while hearing a plea. With this order, the powers vested with the RDOs to try offenders under the Act and award punishment to them have been taken away.An officer, who had tried offenders under this Section, before it was struck down says, Earlier, we were able to try the offenders and punish them without any delay. But, because of the High Court decision, now only a Judicial Magistrate can try these cases. It also means the poor victims, who were already at the receiving end, have to fight cases against the kiln owners by hiring an advocate in a court of law.Tracking the releasedAmidst reports that hundreds of labourers have been released every year, there are also questions as to what happens to them. Government sources allege, in some cases, these labourers, despite having been rescued, make their way back to these kilns with the hope of being rescued again.I myself caught a case, where a labourer was rescued three months earlier and he was found again. When confronted, he confessed an NGO had convinced him to come back so that the relief assistance could be shared between them. They didnt know the district administration used to maintain records, claimed an officer.But when drawn its attention to this aspect, members of an NGO pointed to the absence of a comprehensive list of labourers who were rescued. If the government had a directory of labourers, there is no question of NGOs faking labourers. Officials claim to have lists but when asked, they are not able to produce these lists.PreventionTiruvallur RDO Jayachandran says he has been calling for meetings with the owners of brick chambers and members of the bonded labour awareness committees regularly to prevent such cases in the future.But what is needed in the long term is the determination to address issues like poverty in the source districts so that these labourers wont fall for the promises of the agents and middle-men, says Siddamma, founder of Sarpam Irular Thozhilalar Sangam .She also says whenever labourers come for work into these chambers, they should to be registered and if they do not have any documents like Aadhar cards, bank accounts, they should be helped to open them.Determination to address issues such as poverty is needed- SiddammaFounder, Sarpam Irular Thozhilalar Sangam"

Two among the victims were women. They had all been keenly updating themselves about the late leaders health and had taken part in prayers for her speedy recovery.The death on Monday of Raj (38), a labourer of Manickampalayam, due to heart attack, was followed by deaths of MGR Dasan alias Chidambaram (48) of Krishnampalayam in Karunkalpalayam limits, and Chinnasamy (60) of Pettai Periampalayam near Nasiyanur, under similar circumstances. All the three persons were active party workers. Raj and Chidambaram were ward-level functionaries and Chinnasamy also had been devoting substantial time for party work, according to local sources.Kathirvel (47), a rice trader who had died in sleep the day after the demise of party leader Jayalalithaa, was the partys Ezhumathur Panchayat unit Secretary and had conducted several pujas for her recovery.Subsequently, Anandakumar (30) of Piliampalayam, an ice-vendor and active party worker, swooned and died while watching the last rites for Jayalalithaa. He died on way to hospital.Palaniammal (68) of Andikadu near Athani, who had reportedly fainted and died after hearing the announcement of party leaders death was also a local-level functionary.Devaraj (62) a casual labourer of Iluppili near Bhavani, again an active party worker, died while watching the funeral procession, and Selvaraj, a mill worker also of Bhavani lost consciousness after falling in front of the portrait of the late CM and died soon thereafter on Wednesday.The second woman to die of shock was Kandayi (61) of Kuthampoondi near Appakudal, an old-age pensioner and long-time supporter of AIADMK."

The Senator linked the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria to Mr. Putin. Whats really egregious is now the precision strikes that Russian aircraft are dropping  precision weapons on hospitals in Aleppo. There is no depth that these people wont plummet.Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought closer cooperation with Russia and Mr. Putin to deal with the situation in Syria in particular and Islamism in general, an approach that the Obama administration tried to some extent with minimal results.The Trump transition team sent out a series of emails following the announcement on Mr. Tillerson, quoting Republican veterans in support of the choice. Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III described Mr. Tillerson as an excellent choice to head the State Department. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said the selection was another example of recruiting people of extraordinary skill and accomplishment by Mr. Trump. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush called Mr. Tillerson a patriot who will represent the interests of United States really, really well.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel and House Speaker Paul Ryan have rallied behind the nominee, emboldening Mr. Trump. The appointment requires confirmation by the Senate. Republicans have 52 members in the 100-member upper chamber of the U.S. Congress. Besides Mr. McCain, at least two more Republican Senators appear to be holding out  Marco Rubio of Florida who said he had serious concerns, and James Lankford of Oklahoma whose spokesperson said he was unsure of voting for Mr. Tillerson.Links with MoscowDemocratic Senators will raise concerns related to Mr. Tillersons links with Russia and also on his views on climate change and economic sanctions. Mr. Tillerson has accepted that climate change is caused by human action, but ExxonMobils business planning under his leadership accounted for continuing fossil fuel exploration for at least 40 years more. He has also been critical of economic sanctions as a tool of strategic policy.But the huge leverage Mr. Tillerson has built over politicians on both sides could come handy. The support that he received from former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice demonstrates his influence.

Ms. Bindu takes over the post from Kodikunnil Suresh, MP.Inaugurating the function in this connection, the KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran said that Ms. Bindus appointment to the post by the AICC was in recognition of her longstanding valuable contributions to the party. He said that she takes charge at a time when the security of women across the State and the country was facing serious challenges.Mr. Sudheeran said that after the Left Democratic Front had come to power, atrocities against women and children was on the rise.The latest in this connection is the incident at Kuttiyadi. Instead of providing succour to the victims and taking effective measures to ensure the security of women and children, the LDF government clearly appears to be travelling with the hounds, he said.The KPCC president said that through the demonetisation move, the Narendra Modi government has pushed the nation into an unprecedented crisis. Though Mr. Modi claims that curtains will come down on the crisis by December 30, the situation created through the demonetisation gives rise to fears that crisis will prolong into August.The Modi and LDF governments together are destroying the public distribution system. The foodgrain quota of people through ration shops has been slashed. In protest against this the Congress will be organising dharnas in front of ration shops across the State from December 21 to 23. The decision is to hold a dharna in front of one ration shop in each mandalam, he said.He said that the LDF which made tall promises during the campaign period of the last Assembly elections has already belied the expectations of the cashew, farm and plantation workers.Weakest government: ChennithalaOur Special Correspondent writes from Alappuzha:The present Kerala government led by Pinarayi Vijayan was the weakest ever ruling the State, said Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala.He was addressing Congress party activists who gathered at the party office building in Alappuzha to felicitate M.Liju, the new District Congress Committee president, who assumed charge on Sunday.Mr.Ramesh said the State government had not been accountable to the people. The quantity of rice for distribution among ration card-holders had been reduced, resulting in poverty. The price of rice in the market had gone up by Rs.10.The government was planning to give the November quota of rice to ration card holders in December, exposing the meaninglessness of the exercise. LDF government which had promised to set everything alright, was unable to pay the salaries of KSRTC employees, he said.Mr.Chennnithala said Keralites were going through harrowing times due to the misrule of Modi government at the Centre and the Pinarayi government in the State. Demonetization brought in by the Modi government was a national disaster. The currency crisis was not expected to end even after six months, he said.The new DCC presidents were chosen by the high command on the basis of ability.He hoped that the youthful leadership in various districts would usher in fresh enthusiasm among the cadres.The former DCC president A.A.Shukkoor thanked party workers for the support extended to him.

The idea of a cashless society that is barely prepared for this scenario was once again painfully obvious as most communication lines, and power went off .Most ATMs were down, POS machines stopped working and with no power/battery people could not even make Paytm payments. Many Chennaities struggled to purchase milk and other essentials.G Amudha, a housewife went to buy rice and vegetables at a super market in Kodambakkam, but when she reached the counter to pay the bill through her card, the salesgirl told her, Only cash, madam.

Like Amudha, many housewives struggled on Monday.At the Chennai airport, hundreds of passengers were stranded not knowing when their flights would take off. When passengers went to buy food at the counters they were told that only cash would be accepted. One of the commuters, said, I had money in my card but the sales boy at the stall was specific about receiving cash payment. Many passengers had only card and less cash in hand.Similar was the situation at a bakery on Anna Salai, where cash payment was insisted as their POS machine was down.

Thilothaman told a press conference here on Wednesday that the printing of new ration cards would begin as soon as the final list was ready. The review of the draft list was in the final stage and appeals for inclusion on the list were being vetted by verification committees.The Minister said the distribution of ration rice under the NFSA was expected to be streamlined soon, following the imminent settlement of a strike by Food Corporation of India (FCI) workers. Several rounds of negotiations with trade unions had succeeded in breaking the deadlock that affected the supply of rice from FCI godowns to ration shops in Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kollam, and Ernakulam districts.More than 90 per cent of the ration rice for November had reached ration shops and the process of lifting stocks for December had begun. As many as 154 lakh consumers were entitled to five kg of free rice while 124 lakh consumers would be supplied 2 kg of rice at Rs.2 per kg. The remaining 65 lakh would be entitled to 1 kg of rice and 1 kg of atta, subject to availability.Mr. Thilothaman said the government was considering a proposal to procure surplus stocks of rice directly from the FCI under the open market scheme and distribute it through Supplyco outlets. He said the move was aimed at bringing the price of rice under control.Accusing former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy of making unfounded allegations about the public distribution system in the State, he said the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government had failed to implement the NFSA for three years.He added that the new ration cards would be linked to Aadhaar cards to avoid duplication. Food Secretary Mini Antony said the entire ration distribution network would be computerised to prevent pilferage and diversion of stocks. Vehicles transporting ration rice would be equipped with microchips from next April to enable them to be tracked.A pilot project to install Point of Sale machines at ration shops to monitor the distribution of rice would be launched in Kollam next March. The project would be extended to all ration shops by April."

58e52a437be9e05a951f4ea0,Early start for ties with post-Castro Cuba,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161127/jsp/nation/story_121582.jsp,2016-11-27,"New Delhi, Nov. 26: India has quietly worked on ties with a ""post-Castro"" Cuba for over three years now, through plans drawn up during the Manmohan Singh government's tenure that involve cultivating personal ties with the man expected to step into power in Havana in 2018. Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death on Friday night triggered a wave of condolence messages here, including from President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. But cutting across Congress and BJP-led governments in New Delhi, India has since 2013 also focused significant diplomatic energy on Cuba's First Vice-President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, senior officials confirmed to The Telegraph. Castro's brother Raul, the country's President since 2006 when Castro was first forced to opt out of office because of failing health, has made it clear he will not continue in office beyond February 24, 2018, when his current term ends. Raul, 85, has also made clear that Diaz-Canel, 56, is his pick to replace him as Cuba's first ""non-Castro"" leader when he steps down two years from now. The UPA government in 2013 coaxed Diaz-Canel to invite Vice-President Hamid Ansari, who visited Cuba in October that year. In March 2015, the NDA government hosted Diaz-Canel, who met not only Ansari - officially, his host - but also Modi and foreign minister Sushma Swaraj. ""The Prime Minister recalled the close and multi-faceted relations between the two countries that have been developed during the tenure of President Fidel Castro and nurtured by the successive generation of leadership,"" Modi's office said in a statement after their meeting. ""Prime Minister expressed support for greater cooperation, including in the areas of trade and investment, health, biotechnology, renewable energy, sports and human resource development between the two countries."" For decades, India had relied on the personal goodwill and understanding of Castro for its relationship with Cuba - important because of the way the tiny Caribbean country had come to epitomise the sovereignty of developing nations. That goodwill, captured in the famous photograph of Castro embracing a reluctant Indira Gandhi when she, as Prime Minister, was hosting the Non-Aligned Movement summit in 1983, was also reciprocated by India. In 1992, when Cuba was struggling economically after the collapse of its biggest benefactor, the Soviet Union, political parties across the board in India lobbied, collected and donated 10,000 tonnes of rice and 10,000 tonnes of wheat. Castro received the shipments himself, and famously called the grain the ""bread of India"" - because the wheat would effectively amount to a loaf of bread for each Cuban family. ""Fidel Castro was one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century,"" Modi said today. ""India mourns the loss of a great friend."" But as Castro's health began to fail, and with the growing age of Raul, India began preparing for ties with the next generation of Cuban leaders too, officials said. Raul, in the televised address in which he announced 90-year-old Castro's death last night, had declared that the funeral for his brother would be held on Saturday. If Cuba does hold a later memorial for world leaders to pay homage to Castro, Ansari would again be New Delhi's top choice, Indian officials said. The only challenge, they pointed out, may arise in the form of the Vice-President's role as chairman of the Rajya Sabha - Parliament is scheduled to run till December 16. Ansari had met Castro during his October 2013 visit - one of the last few times the Cuban leader met any visiting dignitary - and, as a former diplomat, enjoys wide respect especially in the developing world. Equally though, officials said, it would give Ansari another chance to meet his counterpart - Diaz-Canel. The importance India gave to Ansari's 2013 visit to Cuba was visible in New Delhi's plans to donate buses to the socialist country, which has a rumbling public transport system. Those plans were blocked because of the vagaries of US sanctions on Cuba that prevented Indian companies like the Tatas from transferring buses that had American components. The Modi government has revived the plan to donate buses - 25 to start with - to Cuba. Diaz-Canel, the first person born after the 1959 Cuban Revolution to hold the post of First Vice-President, served as a minister for higher education under Raul till he was elevated to the country's second-most powerful slot."
58e52a4c7be9e05a951f4eaa,Uniform food labels in pipeline,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161220/jsp/nation/story_125762.jsp,2016-12-20,"New Delhi, Dec. 19: India's food safety regulator is set to revise rules for nutrition labels to make it mandatory for manufacturers to display salt, sugar and fat, among other contents, on all packaged foods, amid concerns about misleading or selective labelling. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is preparing a draft of new rules to ensure uniform display of levels of sodium (salt), sugar, fats, including cholesterol and transfat, in all packaged and processed food, FSSAI chief executive officer Pawan Agarwal said. ""Some companies are already printing nutrition information on labels, some don't - we want everyone to do this,"" Agarwal told The Telegraph, on the sidelines of a food labelling conference organised by the New Delhi-based non-government Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Friday. Nutrition experts are hoping the proposed revisions will address gaps in existing rules that they say make current labels inconsistent across products and manufacturers. While many existing labels display absolute values of food constituents, they do not specify recommended daily allowances (RDA) or cut-offs. ""The absolute levels of salt, sugar or fats in a packaged food or beverage will carry no meaning for most consumers unless they're also told how much they can safely consume in a day,"" said Rekha Harish, professor of paediatrics at the Government Medical College, Jammu, and former national convener of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics task force on prevention of childhood obesity. However, existing rules do not require companies to disclose levels of nutrients in relation to RDAs. Harish and others say most consumers will need this information to make informed choices. The cut-off for the daily sodium intake, for example, is 2,000mg, or 5gm salt. The CSE, in a report released at the conference, has pointed out that a single packet of ""masala oats"" contains 30 per cent of the RDA of salt. The FSSAI is consulting with scientific experts on the issue of making RDAs mandatory on nutrition labels, Agarwal said, but added that the issue is complicated because the values of RDAs for some constituents may vary for people across different age groups. ""We are aware of these concerns, we're looking into them,"" Agarwal said. ""But the process of revising and notifying rules is a long process."" The FSSAI is hoping to finalise the draft rules in about a month after which they will be sent to the Union health ministry for approval, notification and responses from the public, including the food industry. The CSE has been urging the FSSAI to strengthen rules also to address selective disclosure, misleading labels and celebrity endorsements of ""junk food"" which it says is a popular term for food with high fat, salt, or sugar. It has pointed out that not all snacks are consistently labelled for sodium or salt. For example, one manufacturer displays sodium content on its sweet variety of oats, but does not display sodium content in its spicy variety of oats. ""People need to know it right to choose right, and the food industry must tell it right,"" Sunita Narain, the director general of the CSE told the conference. The Advertising Standards Council of India, an industry watchdog, has over the past three years pointed out several misleading claims by manufacturers involving products ranging from rice bran oil and canola oil to health drinks for children and digestive biscuits. The CSE has also called for regulation of celebrity endorsement of foods high in salt, sugar, or fat, pointing out that an expert panel on the Consumer Protection Act 2015, to replace existing law, has recommended measures to tackle misleading advertisements and fix liability on celebrities."

Telegraph picture Ranchi, Dec. 1: The state government has initiated the process to procure paddy from farmers through a computerised system besides announcing minimum support price for the crop. State food minister Saryu Roy said this after formally launching e-uparjan, a software facilitating the new system, at Project Bhavan this afternoon. ""Procurement of paddy formally begins today and will continue till March 31, 2017. The minimum support price of ordinary paddy will be Rs 1,470 per quintal while that for grade A paddy will be Rs 1,510 per quintal. Farmers will be also offered a bonus of Rs 130 per quintal,"" he added. The government has received applications from 50,000 farmers willing to sell their paddy. They will get SMSes, generated by the new software, directing them to sell paddy at procurement centres on particular dates. As many as 320 such centres have been set up in the state. ""Fifty nine rice mills have also been registered that will process the procured paddy and supply ushna (parboiled) rice. Barring Ramgarh district, the paddy will be procured by Food Corporation of India (FCI) and two other agencies affiliated to it. The processed rice will be sent to the state food corporation for distribution through PDS,"" Roy explained. A new system has been introduced for Ramgarh on a pilot basis, where procurement will be done by the state food corporation. ""The procurement process will be cashless. Prices of paddy will be paid to the farmers within 72 hours through direct benefit transfer. Four farmers have already received SMSes,"" said food secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey.<>The procurement target for paddy during the current kharif marketing session (2016-17) has been fixed at 4 lakh metric tonnes, the secretary further informed. ""It's a small part of the requirement and the rice processed from procured paddy will help supply through PDS for about two months only,"" Choubey said. Jharkhand is a rice-deficient state that is dependent on supply from neighbouring states."
58e52b877be9e05a951f4fcf,Lessons in life from two teachers,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161128/jsp/calcutta/story_121722.jsp,2016-11-28,"A bunch of children, who have made Sealdah station their home, sit huddled on a dhurrie spread out on a platform as a young priest teaches them. A train rolls in and passengers stop amid the rush at the strange sight. The teacher waits patiently for the train to leave and the noise to die down before carrying on. That was nearly five decades ago, soon after Brother Brendan MacCarthaigh had arrived in Calcutta from Dublin. Since then, the Irish priest, now 78, has touched the lives of thousands of students on railway platforms, at street corners and in high schools. He has authored books on teenagers, method of teaching, value education and devised a methodology called SERVE (Students' Empowerment, Rights & Vision through Education) to help students explore and learn without being stifled. MacCarthaigh was inducted into The Telegraph Education Foundation Hall of Fame at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence 2016, presented by IIHM, on Saturday. ""This award is a vindication of all that SERVE is doing,"" he said at the awards ceremony. Calcutta has been ""an enjoyable challenge"" for MacCarthaigh, ""never the same, one day after another"". And, today, when he gets off a plane in the city, a voice within whispers ""home at last"". MacCarthaigh first landed in the city from Dublin in 1960, sent by the Christian Brothers headquarters. The first of his many projects in Calcutta was in association with CINI Asha, where he would teach children on the Sealdah platform. ""Passengers would tumble out of the carriages and gather around to see a strange sight of children spread out on a dhurrie. I waited for the train to go away and the noise to subside,"" he remembered. ""It has remained much the same, in many classrooms you still have to wait for the blaring of horns to stop."" The railways later gave MacCarthaigh and his students a place on their premises. It was during his stint as a teacher at St. Joseph's, Bowbazar, that someone drew MacCarthaigh's attention to the children on the streets. ""I would finish my work around 2.30pm and did not have much to do till 7.30 the next morning, when school would start again. There were a lot of kids around who needed education. I got together a few adults and high school kids and started teaching at street corners."" Winners of IIHM presents The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence 2016 at Science City auditorium on Saturday. This time the winners received potted plants instead of trophies n keeping with the Go Green theme. Picture by B. Halder The initiative, however, had to be abandoned midway as local residents started creating trouble. Shifting the class to the St. George's School compound did not work because the little ones had to cross two busy thoroughfares. MacCarthaigh soon graduated from teaching children to building concepts and ideas. The SERVE system of education was born in 1996 out of the ingenuity of a person who was ""never practical but had good ideas"". Egging him on were past pupils Rajesh Arora and Abbas Bengali. ""The fact that the three of us were from three different religions was a way of telling us to keep religion out of our work,"" the priest sai. The three were, in fact, inspired by Alor Pathe, a Bengali dance drama on the life of Edmund Rice, the founder of Christian Brothers. Rice was beatified in 1995 and the Christian Brothers headquarters, which had by then moved to Rome, asked MacCarthaigh to do something special in Calcutta to mark the occasion. ""I was living in Beniapukur then and teaching at CINI Asha. I made contact with Father Saju (then Brother) of St. Xavier's College, who had an MSc degree in Bharatanatyam. I requested him to tell the story of Edmund Rice through dance."" It is MacCarthaigh's students who inspired him to devise SERVE. One evening, a bunch of them dropped in at his apartment in Bowbazar and one of them said, ""When you were teaching us, you told us that the education system would change but it didn't."" That was the ""sweetest music"" to MacCarthaigh's ears. And soon he, along with Arora and Bengali, started SERVE. ""Unlike teacher-centric education, SERVE is child-centric, where students get into teams and teach one another. They understand a topic together and learn cooperation, something not common in Indian classrooms,"" he said. ""In SERVE, teachers don't teach. They come in only when students are stumped. Students aren't bored and teachers not exhausted."" SERVE was adopted by the State Council of Education Research & Training in Delhi for six years but met with resistance in Bengal. MacCarthaigh had approached private schools but despite several heads of institutions being eager, teachers seemed loathe to change. His message: ""Statistics show that education gives children only knowledge, not life. Teachers should help children arrive at life and not just compete and disappear into obscurity."" Calcutta, with its quirks and drawbacks, continues to charm MacCarthaigh. ""As a city, it is not highly organised and it cannot be with a population of 18 million on the floor size of almost my native Dublin (where he travels once in three years). There are too many cars on the streets and processions, too, but people still pull up to let an ambulance pass. That is because this is a gentle city.""# What is your message for Brother Brendan?

58e52bd87be9e05a951f4fec,New govt divisions announced,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161122/jsp/siliguri/story_120541.jsp,2016-11-22,"Calcutta, Nov. 21: The Mamata Banerjee government has decided to create two more divisions taking the number of divisions from three to five apparently for better monitoring of government projects in the districts and better surveillance on the district authorities. Divisions are formed with a few districts and a senior IAS officer monitors development projects in the districts as divisional commissioners as it is tough to monitor development projects in the districts from the district headquarters. So far, there were three divisions - Presidency, Burdwan and Jalpaiguri. Now, two more divisions - Midnapore and Malda - have been set up and the districts have been freshly distributed among the five divisions. ""The state cabinet today approved a proposal to create two more divisions for better monitoring of development work the state government has taken up,"" said Partha Chatterjee, state education minister, after the cabinet meeting in Nabanna this afternoon. Sources in the state administration said the move was initiated after the chief minister realised that some districts were not doing well in terms of development projects. ""It was not possible for the divisional commissioners to monitor all the districts as each of the divisional commissioners was looking after at least eight districts,"" said a senior official. ""The chief minister thinks people had voted her in the Assembly polls only because of her development projects.... But lately, some districts were not being able to cope up with the pace,"" said a source. Over the past one year or so, the state government has started two important projects - giving bicycles to students of Class IX to XII and providing subsidised rice to needy people who could not make it to the Centre's cheap food grain scheme. ""Some district authorities are facing trouble running these schemes smoothly as they were under pressure to run several other schemes such as the 100 days' work plan, housing for poor and drinking water projects. It was impossible to monitor the projects from state level,"" said another official."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Dec. 6: Environment minister Bikram Keshari Arukh said that though all the 11 major rivers in the state, including the Mahanadi, were hit by pollution, their water was still safe for human consumption. ""There has been an increase in the bio-chemical oxygen demand level, total coliform and the most probable number of bacteria - all indicators of pollution. But, they are still within permissible limits,"" said the environment minister in a written reply to a question in the Assembly today. The minister said the water level of these rivers was being tested at 79 places along their course. ""After conventional treatment, the water of these rivers can be used for drinking as well,"" the minister told the Assembly. The minister said: ""According to the Odisha State Pollution Control Board report, the wastewater released in the rivers from towns are mainly responsible for the rise in the pollution level. The Odisha Water Supply and Sewerage Board has taken up a number of measures to treat the pollution in river water."" To treat the water of Daya and Kuakhai rivers, which are a part of the Mahanadi river system, the minister said: ""An integrated sewerage system for the Bhubaneswar city has been taken up, and the city has been divided into various sewerage districts. New sewer lines are being laid with Jica (Japan International Co-operation Agency) funds."" The minister said a number of projects were taken up to treat the Mahanadi river water in Cuttack. ""A 33-million litre per day (MLD) sewerage treatment plant has been completed, commissioned and handed over to the Cuttack Municipal Corporation for operation and maintenance,"" the minister said. Arukh said: ""Under the Odisha Integrated Sanitation Improvement Project with the Jica loan assistance, two sewerage treatment plants to handle the 52MLD plant will be set up. Land acquisition is in progress for septage management under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme."" To treat the water in Puri, the minister said: ""Work is on to set up plant to treat the cooked rice water at the Jagannath temple. Besides, the National Environment Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, has been engaged for wastewater management of the Musa river. A detailed project report is under preparation."" He also said steps were being taken to treat the water of rivers such as Brahmani, Rushikulya, Nagavalli, Kharsuan and Nandira."

Picture by Cameron Petrie New Delhi, Nov. 20: Farmers in the Indus civilisation had independently domesticated rice and grown it as an annual summer crop long before rice from China spawned the crops cultivation across the Gangetic plains, new archaeological excavations have established. These excavations, at three sites in Haryana, provide strong scientific evidence for a longstanding but muchdebated idea that the domestication of rice had occurred independently in China and South Asia, archaeologists involved in the excavations said today. The new research, published today in the journals Antiquity and the Journal of Archaeological Science, also suggests that the Indus people were the first to exploit complex, multicropping strategies, planting crops across both seasons. While earlier excavations had revealed rice grains at Lahuradewa, Uttar Pradesh, dated to about 6000 BC, sections of archaeologists had argued they represented the exploitation of wild rice and not real domestication, which they said began only after rice from China arrived about 2000 BC. Now archaeologists from Indias Banaras Hindu University and the University of Cambridge in the UK have discovered evidence indicating a progressive increase in the proportion of domestic types of rice and a decrease in wild types between 2430 BC and 2140 BC. This would imply rice domestication in India about 400 years earlier than presumed. Weve found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process in ancient South Asia, likely based around the wild species Oryza nivara, Jennifer Bates, an archaeobotanist at Cambridge who specialises in South Asian archaeology, said. The archaeologists examined crop material from two sites Masudpur in Hissar district and Bahola in Karnal districtand found what they say is a pattern of slow development of rice exploitation from wild foraging to farming with full cultivation. Until now, many had argued that the Indus people had not routinely cultivated rice, Ravindra Nath Singh, the team member at BHU, told The Telegraph. Our findings suggest that rice domestication had already occurred in South Asia before the arrival of Oryza japonica (the Chinese variety). The analysis of weed residues from the sites suggests that the Indus civilisation farmers had introduced multicrop farming that is practised even today, growing rice, millets and beans during summer and wheat, barley and pulses in winter. Some of the Indus civilisation sites received both summer and winter rain, which may have encouraged multicropping practices, the scientists said. We found evidence for yearlong farming that predates its appearance in other river valley civilisations, said Cameron Petrie, the third team member. Most contemporary civilisations used either summer or winter crops, he said. Mesopotamia, for instance, grew wheat and barley during winter, while China produced rice and millets during summer. The study, supported by the Archaeological Survey of India and funded by the UKIndia Education Research Initiative and other agencies, has also yielded the first absolute radiocarbon dates for Indus crops 2890 BC to 2630 BC for millets and winter pulses, 2580 BC to 2460 BC for horsegram, and 2430 BC to 2140 BC for rice. Weve had earlier evidence for rice suggesting independent domestication from Lahuradewa and other sites in the Gangetic plains, said Rakesh Tiwari, director general of the ASI, who was not associated with the Cambridge BHU study. The dates ranged from about 6000 BC to about 3000 BC. However, until now, some archaeologists had viewed rice residues from a site called Mahagara in Uttar Pradesh as the earliest evidence of full domestication. Some had attributed the earlier rice residues as exploitation of wild rice. Another archaeologist, Dorian Fuller from the University College, London, had in earlier research papers argued that there was no evidence for rice agriculture until about 2000 BC, by which time the Chinese variety had been brought into India."

All six millets were being grown in the State especially Southern Karnataka, barring coastal areas. They are finger millet, barnyard millet, foxtail millet, kodo millet, proso millet and little millet.After the advent and implementation of Green Revolution in the country, the millets had taken a back seat. Farmers began cultivating rice and wheat as they got more yield and they were more commercial crops also.But the mass cultivation of wheat and paddy had also spoiled the health of the soil and also the health of the people. By consuming these cereals only, we are inviting many diseases, he said.Before the advent of Green Revolution, people had been consuming millets. But now the consumption of millets was less. We should start using these millets, he said.In the coastal belt of the State, only foxtail and proso millets could be grown, that too, only during summer. The millets could not be grown during the rainy season in the coastal belt.The millets took little moisture and grew fast. The millet crop came up in 70 to 120 days. The fodder quality of millet for cattle also was good. The millets are highly nutritious for cattle also, Dr. Bhat said.Shyam Bhat, coordinator, Radio Manipal; M.

58e52ea07be9e05a951f52e8,China aims blow at 'iron rice bowl',http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161219/jsp/foreign/story_125543.jsp,2016-12-19,"Pingdingshan, Dec. 18 (Reuters): China has ordered state firms to smash the decades-old system of providing cradle-to-grave welfare support, known as the country's ""iron rice bowl"". But the order, part of a plan to reduce financial pressure on bloated and heavily indebted state-owned enterprises (SOEs), is likely to be easier said than done as cities navigate the social and financial wrenches the changes will cause. At the heart of soot-covered Pingdingshan in central China is the Pingmei Shenma Group, a state coal conglomerate that dominates the economy, society and air of the heavily polluted city in Henan province. Apart from coal, it has chemicals and construction businesses. But it also has a startling number of other responsibilities. It operates 41 hospitals and 18 schools and provides pensions, subsidised housing for workers, water, heating and power. It even runs a plush retirement home, complete with golf course, for its senior managers. The fate of these facilities, landmarks for the city's residents, is now unclear. If they are not closed down, much of the infrastructure will need to be renovated, which State Council researchers estimate will cost more than 1 trillion yuan ($115 billion) nationwide. Some of Pingdingshan's hospitals already had fewer miners to treat after capacity cuts in coal production. ""We can only try to provide better services,"" a doctor, who only wanted to be identified by his surname Li, said at a small outpatient clinic near Pingmei Shenma's defunct Number Seven coal mine. ""Though this is a big place, we are far away from the city centre, there is no good transportation and it isn't convenient for ordinary people to come,"" Li said. Beijing has given SOEs until 2020 to ditch their ""social functions"". For Pingdingshan, the deadline is more imminent because Henan wants to complete the process by the end of 2017 under a pilot project, putting it in the spotlight not only of Beijing but also other provinces facing similar challenges. While state firms in wealthier regions of the country moved away from paying for social welfare services some years ago, poorer provinces and especially one-company towns like Pingdingshan struggled to make the switch given the central role their SOE played. ""Removing social functions and resolving the problems left behind by history is an important condition for SOEs to become market entities,"" Xiao Yaping, head of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, said on the institution's website. China's SOEs accumulated total debts of 85.3 trillion yuan by the end of September, in a credit splurge encouraged by Beijing following the global financial crisis. Executives have repeatedly called on Beijing to help reduce their costs. China's central government-administered SOEs run around 8,000 units providing community services, and the efforts to ditch them could also increase a firm's redundancy and labour redeployment costs, especially as authorities try to limit unrest in regions already hit by an economic downturn. They spend 850 billion yuan a year on schools, pensions and other ""social functions"". Local government-run firms pay even more, a delegate to China's parliament said in March. In Henan, state firms spend 800 million yuan a year just to supply residents with heating, water and electricity."

The farmers alleged that the traders first offered them an unviable price for their paddy and then offered to raise it somewhat if they accepted the old notes that have been declared invalid on November 8. The enraged farmers, numbering around 250, dumped their paddy in a market as a mark of protest and proceeded to NH512, which links Malda to Balurghat. They blocked the highway for an hour from 11.30am. Siben Sarkar, one of the agitating farmers, said the traders, who buy paddy often at low rates and sell the produce to rice mills, had offered them Rs 930 per quintal in new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. ""They said they would consider increasing the amount to Rs 1,100 if we accepted the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. We'll suffer huge losses if we don't get at least the minimum support price. We have rejected their offer,"" Sarkar said. The Centre has increased the minimum support price of paddy to Rs 1,470 a quintal this year. Many farmers said that last year the traders had paid them Rs 1,300 a quintal. The traders said they had been hobbled by the liquidity crunch this time. ""We don't have sufficient money to buy paddy from the farmers,"" said Raju Saha, a trader. The Bengal government usually starts buying paddy from the farmers from the third week of December. The minimum support price is binding on the agencies through which the state government procures paddy. However, before the government begins the process, local traders (""middlemen"" in common parlance) pick up a part of the produce at low rates. The farmers, who harvest the monsoon crop in November, begin preparations to sow the winter crop with the sales proceeds. Rice mills too have often been accused of forcing the farmers to sell their produce at low rates. Some officials from the Bengal food and supplies department said the traders often cash in on the delay in government procurement but pleaded helplessness in providing immediate relief to the farmers this time because of the cash crunch. ""We are yet to receive a reimbursement of Rs 2,000 crore for last year's paddy procurement. As soon as we get the amount, we will start procurement,"" an official said."

Telegraph picture Kohima, Dec. 14: The situation in Dimapur has not improved since last evening because of a general strike by the Against Corruption and Unabated Taxation (ACAUT) and the Dimapur Urban Council Chairmen Federation against arrest of three ACAUT members. Shops had downed shutters demanding the release of the three ACAUT members unconditionally but police said the trio have been remanded in judicial custody. The strike, however, passed off without any untoward incident. The police arrested Joel Kath, Simon Kelio and Hukiye Yeptho on Sunday for allegedly raiding food and civil supplies department godowns without the consent of the authorities. The ACAUT and Federation said they would organise a public rally tomorrow here to press for the release of the arrested persons. They said the protest would continue till the trio were released. Yesterday, ACAUT started a signature campaign for their release. Today, leaders from several organisations met Dimapur deputy commissioner Kesonyu Yhome and discuss the deteriorating situation in the town in the wake of the arrest. In the past couple of years, ACAUT has been at loggerheads with the state government over several alleged scams in various departments. A source in Dimapur said the scam in food and civil supplies department would amount to multi-crore rupees and that the government was trying to crack down on ACAUT members to deter them from further protest. Sources said chief minister T.R. Zeliang, who holds the civil supplies portfolio, has asked the police to arrest the ACAUT members. According to the ACAUT and the Federation, foodgrain meant to be sold at Rs 3 per kg to the public are being sold in the open market at the rate of Rs 35 per kg. ""We don't get rice, wheat, sugar and other essential commodities from the fair price shops as they are sold in the open market,"" a Dimapur resident said. Several organisations have supported the ACAUT and vowed to support the movement till the corrupt people are brought to justice. The three ACAUT members were arrested based on an FIR lodged at sub-urban police station on Sunday by the proprietor of M/s Lotha Trading Company, R.Z. Lotha, who is a state stockist. In his FIR, Lotha said on Friday, a group of 40 to 70 people raided his godowns at Kevijau and Lomithi and sealed them. ""It may be mentioned that the stocks of public distribution system (PDS) rice in both godowns are meant for people,"" Lotha said. In a counter FIR filed by 13 villages at the same police station against Lotha, they said activities at two godowns were illegal as rice bags were being sold in the open market and to mills. Sources said Lotha has gone into hiding after the FIR was filed against him. ACAUT adviser Khekiye Sema warned of a ""jail bharo"" campaign if its members were not released. The organisation has been banned by the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) on the ground that its activities would have ramification on the current India-Nagaland peace process. It was totally against collection of illegal taxes by Naga outfits."
58e52f8a7be9e05a951f5414,Tea workers block roads demanding wage,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161124/jsp/siliguri/story_120926.jsp,2016-11-24,"Nov. 23: Workers of at least two gardens in the Dooars blocked roads in Jalpaiguri and labourers of an estate in Alipurduar gheraoed the manager demanding wages today. Around 850 workers of Karala Valley Tea Estate, on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri, and their families blocked NH31D at Assam More this morning. They had gheraoed the garden manager in his office demanding immediate payment of wages around 7.30am. Later, they walked to the highway and blocked it. The protest that started around 9.30am continued till 3.30pm and was lifted after administrative officials assured the agitators of intervention. Workers of Batabari garden blocked the Chulsa-Lataguri road for about 10 minutes with the same demand. In Alipurduar, workers of Mujnai Tea Estate demonstrated in front of the garden manager for around four hours demanding wages. Following the demonitisation drive, an arrangement had been worked out to facilitate wage payment in the estates. But on November 21, the Reserve Bank of India said a new process would be introduced leading to further delay in wage disbursal. The Telegraph made an assessment of the situation: Since November 9, planters have not been able to withdraw enough money to pay the workers because of the ceiling imposed on withdrawal. As wages are paid in cash, most estates have missed payment dates. ""There are gardens where wages of two fortnights would fall due in a day or two,"" said a planter in Siliguri. Workers who got their last payment at the end of October or in the first week of this month are living on food grains provided by the state under the National Food Security Scheme and vegetables like cha ful (tea flower) and kochu (wild taro). ""We got wages on October 29. Most of us don't have any cash left. We are having rice and wheat given by the state with fried tea flowers or a curry of kochu,"" Sukri Kishan, a Karala Valley worker, said. ""We are working everyday but not getting wages,"" said worker Kalainti Baraik. Labourers said local shopkeepers and those in the rural markets had stopped giving them items on credit. ""They allowed credit once or twice in the past 10-15 days but now, even they are cash-strapped,"" said a worker. ""If such situation persists, many families will have to struggle to manage even one square meal,"" Rekha Oraon, another worker said. After the demonitisation announcement, it was decided that tea planters could deposit money in the district administration's account. The district magistarte, who can withdraw cash above the ceiling, could then hand over the money to planters for wage payment. But on November 21, the Reserve Bank of India asked planters to contact their banks with details of the workforce and the banks were asked to let planters withdraw cash. It had been stated that a garden could withdraw a maximum of Rs 3,500 per hectare of plantation for a fortnight. It means, if a garden has 100 hectares, it could withdraw Rs 3,50,000. The average fortnightly wage of a worker is around Rs 1,400, which means, the garden can at best, pay 250-odd workers with it. The new directive gave rise to confusion as the administration had to give back the planters' deposits from the DMs' accounts. Second, availability of cash in banks was a problem. Trade unions objected to the new process saying it would deprive many labourers. ""If workers of some gardens get wages, labourers in other estates might start agitating,"" Sanjay Bagchi, the secretary of the Terai Branch of Indian Tea Association, said. The process of sending back money to planters' accounts has started. ""It has been also mentioned by the RBI that payment of wages can be made for two fortnights. After that bank accounts should be opened for each worker,"" an official said. ""Unless wages are paid, it is tough to approach the workers, who are already disgruntled, and ask them to provide documents to open bank accounts.""

(Subhankar Chowdhury) Dec. 19: The head of an animal welfare society has lodged a police complaint against ""persons preventing the feeding of free roaming dogs inside the premises of Presidency University"" since December 2, three days ahead of an NAAC inspection to grade the institute. Complainant Prasenjit Dutta, coordinator of the Pashupati Animal Welfare Society, is the same person who had filed an FIR against vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia in April last year after a pack of stray dogs was rounded up and confined to an enclosure. On Sunday night, two days after the NAAC graded Presidency University ""A"", Dutta alleged that the security supervisor of the campus had been preventing people from entering the campus to feed the dogs. ""All our attempts at communicating with registrar (Debojyoti Konar) and thereafter the vice-chancellor in this regard have fallen on deaf ears and they have not responded to our emails,"" Dutta wrote in his complaint to Jorasanko police station. He accused the guards of not allowing anyone to feed the 18 strays, including a dog named Ghontu who was at the centre of the animal rights storm last year. Ghontu and his friends Foxy, Kalakand and others had been put in an enclosure after he allegedly bit a professor. ""A situation is being created so that they may either starve to death or get dislocated from their habitat for lack of food,"" Dutta said. Although he didn't mention it in his complaint, the animal rights activist said the curbs on feeding the dogs since December 2 had something to do with the NAAC visit. ""Suddenly, restrictions were imposed. Maybe the authorities thought that the spectre of someone feeding the pack of dogs in front of the visiting NAAC team could cause them embarrassment,"" he told Metro . After the April 2015 episode, Dutta's NGO had engaged volunteer Rekha Banerjee in consultation with the authorities to visit the campus regularly and feed the strays cooked items such as rice and meat. The Presidency Dog Lovers' Society bears the cost of the food. Sources said vice-chancellor Lohia was doing the rounds of the campus on December 2 when she spotted the NGO-appointed volunteer feeding the dogs and allegedly objected to it. ""She asked the guards not to let Rekhadi enter the campus. The guards aren't letting us feed the dogs either,"" said a postgraduate student who is a member of the dog lovers' society. Another student said Presidency ought to have learnt from Jadavpur University, which has over 100 strays. ""Nobody was prevented from feeding the dogs when an NAAC team visited the JU campus in August 2014. JU was graded A+, above what Presidency University has got,"" said Puja Bhattacharyya, a former Presidency student. An officer at Jorasanko police station said registrar Konar was contacted on Monday afternoon and asked to ensure that the stray dogs were not ill-treated. Konar declined to comment. Multiple calls by Metro to vice-chancellor Lohia's phone went unanswered."

In the latest incident, the police busted a drug racket and arrested three persons on Saturday. The cops also recovered 32 grams of brown sugar from them. Despite a series of raids by both the excise department and the police, the residents of the area continue to trade ganja and brown sugar. The cops said a number of drug peddlers indulged in the illegal trade despite having served jail sentences. The police said the root of the drug-peddling racket originated from Balasore and its adjoining areas. ""The contraband is mostly smuggled into Odisha from states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal. Small-time traders in the slum procure these illegal drugs from Balasore and its adjoining areas and sell it in Bhubaneswar, making huge profits in the process,"" said a police official. The cops launched a crackdown on peddlers in the slum, which falls within Laxmi Sagar police limits, following the death of an engineering student on May 6. The student, identified as Ashotosh Mahanty, 21, allegedly died after being drugged by a peddler from the slum. Activities in the slum remain a major concern for cops. It has provided several criminals and peddlers a safe hideout over the years. According to the 2008 census conducted by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, the slum had 2,300 residents in 654 households. But, according to the police, the population in the slum has doubled in the past five years and it has made it difficult for them to keep a tab on the criminal elements that teem in the area. ""As brown sugar can be concealed in small containers, it is hard to detect it. Besides, we have also found that some of the peddlers stored the contraband in plastic pouches in rice containers,"" said a police official. The police said most of the peddlers earned in lakhs, making peddling lucrative. One sachet with very small quantity of the drug is sold for anything between Rs 150 and Rs 200. The slum also hogged the limelight after some residents assaulted police personnel, including the inspector in charge of Laxmi Sagar police station and a sub-inspector in June last year. The incident took place while the cops had gone to the slum to rescue a youth. A 30-strong mob, mostly women wielding sticks and bricks, had attacked them. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said the slum had been kept under surveillance for drug peddling. ""Our men visit the slum on a regular basis in plain clothes to keep a watch on the peddlers. We have also asked the residents of the slum to inform us about any illegal trading activity taking place in the area,"" said Bhoi."

A cluster of districts forms a division and development projects there are monitored by a senior IAS officer who functions as a divisional commissioner.""The state cabinet today approved a proposal to create two more divisions for better monitoring of development work,"" parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said in Nabanna this afternoon.Sources said the decision was taken after the chief minister realised that some districts had not performed well in terms of implementing development projects.""It was not possible for the divisional commissioners to monitor all the districts from the district headquarters. Each of the commissioners were looking after at least eight districts,"" an official said.A section of officials also said the move was initiated keeping in mind the panchayat polls in 2018.""The chief minister believes that people had voted in favour of Trinamul in the Assembly polls only because of her development projects.... But lately, some districts have not been able to perform according to the standards set by her,"" a source said.Over the past one year or so, the Bengal government has started two key projects - giving bicycles to students of Classes IX to XII and providing subsidised rice to those who are not covered under the Centre's cheap food grain scheme."
58e5309d7be9e05a951f5556,Joha rice set to get GI tag,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161208/jsp/northeast/story_123540.jsp,2016-12-08,"Guwahati, Dec. 7: Assam's aromatic joha rice is all set to get the geographical indication (GI) tag provided there is no opposition from any quarter. The office of GI under the ministry of commerce says the tag will be given in the next few months if there is no opposition. ""All the formalities and conditions towards getting the GI tag have been met. We have advertised it in our journal to inform people that we intend to provide the GI tag to joha rice. The application will be registered if no opposition is received within four months,"" the official said. GI is a mechanism employed to identify agricultural, natural or manufactured goods which possess certain special qualities or characteristics based on the climatic or production conditions unique to a geographical location. Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, and Seuj Satirtha, an NGO in Sivasagar, had moved the application for joha rice. ""Joha rice varieties are genetically distinct from other classes of rice cultivated in Assam and elsewhere. A study on diversity analysis at the DNA-level based on molecular markers clearly showed that joha rice varieties were distinct from others, as reflected in separate groups from other varieties of Assam rice,"" the report in the GI journal said. AAU associate director (research) Prasanna Kumar Pathak, who made the application, said the joha GI status would be for 43 known varieties of joha which exist in the region. It said the joha class of rice is unique in aroma and grain characteristics and distinct from other aromatic rice like basmati in biochemical and other quality attributes. ""The uniqueness of joha rice is mainly attributed to particular climatic conditions prevalent in the area, together with varietal characters and systems of rice cultivation, adding to the best expression of aroma and flavour in the product. The aroma of joha rice is also considered to be distinctly different from basmati rice,"" the report stated. In 2007, the first consignment of 17MT of joha rice was exported to three European countries - Germany, the UK and Switzerland - where it was in high demand. Historically, joha rice, like khorika joha, finds mention in the 14th century Assamese version of the Ramayan ( Saptakanda Ramayana) attributed to poet Kaviraja Madhava Kandali. This work is also considered one of the earliest written scriptures in Assamese. According to the story, Kumbhakarn, the younger brother of Ravan, was woken up after Ravan prepared a heap of delicious food made of khorika joha. The application says there is need to protect this rice as there is legitimate concern among the farming community, academicians and policy makers that the market potential of joha rice may be jeopardised by some unscrupulous traders or middlemen who sell other small grain aromatic rice developed elsewhere in the name of joha rice."

Early this year, the state government had announced the launch of a happiness department, which will be dedicated to the promotion of well being. The department has come up with some excellent schemes to fulfil that aim. There will be anand utsavs where people will take part in traditional, non-competitive sports, which will make them culturally rooted and unambitious at the same time; there will be anand sabhas that will energize citizens with the power of positive thinking; happiness teams would be constituted to make people feel joyous irrespective of their material circumstances. It is the physical conditions of living that the chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, seems to be up against. He would like people to forget them as they levitate towards a higher spiritual plane. There will be bliss in such forgetfulness: the state's economic survey for 2014-15 had shown that it had more than 16 lakh educated unemployed people. The unemployed can surely find solace in yoga or meditation, which are two of the parameters on the basis of which the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state plans to compute its gross happiness index. Mr Chouhan's welfare plans would certainly bear fruit - he has the blessings of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who is committed to bringing peace to the world, no matter if that caused some damage to the Yamuna floodplains during the World Culture Festival held there in March this year. The most important guru in Mr Chouhan's pantheon, however, is the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who, according to Mr Chouhan, is god's boon to India. For the record, India stood at the 118th position in The World Happiness Report 2016 - but this ranking, which takes as its basis such mundane criteria as life expectancy, social support and freedom to make choices, cannot be of much relevance to Mr Chouhan. The happiness department seems to be directed at teaching people how to be content with less. During the campaigns for the recent bypolls to two Lok Sabha seats in the state, an Opposition leader had said that people's displeasure with the Centre's demonetization drive would show in their votes. A BJP leader had retorted that the chiefly tribal population of these constituencies could not care less - their staple food is rice and jowar and they are happy with that."

In September, the Centre had reduced the duty on wheat to 10 per cent from 25 per cent even as prices rose to about Rs 2,200 per quintal in December from Rs 1,550 a quintal in July. Prices started to rise after traders discovered that government procurement was significantly lower at 22.9 million tonnes (mt). They also started doubting the government's estimate of wheat production for 2015-16 at 93.50mt and have said actual production would be nearly 10 per cent less. Harpal Singh, a leading Delhi-based grain trader, said, ""Private companies have already firmed up orders for import of 5-6mt of wheat."" Companies, which are believed to be in the fray to ship grain include Cargil and Glencore. Private millers have already imported 1.72mt wheat from Australia, France and the Ukraine since September when the duties were reduced. ""The bigger problem is that the winter crop of grain and rice can be expected to be lower as sowing has been delayed in many areas. Secondly, farmers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch have neither been able to use their normal mix of fertilisers nor could they hire sufficient hands,"" Singh said. After demonetisation, restricted flow of new money and the limitation on withdrawal from Jan Dhan accounts also hindered cash flow in rural areas. In November, the government had announced 6-16 per cent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for winter crops - wheat, barley, gram masur, mustard and safflower - for the 2016-17 season. The MSP is the price at which the government buys grain, pulses and oilseeds from farmers to keep a reserve stock for rainy day and for sale through the public distribution system. The government has set a farm target of a record 270.10mt for the 2016-17 crop year (July 2016 to June 2017), an increase of 6.7 per cent over the output of 253.23mt in 2015-16. However, analysts feel these targets may not be reached."

Telegraph picture Kohima, Dec. 13: The situation is still tense in Dimapur after police arrested three members of the Against Corruption and Unabated Taxation yesterday. The police arrested Hukavi Sumi, Simon and Joel Kath for ""illegally probing into alleged scam in food and civil supplies department"" recently. ACAUT, supported by other civil organisations, staged a signature campaign today here for release of its arrested members. Shops were forced to down shutter in some areas of the town. Last Friday, ACAUT ""shattered"" the claims of the food and civil supplies department that the public distribution system was ""in order"" and done in a fair method, after it conducted a surprise visit to some of the godowns stocking PDS items such as rice. The ACAUT team, along with the Concern Citizens of Nagaland, visited R.Z. Lotha Godown in Kevijau Colony and M/s Lotha Trading Company at Lhomithi Colony and ""unearthed"" a mutlicrore-rupee scam. It found that rice, a PDS item, was being packed and kept ready in white synthetic bags for sale in the open market. Those in-charge of the godowns told the team that both ""actually belonged to Tinku and Nirmal Jain"". ACAUT informed the village councils in the area and upon inspection, the 13 villages decided to seal the godowns till a probe was completed. The team also filed an FIR at sub-urban police station in Signal Bosti against Tinku and Nirmal Jain and the food and civil supplies department for allowing the firms to operate from godowns in private establishments other than the designated Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouses. Reacting to the alleged rice scam, the department said the government had been appointing state stockists to procure foodgrain from the FCI because of limited number of godowns. Nagaland state secretary Ramongo Lotha said the state stockists were assisting the department to keep custody of the foodgrain. The foodgrain in the godowns of the two state stockists raided by a group of people and subsequently sealed by the police were meant for dispatch to the distributors, he added. On the allegation that foodgrain is being diverted, the secretary said such allegations have not been brought to the notice of the government. ""If such allegations are true, there is no reason why the government will not take action against such stockists,"" Lotha said. ""However, the same has to be based on some findings and people cannot be allowed to take law into their own hands,"" he added. On the allegation of packaging of foodgrain in plastic bags that were found in the sealed godowns, the department said the stockists had sought permission from the department for repackaging into plastic bags since the gunny bags in which the rice was received from the FCI had torn while loading/unloading during transit. Lotha said the department was committed to ensure transparency. ""In case of any complaints, the department expects that the complainants bring it to the notice of the department instead of taking law into their own hands."" This evening, at Clock Tower, scores of people came out to support the signature campaign for release of the three ACAUT members. The NSCN (Isak-Muivah) has banned ACAUT, while NSCN (Unification) has been monitoring it activities. ACAUT has been vigorously campaigning against ""tax"" collection by the militants."

The six hospitals will have a total of 800 beds. The state government's empowered committee on infrastructure today cleared the Greenfield Hospital and Health Network Project. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation and a Hyderabad-based health care institute will be the collaborators in the public private partnership project. As part of the Rs 424 crore project, Rs 51 crore will be given to the private promoter as viable gap funding. The remaining burden will be borne by the private promoter. The project will be dovetailed with the National Urban Health Mission programme. It will be executed on build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) basis. A 34-year agreement will be executed between the private and public sector partners. The revenue sharing agreement is expected to be signed in January and the project construction is likely to start in July next year, said official sources. The private promoter will take up construction and provide manpower and other infrastructure support, while the government will provide land for the hospitals. Of the six proposed hospitals, the main one will be a referral health care facility. It will have 500 beds and all kinds of superspecialist facilities. Chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi, who chaired today's meeting, directed the officials to earmark a certain number of beds for the treatment of the poor free of cost. It was decided that 359 of the total 800 beds would be reserved for the poor patients who are covered under Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana, Odisha State Treatment Fund and Chief Minister's Relief Fund, said the principal secretary in charge of the public private partnership cell, P.K. Jena. The main hospital will be set up at Gadakana while the five smaller ones will be located at Kapilaprasad, Brahmeswarpatna, Rasulgarh, Bharatpur and Gadakana. The empowered committee on infrastructure also gave its nod to three other proposals - construction 1,300 affordable houses for the economically weaker sections in Bhubaneswar, introduction of city bus service at Balasore and establishment of 23 rice storage godowns across the state. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation commissioner Krishan Kumar said the 1,300 affordable houses would be allotted to families living in Shanti Nagar and nearby slums. Ten acres have been earmarked for construction of the housing project at an estimated cost of Rs 92 crore. While the dwelling houses will be built on 6.5 acres, commercial units would be constructed on the remaining 3.5 acres. The city bus service in Balasore will also be run on the public private partnership mode. Two private promoters have been selected through a bidding process to run buses on the Balasore-Remuna-Matripur and Balasore-Soro-Nilgiri routes. The state government on Tuesday increased fares for all categories of passenger buses in accordance with the automatic fare adjustment mechanism. A notification issued by the state commerce and transport department had said the fares for ordinary and express buses would be hiked by 1 paisa per kilometre, while fares for deluxe and AC deluxe category buses would be hiked by 2 paise per kilometre."

Sources said the spiralling effect of the demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had hit all - right from suppliers, transporters, wholesalers to retailers and customers - resulting in lack of trading activities. As a result, the prices of all categories of Arwa and Usna rice have shot up by at least two-three rupees per kilogram in retail markets of Dhanbad. The price of Arwa Mansuri has increased from Rs 24 to Rs 26 per kg while that of Lakhi Bhog has shot up to Rs 40 from the previous Rs 38 per kg. The rate chart of Ramsal rice has seen an upward movement from Rs 42 to Rs 45 a kg. Wheat and flour rates have also witnessed a similar upward trend. Virendra Sao, a local grocery shop owner, said the wholesale rate of flour had gone up to Rs 620 from the previous Rs 550 per 25kg, raising the retail price from Rs 22 to Rs 25 per kg. The same is the situation with wheat, which has witnessed a two-rupee rise in its price from Rs 25 to Rs 27 per kg. A flour mill owner of Dhanbad, requesting anonymity, said the liquidity flow in the market had turned negligible due to cash wash. ""We are the ones who are facing the most difficult days. Retailers who had taken consignments from us are now facing difficulty in making payments. Thus, we are facing problem is purchasing fresh grains. Even if we make payments through net banking and RTGS system, suppliers are unable to withdraw the money in large amount and thus unable to pay farmers,"" he added. A wholesale food grain trader from Agriculture Produce Market Committee at Barwaddah said that the business had nose-dived by over 70 per cent in the market in the aftermath of demonetisation. ""We are getting very less number of customers nowadays. Again, many of them come up with illegal tenders or new Rs 2,000 notes. Now, we can't sell products to those who are coming with such currency notes,"" he added. Ashok Sharma, a private tutor from Jharudih, said: ""Our rice stock at home got exhausted a bit earlier this month. When I went to the local grocer, he advised me not to purchase rice for the entire month, instead buy only one or two kg at a time. He further told me that the prices were expected to go down once the cash flow normalises in coming months."" <>Jharkhand Industries and Trade Association secretary Rajiv Sharma said they would write to the state government, requesting it to release food grains from its stocks to tackle the current crisis.

The all-under-one-roof facility had a scientifically built warehouse, cold storage unit, individual marketing-cum-storage depots in the southern districts.The research and development lab, he said, would help in analysing the quality of products manufactured or dealt with by food processors and traders. Recently, a research in causes for variation in milling breakage in Basmati rice grown in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was undertaken here. The inference arrived at was to carry out standardised parboiling techniques, which would reduce breakage of rice. Today, many rice mills, which processed Basmati rice, had converted the suggestion into action, he added.Mr. Rethinavelu said the TNFMY had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology, Thanjavur, for carrying out research works. Students and research scholars working in the field of food processing and other allied areas might use the research and development facility.Currently, they were studying the non-chemical jaggery on a commercial level adoption to position it in the global market. Yet another area of research was paddy analysis  physical quality analysis, cooking analysis and sensory evaluation  to bridge the gap between the farmers and millers. This would enable the farmers to get a remunerative price for their crop, he said."

Most of the Bengali-speaking community in New York are Bangladeshi immigrants, concentrated in Queens, owning a variety of businesses from small boutiques to street carts serving up halal chicken over rice till 3am across Manhattan. If you want to learn how to fold your napkins right, look no further than New Yorks Plaza Hotel. Formerly owned by Donald Trump, the Plaza is set to open its very own etiquette school so that those looking for a prestigious international education in etiquette no longer have to fly to Europe. Guests can reserve spots in two types of classes led by etiquette expert Myka Meier: single evening courses for $75 and immersive weekend packages starting at $2,750. Meier received training in part by a former member of the Royal Household of Her Majesty the Queen, and has attended multiple finishing schools in both England and Switzerland. All courses reflect western fundamentals and are taught in English. I wonder how they would delve into the nuances of the Bong etiquette and table manners. How does one perfectly pick out the bones of ilish maach in a public setting? You just dont. In August, the city inaugurated the Museum of Ice Cream  an Instagram-worthy visit for lovers of ice cream and art. The exhibit, located right across from the Whitney Museum in the Meatpacking District, closed after a month-long opening, boasting a waiting list of 70,000 people. While there is no official confirmation of an extension of the ice cream gallery, the city wont stop its indulgence. Just last month, New Yorks first-ever dessert festival, Dessert Goals, was celebrated in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a six-hour-long event where the line never shortened. The festival featured 20 vendors, including those specialising in bubble tea, Hong Kong egg waffles, innovative mochi flavours, ice cream sandwiches and more. Until the sugar rush happily kicked in.  While the post-election day brought an overcast sky to the city, New Yorkers are waking up again to theholiday mood with the annual Christmas markets taking off. The Radio City Christmas Spectacular with the Rockettes, the precision dancers, kicked off on Friday, and the Grand Central Terminals holiday fair and train show opened on Monday; the Union Square Holiday Market and Bryant Park Winter Village brought out Christmas jazz, hot cider and food stalls galore. Next up is the Macys Thanksgiving Parade that includes cheerleaders, live bands, balloons, floats and Rockettes of the Radio City. Thousands of people come out in their thickest black coats in below-zero weather to watch Fifth Avenue lit up in silver lights, or squeeze in next to the barricades to watch the parade. You can watch couples ice skating in Bryant Park or warming up with European hot chocolate under the city skyline. I remember the Christmas vibes on Park Street and New Market. Where mulled wine is replaced by bhaare cha, and the icy clouds over the Empire State by the heavy fog in Victoria. Both have the same magic."

""People, particularly those in remote areas, are now offering us rice and vegetables instead of cash. We fully understand their predicament since the shortage of cash and restrictions on withdrawals have left everyone with very little cash in their hands,"" said Johan Dang, the moderator of Gossner Evangelical Lutheran (GEL) Church, the oldest church in Chotanagpur. The church, the moderator confessed, had always banked on its people and explained that since July 10, 1919 when GEL Church had declared autonomy it meant that all its activities were to be carried out with the help of donations from its own people, without depending on outside sources. A drop in collections meant that the church had very little by way of cash to continue its philanthropic activities. ""While the church depends on its faithful, its people too depend on the church in their hour of need. There are lots of people who are sick and needy and have to be supported. Besides, there are pensions to be paid and scholarships to be given to needy students. The cash crunch would also force us to keep this year's Christmas celebrations low-key,"" Dang lamented. However, GEL Church was appreciative of Prime Minister Modi's initiative against black money. ""We hope that the dislocations are short-lived. We are confident that the Union government would soon come out with appropriate solutions,"" the moderator emphasised. At Church of North India (CNI), Bishop B.B. Baskey revealed that their collections had also nose-dived by more than half in the last month. ""With very little cash with us, many of our charitable activities have been adversely affected. We need to tone down Christmas celebrations this year. While our churches would be lit up, fewer than usual lights would be used. However, like previous years, we would continue to donate warm clothing to the poor,"" the bishop said, adding that the problems notwithstanding, the war on black money should continue. Bishop Baskey described as ""silver lining"", the rapid promotion of a cashless economy. ""Our schools and other educational institutions would now need to upgrade their age-old book keeping system to online methods to ensure complete transparency and accountability,"" he said. At the St. Mary's Cathedral on Purulia Road, Ranchi, parish priest Theodore Toppo confessed that with collections from the Catholic faithful on a downward spiral, he was finding it difficult to meet daily expenses. ""We have more coins than notes. There are many Re1, Rs 2 and Rs 5 coins with us. There are lots of repair and paint jobs to be done before Christmas. Since no one wants to be paid in coins, I don't know what to do,"" he said."

(PTI) Kohima, Dec. 8: Demonetisation has impacted this year's Hornbill Festival as the tourist flow has decreased. ""This year is not like previous years but there is good sale of Naga handloom and handicrafts,"" said Anatoli Sumi, a stall owner at heritage village, Kisama. She said the sale could have been higher if the currency ban move was not initiated. ""Naga people are really expert in woodcraft. The Konyaks are the best wood-carvers among the Nagas. The log drums or xylophones, which are laboriously hollowed out of the trunk of a big tree, are excellent specimens of skill and accuracy,"" said Cindy, a tourist from Manipur. The forests in Nagaland are rich in bamboo and cane. The Nagas are expert basket-makers too. The Nagaland Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation (NHHDC) has also contributed to showcasing the state's rich tradition by organising various exhibitions and festivals. Visheli Zhimomi, another stallowner at Kisama, said though the sale was not as good as last year's, she had sold Naga shawls, jackets, earrings, bangles and the like to foreign tourists. ""The government should take more initiative to promote our handloom and handicraft items,"" she said. Naga wines, owned by Dimapur-based Zatara Pvt Ltd, is another attraction at the fest. Wine bottles, priced between Rs 400 and Rs 1,000 each, are in high demand. There are various stalls from Assam, Manipur and other northeastern states. Visitors were seen buying craft of Assam at a stall of a self-help group, M/s Milijuli from Jorhat. The most popular food stall, Morung (hut), of Sumi tribe, is also not earning like in previous years. A group of people who have been running the stall at Kisama for six years said this year's sale was low. ""We could sell around only Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 a day this time,"" Akavi said. Every year, Sumi Morung earns more than their other counterparts. Last year, they earned Rs 12 lakh during the 10-day festival where smoked pork with axone (fermented soyabeans) was the most scrumptious and sought-after dish. ""Demonetisation caused price rise of food at Kisama. A simple plate of rice and meat costs not less than Rs 250. A small mug of zu (local brew) costs Rs 100,"" said K.P. Angami, a visitor. ""The festival is not only for tourists but for all. Why is the state government not taking any initiative to curb the price hike?"" This year, Kisama is deserted by dusk because of less tourists. The night carnival at downtown Kohima is also badly affected with many stalls running at a loss. The objective of the carnival was to promote local entrepreneurs but half the stalls here are owned by non-locals. Stacey Nyekha, a visitor, said the very objective of the government had been defeated by issuing permits to many non-locals to own stalls at the carnival. ""The price of food is also high,"" she said. A group of womenr journalists have also set up a food stall at the carnival. ""We serve chowmein, momo and Naga breads at a very cheap rate. They cost not more than Rs 50,"" said Emillo Konyak a Naga scribe. Meanwhile, the Kohima district administration has instructed people to use electronic payment services at petrol pumps or avail of the refills they can purchase with the currency notes in hand because of shortage of smaller denominations."

Picture by Nilotpal Bhattacharjee Silchar, Nov. 26: Assam minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Rihon Daimary has directed officials to weed out bogus ration card-holders in Hailakandi district within 30 days. The minister yesterday held a high-level meeting with senior officials and elected representatives of the district to review the activities of the department. He asked officials to strike off the names of people possessing fake ration cards under the National Food Security Act. He said officials must make the people in possession of bogus ration cards to surrender within a stipulated timeframe, failing which legal recourse would be taken. ""The rice is meant for the poor and not for the rich. According to the food security act, only those with an annual income below Rs 1 lakh are entitled to get rice. Those who do not fulfil the criteria must be weeded out,"" he said. The officials informed the minister that over 26,000 bogus rations cards had been terminated in the past few months. Wholesalers and retailers have been directed to keep prices under check and to display the quantity and price of each item on display boards, failing which action would be taken against them. Exhorting the shopkeepers to supply essential commodities at reasonable prices, Daimary warned that stringent action would be taken against those resorting to artificial hoarding with the ulterior motive of making more money. He also asked the district administration to cancel the licences of inoperative hawkers. The officials of legal meteorology department were asked to make random visits to shops, oil depots, gas agencies, markets and tea gardens to check the accuracy of the weights and measures equipment. The minister also held a meeting late last evening with officials of the public health engineering department and directed them to operationalise all water supply schemes. Of the 312 schemes, 85 are functioning and the rest are inoperative. He also took stock of the progress of the World Bank-aided mega water supply project at Chandipur in Algapur constituency of Hailakandi district. Earlier, he inspected the site and urged officials to expedite work on a war-footing in the remaining working season for completion of the project. World Bank has provided over Rs 10 crore for the project that will cover 233 habitations with a population of 83,176. Daimary said that he would visit Hailakandi again in February to review the status of projects and make inspection at the ground level."
58e536ec7be9e05a951f5c46,Paddy alert in Bengal,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161123/jsp/nation/story_120840.jsp,2016-11-23,"Calcutta, Nov. 22: Around 35 per cent of the monsoon paddy in Bengal could go waste because of the demonetisation drive, an agriculture department estimate has suggested. However, against the backdrop of chief minister Mamata Banerjee's vocal opposition to the domonetisation, a section of officials in Nabanna, the Bengal secretariat, felt it was ""a bit early"" to forecast crop losses. Nabanna sources said the department drew up a report on the basis of feedback from all the districts. The government sought the report to gauge the impact of the demonetisation on the harvesting of the monsoon paddy. After the Centre recalled the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, reports poured in from rural Bengal that farmers could not harvest the produce as they had no money to pay the daily labourers. ""The estimates mentioned in the report suggest that there could be a loss of 35 per cent of the total paddy produced in the kharif season. If the crop is not harvested, it will rot in the fields. If the situation does not change dramatically, the state's total rice production is bound to be hit this year,"" a senior Nabanna official said. According to agriculture department officials, if the kharif crop is not harvested by the end of November, the total production is affected. ""If the farmers keep paddy in the fields till the end of November, a large portion of the grain will fall off because of the changing weather conditions..... It will result in crop loss,"" another official said. This would mean the farmers will face difficulties in recovering their investments. Potato cultivation would also suffer if the kharif paddy is not harvested by the end of November, the sources said. ""The sowing of potato seeds needs to be completed by mid-December for a healthy production. If the kharif paddy remains in the fields till the end of November, farmers would not get time to prepare the fields to grow potato,"" an official said. Some Nabanna officials said the report was based on estimates and the final production amount would be calculated only after the harvesting is completed. ""It is a bit early to say that the state is going to face huge crop loss,"" an agriculture department official said. The report will be sent to the Centre tomorrow. The major chunk of the yearly paddy production is done in the kharif season. Bengal produces about 158 lakh tonnes of rice annually, of which 110 lakh tonnes are harvested in the kharif season. The annual consumption requirement is 150 lakh tonnes. ""If 35 per cent of the kharif crop gets destroyed, the total rice production this year will come down to about 120 lakh tonnes,"" a source said. ""Farmers usually sell the boro (winter) paddy before the Pujas to meet festival expenses and the cost of harvesting the kharif crop. Most of the cash in the possession of farmers has become useless because of the demonetisation. So they have not been able to hire labourers for harvesting,"" the source said. The agriculture department officials said the effect was already evident in the sluggish sales of potato seeds at state government centres."

Picture by Deepak Kumar Patna, Dec. 8: State education minister Ashok Choudhary today asked the universities and medical colleges in the state to prepare research projects in life science, pure science and technology in association with universities of theEuropean Union. The minister was speaking on the occasion of a day-long workshop organised by the Bihar government on funding opportunities for India-Europe mobility and cooperation. Choudhary said: ""The state universities should come forward in conducting joint research in life science, science and technology with universities of European Union under the Erasmus+ project."" The education department has asked the state universities to prepare at least five research projects within a month. The state universities have to prepare the project in association with two other universities or individuals who have pioneered in the field of research. Once the state universities submit the project, the education department will shortlist the project and it will be applied for joint research with European Union universities under Erasmus+. The Erasmus+ named after Dutch Renaissance humanist, Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus, is the European Union's programme supporting education, training, youth and sport up to 2020. The Erasmus is a European Union exchange-student-faculty programme. Its purpose is to provide exchange options to students from within the European Union and it involves many of the best universities and seats of learning. Between 2004 and 2016 around 5,000 Indian students from all parts of India have received Erasmus scholarships - recently at a rate of over 500 per year. Cesare Onestini, minister counsellor and deputy head of the European Union delegation to India, said: ""Our idea behind holding the workshop is to spread the functioning of Erasmus+. New opportunities are now being offered, primarily for higher education institutions, students and even teachers and staff."" Sources said after 2015, there has been major increase in the number of Indian institutions who are beneficiary of Erasmus+ funding under capacity building projects as well as number of students who received Erasmus+ mobility scholarships.# Economist Saibal Gupta said in America and Europe, most of the innovations, technical or academic, are university driven. ""Nasa is sponsored by Rice University. The ultimate of higher education excellence (universities) is how many patents one has achieved in its quest for knowledge especially in science, technology and mathematics."" Gupta added that the European Union and India have a long standing cooperation on education and it has been highlighted again on the occasion of 13 EU-India Summit in March 2016 in Brussels.#"

Word spread in my area that officials were waiting near a tea shop in the adjacent street. My wife rushed with the ration card to get the verification done, said N.

If they are not visiting every household, arent there chances of a deserving family getting missed out, questioned M.

Picture by Gautam Dey Dhanbad, Dec. 8: The so-called benefits of demonetisation that the government is harping on hardly makes sense to 40-year-old Rashidan Bibi, who earns a living as a construction labourer. The widow, who gets a daily wage of Rs 200, cites simple statistics to claim that the cash purge has snatched at least 20 days of work from her in the past one month, depriving her of Rs 4,000. ""Note bandi ka bahut kharab asar hain, babu, humko pichhla mahina mein sirf paanch din kam mila jabki aur mahina me humko motamoti tees din mein se pachis din toh kam mil hi jata tha (The demonetisation has dealt a bad blow, Sir. Last month, I got work for only five days, whereas during normal time, it is around 25 to 30 days,"" said Rashidan, whose four children - three daughters aged 12, 15 and 18 years and son of 14 years - are completely dependent on her income. ""We are somehow managing with 20kg of rice provided by the PDS shop in addition to two litres of kerosene oil,"" said the construction labourer, who lives at Simaldih area in Telipara locality of Dhanbad and goes to Hirapur Harimandir around 7.30am every day in search of work. But today also, she returned empty-handed and dejected after waiting for more than two hours. The plight of Meena Devi (45), a neighbour of Rashidan, is even worse. Being older than Rashidan, she secured lesser days of work at construction projects - only three days between November 9 and November 30 and one day between December 1 and December 5. ""This demonetisation has completely finished us. I think I ought to start looking for some other job, or else I have to borrow money from others,"" said Meena, also a widow with two sons - one 12-year-old and another 11-year-old. The slowdown in the construction industry following the invalidation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and resultant cash crisis because of the RBI restrictions have hit hard over 20,000 labourers in the unorganised sector, a majority of whom work under private builders engaged at over 200 ongoing multi-storey projects in the town. Builders, who pay the wages in cash, have stopped hiring workers, rendering many jobless. Admitting that the construction sector is grappling with a recession-like situation, president of Dhanbad Builders' Association Vinay Singh said that the industry was down by more than 60 per cent due to the demonetisation. ""How can we keep our projects functional at full pace when we are facing cash crisis to pay the labourers, a majority of whom don't have Jan Dhan accounts and demand money in hand after finishing work every day?. We are also unable to purchase raw materials,"" said Singh. He added that as it is, the construction market in Dhanbad was not very good as only middle income group and salaried class were buying flats in the range of Rs 15 to Rs 18 lakh. ""The construction sector is going through one of its roughest patches in the Coal Belt. Private developers are somehow keeping their projects alive as completely stopping operations will create a lot of problems regarding disbursement of loan instalments by bank and other financial institutions,"" Prem Singh said, expressing hope that the situation might improve once the RBI lifted the curbs on cash withdrawal."

Venkaiah Naidu at a programme organised in Vijayawada on the occasion of Good Governance Day. But the Congress and other parties were blind to the evidence before them and still refuse to acknowledge that the move was basically aimed at removing the disparities between the haves and have-nots, he said.

What is more, it supplied a pair of buffaloes and 10 fowls to 50 households. The elders of the twin villages formed into committees and invited the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to do the honours.

But, registering protest in that particular way has become difficult in the last couple of years as the police have kept a tight vigil at high rise structures around the Assembly. However, it made such elements find alternative avenues!Recently, a group of DSC-2012 qualified candidates went to the terrace on the sixth floor of the Sankshema Bhavan in Masab Tank to press their demand for appointment as teachers. They locked up the door leading to the terrace and resorted to slogan shouting. The incident tested the patience of the police who finally managed to convince the protesters to come down late in the night.Saving bygunny bagsAn oft repeated quote these days is an idea can change your life. The Civil Supplies Corporation has hit upon a novel idea for saving huge amount. While much is written about the procurement of rice by the corporation, one is seldom aware of the expenditure it incurs on account of packaging the custom milled rice in gunny bags.The corporation has targeted recovery of old gunny this time around as the quantum of gunny bags lying idle with the millers is said to be close to Rs. 66 crore. Huge quantities of gunnies are said to be lying with the millers as they fail to return the excess bags lying with them every season.The corporation is also said to have taken the road route instead of rail for transporting gunnies from Kolkata as it will entail a saving of Rs. 8 crore in addition to cutting down on delays in delivery.Race for top spotEmployees in the Roads and Buildings Department are wondering at the race for top post in their organisation, that of Chief Engineers.A list of 10 probables have been prepared for the two CE posts which is now occupied by in-charge officers.Interestingly, the top-most positions, that of Engineer-in-Chief, are also filled by two in-charge officers of the rank of CE who will retire early next year.Word has it that the government plans to promote the in-charge officers in the post of CE and give them full charge.Hence, the employees are at a loss to comprehend the apparently contradictory moves of readying senior officials for a post when there are no vacancies.Also, it is not known if the post of ENCs will be filled after the retirement of current incumbents.(V.

Prices of staple food, which are normally stable, have climbed in the steel city over the past week with dreams of a cashless economy miles away from wholesome reality. The retail rate of rice has marginally increased by 3 to 5 per cent, but that of wheat products such as atta (flour), maida (refined and bleached flour) and suji (semolina) have leaped by 10 per cent. If a 5kg packet of branded wheat flour was available at Rs 155 even last month, the same is being sold at no less than Rs 170. Refined wheat flour, bought at Rs 27 a kilo a week ago, is now available for Rs 30. Similarly, semolina flaunts a price tag of Rs 32 a kg instead of the earlier Rs 30. As if in consolation, the price of rice has gone up by Re 1 to Rs 1.50 per kg, depending on quality and brand. Govind Agrawal, a Bistupur grocer, conceded that he was charging his customers more.

Another grocer in Bistupur, on the condition of anonymity, said the impact of demonetisation on the wholesale market could not be ruled out. ""As wholesale traders are buying rice, wheat and wheat products at higher prices, we retailers have to follow suit,"" he added. Customer Marshal Tigga said he had barely seen such a sharp rise in flour rates in his life. ""If there is a Rs 3 per kilo increase in maida price, a family of four that needs at least 5kg a month has to fork out Rs 15 extra. It disturbs your monthly kitchen budget. More so when the grocer won't tell you why he is charging more for staple food when there is no agricultural setback,"" said the Sonari resident. Tigga added that he could see no other reason behind the hike in prices except for demonetisation, which inevitably means that the rates wouldn't come down in the near future. Nirmal Sharma, a resident of Sakchi and an employee of a private insurance company, stressed that the increased food prices were definitely the result of demonetisation. ""Apart from rice and wheat, the price of pasteurised milk (Sudha Dairy) has gone up by Rs 2 per litre, prompting the roadside chaiwala to demand an extra buck for every cup of tea. Members of the working class, many of whom eat lunch at small eateries, are also paying more for the humble chapatti,"" Sharma rued. Suresh Sonthalia, president of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry, admitted the problem. ""As (wholesale) traders are buying wheat at a higher price from suppliers in Bihar and Punjab, the cost of the flour and other wheat products has gone up considerably. But, we have to probe if the hike in prices is directly linked to demonetisation,"" he said."

Picture by Dilip Kumar Bhagalpur, Dec. 5: Raj Kumar Panjiwar, a farmer in Jagdishpur, around 12km south of the Bhagalpur district headquarters and 245km east of Patna, is over the moon because he has got 42 quintals of katarni paddy from a hectare of land for the first time. The average yield of katarni has always been around 36 quintals, but Raj had used seeds prepared by Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour, after over two years of research and development. The aroma, too, is better than the traditional katarni, Raj said. Katarni is an aromatic, short-grain rice grown in east Bihar. It is sought-after throughout the country. Bhagalpur district magistrate (DM) Adesh Titarmare visited Raj's paddy field with officials concerned on December 2, when harvesting was started. Impressed with the record production, the DM said the government would give the farmers proper facilities. He also stressed the need of promoting katarni production using scientific techniques, and branding it. ""We earlier sent a geographical indication (GI) registration application from BAU, Sabour,"" Titarmare told The Telegraph on Monday. ""Owing to some technical norms, we were told to send the application from the body of the local katarni growers. ""We rectified it and also speeded up work for registration under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (for a society of harvesters called the Bhagalpur Katarni Dhan Utpadan Sangh, created last year). Besides, they asked us to provide details about the specific agro-climatic conditions which influence the aroma and quality of the variety. We sent the history of agro-climatic conditions and topographical details of the region."" A GI is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (town, region, or country). The use of a GI may act as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation due to its geographical origin. Titarmare also said that BAU-Sabour has started intensive research on the topographical location of such paddy fields situated alongside the Chanan river as the katarni from that river belt has the best aroma. ""Only scientists can explain whether it is the river or specific minerals found in the areas which influence the aroma,"" he said. BAU-Sabour vice-chancellor Ajay Kumar Singh also said branding is essential to promote the rice variety in the international market. ""The variety was under threat so the immediate need was to protect and purify the seeds and hence the scientists started work in this direction (in 2014),"" Singh said, adding that the varsity prepared 280kg of seeds and distributed it among the farmers of Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger and other places. ""On average, there has been a report of 23 per cent increase in yield in comparison to general traditional harvesting of katarni,"" Singh said."

""We will start buying paddy from tomorrow across 280 blocks. We have a fund of Rs 5,000 crore at hand to start the process. Later, we will buy paddy in 50 more blocks,"" food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mullick said today. Sources in his department said the procurement would be done through the kisan bazaars the Bengal government has set up. Only state appointed co-operative societies would be allowed to procure paddy this year, they said. Officials said rice mill owners had been kept out of the purview of the procurement process following complaints that they were forcing farmers to sell their produce at lower rates. This year, farmers would get Rs 1,470 for a quintal of paddy and Rs 20 a quintal extra as transport cost. Nabanna officials pointed out that this year's procurement of Rs 5,000 was way above those in the last few years. ""The government usually kept aside Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,000 crore for the purpose,"" an official said. Apart from the rise in funds, the state government has also decided to transfer money directly to the bank accounts of the farmers instead of issuing cheques. ""It is clear that the state government wants to send more money into the accounts of the farmers and that too as early as possible. This is a well planned move to woo the farmers at a time the Centre has caused them trouble,"" said a senior bureaucrat. ""The Centre would be under pressure if farmers cannot withdraw the amount from their accounts."""

Picture by UB Photos Shillong, Nov. 7: The Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers' welfare, Sudarshan Bhagat, today asked the Meghalaya government to fast-track the implementation of the Centre's schemes related to agriculture and ensure that mechanisms are in place to quickly utilise the funds sanctioned by New Delhi for the benefit of farmers. Bhagat was interacting with officers of the state agriculture and horticulture departments here. He reviewed the status of implementation of 16 of the Centre's flagship schemes related to agriculture. Bhagat told the gathering that the state must utilise the funds released by the Centre so that more funds could be sanctioned. The minister also requested the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to develop more disease-resistant varieties of crops so that there is more production and farmers can increase their income. Stating that Meghalaya could become a hub for organic farming, Bhagat said efforts had been made in this regard. He also stressed the need to take up new technologies and schemes to help farmers and increase production. He also encouraged farmers to take up pig and goat-rearing in the state. Bhagat reviewed the implementation of 16 central schemes, such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, soil health card, soil health management, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture and others. The Centre is providing 90 per cent funding for these 16 schemes while the states have to pay only 10 per cent. Officials of the Union agriculture ministry, who accompanied the minister, said as far as the financial progress in the implementation of schemes was concerned, the state government had done a tremendous job in some of the schemes but in some, including horticulture, efforts have to be made to utilise the central funds. ""If the state is not able to incur expenditure for the money that has been released, the fund will be reduced in next year's budget, which will be a loss for the state,"" an officer said. Referring to the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, the official pointed out that for the last four years, almost Rs 90 crore was left unused under this scheme. The central officials stressed that it would not be possible for New Delhi to release the funds without proper utilisation certificates. #On rice cultivation in Meghalaya, an official said the state bureaucrats had mentioned that the area covered under rice was huge, but less in terms of production. ""Paddy is a traditional crop here and the northeastern region is known for horticulture and floriculture. Farmers should not grow only traditional crops but go for value- addition as well. There should be more production so that the farmers' income can be doubled,"" he said."

Telegraph picture Jorhat, Dec. 9: A lightweight tea basket, a more efficient dheki (wooden rice-pounder) and a multimedia package to make learning Assamese alphabets easier for children are being designed by teachers of the College of Home Science here. These projects are being sponsored by the ministry of human resource development under its design innovation centre scheme. Nandita Bhattacharyya, associate professor, family resource management, said IIT Guwahati was one of the 12 design innovation hubs in the country and Assam Agricultural University is one of the spoke (as in those of a wheel) institutes under it. Bhattacharyya, who is also a coordinator of the AAU spoke institute, said the College of Home Science under AAU had taken up three projects under this scheme. Bhattacharyya had improvised on an earlier design of a tea basket to come up with a lightweight one for women plucking leaves and was conducting trials for further improvement. ""The tea basket we have designed takes into cognizance the height and average weight of a woman working in the tea gardens. We have used a light material which which can hold up to one-and-a-half times the amount of tea leaves which a plucker can put in now,"" she said. ""Plucking tea leaves and putting them into a basket on a daily basis often tells on the health of tea workers, especially women who suffer from backache, muscle strain and other problems. This basket that we have developed will hopefully be able to address these issues,"" she said. Not only is the material light and easy to carry on the back, it is also more durable, thus making it cost-efficient as well. ""An engineer from IIT is associated with each of the three projects to ensure that the innovation does not lack efficiency,"" she said. Juri Baruah, principal investigator and professor, human development and family studies, is engaged in the project titled Early Language Acquisition - An Approach to Alphabet Learning in Assamese language, along with professor Jinamoni Saikia and assistant professor Tullika Borah. ""The multimedia package will have computer games designed in such a way that a child will move up different levels while he or she learns the alphabets and conjuncts ( juktakhyor). The games will be for children from nursery to Class IV. There will also be audio games to help learn the pronunciations and we are also planning a metallic arc game like a puzzle,"" she said. Professor Ruplekha Borah and assistant professor Mira Kalita, on the other hand, are developing a dheki, a traditional wooden equipment which is a part of every rural household in Assam and is used to grind the glutinous variety of rice used to make paper thin white pithas during Rongali and Bhogali Bihu. Borah said pounding the rice by rhythmically moving one leg up and down on a low-placed see-saw like contraption placed on a fulcrum consumed a lot of energy and was a back-breaking task for women. ""We are trying to make this more energy efficient and easier to use by utilising different materials and other means,"" she said. At present feedback is being taken and reviewed before finalising on the technology, she said."

Picture by Rining Lyngdoh Shillong, Dec. 10: For the last 14 years people involved in promoting locally-made brew in Meghalaya have been requesting the government to accord recognition to the indigenous sip, but their voice is still unheard of. At an annual festival here showcasing local brew of different varieties made of various indigenous fruits and other produce with different taste and quality, there is a demand for recognition of home-made wine. Today's festival, held on the premises of U Soso Tham auditorium here, is the 14th annual event that Forever Young, an organisation led by social activist Michael Syiem, has been organising since 2002. With colleagues from Meghalaya, long-time maker of local brew from Assam, Muktidhor Borua also asked the governments of Meghalaya and Assam to recognise local brew. Makers of local brew believe that giving recognition to the brew would not only generate revenue for the government, but boost the economy of the local people. The 85-year-old Borua and his family have travelled to Shillong and participated in the wine festival twice, last year and this one. Borua, who retired as an engineer in 1991 from Oil India Limited, has a strong attachment with Shillong. He had worked with the Assam Electricity Board in Shillong in undivided Assam till 1958 and has been producing homemade brew for 40 years. Like other stalls, Borua's displayed wines under the brand name Mukti Borua. His brew was made of various fruits and flowers, including fig, an Asian species of flowering plants, root beet, jasmine, litchi and others. ""The government is yet to allow us to sell homemade brews in shops though it has allowed hard drinks of various brands. I request the government to recognise homemade brews and give licence to also sell in shops, apart from in the festival,""? the octogenarian said. Syiem said the government should understand and take a call to see that local made brew is recognised and promoted in the state. ""If beer has been allowed for production and export from Meghalaya, why not allow local brew?""Syiem asked. He said home-made wine is more acceptable than hard drinks, adding almost all festivals in the state also require home-made brew. Adding flavour to the taste and the festival this year is a brew made of tapioca and sticky rice ( ja shawlia). Prominent visitors to the festival included North Eastern Hill University assistant professor (tourism department) Sharad Kumar Kulshreshtha, and A. Kumar, faculty of Institute of Hotel Management, Shillong. While Kulshreshtha stressed on the need to do research on local beverages and the prospect of wine-making and its links with tourism, Kumar is planning to do research on the potential of local brews. ""Meghalaya is rich in biodiversity with different species. We need to identify the potential and how to market the local wine as tourism product, because every tourist spot in Meghalaya has its own unique selling point,"" Kumar said."

Picture by Bhola Prasad Jamshedpur, Dec. 5: With almonds strewn here and there and honey trickling from tree trunks, Tata Steel Zoological Park is trying to make its sloth bears feel right at home. The zoo management launched the initiative on the directives of the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) to make the animal enclosure more natural. ""The CZA directives say enclosures must simulate the wild to make animals come out of cages. We want to make the bears feel as if they were living in the wild. We started this initiative with sloth bears, which will be taken up at other enclosures too,"" zoo director Bipul Chakravarty said. So, the 3,000sqft enclosure, hosting a male and two female sloth bears (Melursus ursinus), has two ponds and artificial tunnels and one hump. Caretakers smear honey daily on trees and strew almonds on the ground so that the shaggy creatures can have these delicacies in a more natural way. The cell for the sloth bears also wears a wild look. It resembles a cave with rocks. A crawl area has also come up. According to zoo vet Manik Palit, captive sloth bears live for 35 to 40 years. ""These steps will increase their life span by two to three years. Metabolic rate increases in active animals. Monotony makes them lazy,"" he said. People will also like the animals better when they are more playful, he smiled, adding next in line for the natural revamp was the langur enclosure. The 10-year-old male sloth bear was rescued from Chaibasa in 2008 while his female counterparts, both aged 25, were freed from madaris in New Delhi in 1997. They munch on almonds, honey and carrots for breakfast, have milk and rice for lunch and chapattis for dinner. The sloth bear is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss and poaching."

In a tweet late this evening, Rahul said: ""When you talk you are only repeating what you already know. But if you listen you may learn something new - Dalai Lama."" He did not mention Jaitley but the context was clear because he pasted the link of a news report on how the demonetisation would affect farmers. The finance minister had yesterday said: ""Rahul should apply his mind and understand that those in farming are not in the tax net."" This followed a series of tweets by the Congress vice-president questioning the government's move. ""Once again MrModi shows hw little he cares abt ordinary ppl of this country-farmers, small shopkeepers, housewives-all thrown into utter chaos,"" Rahul had written. ""While the real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed away abroad or in bullion/ real estate. Well done Mr Modi. ""One Q for the PM: How is replacing 1000 rs notes with 2000 rs notes going to make black money hoarding a lot harder?"" Congress leaders had underlined through the day today that Rahul was referring to the immediate inconvenience farmers and the poor would face because of the sudden scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Naresh Kumar, a farmer leader in the Congress, told The Telegraph: ""This is the time when we buy seeds and hire tractors. A larger number of farmers these days hire day labourers. Everything requires cash. This is also the time to sell rice and the cash crunch has affected transactions. There is panic among farmers."" Jagat Singh, a farmer from Tikri village in Outer Delhi, said: ""Today is the day when we believe the gods wake up ( Dev-uthaun ekadashi) and hence marriages start. My son is getting married today and we don't have any cash."" Another farmer, Mahavir Singh of Nilwal village, said: ""We can't hire labourers because they have to be paid in advance these days."" Congress leaders said vegetable farmers had suffered losses as many retailers stayed away from the mandi today, after poor sales yesterday because people did not have cash to buy vegetables. Yesterday, former finance minister P. Chidambaram had expressed doubts about the economic sagacity of the move. ""Such a decision had been considered by previous governments at different times but not implemented as they thought economic gains would be very small while disruption and inconvenience will be much larger,"" he said. Arguing that arguments like terror financing are ""a complete exaggeration,"" the former finance minister said: ""The Reserve Bank of India has itself said only 0.7% of the cash is counterfeit."" Chidambaram said about 98 to 99 per cent people who have cash at home are honest, having legitimate money - farm income, daily wages, income of small traders. ""If they are asked questions, asked to fill up forms, that will be harassment."""

A birthday party a father had planned for his daughter was virtually on hold after one phone call at 9pm. At least 50 cars were queued up at a Park Street petrol pump at 11pm. Spencer's and Big Bazaar stores decided to remain open till midnight because people were picking up stuff like it was an emergency. Around 10.30pm, Aliah restaurant on Bentinck Street had stopped accepting Rs 1,000 notes and the eatery was not sure if it would open on Wednesday. Around 11.30pm, the queue outside a Baguiati ATM was so long that some were fighting with each other, worried that Rs 100 notes might get exhausted. Calcutta, Nov. 8: These were some of the scenes that played out in Calcutta in the aftermath of the decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. On social media, many people hailed the announcement as the Prime Minister's ""surgical strike"" on black money, but it had nuked Dulal Mukherjee's plans for his daughter's birthday. Mukherjee, a Garia businessman, had planned a party to celebrate his daughter's fifth birthday on Friday. A little after 9pm, the caterer called up to say that the Rs 25,000 advance Mukherjee had given him in the morning in Rs 500 notes was of no use now. Mukherjee was left running from one ATM to another near Esplanade, where he had come for work, trying to withdraw Rs 400 from each. Power utility CESC said in a statement that it would not accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes at its cash counters from tomorrow. For cash payment of bills at CESC counters, ""the due dates for electricity bills between November 9 and November 11 is extended till November 15 for payment allowing the rebate"", it added. An Armani Jeans showroom still open at 10.50pm. Pictures by Amit Datta Employees of petrol pumps, which are expected to accept the big notes beyond the midnight deadline, were having a busy time. By 11pm, the queue at a Park Street petrol pump had led to traffic snarls. On the streets, at roadside shops and outside pubs, people were seen talking about the demonetisation announcement. Many spent the big notes on shopping. The Spencer's outlet at Quest Mall saw a surge after 9pm. A man was seen buying 10 sacks of rice weighing 10kg each and paying in notes of Rs 500. ""We had downed the shutters as usual at 10pm but soon after, an order came asking us to reopen the store,"" said an employee who did not want to be named. A designer denim store at the same mall was open well past the usual hours. A man had just bought three pairs of jeans and paid in Rs 1,000 notes, said an employee. The queues outside ATMs grew longer with each passing hour. Scuffles were reported outside ATM kiosks in Baguiati and Sodepur's Ghola. People waiting in the queues grew impatient, frequently knocking on the door if someone took time withdrawing cash. ""Everyone is withdrawing Rs 400 but two or three times to ensure they get only Rs 100 notes. This is delaying the next person's turn,"" said a guard outside an ATM. A group of youths who were smoking outside a popular watering hole at Chandni Chowk got the news on Facebook. Their response was perhaps the most ingenuous. Two of them had four Rs 500 notes between them. Deciding that the best solution was to spend the money, they went back into the pub."

Trump and President Obama have been unfailingly polite towards each other since the election. But with Trump staking out starkly different positions from Obama on Israel and other sensitive issues, and the President acting aggressively to protect his legacy, the two have become leaders of what amounts to duelling administrations. The split widened yesterday when the Obama administration abstained from a UN Security Council vote that condemned Israel for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and allowed the resolution to pass. A day earlier, Trump had publicly demanded that Obama veto the measure, even intervening with Egypt at the request of Israel to pressure the administration to shelve the effort. ""As to the UN,"" Trump wrote on Twitter after the vote, ""things will be different after January 20"". It was the latest in a rapid-fire series of Twitter posts and public statements over the last week in which Trump has weighed in on Israel, terrorism and nuclear proliferation - contradicting Obama and flouting the notion that the country can have only one President at a time. That longstanding principle has largely collapsed since the victory by Trump, who campaigned on a strategy of breaking all the rules. ""In some ways, Trump is neutering the Obama administration,"" said Douglas G. Brinkley, a professor of history and a presidential historian at Rice University in Houston. ""They've avoided personally attacking each other, but behind the scenes, they're working to undermine each other, and I don't know how the American people benefit from that."" For its part, the Obama administration on Tuesday announced a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling along wide areas of the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, invoking an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to claim that Trump had no power to reverse it. White House officials asserted a similar privilege in their decision not to veto the Security Council resolution. Israel's aggressive construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they said, puts at risk a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump's opposition to the measure, and the likelihood that his administration will reverse the position, played no part in the decision, they said."

""Bringing smiles on the faces of the poor has always figured on the top of my list of priorities. And, we did what we said. My government has done well on every front since it came to power two years ago,"" Das, talking exclusively to this correspondent this afternoon, said. Asked for examples, Das steered clear of all controversies in the past year, especially related to local residents' policy and CNT and SPT amendments, and instead focussed on plain facts and figures of the past two years in sectors ranging from agriculture to infrastructure and industry. ""We have waived market cess on agriculture products, built over 2 lakh dobas to enable the farmers irrigate their fields throughout the year and planned another four lakh dobas to be dug in the coming days. We have set up single window redress system for agriculture-related issues at headquarters of 100 block (of the state's total 263). We are giving 50 per cent subsidy to farmers on seeds and agricultural equipment to begin cultivations on barren lands,"" he said. Proving he had done his homework well, the chief minister went on: ""To uplift people belonging to particularly vulnerable tribal groups, a separate welfare authority has been formed. Each family is being given a monthly honorarium of Rs 600. Over 34 lakh BPL families are being given LPG connections and stoves free of cost. Over 25,000 forest land lease deeds have been settled."" He added 51.70 lakh BPL families were getting 35kg of rice every month for Re 1 a kg. The limit of the state's financial aid for treatment of critically ill poor patients had been revised and 85 new diseases added to the list enabling them to avail financial assistance. Shifting gears to industry, he said his recent tours and roadshows were aimed at fetching new investments. ""We received warm response in Singapore as well,"" referring to his most recent trip, which the Opposition dubbed a ""Christmas holiday"". He added several leading companies from across the globe would participate in the global investors meet in Ranchi on February 16 and 17, 2017. Is Jharkhand prepared for big-ticket investment? Das believes it is. ""We have already made an online single window system functional in the industries department. A land bank too has been set up. We are one among the top states in the ease of doing business. We give special incentives for start-ups and Make in Jharkhand projects. We have also formulated our film and tourism policies,"" he said. Das added several leading business houses were making ""honest efforts"" to set up their new projects but did not name anyone. "" Mera kaam hai udyog dhandha barhane ke liye saaf-sutra maidan taiyar karna (My job is to make the groundwork smooth for industry),"" the chief minister said. ""The rest is for the individual businessmen to work out."" On infrastructure growth, the chief minister said over 1,000km of new roads and 25 bridges were built in the past two years and passenger train services began on Jasidih-Deoghar-Dumka-Rampurhat and Koderma-Hazaribagh rail routes. He added groundwork of the golden triangle, an expressway linking cities of Dhanbad, Bokaro, Ranchi and Jamshedpur, would begin soon. AC bus services to every district headquarters from Ranchi were available, he claimed. On transparency, he said over 130 officials of different ranks were put behind bars on corruption charges in two years and they were directly solving individual problems through Jan Samvad Kendra.

The three-day workshop was organised by the Manipur Biodiversity Board in association with the Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Tradition (FRLHT), Bangalore. The workshop discussed the importance of forest produce, conservation assessment and management prioritisation process, using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of threatened species categories and criteria for the state. Chief secretary O. Nabakishore said the use of herbal medicine in the state was unique. The traditional physicians of the state have been prescribing medicines comprising herbal extracts that can cure many diseases. ""Like Ayurvedic medicine, Manipur has similar medicines produced from plants, fruits and roots. What is important is that we have to get the local herbal medicines tested by an accredited lab to find out its advantages and negative effects."" For instance, black rice, which helps people fight cancer and diabetes, is abundantly available in Manipur at Rs 60 per kg. A kilo of black rise costs Rs 600 in New Delhi. The traditional shampoo, chinghi, produced from rice water and herbs, can also be sold outside the state. Its cost of production is negligible and is sold locally at Rs 25 per 500 ml. ""Local entrepreneurs and marketers need to be promoted to market these natural products,"" said the chief secretary. Additional chief secretary W.L. Hansing said the state has a rich biodiversity consisting of medicinal plants, herbs and shrubs. However, a comprehensive scientific survey is necessary and the forest department and biodiversity board needed to take necessary measures, he added. P.N. Prasad, the principal chief conservator of forest, said Manipur was well known because of the Siroy lily and sangai. ""If we do not protect them, they will be extinct one day. Hence, biodiversity is an important issue in the state."" ""Our life depends on forests. Every vegetable is grown in the hill forests of the state. But the people cut down trees and kill birds and animals resulting in the failure of horticulture and forestry. This should be strictly prohibited and people should be made aware of the importance of biodiversity,"" he said. ""In Tamenglong district, Amur falcons eat up all the insects. Hence, there is no need of pesticides or insecticides,"" he added. ""Manipur's medicinal plants and forest products can be a source of livelihood. We need to appoint collectors of medicinal plants for export. Export of furniture and crafts can be promoted by providing transit permission."" In today's session, Abdul Kareem, the assistant director, FRLHT, Bangalore, talked on Species Enlisted Based on inputs from Resource Persons and Selection of Species for Assessment."
58e53d187be9e05a951f63b4,Populism drives BJD at 19,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161226/jsp/frontpage/story_126809.jsp,2016-12-26,"Bhubaneswar, Dec. 25: Led by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, the BJD finds itself going strong and much ahead of its rivals in spite of several controversies dogging the party, as it gears up to celebrate its 19th foundation day tomorrow. The chief minister, who turned anti-incumbency on its head in the 2014 elections winning a stunning 117 seats in the 147 strong Assembly, has during this period weathered many a storm successfully while making short work of his rivals. His USP has been a clean image and ability to sustain a slew of welfare programmes in the face of financial crunch. This might have earned him the sobriquet ""Naveen the populist"" but it has kept his popularity undiminished among the masses. That he remains the darling of the people was proved with his party winning the civic polls at 12 places across the state since the Assembly verdict gave him a record fourth term in office in 2014. He campaigned in the municipal polls unfazed by the Opposition campaign that centred around the multi-crore mining scam being probed by the CBI which arrested, among others, a sitting MP and MLA of his party. ""He is one chief minister whose image has remained untainted by sca-ndals since he stepped into politics 20 years ago. People are convinced that he has zero tolerance for corruption and that he means business,"" said BJD Rajya Sabha member Narendra Swain. ""The Opposition have been targeting him since he came to power but they will never be successful."" But Naveen has struggled hard to reach the unassailable position he enjoys now. His fourth term has been the most difficult with one controversy after another rocking his government. Even as he was grappling with the problem of malnutrition deaths in the tribal-dominated Nagada village, Japanese encephalitis assumed epidemic proportions in Malkangiri district providing fodder to the Opposition. Then, 27 people were killed in a fire at a major hospital in Bhubaneswar with fingers being pointed at the then health minister Atanu Saby-asachi Nayak. But before the controversy could snowball into a crisis, Naveen got rid of Nayak, taking the sting out of the Opposition's campaign. At the moment, his government is battling a sex scandal with a video clip purportedly showing Bhubaneswar mayor Ananta Narayan Jena in a compromising position doing the rounds of social media. But the chief minister remains unfazed secure in the knowledge that people trust him and the good work that he has been doing. His welfare schemes, including cheap rice for people, Rs 5-a-meal for the poor in the cities and the Mamta project to help pregnant women, have brought him closer to the masses. His generosity seems to have grown manifold with the BJD's campaign for the upcoming panchayat elections on in full swing. Naveen, who has stolen to march over his rivals by touring almost all the district of the state even before panchayat poll dates are announced, has been cleverly targeting his government's resources at the poor. Last July, he decided to bring three lakh more people under the social security net at an additional expense of Rs 115 crore. He has also come up with more populist programmes such as Biju Atma Nijukti Yojana and Special Employment Generation Programme. All these have endeared him to the voters and he has succeeded in blunting the edge of the Opposition's criticism on the issue of his government not doing its bit to promote Odia by offering online Odia Cerification Courses to Odias living abroad. Even on the industrial front, the BJD government has succeeded in refurbishing its image following the withdrawals of Posco and ArcelorMittal by attracting fresh investments through well-organised conclaves in Bhubaneswar and Bangalore. ""No wonder we are ahead of our rivals,"" said BJD Rajya Sabha member Narendra Swain. But such claims are contested by rivals in BJP and Congress. ""Thanks to large-scale corruption, the BJD today seems to be on ventilator support. The chief minister should stop bragging about his achievements,"" said BJP national secretary Suresh Pujari. Former state Congress president Jaydev Jena agreed. ""His brand of populism has a short life. People will soon see through his game."""
58e53d8e7be9e05a951f645d,Calcutta copes with Cash Wash,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161110/jsp/calcutta/story_118358.jsp,2016-11-10,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement on Tuesday evening that currency notes in denominations of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 wouldcease to become legal tender from midnight triggered a gamut of emotions in Calcutta  from a chief minister incensed to insidiousmoney changers fleecing foreigners. Metro reporters hit the cash trail on Wednesday to mirror the citys moods The first thing an eminent Calcuttasurgeon did on reaching his workplace on Wednesday morning was consult the head of the private hospitals accounts department on what to do with the cash pile of Rs 40 lakh he had at home. How do I transfer the money into my account? he asked. Ditto many other doctors who had previously never worried about being called into question for accepting payments in cash and not showing it in their financial statements. Some called their tax consultants and the rest their lawyers to find out how to save their cash from becoming trash or tax fodder. A doctor friend of mine told me that he is planning to pay his staff their salaries for one year so that they can deposit those amounts in their individual accounts, said an official of a private hospital along the Bypass. Some doctors were advised by their consultants to wait and watch. You have 50 days, relax! a consultant quoted his financial adviser as saying. Not all doctors are losing sleep, though. I am paid by the hospital I work in, just like someone in a corporate set-up. I dont have anything to be worried about but those with cash at home must be jittery, said a consultant working full-time at a private hospital. A few contemplated making flight bookings in cash for foreign vacations. At least two lawyers with unaccounted for cash called their friends in the Supreme Court to find out whether anyone had filed a PIL against the Modi governments decision! Discharge cancelled and admission refused. This was the story across private hospitals on Wednesday. Payment counters at several hospitals displayed notices saying that notes in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 were no longer accepted, leaving those with spending limits on their debit or credit cards in a bind. Some hospitals had sent out text messages on Tuesday evening, advising families of patients lined up for discharge the next day to pay in cash until midnight. Some managed to beat the deadline but most couldnt.  Bangladesh nationals in Calcuttafor treatment suffered the most. Halima Khatun Parul, 37, of Munsiganj in Bangladesh was to be discharged from Peerless Hospital at noon. She had undergone laparoscopic surgery and the bill for her treatment was Rs 1.29 lakh, out of which about Rs 30,000 wasdue. My husband has Rs 500 notes with him that the hospital wouldnt accept. He has gone to New Market to exchange the money, said Halima. Thalassaemia patient Akhtar Hossain, 33, from Dhaka needed to get admitted to the same hospital for spleen surgery, but his family didnt have enough Rs 100 notes to make the required deposit. Luckily for Akhtar, the hospital made an exception for him. We can admit a patient without a deposit. But what do we do when someone is ready for discharge and the persons family cant pay in anything other than cash? said an official of another private hospital. Gopal Kanti De, 60, from Chittagong in Bangladesh landed in Calcutta on Tuesday night with two family members. He had three confirmed tickets on the Sealdah Rajdhani Express to New Delhi for Wednesday, but has decided to return home rather than proceed to the capital for a scheduled medicalcheck-up. I have cancelled our train tickets and we are returning to Bangladesh on Thursday. There is no other option because I can only pay in cash, he said. Michael Muennich, a German tourist, arrived in India with his parents in the middle of October. He learnt about Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes ceasing to be legal tender when he went to the reception of his Calcutta hotel on Wednesday morning to settle the bill. I thought the lady at the reception was joking! said the 43-year-old from Berlin. Muennich then went from one foreign exchange shop to another but could not get two Rs 1,000 notes changed. One shop near New Market was ready to accept a Rs 500 note provided I settled for Rs 400 in exchange value, he recounted. A New Town syndicate leaders iPhone hasnt stopped ringing since Tuesday evening. I have received at least a hundred calls from my boys. They want to know what to do with the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. I have asked them to hold on to the notes as of now, he said. Syndicates that supply construction material and labour to various sites  often using force to get the contracts  deal only in cash and charge more than the market rates. One syndicate leader said he had advised all his acolytes to deposit small amounts of money in their family members bank accounts from November 11. As of now, we have almost Rs 40 lakh in cash, he admitted. Tea estates in the Dooars and Terai region withdraw cash from banks to pay wages to their workers every fortnight or weekly. Since Rs 20,000 is the maximum that can be withdrawn in a week till November 24, these estates are clueless how to pay wages. Several estates are supposed to make fortnightly wage payments in the next two to three days and have already withdrawn cash, mostly in denominations of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500. They cannot disburse these notes now, said Sumantra Guha Thakurta, secretary of the Dooars Branch of the Indian Tea Association. Customers who prefer making high-value purchases upwards of Rs 1 lakh in cash were conspicuous by their thin presence at the Quest Mall on Wednesday, leaving luxury stores worried that this might be a long-term trend. Employees of three outlets at the Syed Amir Ali Avenue mall said business was down compared to any other weekday. Nearly 80 per cent of our customers buy high-value goods in cash. A few of them walked in today only to enquire if we were still accepting currency in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, said a salesperson. The manager of another store said he feared there would be little business till at least the end of this week. Customers buying goods worth Rs 1 lakh or even Rs 1.5 lakh in cash is not unusual in our store. The decision to put Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes out of circulation might deter these people from making high-value purchases and we will be hit hard. Goods worth less than Rs 2 lakh can be bought without the buyer producing a PAN card. But Modis surgical strike on hoarding currency may have put paid to the old ploy of turning black money white with a high-value cash purchase such as a luxury watch, a pair of shoes or whatever. In a series of tweets, Mamata targeted Prime Minister Modi for triggering what she said was a disaster. Roads are closed, markets shut, patients not being admitted to private hospitals, millions affected, she tweeted, comparing the decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes with an all-India unannounced strike. Midway through the criticism, she slipped in a plea. I once more appeal to the Govt to withdraw this hasty decision, she wrote. Ice was on demand more than fish in most markets on Wednesday as the sudden shortage of usable currency seemed to curb the Bengalis craving for a piece of katla on the lunch plate. Footfall at markets remained low through the day, although some regular buyers were saved by traders who sold fish on credit or even accepted Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes. At Maniktala, Ultadanga and most blocks of Salt Lake, markets bereft of the usual morning rush made for an unusual sight. The shortage of customers forced many fish traders to procure extra blocks of ice to preserve the stocks that they would have otherwise sold off in one morning. As realisation dawned that a scowl would do them no good, many of them started accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes rather than turn away regulars. Retired bank employee Sudarshan Sarkar, 63, was spotted bargaining with a fishmonger at the Maniktala market. I have only Rs 200. I left my Rs 500 notes at home thinking no one would accept them, he said. Prabir Choudhury, 52, bought a kilo each of prawn and topshe and handed the seller a Rs 1,000 note that was accepted. Teacher Indira Mukherjee, buying groceries in a Salt Lake market, didnt face any problem either. The grocer from whom I have been buying for ages gave me dal, rice and tea and accepted the Rs 500 note I gave him, she said. Chaos reigned at the toll booths on Vidyasagar Setu on Wednesday, queues in multiple lanes extending far beyond the usual. Every toll gate had about 20 vehicles in line around noon, each of them interminably still. People in eight out of 10 cars are trying to pay the toll with Rs 500 notes. We are having a difficult time dealing with this, an employee said. Apurba Das, riding a motorbike, was clutching a Rs 500 note even as he waited for his turn behind three cars. This is a government facility. If banks can accept notes of high denomination, why wont they? I didnt create the currency shortage, did I? he said. By evening, Delhi had announced the suspension of toll collection on national highways till Friday midnight. Told about the decision, an employee at the plaza said it would make no difference to traffic passing through Vidyasagar Setu. Toll here is collected by the HRBC, which is under the state transport department. So, the decision to suspend toll collection doesnt apply here, an official said. A working day without much work  this summed up the mood at banks across Calcutta on Wednesday. Carom, cups of tea and chatter kept employees busy at several bank branches. Interns at the Salt Lake branch of a private bank had all the time to ask questions and get familiar with the banking system, something they wouldnt have been able to do on a normal weekday. We waited for instructions for the better part of the day, said a senior employee of a bank in BBD Bag. Many bank branches received cash in notes of Rs 100 denomination, some more than once. A list of FAQs from the Reserve Bank of India was circulated too through the head offices of banks later in the day. There will be additional counters on Thursday for both deposit and exchange of notes, said an employee of a nationalised bank in central Calcutta. In the evening, the relaxed mood changed after the RBI announced that banks would be open this Saturday and Sunday. Outside a private bank on Central Avenue, two employees were heard grumbling about their cancelled plans for the weekend. Chowman, a restaurant chain serving Chinese cuisine, equipped delivery boys with card-swiping machines to beat the cash blues. We are telling customers that they can pay with cards even for home delivery, said the manager of the Chowman outlet at Golf Green. An employee at the Pizza Hut outlet on Camac Street said card-swiping machines were used for home delivery since morning, but the service was stopped in the evening because of a technical glitch. Several online shoppers told Metro that their cash-on-delivery orders frome-commerce giants had been put on hold. Food delivery app Swiggy did the same. We have switched off the COD option. We are trying to find a way to make things more convenient. For now, we are sticking to online payments through debit or credit card and wallets like Paytm and Mobikwik, said Anuj Bothra, city head, Swiggy. Swiggy does not use card-swiping machines for payment at the point of delivery. The gas station opposite Acropolis Mall on the Ruby-Rashbehari Avenue connector had received 411 notes of Rs 1,000 denomination and 1,528 notes of Rs 500, more than double the usual daily figure, before noon. By afternoon, employees at the station were heard asking everyone to buy fuel in multiples of Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 if they were not carrying Rs 100 notes. What can we do? Everyone is giving only Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. We have run out of change, said Biswanath Saha, an employee at the gas station. According to owner Amarendra Kumar Goswami, even autorickshaw drivers had switched from paying for fuel with a bunch of Rs 10 notes to Rs 500 for each refill. A booth located near the Karunamoyee bus stop in Salt Lake ran out of stock barely three hours after opening on Wednesday morning. There was a long queue since morning. Most people would grab a one-litre pack and hand me a Rs 500 note. I had a tough time giving change, said Swapan Ghosh, who runs the Mother Dairy outlet. Not only residents, even people headed for office made a beeline for the milk booth to get their Rs 500 notes broken into currency of smaller denominations. I had read on Facebook that milk booths would accept Rs 500 notes. I asked someone at the bus stop about the nearest booth and reached here, said Praveen Kumar, an engineer employed with a construction company. For some jewellers in town, Tuesday night was as big as Dhanteras. We received calls from several regular customers just before closing time, requesting us to stay open for a few hours. They came and bought a whole lot of jewellery, said the cashier of a central Calcutta jewellery store. And, yes, all the payments were in cash. What can we do if they insist (on paying in cash)? You cant turn back a customer, a jewellery store owner told Metro on Wednesday, winding up with a wink. Rs 400 for Rs 500 was the going exchange rate at many money changers on Marquis Street, the area that serves mainly Bangladeshi nationals. Not only were they making bigger profits, some were also seen pushing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes with a take-it-or-leave-it line. For foreigners who desperately needed Indian currency to pay for basic necessities like food and lodging, there was little option but to accept whatever the money changers offered. Metro followed a man in a T-shirt and a pair of denims to a small foreign exchange shop and heard the following conversation: Money changer: We can only give you Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.  Money changer: No, we dont have any. You take Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes or go elsewhere. A man accompanying the foreigner advised him to accept the offer. Take it. Its the same everywhere. We will find some way. The customer paid Rs 10,000 worth of Bangladesh taka and accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in exchange."

The spacious room with high ceiling of the Police Canteen has crowd flowing in and out from 8 a.m. till late evening every day.Here, you will see police donning a different role to serve people. The men in khaki so used to holding rifles and lathis have taken up the hospitality sector with a motto of welfare. They serve you sumptuous food for just Rs. 10.The Police Canteen, established in 1989, will complete 28 years on January 26, 2017. The canteen that was started in order to serve food for the police personnel at an affordable price has slowly stretched its wings to accommodate general public.N. Hemachandran, Inspector of Police, said that the idea behind starting this canteen in the police headquarters was to provide healthy food at an affordable rate for the police. This canteen serves even the public at the same rate, he added.In plainclothes, an assistant sub-inspector police, a police constable and two home guards are busy giving away bills, serving food and cleaning the tables.Hot idly, pongal, puri is served for the breakfast. This is followed with soup and vada as snacks while vegetable biryani and curd rice is served for lunch.People can buy four idlis, pongal and three puris for Rs 10 each; vada is sold at Rs. 2 in this canteen. Even a plate full of vegetable biryani and curd rice is provided for Rs 10. People can have sumptuous food just for Rs 20, says G. Danasegaran, an unassuming Assistant Sub Inspector of Police.The canteen which served food to a maximum 100 people in the 1990s, now caters to a minimum of at least 500 people. There are several government offices and a hospital close to the canteen. Hence, the staff and public looking for affordable and clean food come here, he said.However, the number of staff in the canteen has come down. There were six home guards, 2 cooks, one head constable and two people to clean the table. Now, there are only two home guards, three civil staff, one police constable and an assistant sub inspector of police. More staff is required to serve to the increasing demand, said an official.A government staff, who had come with his child, said: I have come to pick up my son from the school. Before we go home, we decided to have mushroom soup from the canteen. It is just Rs. 5 and delicious.The police canteen, which was established with a loan of Rs 20,000 from the welfare board, now runs from its own sources of revenue . An official stated that the revenue earned from the canteen is used to run the next day business. The civil staff who work on daily wages are paid from the profit earned through the business, he said."

They were provided with blankets, water tanks, schoolbags, radio sets, stainless steel toilet seats, footballs and carrom boards under battallion commandant P.P. Pradeep's initiative. The battalion also provided 50 huts with solar-powered LED bulbs, and a poultry farm structure for the unemployed. The area is a Maoist stronghold where cops and government officials did not dare enter since January 2005 when superintendent of police K.C. Surendrababu and six other policemen were killed in a landmine blast. As a result, residents in the area continue to live in abject poverty. The situation has improved slightly only since2013 when the CRPF battalion was positioned around 15km from Narkol village in Bhimbandh. Villagers in the area, about 70km from the Munger district headquarters and around 250km south-east of Patna, have been living without health services, potable water, electricity, transport, proper roads or mobile network over the past decade. The villagers depend on the forest to live. ""It takes us a day to cut trees, two days to dry the bamboo and another two days to wrap the bundles. They are then taken to the Kharagpur market in Munger or the Laxmipur market in Jamui for sale,"" said Faguni Devei, 40, a resident of Narkol village, at the CRPF camp at Bhimbandh on Tuesday. ""We hardly get Rs 200 to Rs 300 for a bamboo bundle. With that we buy rice or wheat, salt and other edibles."" Many villagers mostly eat boiled roots five days a week. The other two days they may get rice and salt, Faguni said. ""We eat three kinds of roots - denar, chorgo and chakki - but as they are bitter we boil them in water for hours and cool them for 12 more hours. We eat the boiled roots with some salt the day after,"" she said. Villagers have to walk about 20km to reach doctors in the neighbouring village of Laxmipur in Jamui district. Many are forced to ferry patients on cotscarried on shoulders. ""In all tribal villages near Bhimbandh forest, treatment is by the mercy of God,"" said Sukhni Devi, 55, of Narkol village . Water bodies rot with leaves and waste, but there is no other option for drinking water. Water-borne diseases are common. Gauri Kumari, 17, said no one had enough money to buy mosquito nets, and cerebral malaria ravages the villages every year. Munger district magistrate Udai Kumar Singh, however, denied that was the true picture. ""It is a lie, 100 per cent, that tribals still eat roots,"" he told The Telegraph. ""They are trying to defame the government. Such poverty doesn't exist there."" He conceded that medical facilities there were at best poor, but added: ""Doctors and paramedical staff do not dare not enter the Naxal-infested forest villages. Whatever be the state of health care, it is the tribals' fault."""

Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, Nov. 12: Nobel laureate Richard John Roberts today championed the claims of the controversial golden rice and said he was hopeful that India under Narendra Modi's leadership would introduce it. Golden rice is the world's first Vitamin A-enriched rice. The controversial rice is a genetically-modified (GM) variety that is being developed by scientists in various countries, including Bangladesh. Roberts was speaking at KIIT University's 12th annual convocation. He said: ""Activists in India have opposed GM crops. For a while, the government was also against it. But now, it seems that the government will be much more reasonable."" Although some GM crops, such as GM brinjal and GM cotton, have been introduced in India, the move has invited criticism from many quarters. It has been alleged that GM crops lead to organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated ageing and infertility. Roberts, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993, is popular for his campaign for GM crops. At the event, he also took a dig at Greenpeace - the environmental organisation that has long been opposing GM crops. ""There is no evidence that GM crops are dangerous. Greenpeace is in the business of scaring people by calling it 'too dangerous'. People are going to starve if they do not introduce these crops. If technology can prevent starvation, why not use it?"" he said. The golden rice has been infused with a gene that produces betacarotene and can be used to address vitamin A deficiency. Trials are underway for the grain's commercial release within the next couple of years. Roberts said it would help curb deficiency of vitamin A in children. When asked why GM crops were being introduced only in developing countries and not developed countries, Richard said countries in Europe did not need these corps, while India and countries in Africa needed it. Addressing the graduating students of the 2015-16 batch, Roberts said:""I wanted to be a detective when I was a child, but later developed an interest in science. Never be afraid to try something new and always follow your heart."""
58e53e737be9e05a951f658e,Retail vs wholesale battle,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161116/jsp/jharkhand/story_119375.jsp,2016-11-16,"Steel city grocery shops, the lifeline of every household, are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Owners like Ganga Prasad Shao, whose outlet is at Bistupur market, has been accepting old currency notes from his loyal customers. But, his supplier, a wholesaler, refuses extend that courtesy to him. Subhas Mondal's worry is on the same lines. His problem is that the wholesaler he buys from isn't chasing him for payments, fearing he will be dumped with old currency. ""But where will I generate cash to pay our wholesalers, especially when we are accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from regular customers,"" he asked. There are hundreds of retailers who are facing the same predicament as Shao and Mondal after the demonetisation of high-value currency was announced a week ago. Mondal said he wasn't sure if he would be able to stock up food-grain and edible oil at his shop next month. ""As we are dependent on cash transactions, both with our customers as well as wholesalers, we cannot suddenly switch over to doing business in cheques. Moreover, we have to look after the interest of our regular customers too. Hence, we are left with no option but to accept banned currencies,"" he said. Several other retailers claimed that wholesalers had stopped supplies. ""I had gone to bring 10 tins of mustard oil, but returned with only two as the wholesaler refused to give me the stuff on credit. I had no other option but to pay cash,"" said Murlidhar Agrawal, a grocer of Sakchi market. Deepak Bhalotia, a rice trader with an office and godown at Krishi Bazaar Samiti at Parsudih, confirmed that wholesalers like him had stopped supplies and weren't accepting payments in old notes. ""We do our business with rice traders in Bengal, Odisha and Chhatisgarh in cheque. We also pay our traders in cash, but when the government has banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, why should we accept them from the retailers,"" he asked, adding that they were following this practice since the morning of November 9, the day after the demonetisation was announced. Bhalotia said the government was in the process of releasing new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. ""Let retailers come with these notes and we will resume our business.

Picture by Rajesh Shrivastava Nov. 12: Villagers allegedly looted a ration shop in Madhya Pradesh after its owner refused to accept 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, as people's patience seemed to wear thin at many places in the country after four days of the cash crisis spawned by demonetisation. Munnilal Ahirwar says he watched helplessly last evening as over 100 villagers, many of them women, looted bags of wheat, rice and sugar from his store at Bardua in Chhattarpur district. Ahirwar was allegedly roughed up each time he raised his voice or tried to physically stop the looters. ""I recognised most of the faces, but will the police act?"" he asked today. Police from the nearest outpost, 6km away, arrived this morning and registered a case of looting against unknown people. Long queues were seen at bank branches for the third consecutive day throughout Madhya Pradesh, while most ATMs remained non-functional for the fourth day, adding to the popular frustration. For the past three days, most rural areas have received no cash from big cities like Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which are battling their own cash problems. A video clip went viral on the social media, purportedly showing the police thrashing people who had lost their cool after waiting hours outside a bank in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh today. The cops are seen beating the people with canes and belts outside the State Bank of India branch in Porsa. The customers had tried to barge into the branch around 3pm, apparently angered by a policeman on duty allowing some people in through the backdoor, an eyewitness said. ""No one has approached us with a complaint yet, but I'm going to look into the incident and if the policemen are found guilty, they will be punished,"" superintendent of police Vineet Khanna said. In Chhattarpur's Motwan mohalla, Mathura Prasad Ahirwar was able to perform the last rites of his wife Raj Bai only after neighbours pooled the necessary money. His granddaughter Anuradha said the cost of the necessary materials such as milk, yoghurt, honey, ghee, wood and sandalwood came to more than Rs 2,200 but the shopkeeper refused to accept the demonetised notes. Eventually, the funeral was performed after sunset, which is not the preferred time according to local custom. In Sagar district, retired BSNL official Vinod Kumar Pande, 69, suddenly collapsed and died after standing in queue for an hour at a Union Bank branch. He was carrying Rs 4,000 in large currency in his pocket that he had wanted to exchange. Customers ran wild when a bank at Sujdu Chungi in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, delayed the exchange of the demonetised currency yesterday saying it lacked 100 and 50-rupee notes. Some people damaged the cash counter and stoned the police when they arrived. The mob also damaged a government bus and two private cars on the street outside. Later, the police carried out a baton-charge that left Khatiza Begum, 30, and Ayesha, a two-year-old girl, injured. Some people claimed the police had also fired in the air outside the bank. During the vandalism, a few customers chanted "" Mera desh bigad raha hai (My country is deteriorating)"" - a take-off of the slogan ""Mera desh badal raha hai (My country is changing)"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted after completing two years in office in May. Eyewitnesses said the problem began at 11am when an iron net attached to the teller's window, which some customers had grabbed as they jostled to get closer to the counter, came off under their collective weight. Someone then smashed the glass pane at the counter, prompting nervous bank officials to call the police. ""The bus driver and the bank manager have lodgedcases against unidentified people,"" circle police officer Tejveer Singh said. ""We are trying to identify and arrest them."" He said the bank received cash after an hour. Some 200 angry customers waiting outside a State Bank of Travancore branch in Kerala's Kollam district allegedly broke a glass door today after the bank decided to down shutters because of the heavy rush. The police are questioning several people. Long queues formed outside bank branches across Kerala for the third day, amid complaints that the ATMs were running out of cash. An elderly man had collapsed and died while queuing to deposit cash yesterday at Haripad in Alappuzha district, while another man fell to his death from a building housing a bank branch in Kannur. People clashed with bank officials at several places in Gujarat, prompting police baton-charges and detention. Customers complained that several ATMs were closed and that banks were exchanging the demonetised notes with coins and very small-denomination currencies. ""Even hospitals are refusing to accept the larger notes,"" Ramesh Agarwal said. ""Bank officials said they had run out of the new 2,000-rupee notes and only had coins,"" said Bipin Patel. ""They have given me coins for Rs 4,000, which is very difficult to carry."" Rajesh Shah, a senior citizen, said: ""We stood in queues for two days.... We have Rs 3 lakh in our bank account but can't buy essentials. Modi should have made proper arrangements for cash."" The police caned customers who had clashed with bank officials when they refused to dispense money at a branch at Shihori in Banaskantha district. A similar incident was reported from Abdasa in Kutch. A senior assistant of the Kolhapur zilla parishad in Maharashtra was arrested on the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs 35,000 that contained 17 newly introduced Rs 2,000 currency notes, officials said. Chandrakant Sawardekar, 45, had allegedly promised to help the complainant secure a promotion as a principal in a zilla parishad-run school."

Poet-saint Andal speaks of akkaraadisil in her Nachiyar Thirumozhi, and of pongal in the Thiruppavai.At a recent event titled Akkaraadisil and Andal at The Park hotel, guests were served akkaraadisil , venn pongal , samba dosai (a speciality of Azhagar Koil), Kancheepuram koil idli , chutney and yummy gothsu without onions or garlic, using only traditional ingredients, just like the recipes followed in temples.The old waysFood traveller Rakesh Raghunathan explained that the dishes had been prepared traditionally, on wood-based stoves. You cant find tomatoes or red chillies in temple recipes. We have inscriptions on the walls of the Tirupati temple for a recipe of pongal that is offered to the deity. At the Srirangam Ranganathar temple, the akkaraadisil is cooked in earthen pots that are used only once, he explained.Historian and writer Pradeep Chakravarthy spoke of Andals Nachiyar Thirumozhi, and of her prayer to Sri Azhagar in Thirumaliruncholai, a hill temple near Madurai, in which she promised to offer him 100 thada s (thats equivalent to a pond) of butter and 100 thada s of sweet akkaraadisil if the deity united her with her Lord. The tale goes that she finally becomes one with her Lord but the promise remained unfulfilled. It was Saint Ramanuja who instituted a festival on the 27th day of Margazhi at the Azhagar temple, where butter and akkaraadisil were offered even today, he added.Easy does itThough akkaraadisil is such a tough dish to make, Mr. Raghunathan showed how to make quick and easy version. Here is the recipe: Pressure cook one cup of rice and 1/4 cup of toasted moong dal together. Add a cup of water to three cups of powdered jaggery and strain it. Boil two cups of whole milk with three cups of water. Mix a whiff of nutmeg, the cooked rice and dal , the strained jaggery, cardamom, fried cashew nuts and raisins. Alongside, Mr. Raghunathan sang verses of Andals poetry as Mr. Chakravarthy explained their meaning."
58e53f607be9e05a951f66c3,Cash crunch strains food chain,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161115/jsp/frontpage/story_119272.jsp,2016-11-15,"Uday Hazra is an affluent farmer. His fields are flush with harvest-ready paddy but he cannot hire day labourers. Shiva Sambhu Das is a day labourer who works on farms to earn Rs 100 and 2kg rice a day. He needs money to feed his family and pay for his children's education. Sarashi Jasan Samanta's shop is brimming with fertilisers he had stocked ahead of the potato-sowing season. But he is not getting customers. Samir Sahana runs a poultry unit, but the demand for his chickens has dipped. Nov. 14: The fates of Hazra, Samanta, Sahana and Das are bound together by cash, the absence of which is disrupting the rural food chain. Unless cash flows from Hazra to Das, the labourer cannot harvest the farmer's ripe crop. If the crop is not harvested, the farmer will not be able to buy and sow potato seeds, which means Samanta's fertilisers will not find a taker. Unless the farmer, farmhand and the fertiliser supplier complete the economic jigsaw, Sahana's meat will remain unsold. Cash, indeed, is the binding force that holds life together in rural Bengal - and in most of India's hinterland. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana are residents of Burdwan's Kendur village, around 140km from Calcutta. The plight of the four residents is a textbook case of the impact of the demonetisation - and the resultant currency crunch - announced by the Prime Minister on November 8. ""I cannot get my paddy fields harvested because I have to pay around Rs 1,000 daily to six or seven labourers. I have to harvest my crop soon as the paddy is ready and time is running out to sow potato seeds. But I don't have the money to buy the seeds or the fertiliser,"" said Hazra, who can be categorised as a big farmer in Bengal. The 62-year-old has a two-storey house that bears all the signs of solvency, from a double-door fridge to a water filter. His cowshed houses 10 cows, and prime gobindobhog paddy fills the silo in his courtyard. The farmer has one new Rs 2,000 note and several Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Hazra spoke of a stifling feeling of cashlessness. Told that his home and surroundings did not suggest such a sorry state of affairs, he said that for rural households, savings meant what was grown in the fields. ""I have 110 packs of quality paddy at home, which I retained after the last harvest so that I could sell them this winter at a better price. But there are no buyers. Even if I find some, they will insist that I accept the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" Hazra said. At Badamtala in Burdwan town, where the big rice traders have their gaddis (offices), several traders said the price of paddy had started falling after the demonetisation announcement. The price of gobindobhog has dipped from around Rs 2,200 a pack of 60kg to Rs 2,000. Other crops too are fetching lower prices, the traders said. Although the big farmers are often accused of exploiting the labourers, they remain the drivers of the rural economy, where the organised public and private sectors hardly generate any employment. By engaging in agriculture, they provide a livelihood to others in the village ecosystem. In neighbouring Hooghly district, another fertile zone where farmers grow three to four crops, labourer Rabin Sing is losing around Rs 500 every day this harvesting season. ""I work in two shifts during harvesting as I have to feed a family of four.... The farmer I work for gave me Rs 500 saying it can be changed in the bank. I lost a day trying to do that but couldn't exchange it. The farmers don't have money,"" said Sing, who is praying for a speedy return to normality. After demonetisation, he has been left with his life's savings of Rs 3,000 - two Rs 1,000 notes and two Rs 500 notes. After the experience at the bank, he deposited the money with two kirana stores from where he will buy his monthly provisions. ""They said they would give me provisions against this money.... But I don't have any cash. I can't buy medicine, fish or egg,"" Sing said, sitting near a kirana shop in Mirzapur, 50km from Calcutta, where 95 per cent people depend on agriculture. The shop had become the venue for an evening adda . Soon, stories of inconvenience were being exchanged. But some in the audience protested, emphasising that a few days' pain was worth the bigger gain in the future. When this correspondent asked about black money and why it was bad for the economy, Sanjay Patra, a carpenter, said: ""I don't know all that... but rich people will now face the music."" What about the misery of his fellow villagers? It's just a matter of a few days, he said. But P. Sainath, the founding editor of People's Archive of Rural India and a veteran journalist who has written extensively on poverty, said: ""The Prime Minister is talking about bearing pain for 50 days.... You can imagine how long it will take. But there is little doubt that the impact on the rural economy is going to be devastating."" Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India, predicted that the demonetisation's effect on the rural economy and country's informal sector could reduce GDP growth by one percentage point this year. ""Whatever you are witnessing in rural Bengal is not unique; it's happening across India as the sowing season is going to start and people have no money to buy seeds, fertilisers or pesticides,"" Sen said. Textbook economics says that the surplus generated in agriculture sustains the other sectors by generating multiplier effects, which help the economy grow. As the rural economy is cash-based, the first casualty is spending power. ""I was in Chikalthana, on the edge of Aurangabad (Maharashtra). Nobody has cash there. There is chaos and a law-and-order situation is developing,"" Sainath said. Some analysts have been saying that rural India's ""resilience"", arising from an informal credit system that facilitates cashless transactions among acquaintances, will help it cope. Hazra, Das, Samanta and Sahana agreed that left without cash, they had been able to survive the past six days because of the credit system. Mirzapur residents echoed the assessment. ""At the village level, a personalised credit system works. But it cannot sustain as the moment you are out of the village, it doesn't work,"" said Sainath. Sen said that although the rural population can tide itself over the crisis for some time, its indebtedness would grow and make the villagers more vulnerable to moneylenders. ""The indebtedness in the economy is growing, and it's not a good sign,"" he added."
58e53fb97be9e05a951f6734,Odisha Whispers,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161113/jsp/odisha/story_118935.jsp,2016-11-13,"Chief minister Naveen Patnaiks statement at a recent literary event that he was not grooming anyone as his successor has set tongues wagging. While the talk in the BJD circles is that Naveen is not keen on creating a second-string leadership which could take over from him in the event of an unexpected emergency, for Opposition leaders, the statement is a confirmation of their long-held belief that the BJD is a one-man party. Some others said Naveen was following in the footsteps of his father, Biju Patnaik, who was twice the chief minister of the state. Like father like son. Biju babu, too, was abhorrent to the idea of grooming a successor. But that can be dangerous, remarked a leader. The rift between Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra appear to be widening. The latest instance of their growing differences between is Mohapatras criticism of the young minister for praising chief minister Naveen Patnaik at a literary do in the capital last week. Pradhans description of Nave-en as a simple man at the event organised by a daily newspaper, got Mohapatras goat. Though most other BJP leaders chose to ignore Pradhans remark, Mohapatra, who loves to hate the chief minister, reacted vehemently saying it would have a demoralising impact on party cadres. Pointing out that Mohapatra and Pradhan had sparred in the past as well, BJP sources said the latest episode could worsen their relations. Many eyebrows shot up when senior BJD leader and excise minister Damodar Rout refused to sit on the dais along with his peers during a crucial meeting of the party on the Mahanadi water sharing issue in Bhubaneswar last week. Citing knee pain, which everyone present realised was a lame excuse, he refused to leave his seat in the front row below the dais even though colleagues such as mass education minister Debi Mishra and BJD spokesperson Surya Narayan Patro kept pleading with him. Sources said this was Routs way of sending a message to the party leadership, which had denied him an opportunity to speak on the Mahanadi issue during a debate in the Assembly. This happened during the monsoon session of the Assembly, and it still rankles him, said a BJD leader. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik lauded the Modi governments move to demonetise currency notes of higher denominations describing it as a bold step on his Facebook page. This drew some interesting comments, some not so flattering. Some of his followers suggested that he should have another look at his welfare schemes such as the cheap rice one that was making people lazy. Please stop Two Rupee Rice scheme. Odias were known as fighters earlier, and in the past 17 years, they have been just lazy and non-productive. Run some schemes to make them active, said a follower. Another said: Odisha agar ek family he, app uska baap ho...aur kisi family ka baap nehin chahta he unka beta kha pike ghar me soye (If Odisha is a family you are like its father and no father would like to see his son just eat and sleep). The death of firebrand Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra aka Lulu has further widened the schism in the state party. While a section of party leaders such as Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati have openly voiced their displeasure at the unfair treatment meted out to the late leader, Lulus supporters reportedly heckled AICC general secretary in charge of Odisha affairs B.K. Harip-rasad when he arrived in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday to broker a truce between Pradesh Congress Committee chief Prasad Harichandan and Opposition leader Narasingha Mishra, who do not see eye to eye over several issues. The signs are ominous for the party in view of the panchayat elections a few months later, said a party leader. Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram is working overtime to ensure that the BJP does well in his constituency - Sundargarh - in the upcoming panchayat polls. Sources said that when the minister was not in the state he remote controlled his constituency from Delhi, issuing instructions to his followers and even speaking to officials when required. Oram is being extra cautious this time as his former disciple, Bhimsen Choudhury, who has represented the Bonei Assembly seat in the past, is now in the BJD camp. Bonei is a key Assembly segment of Sundargarh Lok Sabha constituency and Choudhury knows the area like the back of his hand. Oram cannot afford to take chances, said a BJP leader."

""Buying of xali rice (first crop) under the state's paddy procurement programme will start from January 1 and continue till March 31, 2017. Boro rice will be procured from May onwards. The period of milling and delivery of customised milled rice will begin thereafter and continue till September 30,"" a source in the department said.The state had, however, failed to meet the procurement target of about one lakh MT last year (2015-16), falling short by 37,000 metric tonnes. ""Last year, only two agencies were engaged, with FCI procuring 52,000MT and ASAMB buying 11,000MT,"" he said.The sources said Assam, a rice-surplus state since 2010-11, had produced 51.93lakh MT rice in 2013-14. In the previous year (2012-13), the output was pegged at 47.16 lakh MT. According to records, rice productivity (kg/hectare) saw a noticeable jump during 2012-13 and 2014-15.""The objective of the paddy procurement programme is to ensure that the farmers get the minimum support price, a rate fixed by the government to protect the producers/farmers against excessive fall in price during the bumper production years. Secondly, the procurement is done so that Assam is not dependent on the public distribution system of another state,"" the source said."

(Prashant Mitra) It's said that good food and a great laugh keep us going. This was evident on Statehood Day at Vikas Mela, Morabadi grounds in Ranchi, as Vandana Kispotta, a tribal master chef from Garhwa, won hearts with her chawal pitha, steamed rice flour dumplings stuffed with chana dal, and dhuska, fried roundels prepared from a batter of ground rice and chana dal. Kispotta, who runs a self-help group and takes cookery classes, was among the 10 woman tribal chefs from various districts to set up live food counters at the three-day Vikas Mela under the aegis of the state art and culture department, that ended on Tuesday. Beaming as visitors praised her crisp dhuska and soft steamed chawal pitha, Kispotta said: "" Humlog pehli baar yahan aye hain, logo ko bahut pasand aa raha hain (We have come here for the first time, people are liking our food a lot)."" Equally elated was Lily Oraon of Ranchi district, who prepared fresh chutneys from tomato, coriander leaves and beng saag to be served with piping hot traditional marhua rotis.

58e540d77be9e05a951f689a,'Not against govt but system',http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161231/jsp/odisha/story_127757.jsp,2016-12-31,"You are demanding pension for farmers. Why are your reasons for making such a demand? We want social security allowance for farmers and it should be given from the age of 20. One has the fundamental right to livelihood and the government has to protect it. This has been enshrined in the Constitution itself. The person, who is taking the responsibility to fill the stomach of the nation, cannot be left in a lurch. Even a peon, after his retirement, gets decent amount as pension. While soldiers, doctors, officers and government employees at various levels get pension, why not the farmers? They dedicate their entire life for the development of the nation as well to feed the country. Don't they deserve pension? Your demand for prestige to farmers appears a vague slogan. No one can demand prestige for himself or herself. It is earned... Yes, I do agree with that. But with the passage of time, many things have changed. Here, the masters are subjected to humiliation and the government employees, considered public servants, are ruling the roost. They survive on the taxpayers' money, but because of the power and authority they enjoy, the farmers have to come and bend before them. These things have to be changed. You are talking about remunerative prices... Yes, we are aware of it. As we are raising the demand, the state has taken up the issue and the farmers are being benefited. Our motto is that it's not the government that should fix the price of the farmers' produce. Let the farmers fix the price for their produce themselves deciding the profit margin. We are a market-driven society. Is it possible here? Yes. The government should intervene so that farmers get the minimum justified price for their produce. When the private sector takes maximum retail price for their products, why can the farmers not be given the just price for their products? There are many kinds of farmers - rich, small and marginal farmers. Who are you fighting for? Our fight is for those who till the land. We are not for landlords. But in Odisha, there are few landlords. The state government is going to introduce land rights for sharecroppers. Do you support that? An attempt is being made to create a division in the society by driving a wedge between the sharecroppers and marginal landowners. We all should be aware of it. Our demand is that you first allocate 25 per cent of the state's budget for farmers and then we will decide how the land will be divided among the sharecroppers and the landowners. First give us our share, then we will decide what to do on this issue. You are evading the issue... No. We are with all those who cultivate the land. While the per capita income of the farmers at the national level is pegged at Rs 6,426, that of Odisha farmers hovers around Rs 4,976. The state government, despite budgetary constraints, is going ahead with its Re 1-a-kg rice scheme. What is your opinion on it? The Re 1-a-kg rice scheme is kind of relief measure that should continue for a brief period but not forever. It's like throwing a loaf of bread before a dog... But the Re 1-a-kg rice scheme has successfully checked starvation deaths in Odisha. For the past few years, no case of starvation death has been reported in the state... I agree. But one should not think it's the only solution to bring a lasting change in the life of farmers. We must focus on how to improve the livelihood of farmers by bringing sustainable development and giving a boost to their sagging economy. Your agitation for the farmers' cause seems to have a political tone. It gives out the message that you are against the Naveen Patnaik government. We are not against any government. We are against the system, against the concept of development. We are raising some issues and want that they be addressed. We have to involve all kinds of people to make the movement a success. Let me make it clear that I am not joining electoral politics. I am openly saying that no government - neither the J.B. Patnaik government nor Naveen Patnaik government - has laid emphasis on development of agriculture. You seem to be also against industrialisation. How can the state grow otherwise? We should focus on small-scale industries and the development of agriculture. We should not focus only on setting up big industries by exhausting all our natural resources such as iron ore and bauxite. Just tell me, how Punjab has emerged as one of the economically advanced states in the county? It has been possible because they have given thrust on the development of agriculture.  Akshay, 50, a believer in Gandhian philosophy, spent many years at the Vinoba Bhave's Ashram in Wardha and did a diploma in Gandhian studies He had worked in Punjab when the insurgency was at its peak.

(Vijay Deo Jha) A famished Arun Kumar, visiting Ranchi from Jamshedpur, decided on an affordable roadside lunch because his wallet was lean on a cash-starved Monday afternoon. The 40-year-old private company employee settled for a plate of idli on Harmu grounds, gobbled down the steamed rice cakes and fished for Rs 40 to pay for his meal. Arun's surprise knew no bound when the eatery owner, Md Shahnawaz, told him that he could pay online. ""Sir, pay with Paytm if you wish. It is safe and secure,"" the idli-wallah said. The 30-something man, who started his roadside grub hub New South Indian Centre six months ago, decided to embrace the mobile wallet within a day of the Narendra Modi government demonetising high-value currency notes. Shahnawaz is not alone. Several vendors and traders in the capital are subscribing to Paytm and similar e-commerce websites and mobile applications to run their businesses without incurring losses. Harmu resident Shahnawaz said he had invested Rs 25,000 on his food stall, which had become a favourite hangout for young and old. He said he could not afford to turn away regular customers because they had no cash and so found a away around the predicament. ""I got lucky when I came across a Paytm employee. He helped me create an account and gave me the barcode, which is now displayed in front of my stall. On an average, around 100 people eat here and at least a dozen pay through Paytm. The amount reflects in my Paytm wallet and goes to my bank account. I don't have to queue up at the bank to deposit proceeds,"" Shahnawaz grinned. At Karam Chowk, 2km away, some 12 small-time traders now urge their customers to pay through e-wallet. Bhupesh Kumar Singh, who owns a garment store, said he adopted Paytm a couple of days. ""Last year, I had installed a card swipe machine, but there were no takers. Now, I insist on mobile wallets. Many are reluctant, but when I explain how it works, they become willing to give it a try,"" Singh said. A Paytm official said 90 employees of the e-commerce firm were working overtime to tap the Ranchi market. ""It is our promotional scheme. We have roped in around 1,500 shopkeepers. We generate their account and provide them with barcode. All a customer needs to do is install the Paytm app on smartphone, recharge the online wallet and scan the code,"" he added.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah met Union Ministers and officers in New Delhi on December 10 and sought the additional bonus. He said this would also help small farmers whose millet crops such as ragi and jowar were suffering losses. Karnatakas farmers produced nearly 62 per cent of the ragi produced in the country, he said. However, this has not come through. If the Union government had chipped in part of our cost, we would have been able to gather all the grain we want. But we have got no response yet. On the contrary, we are getting hints that we may not get much help, said a senior officer in the Ministry.A senior officer from New Delhi pointed out that jowar and ragi, with other millets, were getting MSP of Rs. 1,650, which is the highest among all foodgrains. Union government officers tell us there is no chance of a further increase, he said. We were hopeful of getting the subsidy as Karnataka was the first State to return the kerosene subsidy and got financial incentives in return, another officer said. The Karnataka government is offering Rs. 2,500 per quintal, after adding an incentive of Rs. 850 to farmers who are willing to sell. The Food and Civil Supplies Department officials say they have failed to collect the required quantity of jowar for distribution. We have succeeded largely in including parboiled rice and ragi in districts where they are consumed. But we are unable to procure jowar, said Harsha Gupta, Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies. Farmers wont sell the Maldandi white variety for the prices we offer and people do not eat the black hybrid variety that we can easily buy, he said. The government estimates that it needs a minimum of 3.5 lakh tonnes of jowar per year. However, it has not been able to buy even 10,000 tonnes in earlier rounds of procurement."
58e541937be9e05a951f69a3,Ration on credit in Karnataka,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161119/jsp/nation/story_120099.jsp,2016-11-19,"Bangalore, Nov. 18: Public distribution system beneficiaries in Karnataka will be able to buy their November quota of food grain and oil on credit. The aim is to provide immediate relief to the economically weaker sections struggling with little or no cash in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. However, the Congress government could offer the facility in December too if the crisis continued. ""If the availability of cash doesn't improve in December, we will extend the credit facility till the end of the year,"" food and civil supplies minister U.T. Khader said today. He said PDS beneficiaries would be able to avail themselves of the facility from tomorrow. Chief minister P.C. Siddaramiah had earlier asked his ministers to keep a watch on developments following the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. ""The urban poor may not be that badly hit as some of them have cash in hand. But it's the villagers and people living in highlands and the fringes of forests who have been badly affected by the demonetisation,"" Khader said. ""Things would have been better had co-operative banks been allowed to accept old notes as they have a good presence in rural areas,"" he added. The minister said labourers in tea and coffee estates and the agriculture sector were also facing difficulties. ""Their employers don't have cash to pay wages,"" Khader said. Those who will buy grain and oil on credit will have to pay the due amount when they purchase rations in January. Their accounts in the computerised public distribution system will reflect the outstanding amount. ""I hope cash will be easily available by January,"" the minister said. The state offers Above Poverty Line (APL) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) ration cards, depending on the annual income of the beneficiary. APL card-holders get 5kg of rice and an equal amount of wheatfor Rs 15 and Rs 10, respectively, a month. BPL card-holders get 30kg of free rice, besides subsidised sugar and edible oil. Villagers with no cooking gas get kerosene as well. Both APL and BPL card-holders will get the credit facility. Khader said the credit facility would not burden the government. ""Once the card-holders pay back the dues, ration shop owners will have to deposit the amount to the government,"" he said. The government spends Rs 42 crore a month to provide rations to APL and BPL card-holders through a network of more than 20,000 ration shops. Karnataka has so far issued around 35 lakh APL card and nearly a crore BPL cards. Ration shops are gearing up to meet the likely rush of customers once the facility kicks in tomorrow. Manjunath, who works in a ration shop in the east Bangalore neighbourhood of Doopanahalli, said he was aware of the credit facility and would adhere to the government order. Nagrathnamma, who ekes out a living by selling snacks near a slum in Ulsoor, just a few kilometres from the upmarket MG Road, can't believe she can buy rations on credit. ""Let me get it first,"" the mother of two said. ""I am yet to purchase my rations this month as I don't have enough money after paying my son's school fees,"" she said, adding her daily earnings had dropped from over Rs 300 a day to Rs 60 yesterday as the cash crunch as hit street vendors as well."

Paul, a faculty member in the paediatrics department of AIIMS, has suggested changes in the ingredients of the mid-day meals.The other alteration under consideration is a reduction in the quantity of grain - rice or wheat. Sources said several studies had suggested that children were not able to finish the food served in schools.The amount of vegetables and pulses will remain unchanged.If the proposals are implemented, the cost of cooking a primary-level meal will go up from Rs 4.13 to Rs 6.18. The cost of cooking an upper primary-level meal will increase from Rs 5.88 to Rs 8.88. The overall spending on the scheme will increase by 25 per cent.The Centre spends about Rs 11,000 crore a year on the mid-day meal scheme, which has helped increase the attendance rate in schools and arrested classroom hunger, according to several studies.T. Sundararaman, executive director at the National Health Systems Resource Centre that works on public health issues, welcomed the proposal.""Around 30 to 40 per cent of children are malnourished. Ghee has a lot of fat and calorific value. It is a good move,"" Sundararaman said.Asked if a higher quantity of ghee would make children obese, Sundararaman replied in the negative. ""Only 6 per cent students are obese. Such students may avoid ghee,"" he said.Food activist Deepa Sinha also hailed the proposal but cautioned that good-quality oil should be used.""If the oil quality is not good, it can contaminate the food. School principals have to be careful,"" she said.At a meeting of the empowered committee on the meal scheme on September 9, a representative of the Azim Premji Foundation had suggested that mid-day meals be served to students of Classes IX and X too. Some states and Union territories provide meals to students of these classes from their own resources."
