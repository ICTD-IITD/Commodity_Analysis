58f0fa31a3d24b3489ce64dd,Linking food and nutrition security,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Linking-food-and-nutrition-security/article16217399.ece,2016-11-08,"The euphoria around the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, seems to have dwindled. As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

In Uttar Pradesh, Ballia is most prone to arsenic contamination followed by Bahraich, Rae Bareli, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Meerut, Chandoli and many more.The technology is ready for field trials. Senior NBRI scientist Debasis Chakrabarty, who conducted the research recently, visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippine and discussed the possibilities of field trials. The institute in principal agreed to help in this regard.""The institute invited us to become familiar with ongoing research work at NBRI and has agreed in principle to conduct field trials subjected to clearance by governments of both countries,"" said Chakrabarty, head of the eight-member team, which carried out research published recently in an international journal 'Metallomics' published by 'Royal Society of Chemistry'.The scientists said the transgenic rice has 'arsenic methyl transferase', a gene isolated from a fungus that accumulates less arsenic and would be less toxic.He explained that arsenic present in groundwater percolates in soil during irrigation and contaminates rice with arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure through groundwater contamination affects more than 150 million people worldwide and over 500 million people in Ganga, Meghna and Brahmputra areas.Rice is the crop most susceptible to absorbing arsenic during cultivation. Cultivating rice varieties that accumulate less amount of arsenic can tackle the challenge of exposure to carcinogens (cancer causing elements) that affect population in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha."

The communication has been shared with the TOI on email.Tiwari is the first farm activist to be appointed as VNSSM chief, since the post is normally meant for an IAS officer. His letter says fictitious joint liability groups (JLGs) of farmers are being formed in collusion with some agro-processing companies. The JLGs are created using forged documents in the name of farmers, but the funds actually go to the companies engaged in ago-processing businesses.Most of the accounts have now turned NPAs and proceedings have been initiated against the non-existent JLGs, says the letter. The persons named in the group are not even aware of such loans, says Tiwari. The practice is undertaken by private as well as public sector banks.The letter alleges that some domestic as well as foreign banks have been granting farm loans against land as collateral security, but the money is diverted. Instead of being used in agricultural activities, the amount is used to create term deposits. This helps banks to meet farm loan targets without farmers getting money in their hands. There are schemes on extending finance as cash credit to urban cooperative societies, which also misuse the amount by turning the money into fixed deposits or finance businesses other than agriculture.The VNSSM letter has alleged that a huge amount is lent as agro-cash credits to big corporate houses, with no system of end-use verification, and the money is misused. Credit made available to non-banking finance companies is also included in farm loans. Even as the letter has named some companies, no specific instances such as amount lent to any company has been mentioned.VNSSM said the circular on farm lending issued by RBI in July 2015 has hampered the farmers' interest.Earlier, loans to industries like rice or dal mills, cotton ginning units or food processing industries were put under the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector.Loans to such entities made up the indirect agriculture finance.The latest guidelines have included loans to such industries in the direct agriculture finance category. This has led to a major disadvantage to farmers, since actual lending to agriculturists has gone down. Several banks are approving loans to such industries at concessional interest rates."

""After 15 years of misgovernance, fake promises and corruption, Tarun Gogoi is dreaming of capturing power again. But this time, all his efforts will be futile.

""People of the state are fed up with the activities of the Congress government during the past 15 years. Most of the schemes that the CM has announced have been the long-pending demands of the people, but why has the CM taken such a long time to announce them? In the past, we have seen a number of development councils being set up. But we have not seen any kind of development in reality,"" Sonowal added.Referring to various financial packages for the flood-affected people of Dhemaji and the Rs 1000-crore package for the people of the Barak Valley announced earlier, Sonowal pointed out that Gogoi had forgotten all these promises.

On March 20, 2013, India submitted evidence to say use of these plants to treat the diseases was known in the country for many decades. In July 2014, the firm made a second bid with an amended application, but Indian proof was overwhelming. The EPO junked the application in June 2015.For the record, India has captured 2.93 lakh medicinal formulations derived from traditional systems of medicine -Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. From 2009 to 2015, India has fought off many such patent claims on drug formulations with roots in the country's system of medicine.No less than 220 claims have been withdrawn or rejected. Science and technology ministry officials said India has filed about 1,400 pre-grant opposition in many international patent offices. ""Many claims are filed in European, US, Canada and Australian patent offices. We hope to win these cases,"" a source said.India managed to foil attempts in 220 patent-claim cases, thanks to the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL), which has documented 2.93 lakh medicinal formulations with scientific evidence. The country didn't spend a rupee to fight these cases.In contrast, India spent more than Rs 7 crore in getting revoked claims on a single Basmati rice patent. The TKDL took birth, thanks to India's efforts in fighting patent claims on wound-healing properties of turmeric at the US office and anti-fungal properties of neem in the Eu ropean office.Presentations at a 2011 international conference on utilizing TKDL data show that about 2,000 wrong patents on Indian systems of medicine were granted every year at the international level. A presentation, quoting the 2000 data, said the TKDL expert group surmised that this lapse occurred as India's traditional medical knowledge existing in Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic Urdu and Tamil could be nei ther accessed nor compre hended by patent examiners at international offices.As a result, TKDL, which got the cabinet clearance in 2006, has medicinal-formula tion literature in English German, French, Spanish and Japanese to make search easy for patent examiners a international offices.""It is important we document -backed with proper evidence -our traditional knowledge so that fighting cases becomes easier and cheaper,"" Kasturirangan said.The commission has recommended Karnataka create a library of its plants and traditional knowledge using GIS.In 1995, a US patent (No.5,401,504) was granted to two researchers from the University of Mississippi Medical Centre on use of turmeric in wound-healing.The CSIR challenged the patent, claiming Indians knew this for centuries, and submitted evidence.

It does not matter whom they vote for as long as they do so. Last time, the voting was about 47 per cent.

It does not matter where the people are originally from -- Andhra, Bihar or any other part of the country -- what matters is that they vote.""Explaining her party's strategy for the polls, Kavitha gave the example of the Gandhinagar ward, of which she is the campaign in-charge, where TRS activists will be working as teams at the booth level.""I have people from my Nizamabad constituency as the team leaders, and each will work with a five to seven member team. The TRS has faced several elections and all our leaders and workers come from a humble background. They will visit every household and request votes for the party. That is all we are going to do. There is nothing out of the box in our approach,"" she said.Asked about the disparity, or a perception of it, in the development between the new and the old city areas, she remarked, ""Virasat mein mila hai, kya karen?"" The perception that development happens in the more modern parts of the city is not correct, she said, giving the example of the Samagra Kutumba Survey during which, for the first time, officials went to every household in the Old City and people came out to provide data about their families.""They have faith in KCR garu and that something good will come from government actions. Now, families in the Old City and elsewhere get 6 kg rice per person as there is no cap on the number of people who can benefit from it.

""The 6,000 people used to get Rs 200 a month. Now, 20,000 people get Rs 1,000 a month. We want to cater to every section of the society. Don't you think people will vote for the TRS after such steps were taken?"" Kavitha asked.As far as development of physical infrastructure is concerned, Kavitha said progess would have been visible in every part of the city had the junction improvement programme taken off as planned. ""In the first few months of the government, KCR garu started the Rs 50 crore junction improvement project and called for tenders on annuity basis, but there was lukewarm response. This slowed matters down. Roads will be laid, junctions will be developed and new buildings will come up. It is just a matter of another year or so to see changes in the city roads,"" Kavitha said.The TRS Lok Sabha member, however, expressed some disappointment that Telangana's request for relaxation of borrowing limits by the central government is yet to be approved. ""Had that happened, you would have by now seen a big change and improvements in the city,"" she said.BOX'No truck with MIM'K Kavitha, TRS MP and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's daughter, said her party has no plans for any truck with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) for the GHMC elections. ""For the present, there are no plans of an alliance. It is an issue that will be dealt with after the elections,"" she said.Though the TRS will contest from all the 150 wards in the GHMC area, Kavitha said, ""I cannot predict how many seats we will win but can tell you that we will be the single largest party."" ""I think we will be able to do it (winning control of the GHMC council) on our own,"" she added.She also explained that any deficit in support, if at all, can be overcome ""with the ex-officio votes from the MLAs and MLCs from the GHMC area who have joined the TRS.""Kavitha, however, did admit that it has been a challenge to find candidates, especially in areas where the MIM is very strong. ""Everyone knows that just fielding a candidate in MIM strongholds is very difficult.

Even though analysts are divided on the exact cotton output, it has already led to prices of cattle feed going northwards. On the other hand, drought has hampered supply of green fodder, comprising jowar and maize, leaving cattle owner hard-pressed for fodder.Seeds separated from raw cotton in a ginning mill are used to make cattle feed after oil has been extracted from it. In what is being attributed to the shortage of cotton, rates of feed made out of cotton seed cakes have touched Rs2,200 a quintal. It was Rs1,450 in the same period last year. Traders say normally prices cross Rs2,000 in August, when cotton supplies have been exhausted, not when arrivals are still on in January. After August, rates may even touch Rs2,800 a quintal.Since cotton cakes are staple cattle feed, price of other fodder has also gone up in a ripple effect. Green fodder is already in short supply due to the dry spell. Green fodder, which was available for Rs1 to 2 a kg is now Rs4, said a source in the state's animal husbandry department, which also keeps track of the trends. This comes at a time when dairies have cut procurement prices by Rs4 in last one year.Roshan Kothari, a director of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, Wani, said this is mainly attributed to shortage in cotton supplies nationally. Crop losses have been reported in the northern states. Price of raw cotton touched Rs4,700 a quintal but have now settled to Rs4,500. ""However, speculation in the name of shortage cannot be ruled out. In Vidarbha, almost 75% of the supplies as compared to last year's level have reached the markets,"" said Kothari. There are chances that cotton seed cakes may touch Rs2,700 to 2,800 when the harvest is completely over, he said.Sanabhai Bharwad, a herdsman from Saoner, said the cost of maintenance has gone up to Rs5,500 to 6,000 per herd of 10 cows in a month from Rs3,000 earlier. Feed prices are on the run since last six months at least, he said. Wheat bran feed is now Rs18 a kg as against the normal level of Rs12 per kg, and rice bran feed is Rs530 a quintal as against Rs400 per quintal, he said.The milk procurement rates have been going down on the other hand, touching Rs24 a litre. The rates have come down by Rs4 in a year, added Hoda Rathore, a cattle breeder from the city.An official in the state's animal husbandry department said there is a huge shortage of green fodder, which is now almost four times dearer than the normal levels. Only dry grass is available at cattle marts in the countryside. To make things worse, the number of government milk procurement centres is fast coming down, which is allowing private dairy units to dictate the rates. In Nagpur district, out of 272 government milk collection centres only 52 are functioning at present, the source said.Dr Anil Thakre, live stock development officer at Katol, said the department is now growing certain new varieties of grass which can last for an entire year. The supplies will be made available from June this year.Cotton seed cake prices had last seen such highs in 2011, when the raw cotton prices had touched Rs7,000 a quintal. This year, the market trends have left even the veterans confused. NP Hirani, president of Maharashtra State Cotton Growers Federations, says there are estimates of cotton output ranging from 300 to 362 lakh bales as against 370 lakh bales last year. However, only 1.5 lakh bales have reached the market yet. It seems farmers are holding on for better rates.IN A NUTSHELLCotton seed cakes are staple cattle feedCost has touched Rs2,200 a quintal as against Rs1,450 last yearOther type of feed too is dearerRates of green fodder up by four timesMilk procurement rates down by Rs4 to touch Rs24Maintenance cost of cattle heads has doubledGovernment milk production centres shutting down, making things easier for private dairies"

The South Indian community welcome their New Year on Friday, when the Maharashtrians, Bengalis and Gujaratis celebrate Makar Sankranti.Gurupreet Malhotra, a Teen Hath Naka area resident, said, ""We celebrate Lohri with a program at the Gurudwara or an open ground in the area. There is a buffet and folk dancers are invited for entertainment. We also have get-togethers in our societies where we light a bon fire and offer this bon fire some til laddoos or revdi. We take seven rounds of the bon fire.""While each community has different ways of celebrating the festival, many have a fine line of similarities either in their delicacies or festive activities.""Just like the Sikhs have their Lohri bonfire, we too gather rice husks or wooden logs and burn it while praying in the morning after the night of Magh Bihu. This is one of our three big festivals and we celebrate it by preparing a feast of chicken and fish dishes as well as sweets like til pitha, gila putha, etc,"" said Deepali Newar, a Thanite who come from the Dibrugarh district of Assam.""We too celebrate Posh Sankranti by coming together as a community and sharing sweet meals that include chitoi pithas, patishaptas and puli pithas, which are all palm tree jaggery based sweets. We listen to Baul music and wish each other good luck. We then share the sweets with our neighbours and friends,"" added Vartak Nagar resident Bratamay Majumdar.While the Makar Sankranti festivities peak on Friday for the Maharashtrian community, they begin their celebrations on the first day called Bhogi on Thursday.""We prepare a til based mixed vegetable sabji on Bhogi, on the night before Sankrant. Then on the main day, we wear black outfits and have a small prayer after which women distribute packets of sugar, jaggery and coconuts, or even plastic and steel articles among other women. We also pray to black and brown coloured mud pots that we call Sugad and place pieces of sugarcane, bhor, carrots, gevda and peas in it to signify the arrival of the harvest season,"" said Kameshwari Kulkarni, a Thane resident.After all this, they go around sharing til gul laddoos to friends, families and neighbours while saying the common phrase, 'Til Gul Ghya, Goad Goad Bola.'""We do a lot of dhan daan during Makar Sankranti. We put a few coins in sweets and share them with others as part of gupt daan, we keep a fast at night to understand the suffering of those who go hungry every day, and we spend a lot of time with others sharing our joys. The children have a lot of fun flying their colourful kites too,"" said Janvi Shah, a Devdayanagar resident.The South Indian families in the city join the festive spirit with their traditional Pongal Celebration.""We bring in the New Year by decorating a small brass pot with leaves etc. and cooking our traditional dish, shakrapongal, which is the first meal of the season. When the dish starts boiling, it is accompanied by all the members of the family chiming the phrase 'Pongal oh Pongal' along with it. We then share it with our family and friends,"" said an excited 23-year-old Anuj Iyer."

With Uttarayan round the corner, more than 1.5 crore kites will change hands to reach retailers and then those who will fly them on January 14 and 15.""For a kite enthusiast, Uttarayan starts well before the festival -at midnight auctions across the state -and ends on January 15 when tukkals (lanterns attached to a string) are flown to bid goodbye to kites till next year,"" said Narayan Patel, a kite trader from Khambhat who supplies the toys to centres such as Ahmedabad and Vadodara.He further said that for people like him, the end of Uttaryan is actually time to begin preparations for next year's festival.""In Khambhat, we make around 25 types of kites. The cottage industry employs more than 3,000 families round the year except during monsoon,"" said Patel.It is interesting that the kite has communal harmony woven into its texture. A study conducted by Sewa found that 70% of kite-makers in 5-6 major centers in Gujarat are Muslims. The remaining 30% belong to the Scheduled Castes and the Chris tian community . However, most of the distributors and retailers are Hindus.Many of the Muslim families involved in kite-making trace their roots to north India. They came to Gujarat during the Sultanate and Mughal periods when kite-flying was considered a royal sport. And even among Muslim families involved in kite-making, it is the women who are the main artisans.Kites are woven into the history and heritage of Gujarat, so much so that they have become a symbol of the state. The annual kite festivals have attracted many tourists - both Indian and foreign- to major cities during Uttarayan. It gives Walled City residents an opportunity to rent out their terraces to tourists. Uttarayan and the kite festival have given a boost to the state's tourism industry, say experts.Even as cries of `kai po che' echo during the festival and after, enthusiasts regret lack of proper documentation of the craft of kite-making.Kirti Thakar, a kite enthusiast and former manager, fair and festivals with Gujarat tourism department, says that kite-making was given industry status but nothing was done about it except for a research report commissioned by the state government in 2003.Ahmedabad hosted india's first international kite festivalEdmund Hillary, who was the first to climb Mt Everest with Tenzing Norgay, and Barbara Carrera, a Bond girl, came to Ahmedabad to inaugurate India's first international kite festival at Shahibaug police stadium in January 1989. ""Hillary was roped in to project kite-flying as an adventure sport.Veterans such as Bhanu Shah and kitemakers Rasul and Naushad played a pivotal role in its success,"" said Kirti Thakar, kite enthusiast and a former government official.Sources of raw materialThe `tracing paper' which forms a kite's body comes from Sivakasi, Tiruppur, Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and Ramnagara in Karnataka.Bamboo, whose strips comprise its skeleton, comes from Kolkata and Assam.Kite-making in gujaratIn Ahmedabad, Behrampura, Danilimda, Gomtipur, Jamalpur, Juhapura, Khanpur, Millatnagar, Mirzapur, Rakhial, Saraspur, Shahpur and Vatva are kite-making centers. The cottage industry employs around 23,000 people. Khambhat is known for its special kites. In Mahuda, around 500 families are engaged in fixing waxed thread to the four sides of the kite to provide it stability.How kites and manja are madeCraftsmen - mostly men - choose the right paper and cut it in the desired shape.This requires expertise and experts are paid handsomely. Khambhat specializes in this art Artisans, primarily women, stick waxed thread to the sides of the kite to provide it shape and stability. Mahuda specializes in this skill Women apply `lahi' (glue and rice paste with copper sulfate) on paper and then stick the kites spine in the middle, and paper tabs on four corners. They also apply the paper triangle (pablo) to the bottom of the kite Last comes the bamboo strip bent into an arc. It provides the tension to keeps the kite in shape and allows it to fly For the manja, artisans grind glass bottles bought from the waste market into fine powder Homemade glue mixed with colour, rice paste and glass powder is applied by the `ustad' (master) to a cotton lineTraditions of khambhat and siddhpurIn most of Gujarat, kites are flown on January 14 and 15 for Uttarayan. But Khambhat and Siddhpur fly kites at different times of the year. Siddhpur flies kites on Dusshera and Khambhat on the Sunday immediately after Uttarayan. The founder of Siddhpur, Solanki ruler iddharaj Jaysinh, is believed to have died on Uttarayan. Hence the town mourns his death and doesn't fly kites on Uttarayan. In Khambhat, the new wind after Uttarayan attracts kite enthusiasts to its beach in the Gulf of Cambay.Rasool patangwalaThe Kite Museum at Sanskar Kendra in Paldi has many kites with creative designs. These are Rasool Patangwala's creations. Patangwala is something of a legend because of his sense of design and experiments. He had flown the country's first `train kite' made of 500 kites designed like a Tricolor. A native of Mathura, Rasool's legacy has been kept alive by his son, Pappubhai, who is also a noted kitist.Naushad patangwalaNaushad and his wife, Zareena, have several hundred designs to their credit. Naushad belongs to a family that has been making kites for generations. He was born in Rampur, UP, and shifted to Ahmedabad with his father five decades ago. His signature kite is `The Star,' an ancient design that does not participate in `aerial fights' but goes straight to `heaven.' Around 40 women work at his unit each season."

In a major relief, Madras high court on August 16, 2016 ordered no action should be taken against Madhya Pradesh for using name Basmati on its rice till November 19, 2016.Earlier in February this year Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) set aside the GI registry's order of December 2013 to include MP as basmati producing state. In December 2013, GI registry had instructed Agriculture and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority (APEDA) to include MP for GI tagging.But, APEDA moved an appeal against orders of GI Registry at the IPAB. And IPAB set aside orders of GI registry for including MP into the basmati producing states in February this year. Subsequently, Madhya Pradesh moved a petition before Chennai High Court, challenging the order of IPAB and hearing in the case is going on. ""We have informed court that we are moving a fresh petition before the GI registry. Because, IPAB in its order of February this year, said GI registry 'shall reconsider the matter afresh in respect of the claim of respondents, opponents for inclusion of areas specified in Madhya Pradesh and other places mentioned in the impugned order'.The Madras high court also ordered that no curative action should be taken against state's basmati till November 19, which is the next date of hearing,"" principal secretary, agriculture Rajesh Rajora told TOI.""We will be filing the petition in next 15 days,"" he said. APEDA has included Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Western UP and two districts of Jammu and Kathua as traditional GI area for basmati rice cultivation. Madhya Pradesh has been excluded from the list. ""Basmati is being cultivated in Madhya Pradesh traditionally. The quality and popularity of state's basmati could be gauged from the fact that 50% of our basmati contributes to exports to the US and Canada,"" Rajora claimed."

As his quest to add movement to the dolls depicting the different small forms of Krishna Leela began in 1947-48, it was the eco-friendly way that he went for.Putting together aluminium from old clothes hangers, circular wood cut out from rolling pins, cycle rims, old levers, pulleys, ropes and other things lying at home, the 88-year old retired medical professional has since then managed to extend his hobby to family members and devotees who form a beeline year after year with the stories of Lord Krishna in continued sustained motion.""I wanted to do something new, ahead of what was being done by my elders at home back then. Studying at Kanpur medical college that time helped me a great deal in understanding human body movements, which I developed into all these dolls, without even having any knowledge of mechanics,"" said Dr Mathur , who did his MBBS from King George's Medical University and retired as additional director of medical health, Uttar Pradesh.From the aura behind the head of Lord Vishnu , to the chakra moving continuously on his finger, the shadow display of Kans to Lord Krishna opening up his mouth to show mother Yashoda the universe within, from the water play during Holi to the 'cheer haran' of Draupadi - all stories with limb movements of the wooden dolls have been made by him.While it takes around 25-30 days for the entire tableau to be assembled, the entire family, from Mathur's children and grand children, all has a role to play. ""I paint the dolls' face now, earlier my aunt used to do that. My father narrates the stories to people who flock our home for the six days. Every person has a department to take care, from sewing clothes for the dolls, to assistance with the mechanics,"" said Shubhra Mathur , the third generation. Regular visitors come in every evening and schoolchildren come in during mornings for the tableau to be up at the house till August 31.""The most difficult movement to solve was in the story of Krishna-Sudama , where I had to depict snatching of the rice packet. The Mahabharat scene with Krishna lying in the bed, getting up and turning his neck was also a difficult one. But it all came God gifted for me to solve,"" said Mathur, sitting in his Khurram Nagar house."

Interestingly enough, her mother, Madhurima Das, a research associate at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has not burst a cracker for more than a decade.""We had a quiet Diwali. Neither I nor my spouse burst crackers. Also, being asthmatic doesn't help. Although the festival gets over, its effects linger for a while.

The amount of dirt there was much lesser compared to the previous years.""Concurring with the observations made by the residents, officials of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said that pollution levels were much lesser in comparison to last year.The National Air Quality index, which provides real-time data on air pollution indicated that particulates that could travel deep into the respiratory tract were the prominent pollutants on Sunday. Exposure to these particles could lead to short-term health problems in the eye, nose, lungs and throat.While the maximum level of particulate matter touched 436g/m3 and the average was 11 g/ m3. On Sunday, the carbon-mono-oxide remained the major pollutant, touching 103g/ m3 in the morning. The average CO levels remained at 56g/ m3.Particulate matter was the main pollutant in Peenya, while the air quality index (AQI) was 199 on Saturday. It remained the same on Sunday as well. PM 2.5 levels are commonly used as the best indicator of severe air pollution, while PM 10 particles are a cause of public health concern, but less lethal.In the other air quality monitoring centres, at City Railway Station and SG Halli, particulate matter, CO and Nitrogen Dioxide were the main pollutants over the past three days."

Until two decades ago or so, and still in some villages, the rice gruel or pez was not only reserved for illnesses, but was as staple preparation every day, any day. Children rushed home to consume it during their school break time. Adults too had it as a mid-morning staple, full of easy to digest carbohydrates, which kept them going till lunch time. And the farmer, consumed the pez early in the morning, as breakfast as a doze of energy.With rice being the staple food, pez was the easiest meal to prepare. Ukde tandul or the local unpolished red-coloured par boiled rice, freely available at home, had to be simply put on the boil with extra water and salt. This softened bits of rice with the nutrition rich starch water is easy on the stomach and very filling. Children of the household also often consumed nevol, which was the white-coloured rice starch strained from the ukde tandul being cooked to be served for lunch.As an accompaniment with the pez, homemakers reached out for their stock of dried fish and roasted it, or they simply served pez with pieces of the raw mangoes pickled in salt during the summer. On days when the woman of the house had more time to spare, the family would be treated to ambil.To make nachnyachi pez (ambil), raagi grains are soaked for an hour. They are then ground to a paste with water. The extract from this paste is then squeezed out and added to the pez with salt and brought to a boil. The proportion of raagi has to be lesser than the rice. The raagi or nachne adds to the nutrition of the pez, said Lalitha Shenoy , homemaker, from Porvorim. Unlike pez, which is treated like a snack, ambil is considered a proper meal and eaten with vegetables on the side. Another time-tested recipe, mainly served to women post delivery, is that of athwal or metheachi pez To make athwal, few methi or fenugreek seeds are roasted and added to the rice when cooking the rice for pez. Salt, jaggery and coconut milk is added to this mixture before bringing it to a boil. Unlike pez or ambil, athwal enjoys the status of a dessert. Athwal is still a mandatory dish served by Hindus to guests during a newly born childs naming ceremony or barso."

This is where Iran ends up if we continue on this same misguided path.""Obama came to office in 2009 vowing to extricate the United States from costly foreign wars, while signaling Washington would no longer rush headlong into every global crisis.He has also engaged with US foes Iran and Cuba, popular bogeymen for Republicans on the campaign trail.White House aides say Obama's policy is borne from a more steely eyed approach to the US national interest.But they also admit that policy toward North Korea, which has seen three nuclear tests during Obama's presidency, has been less than a total success.Obama's broad aim was to get reclusive Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program, stop destabilizing the region and come back to the negotiating table.""It is true that we have not achieved our goal,"" conceded White House spokesman Josh Earnest.""But we have succeeded in making North Korea more isolated than ever before and the international community more united than ever before.""North Korea's latest actions leave the White House with a difficult balancing act.On one hand, Obama needs to carefully craft a response with South Korea and Japan and, perhaps above all, China, North Korea's sole major ally.""The question is, will Beijing react passively as it has in the past or will it eventually decide to get tougher with Pyongyang and let sanctions bite?"" asked Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.US National Security Advisor Susan Rice on Wednesday met the Chinese ambassador at the White House to measure Beijing's intent.Obama is slated to speak to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye later Wednesday.Park has made a concerted effort to forge a close relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US officials will hope her newfound sway in Beijing can now be brought to bear.Meanwhile, inside the United States, Republican demands for tough action point to public pressure on Obama's administration to show steel in the face of international threats.A recent Economist/YouGov poll showed two-thirds of Americans are unhappy with the way Obama has handled foreign policy.Earnest rejected Republican criticism as vote seeking.""They're trying to win votes from conservative Republicans in a presidential primary,"" he said. ""We've heard a lot of campaign rhetoric, but not a lot of specific, tangible suggestions about what should be done differently.""Despite the pressure on the White House and North Korea's seemingly ever-more potent military capabilities, Kim said a dramatic change in US policy was unlikely.""The administration probably will not shift its current approach, especially with less than a year left of President Obama's term,"" she said.""The next administration will need to devise an effective and proactive strategy or else Washington will be faced with some tough decisions."""

Soon he was to learn he'd paid $16 for idli and chutney.Akshara was referring to the creative and contextual diversions that language takes in the process of translation.Good translation is a rare commodity. More so in the realm of Indian writing. For long, Kannada literature -with eight Jnanpith award winners -has been celebrated for its rich diversity, but not many important works have reached anglophile readers. Poet and scholar A K Ramanujan, whose English translation of U R Ananthamurthy's Samskara has been much-acclaimed, believed that a ""translator hopes not only to translate a text, but hopes to translate a non-native reader into a native one"". Of his own work, he wrote: ""I have tried to make the translation self-contained, faithful yet readable, but the best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amends them.""More than carbon copies or word-to-word conversions, literary works need adaptations that can recreate them into another language for readers of another culture. But there are many hurdles in this path. The translator has to take vocabulary, syntax, rhythm and dialogue into consideration. Kannada has many dialects too to contend with.Speaking of nuances, Girish Karnad once gave an example of the lack of an equivalent term in English for the word `agni'. In the title of his play it reads as `fire' (in Fire and the Rain), but the connotation would actually be of ""sacred or holy fire"" as in the ritual of a yagna.Fire, in plain Kannada would translate into `benki'.Even day-today terms like day terms like `Maharaya' and ` M a h a r ay t i ' t h a t smack of a mocking under tone don't have matching words in English.And then translation isn't about language alone. Some writers be lieve the pre-verbal stage of thoughts before they are put to paper is crucial in understanding a novel, short story or a poem. Besides, apart from individual enterprise, the exercise calls for a promising ecosystem that promotes translation studies, better editing, publishing, marketing and distribution.And so, for many years, Kannada writers old and new - be it Shivaram Karanth, Bhyrappa, Kambar, Lankesh, Devanur Mahadeva, Vaidehi or Jayant Kaikini - remained largely unread outside Karnataka.The sole exception was per haps of Karnad who chose to translate his plays into English.The story has taken a twist in recent years. A t l e a s t some part of the credit must go to the willing ness of the mainstream pub lishers to tap the po tential of translations from Indian languages. Arunava Sinha's Bengali-to-English version of Sankar's Chowringhee was received very well and went on to be translated into French, Spanish, Italian and other global languages.In Kannada, too, the scenario is getting brighter with Devanur Mahadeva's Kusumabale, UR Ananthamurthy's Bharatipura, Na D'Souza's Dweepa, Vaidehi's Asprushyaru and Siddalingaiah's autobiography Ooru-Keri having seen English translations in recent years. Two recent English versions have drawn attention: Vivek Shanbhag's Ghachar Ghochar and S Diwakar's Hundreds of Streets to the Palace of Lights. The former, with an excerpt in the latest Indian edition of Granta, has already received wide acclaim.Vivek believes it's important for a translator to get the tone of the original work. He's doing it himself, he says, when most of his stories come from a world where only English or Konkani (his mother tongue) and he has to turn it into Kannada. Diwakar too feels the tone is critical to a story and cites the example of a version of War and Peace that he'd read in which the translator had broken Tolstoy's long sentences into two or three smaller ones.It's important to get what the writer is trying to say. If the translator can see the power of a Lankesh story , the lyrical humanism of Kaikini and the ever-so-unique folk idiom of Kambar, much will be conveyed.Translation is a window to the diverse wealth of Kannada writing. It must be opened wide."

A raging controversy is on in the state over large-scale irregularities in the NFSA beneficiary list with names of many of ineligible persons, including BJD politicians, figuring on the list.The CM will take stock of the situation by interacting with district collectors, district nodal officers for NFSA and civil supplies officers through video conference, said a letter written by the food supplies and consumer welfare department to the collectors. The government has asked the district administrations to submit details of the following: grievance petitions; how much rice and wheat has been allotted and lifted; status of ration card distribution.Opposition whip and senior Congress leader Tara Prasad Bahinipati said the party would file a public interest litigation (PIL) at the Orissa high court soon. ""There are enough grounds to challenge the government's inadequacies in implementation of the central Act because it hasn't constituted state food commission and district-level grievance redressal committees as mandated in the Act,"" Bahinipati told reporters.Echoing similar views, BJP general secretary and former minister Manmohan Samal said his party too would file a case in the HC. ""The government has violated the Act by not complying with its provisions. Beneficiaries were chosen on the basis of their party affiliations,"" he said.Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma said instead of politicizing the issue, the opposition parties should come forward to ensure that all deserving people benefit from the Act. ""The government is committed to ensure implementation of the Act in letter and spirit. All the provisions of the Act will be met.

It also wants to explore the option of extending fortification to flour.The idea was discussed with executive director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Ertharin Cousin, when she had met Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan and senior officials of his ministry last week.Recent advances in food technology have led to the production of 'fortified rice kernels', which can be machine blended with regular rice to increase the nutritional value. Taking advantage of this new technology, the WFP has collaborated with the Odisha government to fortify the rice used under the midday meal scheme with iron. At present, this programme  launched as a pilot project of rice fortification  is running successfully in all 1,449 schools in Gajapati district in the state.Cousin told TOI that the minister and food secretary, during the meeting, encouraged the WFP to move beyond rice fortification and to work with them on the issue of flour fortification as well. She said, ""We are working with the government on fortification activities including rice fortification. We embraced the suggestion (of flour fortification) and we continue to work with them as we move forward.""The WFP claimed that the model of rice fortification has found high acceptance among students of Gajapati district where it had trained school staff involved in the preparation of the meal on how to properly cook the fortified rice for maximum nutritional impact.

If we can solve the issue of hunger in India, we can achieve zero hunger in the world.""She said the WFP was also working with the Indian government for setting up of a centre of excellence on food, particularly around the best practices that were developed here."

They even have their own traditional alcoholic beverages to get drunk on.Bihu goes by the name Bishu or Harali among the Dimasas of Dima Hasao district. It is a confluence of both the harvest and the spring versions of Bihu.Traditionally, Bishu would be celebrated for seven days and seven nights and the traditional 'meji' or 'bhela ghar' would represent seven houses.The men play the flute and women dance with traditional plates during the harvest festival. Dimasas consume 'jumai' or traditional rice beer and consume fish and meat, especially pork, to celebrate, said Upen Rabha Hakacham, professor of Assamese at Gauhati University and a Bihu exponent.Cut to lower Assam, and Bihu celebrations take on a different hue. Here, Bihu is called Dumahi, Dumasi, Dumsi and Pushna by the Rabha, Bodo, Rajbongshi and Hajong communities, respectively, and the focus is on the ritual worship of cows. Cattle is smeared with 'ghimsu', a special concoction comprising extracts of the 'ekora' tree and the oil and ash collected from the burning meji. The cows are then let loose for three months.""This is uniform among all communities residing in lower Assam, be it the Assamese, the Bodos, the Rabhas or the Rajbongshis,"" Hakacham added.The number of rituals and their diversity is often mind-boggling. While the Karbi plains community, like the Rabhas, offers pigs and roosters as sacrifice during Bhogali Bihu, the Tiwas consider the traditional ox or buffalo fight to be intrinsic to their Bihu celebrations. The Rajbongshis, Rabhas and the Dimasas regard the burning of the meji as the funeral pyre of the legendary Bheesma.""Magh Bihu symbolizes harvest for tribal and non-tribal communities in Assam. The approach to the festivities differs from one community to another and contributes to its appeal,"" explained cultural exponent Anil Saikia."

It is suspected that the animals were searching for water and came out of the forest areas.Handling such a heavy animal posed a challenge before the villagers as well as forest officials to get them out. As the unused well had a steep slope, the officials called an earthmover to dig some part before releasing it in the well. It helped the animals to get some grip to get outside the well and ascend. Once, they got out, the animals rushed towards the forest areas.During the same time, a leopard was found inside a well in Ratnagiri district. The officials struggled for 20 hours to get the animal out, as the animal was reluctant to enter the cage released in the well by forest officials. Earlier, Suresh Upare, senior forest guard in Ratnagiri, rushed to the spot with his staff soon after receiving the information. As the well had no steps and support for the leopard to climb, the animal took shelter in a cave on the wall.A villager alerted the administration after noticing the leopard inside the well. Upare, who rescued the animal, said, ""The leopard was hungry for more than two days because of which it had developed weakness. It failed to respond when an empty cage was opened in front. A pray was kept inside to lure the leopard, but this attempt too failed to reap any result. Finally, I sat on the cage and the animal was taken down with the help of a crane. I opened the door of the cage so that the animal would leave its place and jumped inside the cage.""Meanwhile, an elephant went on a rampage in Shevale village of Chandgad tehsil on Saturday. Pandurang Malvikar, a resident of the village, had kept the harvested sacks of rice outside his home. The elephant came outside the house on late Saturday night in search of food.

Thereafter, the animal ate some rice and trampled the remaining produce.According to forest officials, the process to assess the damage and recording Malvilkar's statement is underway."

Excerpts:The fortunes of the agriculture sector are cyclical. But the recent slowdown which followed 7-8 years of good growth has been further aggravated by two successive years of adverse monsoon rains. The rabi crop was hit by excessive rainfall. That further pulled down agri growth. This time despite low output, prices are also depressed. It's a double whammy for farmers. That is why you hear stories of agrarian distress. We have looked at a number of factors which can revive growth. One of them is good quality seeds. Another is fertiliser. And the third is in the area of prices.It does not always have to be through government support. We have serious problems with marketing. Markets are not only inefficient, their inefficiencies are rising. In some markets cartels are operating. I am a strong supporter of increased private sector participation in agriculture marketing. Under normal circumstances, the market should take care. That is not happening. One reason is that because of APMC Act (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) there are so many restrictions.States are not doing it. This is the problem. Central government has been trying to do it for the last 12 years. I would say traders' lobbies are opposed to reform of the APMC.One is to expand the national common market gradually. Hopefully states should come on board.Higher minimum support price alone is not a solution. If you can assure the farmer that you will get a reasonable price, he may put area under pulses. It may make some difference. But it will lead to very little increase in productivity. Prices help in harnessing potential created by technology, prices do not create potential by themselves. This synergy between prices and technology is very essential.There will be a lot of emphasis on public research and development and even on private sector. Many people are against GM technologies but my position is that in critical areas where we are not able to find success through conventional technology we should not shy away from trying it. In ICAR, the best brains are being applied to increasing productivity of rice and wheat. They need to re-prioritise their research portfolio and put more people on pulses.Pulses is a problem of deficiency, onions is a problem of management. No other crop has the kind of growth rate that onion has. We are asking ICAR and state agriculture universities to provide seeds for onions. Yes cartels are at work. I wrote a book where I said there are clear cases of market manipulation.We have to go in for some sort of public sector intervention. We have to build some kind of storage structure in the public sector. Our public agencies maybe inefficient, but they are needed in these kinds of situations.We need the public sector. A country like India needs institutions like the FCI. The inefficiencies can be addressed. FCI could say that we do not have autonomy. Inefficiency of FCI is partly operational and partly related to policy.Of course they should be. There are problems with FCI but they are not of FCI alone. I am a strong supporter of the presence of public institutions in important food items for safeguarding the interest of consumers. Imagine if the problems of onions were to happen to wheat and rice? We have had two consecutive droughts in many parts of the country but we are still comfortable. There is need to reform FCI but we should not take the extreme step of closing down FCI or even think of dismantling such an organisation. Why don't you allow FCI to procure from newly emerging surplus states such as Bihar? They need autonomy and their management should be in the hands of professionals rather than bureaucrats.I have been taking this position in G-20. Some kind of food inflation is good and we should accept it. If there is no food inflation there is no incentive for the farmer to raise production. But that inflation should be in farm harvest prices not in retail and wholesale prices alone. Some inflation in the farm harvest prices acts as a great incentive for producers. Only if it goes beyond a certain level one should feel concerned."

The authorities will demonstrate the use of solar devices like cookers and dryers to schoolchildren. They have also installed a biogas plant and charcoal unit in order to limit the use of modern fuels.Keshav Srushti is an RSS-affiliated trust whose campus is located in Uttan, Bhayander. Last year during Makar Sankranti, it created a world record for the largest solar cooking session by getting 3,639 children to prepare meals on solar cookers. Over the years, it has reportedly demonstrated this device before 50,000 children including pupils in Dubai.This festive season, the organisation is preparing for a Maha Suryakumbh 2016 through various programmes. On January 24, it will launch an energy park in Uttan. Named after former sarsanghchalak Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiya), it houses an array of solar devices and energy-saving gadgets that hark back to earlier times when the use of modern fuels was not so rampant.Employing alternative forms of energy is the focus on campus. The cattleshed generates two tonnes of cowdung annually which is used to power a biogas plant.""Our agriculture pumps are powered by solar energy. We recycle kitchen waste from the canteen to produce biogas which is used to cook food in that very mess. There is also a charcoal-making machine which uses fallen leaves and twigs to generate fuel. A solar dryer is used to dry the herbs for use in our medicinal unit. This method can be replicated by fishermen to dry their catch,"" says Vinay Nathani, the secretary of the organization.Even though charcoal is universally considered a polluting fuel, Nathani believes the ""harm is lessened since they use natural materials for production"".The energy park also has a solar kitchen where they cook dal and rice to show students how it is done. Keshav Srushti's pavilion is fashioned from bamboo which has been organically treated. The trust is building a sun temple, also from bamboo, which will guide children to tell the time by observing the position of the sun. A butterfly garden is also on the anvil.The NGO regularly invites schoolchildren on a two-hour energy trail. ""Another popular programme is our 30-hour long Akshay Urja camps where students begin the day by performing surya namaskar and then familiarise themselves with means of alternate energy. They play farmer for a day, visit the greenhouse, explore vermiculture and shade nets, and milk cows. The best compliment we receive is when they say they do not miss their cellphones during this time,"" the host laughs."

Several gangs have been conning people selling vessels and idols that they claim to be made of iridium that has the power to attract rice and bring wealth to the owner.S Sudheer, an engineer from Hyderabad, had fallen for the conmen who promised to sell him an 'rice pulling' iridium idol of a horse ""worth 50 crore for just 5 crore"".They told him they could give him a demonstration in Chennai for 50 lakh and he could buy the idol if he was convinced.When he landed in Chennai, Sudheer was asked to go to a hotel in Ooty. There, he witnessed the demonstration and left the place after paying 50 lakh when police descended on the place.A joint team of organised crime intelligence unit and the Ooty police made the move after they were tipped off by someone who grew suspicious of the five-member gang that remained closeted in a hotel room in Paramoolai, meeting some people on the sly. Police soon discovered their game and arrested the five who had 50 lakh in cash. Police called the engineer and returned the money.It turned out that the horse idol was worth 10,000. Attached to its base was an electromagnet powered only before the time of demonstration.The rice was boiled and iron shavings embedded in them before being dried to look like uncooked rice. When the electromagnet is switched on, it attracts the rice. The gang members were identified as P Venumathan, 32, M Kumar, 40, V Govindaraj, 46, P Kumar and A Charles, 44. Venumathan, who posed as a scientist to convince Sudheer, hails from Hyderabad, while the rest are from different parts of Tamil Nadu."

For a deity like Ganesha , who transcends all borders, castes and creeds, it's only natural that the naivedyam (food) offered to him varies across communities. Symbols of stories and family traditions of yore, here are some community and familialpreparations that Bappa's devotees are offering him this time.A bed of steaming-hot Ambemohar rice, doused with some flavoursome chinch-gulachi amti laden with bite-sized savoury- for Shilpa Bhide, the day Bappa came home was synonymous with relishing this wonder that her maternal grandmother prepared. ""When I was a child, our relatives would come down for the festival from Chiplun , and this dish was a must on the table,"" recalls Shilpa, a Kothrud resident. A favourite in many Kokanastha Brahmin households during the festival, this amti preparation, that comprises goda masala, coconut, tamarind and jaggery, however skips the tur dal in order to give the's taste and texture their due. ""What's tricky is that theshells, made from fine gram flour, aren't steamed or fried. They are moulded and put into the boiling amti minutes before serving. A little time more and less, and the shell either remains raw or disintegrates in the amti,"" says Shilpa. The filling of freshly grated coconut with hints of green chillies, ginger and coriander adds to the divine experience of the community meal. ""Owing to its laborious preparation, women would prepare it together, each one having their duties cut out. It's difficult to find time to make it today,"" says Shilpa, who continues the tradition of preparing it as naivedyam during Bappa's ten-day stay.The fare of the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP) people stands testimony to their hospitable spirit and love for all things lavish. For Sarita Kulkarni, a resident of Sahakar Nagar, the CKP-stylepreparation was a regular during the Ganesh festival at home. While theusually comprises coconut with a choice of fruit and sugar, the shell is prepared from Basmati rice. The highlight of the dish, however, is the decadent basundi, poured over the. ""When I was young, our family would prepare the basundi at home with milk from the domestic cow. The taste of the flavour-packed basundi coupled with the freshly-steamedwas worth all the time it would take to reduce the basundi down to its consistency. It was a real treat for khavaiyyas (foodies) like me,"" quips Sarita, adding that serving the CKPwith coconut milk poured over is another option.Though Chris Bastian Pillai, hails from Sri Lanka, the concept ofisn't new. ""I was introduced to the traditionalonly after I got married to a Maharashtrian; but in Sri Lanka, we have a similar preparation called kollukatta. My mum was a wonderful cook, and people would drop by to sample her kollukattas,"" recalls Chris, a Tamilian. The outer buttery, steamed rice dough is very supple, enveloping a rich golden coconut-jaggery filling. ""In Sri Lanka, brown palm jaggery was used, an ingredient that lent a very different flavour to the sweet,"" says Chris. In India, the Tamilians prepare kozhukattai, something that Chris says is but a relative of the Sri Lankan preparation. The fact that the outer covering has to be so thin so as to reveal just a sliver of the inner golden filling, is what determines the skill of the one making these pouches of goodness. The dish largely features as part of naivedyam during festivals.A 'fasting' meal from the Chitpawan Brahmin kitchen, Bhugaon-based Prakalpa Ashok recalls this dish being made at her grandmother's quaint house in Narayan Peth. ""My grandmother was a passionate cook. She would prepare this for relatives who were fasting during the festival. I would be delegated the task of tasting the modaks,"" says Prakalpa. Bite-sized savoury, whose shells are made from varachi tandul (rice), are served in a gravy of roasted and ground peanuts and a host of spices, enhanced with some ghee tadka. ""Since thearen't cooked prior to adding them to the gravy, getting the consistency of the dough is important, so that the shell does not break,"" says Prakalpa. This comforting fix is best enjoyed with some steaming hot varachi bhaat.(Pictures by Nikhil Vidyasagar)"

The sales figure is an all-time high and is almost thrice the figure of the previous year. The huge difference in price between products available in other markets and those at the fair is one of the major reasons for the surge in sales.""I am a regular at such fairs. See the difference in price. The price of one kg of Urad Dal is Rs 180 outside, here it is only Rs 66,"" said Preetha S, a customer who came from Santhivila. Not only dal, all essential items like rice, sugar and coconut oil are much cheaper at the fair. While Jaya rice is sold at Rs 40/kg outside, the price at the fair is only Rs 26/kg. When the market price for sugar is Rs 43/kg, it is sold for Rs 22/kg at the fair. The vegetable market set up by horticorp as part of the fair is also a hit as it sells organic vegetables at low cost.The market which is open to public from 9.30am witnesses huge rush till the day's sale is closed at 7.30pm. The crowd peaks in the evening hours resulting in long queues.The steep hike in sales figures has turned out to be a morale booster for employees too. Varghese, assistant taluk supply officer, said it is a remarkable fete that the fair could break Rs 1.25 crore sales within 18 days. ""Obviously, customers are attracted by the price. We also make sure that quality products are supplied,"" he said.But, all customers are not happy with the quality of products available. Donald, from Thiruvananthapuram, complained that many of the materials are substandard.The Kerala State Handloom Development Corporation alleges that they were marginalized by the organizers of the fair.

It's after a while that three children of the family belonging to Urala community - two of them doctors and one studying medicine -are coming together at their home in Malayattoor reserve forest. The efforts of their parents - Raghavan and Pushpa - have paid off. The family, which owns a little house in a two-acre plot, was staying in a bamboo shack until a couple of years ago. Their eldest son, Pradeep, practises at a hospital, mainly catering to tribal set tlements, in Adimali. He is an MD in homeopathy while his younger sister Soorya is pursuing MD in pulmonology at Thiruvananthapuram. The youngest son, Sandeep, is studying ayurveda at Pariya ram medical college.The life of Raghavan (56) had been hard. ""It's not easy to do the job I do; I wanted my children to have a better, easier life. I did what I could to give them the best education,"" he says.""There were no proper means of commute when Pradeep was ready for school. We were staying at Mamalakandam then. I used to wrap him in a lungi and carry him on my back through the narrow forest paths frequented by elephants. He studied classes I and II at Mamalakandam government school.""Raghavan used to walk to the school with the boy on his back and then return home. The only work I could find there was collect ing coral tree stumps (murukku). It has thorns (murukku). It has thorns and not everyone can cut it but the stumps were in demand as they are good for growing pepper. I used to collect other forest products too.""The arrangement turned tough once the other children too grew old enough for school. ""We left my ancestral home and settled in Elamblasserykudi so that I could find more jobs and ensure better schools for children.""Pradeep says he would have never thought of appearing for entrance examination if not for his father. ""I was sent to Idukki Vidhyadhiraja school first, and then to Ambedkar memorial school in Wayanad.""Pushpa says their encouragement also had to do with the enthusiasm of children.""Soorya was really good at studies. She had to face testing times too. She was down with chicken pox when appearing for SSLC exams. School authorities arranged a separate hall for her while she had high fever. She still secured A+ in all subjects.""A major entrance coaching centre in Pala offered her free entrance coaching and higher secondary education.""She cleared the entrance exam in her first attempt. She is in Thiruvananthapuram now and will come home only on Thiruvonam day,"" Pradeep says.Sandeep has been the luckiest of the lot. ""My siblings were there to mentor me. I just followed them,"" he says. Pradeep, meanwhile, married Nithya - a homeopath - from Malappuram and the couple had a child recently.Raghavan says Onam had been just another day for them all these years. ""The children were often in various boarding schools. It's celebration time when they come. I am at peace now as all of them are settled.

The increased allocation for a programme of the United Progressive Alliance era will aim to buttress the Modi government's pro-poor credentials while quelling Opposition criticism that it is a ""suit boot ki sarkar"". If successfully implemented, it will mark another instance of the NDA govern ment embracing a pet UPA scheme and doubling down on its use, much like in the case of Aadhaar and MGNREGA.Officials familiar with the plans said the Food Se curity Act will from April 1 cover more than 70 crore beneficiaries identified in 27 states and union territories. The Act covered 11 states and 33 crore people when its implementati on began in June 2014.""What we are looking at is ending hunger and ensuring that every citizen of the country has two meals a day. The PM is looking at this as entitlement of the poor,"" a top government official told ET on condition of anonymity.Last Friday, Modi, speaking at the Airtel-Economic Times Global Business Summit, criticised ideological opposition in some quarters to all kind of subsidies and launched a spirited defence of those aimed at the very poor. He said the government would rationalise subsidies and target them at the needy.Officials in the ministry of food distribution said the prime minister had personally taken what they said was an ""inordinate amount of interest"" in the implementation of the programme.He had personally enquired about its progress from states' chief secretaries thrice in the past six months.As part of the planned rollout, some 1.8 lakh fair price shops across the country will have electronic point of sale devices to authenticate beneficiaries at the time of distribution and also electronically capture the quantum of grains distributed to each family.The number of these shops, at 70,000 now, will increase to 5.52 lakh by March 2017.Under the Food Security Act that came into force in 2013, the central government has to share 50% of the cost of handling and transportation of foodgrain (75% in case of hilly and difficult areas) incurred by states and the dealers' margin so that it is not passed on to the ultimate beneficiaries.The beneficiaries get coarse grain at Rs 1 per kg, wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg.The Supreme Court on Monday blasted some states, notably Gujarat, for not implementing the Food Security Act and questioned their defiance in not adhering to the federal structure.Officials said that of the nine union territories states and union territories that are still to implement the Act, four - Gujarat, Kerala Jammu & Kashmir, Dadra and Nagar Haveli - have promised the Centre they would do it by the end of February, while another four - Arunachal Pradesh Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland have committed to start by March. The last holdout state, Tamil Nadu has sought time until July.The officials said there was greater emphasis being laid on better preparation so that it is implemented well and not rolled back, like in the case of Uttarakhand.They said online allocation of foodgrain is being done in 21 states, and the entire food grain supply chain has been computerised in 12 states.Last year, as a run-up to the rollout of the programme, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan was asked to conduct monthly meetings with food ministers and secretaries in all the states.A team from the ministry comprising senior officials Deepak Kumar and Nilambuj Sharan were asked to travel across the country, spending about a week each in every state to get the online systems fixed and operational.The Centre is also holding workshops in states on the practices adopted by states such as Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in implementing the law.What has helped the government get states on board for the Act is the massive National Informatics Centre led digitisation programme that has trained officials in states to track the entire process of distribution of grains. NIC has also built a monitoring portal to ensure there is no fudging of numbers. ""The entire process of grains moving from godowns to shops to the beneficiary is captured online. Even the electronic receipts given to beneficiaries and closing balance of shops are up for public scrutiny. This data and automation of process has also made the allocation of foodgrain and their release to district administration easier,"" one official said.While the Centre has assisted state governments to set up technical support systems for the programme, it also insisted that they use socio-economic caste census (SECC) data that had not been used by many of them to identify beneficiaries in previous years."

Not just Gujarat, several other states also are still to implement it.""After the rout in the district and taluka panchayat elections, the state government ordered the state civil supplies and consumer affairs department to start implementation of the Congress-led UPA government's flagship National Food Security Act (NFSA) programme in the state, under which 3.5 crore people from six crore Gujaratis will get wheat and rice at Rs 2 per kg. At present, only 1.3 crore people are covered under the public distribution system (PDS). The scope of coverage will become three times more, which may help the BJP government overcome the anger caused by skyrocketing food prices."

The second Khichdi was offered in the temple was of Nepal naresh which was brought here by representatives.Khichdi fair which started on Thursday continues over a month. Visitors get immersed in the myriad colors and sounds at the month long Khichadi Mela held in the premises of the 52 acre Guru Gorakhnath temple compound, built in the memory of Baba Gorakhnath who is known to popularise Hath Yoga. The fair is an unique example of Hindu - Muslim unity as many of the shops in the fair are of including, local sweets, jewelry, utensils, hand-made shoes, artifacts, toys and traditional garments. People wait in long queues to offer Khichdi (a mixture of rice and pulse) and it as also distributed among devotees as Prasad. PK Lahiri, scholar and environmentalist, describes the story behind Khichdi, "" Baba Gorakshnath was a native of Kangra in Himanchal Pradesh and he use to visit Ma Jawala Devi temple, once Ma called him for lunch but he refused as animals were sacrificed there. Ma became angry and from then what ever he tried to eat turned into pieces of meat so he lived only on water for a year and reached the place where Gorakhnath temple is situated now. Ma saw his pain and forgave him and tiik a face of old woman sat his way. When Baba begged her she offered Khichdi and the day was of Makarsankranti. Thus the tradition of offering khichdi on the day of makarsankranti came into tradition in Gorakhnath temple. ""The head priest of the temple, Mahant Yogi Adityanath, says, ""Devotees offer Khichdi to Baba Gorakhnath and hope it will bring good luck and prosperity to them. People believe that their wishes will come true if they offer prayers on this day when the sun changes the zodiac and herald a new beginning. The day is auspicious for any new beginning."" "" Gorakhnath temple has been constructed where the 12th century Hathyogi Baba Gorakhnath said to have meditated. In the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, Baba Gorakhnath is portrayed as the manifestation of Bhagwan Shiva in deep meditation posture. The temple had a long tradition that the first offering of the porridge to the deity on Makar Sankranti would be made by the king of Nepal after Gorakhnath temple Khichdi offering."" Mahant added."

The survey, with a sample size of around 200, found that the diet pattern of those who do physical work is high on vitamins and proteins.The diet of those working in the informal sector included high consumption of sweet tea, coffee and milk as it helped them to relax and concentrate. While those who do dredging work consume more fish. Most of the workers' needs are met by the small restaurants with makeshift rooftops, vegetable thelas, chicken, meat and fish outlets around the construction sites in Ulwe, Karanjade and Panvel taluka construction sites.The survey found that maids, cooks and those who do dredging work are addicted to tea, coffee and milk.

This was the question put to a panel of highpowered global and Indian CEOs at the inaugural session of the Airtel-Economic Times Global Business Summit. The answer was surprisingly upbeat from all, but more robustly so from those who view India from the outside, in relation to the rest of the global economy , than from their Indian counterparts.The time is ripe for India to step up investment in infrastructure and improve ease of doing business and the result would be remarkable growth. And much of this depends on executive action, rather than legislative changes.In fact, so little premium did the assembled CEOs put on fresh laws that some of them, led by Sunil Mittal , expressed the view that most of the needed reforms are already in place and action by the government and India Inc is what is required to realise the growth potential the entire world sees in India.Present on stage were Sunil Mittal, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Anil Agarwal and Uday Kotak , along with McKinsey Global CEO Dominic Barton, GSK Global CEO Andrew Philip Witty, PwC International Chairman Dennis M Nally, GE Vice-Chairman John Rice and US Exim Bank Chairman and President Fred P Hochberg.Economic Times Associate Editor Anand Mahadevan, who moderated the discussion, set the context by first asking Dennis Nally about the findings of the latest edition of PwC's survey of global CEOs. Nally said while 27% of the respondents expected the world economy to worsen, Indian CEOs were far more optimistic.While this definitely is a positive, he drew attention to a sobering finding of the survey: despite all the positive vibes about India being the fastest-growing large economy, huge emerging middle class and a young, energetic workforce, India ranked only number five as these CEOs' preference as an investment destination.He stressed the need for India to improve ease of doing business. Kumar Birla rated the demographic dividend as the biggest positive for India, that was endorsed by Sunil Mittal later. Birla ticked off the other positives: macroeconomic fundamentals were healthy, the rupee was relatively stable, inflation had halved from the double digits of a year ago, financial inclusion was becoming a reality.Uday Kotak counted low oil and commodity prices, low inflation, the low current account deficit and low interest rates around the world as enabling factors for a spurt in infrastructure creation in India. He thought that needless despondency among Indian industrialists were a bigger problem than any external threat to India's growth. But he did sound an important warning: don't binge on debt, a point that the audience registered volubly.Vedanta chief Anil Agarwal would be expected to be chastened by the global trend of weak commodity prices, but he remained ebullient as ever, seeing in these low prices and low interest rates a great opportunity to build Indian infrastructure.He wanted India to meet at least 50% of its energy needs from domestic sources, and step up manufacturing in areas of surging demand, such as electronics. Channel savings into infrastructure, he urged, and wanted, to this end, the normal EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) mandate to be expanded to add finance, and become EPCF.No country is investing enough in infrastructure, said Hochberg. But the US Exim Bank has financed more infrastructure projects in India than anywhere else in the recent past, he attested. Of course, China does not need external financing for its infrastructure building. He was particularly hopeful about energy, solar and nuclear.Barton saw in the excitement large pension funds, such as from Canada, are showing about India, a positive message about long-term financing possibilities. Rice expected oil and commodity prices to stay low. Witty stressed the need for and possibility of innovation to produce low-cost solutions in India for people in India and around the world who cannot afford high prices.When asked about what he wants from the forthcoming Budget, Birla did not dither: stepped-up infrastructure investment, lower corporate tax rates and simplification of rules and regulations. This emphasis on improving ease of doing business and utilising the current global conditions to build vital infrastructure captured the consensus of global and Indian CEOs on what India's current priority should be."

It could be a hearty breakfast or brunch after a rigorous workout or a dinner especially designed and cooked to include the 'only organic' sensibilities of the guest. Arjun Choudhary, who has conceptualized this theme is encouraging his guests to have some fun and games at the ground before trooping in for a healthy meal.""Dining out is seen as 'entertaining' where family or friends come together for a good round of food and booze,"" says Choudhary who has developed the space for not just dining but for multiple events. ""We encourage our guest to take up some physical activities before settling down to eat. On Sunday morning we have CrossFit workouts and our guest enjoy the exercise and the meal that follows which is designed as per their preferences,"" he says.There is an organic farm, owned by him, adjacent to the restaurant which grows vegetables that provide farm fresh greens and other vegetables. ""Our preparations are guest specific. Like this Sunday we have a group of bikers who will be coming in for breakfast after the ride and want to have lean meats and salads. There is also a group of 20 couples coming for brunch as it is Valentine's Day too, and they want to have comfort food, but one prepared with organic produce,"" he says.The growing health consciousness among people even when they are dining out is compelling eatery owners to come up with foods that qualify as healthy. ""We realize that our guest want to eat healthy even when they are eating out. So we introduced whole wheat pizzas without cheese which are hugely popular. People want to enjoy these delicacies but want to avoid carbohydrates,"" says Manju Saraf who owns Italian restaurant Zinq and the recently opened Brie.Breakfast Story, another restaurant that has caught the fancy of city foodies, has developed its menu around these healthier options that people like to take while dining out. ""We do not use food colours, MSG or gelatin in our preparations and are very low on processed food,"" says Mukul Kulkarni, the founder of the restaurant.""We have very consciously kept out aerated drinks from the menu and are serving coconut water, kokum and amla juice and buttermilk,"" he says and adds, ""Eating healthy is such a habit that three days a week we have scrambled eggs and omelettes made just with egg whites and have even served a fried egg without the yolk.""The entire concept of Khichdiwala, a eatery that serves only the daal and rice gruel, revolves around eating healthy. Co-founder Manish Khanchandani says, ""Healthy options are being given in high end eateries as they come at a price. The younger generation with deep pockets and a fetish for fitness are the ones who look for healthier options while ordering food. We have observed that people now even carry their own water to restaurants.""Khanchandani says that healthier food options are getting so popular that he is now getting requests for giving his brand franchisee outside Nagpur too.The concept has caught on even at events where food is prepared by caterers. ""We now put up live counters of sauted green and leafy vegetables, which are very popular,"" says Pradip Rajput who runs an outdoor catering business. ""It's hard to imagine that now at weddings and conferences people eat light and healthy.""Nagpur still does not offer many healthy options on restaurant menus, rues Prerna Bhattad who runs a home accessory business. ""We are eating out so frequently that now there is little choice but to pick up items that are low on fat, carbs and sugar. These concerns are not just about looking good. Eating unhealthy items regularly has serious ramifications,"" she says.The fact that even those in their 30s are succumbing to various ailments has spawned this awareness about eating healthy feels Nitin Dholakia who works with an IT company. ""Exercise is a part of our daily routine and if we do not back it up with healthy eating then it's a waste. I don't know how healthy are the foods that these eateries offer but at least I don't go on a guilt trip after having a brown bread sandwich or a whole wheat pizza,"" he says."

He is upbeat about investing in India but is critical about the way taxes are levied. Excerpts from an interview with TOI:The government is getting a lot of traction. The central and state governments are starting to move forward on some of the big initiatives. For us, the rail deal ($2.6-billion contract to supply 1,000 diesel locomotives) was a very big commitment to make to the country and for the rail ministry to make to us.It's a good signal for other potential investors that India is ready to move forward on some of the big infrastructure projects that have been sitting on the sidelines for a while. I've been coming to India for a long time. When you look at the Prime Minister and the ministers, there's more in this government than I've seen in the past.We were talking in an internal meeting about new tariffs on imported medical equipment. This tariff was 7% and it kind of came up overnight. It illustrates in my view the wrong way to do it. I get the fact that you want to promote local manufacturing but you don't want to subsidize inefficiency. If you want to promote local manufacturing, tell any medical importer that here's the game, over the next two years, we are going to go from 0 to 7% and you are going to play by the rule. Now, you have an opportunity to localize as much as you can to avoid that 7%. The government will accomplish what it wants to accomplish and my bet is that you end up localizing activities that allow you not just be competitive in Indian context but competitive in global context.I understand that criticism. The bureaucracy that has caused the central government to not move with speed and agility was built over the past decades and is not going to change or be unwound overnight.The people who advance that argument have to realize the magnitude of the challenge. This is an enormous institution and the people and the practices and the processes that cause it to not move the way many of us would like it to move don't get unwound overnight.There are two things  people have to be patient and the government has to realize that people aren't going to wait forever. So, there has to be some of both.We are still in the honeymoon phase. But I am confident they will because for Bihar this is about their project and we are going to line-up to organize a set of processes which are world-class. We have built a world-class manufacturing facility in Pune in the last couple of years. We want to do even better in Bihar and use it as an example for the rest of India and the rest of the world, that Bihar is open for business.No, I was going to try to go this trip and see the chief minister. But we couldn't get the schedules arranged so that it worked. But we've built plants in places all over the world. So we're confident we can do this in Bihar.If you look at what we've done with Pune, there's a whole ecosystem around the city that supports the creation of a facility that's going to compete on a global basis. Half of what we do in Pune gets exported.This is not 'Make in India for India', this is 'Make in India for India and the rest of the world'. That's what Bihar will have to be, because we want to build locomotives there that meet global standards. So, if we don't have world-class training capability, we're going to hire a lot of people locally, we're going to have relationships with local educational institutions, because we have to build a workforce that can compete globally. This is not just building a plant so people can make stuff. That's the very beginning."

They don't say much but their bottled affection has a way of showing up in gushes. That day, when the Panvel girl returned from a 19-day solo trip, her father__a quiet cyclist__had run up to her and hugged her. The torrent of anxiety that had built up within the reserved Dhananjay Madan let up when he finally saw his lean daughter, who had come back a year older, a few shades darker and several stories richer. She had also developed an uncanny taste for brown rice and bananas. All of this, with the help of his beat-up old bicycle, which she now calls her ""bestie.""""She is a part of me now,"" says 22-year-old Prisiliya, about the Canondale cycle that made her feel less alone during her recent solo journey from Panvel to Kanyakumari ""to find myself."" Like a dutiful mule, it had carried a pair of 17-kg panniers (basket) even as the cyclist negotiated five uphills up to Goa, dodged trucks and trailers in Karnataka and counted the staggering number of chopped trees in Kerala. In those two panniers, Prisiliya had carefully packed three pairs of riding clothes, heavy cycling equipment, toiletries and, most importantly, homemade besan laddus and chiwda__her antidotes to homesickness during the 2200-km-long journey. While chomping on these, staying in alien homes, communicating through gestures and delivering motivational lectures in schools__the NH17 progressively became Prisiliya's highway to confidence.""Now, I know how to say no and how to accept no,"" says computer science student, who embarked on the journey she calls 'I P'Ride' as soon as her practical exams got over in December. ""I didn't get time to train for it at all,"" says Prisiliya, who would pedal close to 100 kms a day. It helped that her tendons are used to tedious vacations. In 2011, she had accompanied her dad and a group of cyclists from Panvel to the highest motorable road in Leh while last year, she was the only girl in the group that cycled upto Orissa. Here, ""the terrain was tough and we had to cook ourselves,"" she recalls. What really implanted the itch of a solo trip in her, though, was an English girl, Rubina Surti, who had briefly stayed over at Prisiliya's residence last year while cycling from England to Sri Lanka. ""I thought if she could get by knowing only English, surely I can survive in India knowing Marathi, Hindi and English,"" says the Maharashtrian, who soon enlisted the help of not only her father but also accomplished cyclist Sumit Saringe in her dream. They mapped the route and renewed local contacts. ""My father was mainly worried about the traffic,"" says Prisiliya, who found out why when she could not hear any of her thoughts over the cacophony of speeding vehicles.The other major allies in her dream were 18 strangers, each of whom not only let her stay in their homes but also suggested the next. ""If not for them, I would've had to stay at hotels or railway stations,"" says Prisilya, who is now busy returning the favour by making 18 clay pots on a potter's wheel at a friend's art gallery in Indrapur__souveniers she will mail soon. She is particularly indebted to one family in Thellissery__the Balans. On learning that it was her birthday on January 4, they had travelled almost ten kms to the city to get her a cake and a gift. The bubbly introvert, who is used to spending her birthdays watching the sunset, was so overcome by emotion that ""I didn't even cut the cake.""Many such gestures litter the highlight reel of her road to self-discovery. There was Anupama Parameshwaran, a Malayalam actress, who got off her car to congratulate her, the Tamil book seller in Kanyakumari who presented her with a book on Swami Vivekananda in Marathi, the ice- cream vendor in Karnataka who wasn't creeped out but intrigued by the sight of a girl laughing to herself on the beach and who handed her a free Choco bar and Dr Sudha, who lent her a Kerala sari during her visit to the Guruvayur temple__the only time she had shed track pants in those 19 days. In fact, at the Kharepatan police chowki at Sindhudurg, ""the cops not only told me the route but also gave me the numbers of all the police chowkis stationed at Sindhudurg,"" recalls Prisiliya.As the rice she ate changed colour from white to brown, though, Prisiliya had a sense of her tastebuds expanding and freedom shrinking. ""In Maharashtra, we can come home after 9 or 10 pm, but in Goa and Karnataka, girls have to be back by 6 or 7 pm,"" says Prisiliya. Along with narrow roads, the NH17 also threw up narrow minds. ""Why are you doing this? Aren't you worried about your parents?"" strangers would ask after breaking bread with her in the highway dhabas.Her simple comeback, ""To search for myself,"" only seemed to confuse them further. ""They assumed I didn't have parents or that I may have an elder brother who would look after my family in case something were to happen to me,"" recalls Prisiliya, who also learnt to ignore and move past the male cyclists who would heckle or deliberately cut off her pace.Naturally, in those 19 days, her motto changed gears from self-discovery to women's empowerment. She found herself invited to deliver lectures in schools in Guruvayur and Trissur where she told the students to be very clear about their goals. ""Only then will you earn the support of your parents and well-wishers,"" said Prisiliya, whose journey culminated in Kanyakumari's 'Triveni Sangam', where three water bodies meet. This felt like poetic justice to the 22-year-old.""My pride ride was a 'Triveni Sangam' in itself,"" says her facebook post. ""My resolve, the blessings of my family and help from my well wishers."""

The revenue department is also planning to identify and remove outlets that discharge waste into the river. A Kozhikode-based firm had offered to provide equipment to identify underwater pipes and outlets that discharge pollutants.According to environmentalists, there has been much hue and cry over saving the river. ""The river is not polluted much along the Bhoothathankettu-Malayattoor stretch. The pollution level increases as it enters downstream, especially in Eloor and Pathalam areas,"" said environmentalist S Sitaraman.In Illithode near Malayattor, many quarries dump waste into the river. When the river reaches Kalady and Okkal areas, rice mills, food processing units, etc. cause heavy pollution. Another major pollution point is Aluva. ""Nine canals that carry the entire waste from the Aluva municipality open into the river. Hospital waste, waste from hotels and other shops, apartments, etc. are also dumped into the river,"" he said.""Waste, including batteries, metals and oil from the KSRTC garage at Aluva, is also dumped into the river,"" Sitaraman said.When the river reaches Muttar, Eloor and Pathalam areas, pollution level reaches its peak. ""Chemical waste from all factories in the area is being discharged into the river. Septic tank waste, meanwhile, enters the river at Muttar through the Edappally canal,"" he said."
58f159e0a3d24b245e599055,Mixed reaction to e-procurement,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/Mixed-reaction-to-e-procurement/articleshow/53583079.cms,2016-08-07,"TRICHY: The Tamil Nadu government's announcement of the proposed e-procurement scheme has received mixed response from the farming community across the delta districts.Hailing the chief minister's initiative to find a solution to the discrepancies in the present system of procurement, members of farmers' associations sought steps to eliminate the malpractices and irregularities farmers face when they approach procurement centres to sell their produce. They have also stressed the need to impart basic level training to farmers before implementing the new system.Farmers said the electronic clearance system (ECS) for distribution of money that is due to them should have been implemented much earlier. However, they were grateful to the state government for making it a reality at least now.""Every year farmers across the state have been foregoing Rs 75 per quintal in direct procurement centres (DPC) in the name of commissions illegally collected by the authorities while weighing paddy. This amount would come to Rs 130 crore-Rs 140 crore throughout the state. Once the ECS system is implemented effectively in all DPCs, corruption in the name of weighment would definitely be curbed,"" said Swamimalai R Vilalnathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association.Welcoming the government's effort to digitise the entire process of paddy procurement in the state, small and medium farmers were apprehensive that the money deposited in their bank accounts through ECS might be adjusted against their loan dues, said N Veerasekarn, coordinator, South and North Ayyan Vaikkal Ayacutdars Association, Trichy. ""Already the beneficiaries of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) are facing the same difficulties across the state. On these lines, farmers wonder whether they would also be trapped,"" Veerasekaran added.Instead of depositing the money in banks, the state government should think of depositing it in post offices, said Vimalnathan. ""When compared to banks, post offices are more easy for the farmers to access. It has penetrated each and every hamlet in the country. Farmers need not have their own gadgets or search for internet centres. The state government should do this as a pilot scheme,"" he added.He also sought an assurance from the chief minister that the money deposited to the farmer's bank account would not be adjusted or withheld or debited against their loan dues.The secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association for Thanjavur district said though the initiative would eliminate irregularities and malpractices involved in the process of selling paddy, the government should do the needful. Since farmers in delta districts have no easy access to computers or internet facilities, they should be imparted some training.Farmers also thanked the government for the announcement on setting up a modern rice mill at Vlangaiman in Tiruvaru district at a cost of Rs 20 crore and also for the construction of two godowns with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes at Kottur and Needamangalam in Tiruvarur district."

His first impulse was to look back, thinking it was his son calling him. Seconds later he realised that Tamils like Koreans also address their fathers as Appa. The incident inspired him to start researching on words that are common to both Tamil and Korean languages.Although a possibility of the two cultures sharing a common origin has been disputed due to a lack of genetic and anthropological links Kim, who will soon give a presentation on the topic during the Madras Week celebration, asserts that Asians in general share a lot of values and are indeed genetically related. He adds that India's mission to capitalise on the growth potential of Asia has to be studied and developed so that South Korea and India can be considered as sister countries.During his research, Kim came across about 500 words in Tamil and Korean which share the same meaning and pronounciation. For instance the Korean word 'Apahada' which is 'Avadhipadu' in Tamil means the same --'in pain' or 'suffer'-in both languages. Similarly 'Vanakam' (hello in Tamil) in Korean is 'Vangapta', 'Manaive' (wife) is 'Manura' and 'Nal' (day) is also 'Nal'.Not just words, the two cultures share a lot of cultural and traditional practices too. Just like Tamils, Koreans have the habit of leaving the slippers outside the house and bowing before the elders as a sign of respect.And when it comes to syntax and grammar, Korean and Tamils share the same sentence structure. For example, 'I am cutting the grass' in Korean is 'Naan pul-ul-beda'.Kim says another thread of similarity could be a stone that Huh, the first queen of Kaya kingdom, took from India to Korea. This could be the 'Illavattakkal', the practice of a man lifting weight to prove his strength.The old Tamil ritual involved a young girl asking her lover to lift a heavy stone to prove his strength. These stones are still found in interior villages of Tamil Nadu, says Kim.""When a baby is born in Korea, we have green chillies hung outside the house to ward off evil spirits and I find the same practice here too. It is remarkably surprising to see girls playing five stones here just like Korea. These are some things that goad me to look deeper into the cultural similarities and I must say I feel com pletely at home here,"" he says.He substantiates his argument by citing examples of Korean food which are similar to the Tamil cuisine. Rice cakes, rice puff and lentil cakes are a few to name. ""There must have been an exchange of cultural habits and cuisines when people from both the cultures migrated to each other's' country ,"" he adds.The connection between the two cultures is believed to date back to the reign of King Suro and Ayi of Pandian Kingdom in CE 45. Experts don't rule out the possibility of queen Huh taking Tamil culture to Korea with her when she left India.Kannan Narayanan, a professor in AIMST University , Malaysia and an expert in Tamil-Korean heritage, says the Koreans are as emotional as Indians and have the same affinity for bonding and intimacy like Tamils. ""Even the smallest similarity is something we have to be really proud of.We just can't have a meal without pickle and they too can't have food without it. The Koreans believe they have Indian ancestors and the queen who migrated from India may have been highly influenced by the Tamils."" He adds that more research should be done in the area to strengthen the relationship between the two countries."

A merchant navy engineer, who, along with his team, was wrongly accused of felony and imprisoned on foreign land without any hopes of extradition, has come back, safe and sound, to recount his tale. Two weeks after his return, we meet Jogesh Chandra Das (51), for his story that sounds straight out of a Hollywood thriller.Two years back, Jogesh Chandra Das left the country on an assignment with his team. He was the chief engineer on a merchant navy ship, who left his college-student daughter and wife back. It was supposed to be a routine trip. On July 22, 2014, while on their way from Ghana to Cameroon, their ship veered into Nigerian waters  a territory they did not have permission to charter into. ""Everything was going fine,"" he recounts. ""However, suddenly, the captain of the ship informed us of some technical glitch and we found ourselves stranded in the middle of nowhere. The Nigerian navy approached us and commanded us to anchor. We had no reason to suspect anything. But, once we docked, they slapped drug smuggling charges on us. They seized our ship and threw us into the Yenugua Prison at Bayasala in Southern Nigeria,"" Das tells us.Even before the 12 men could figure out what was going on, they were slapped with a fine of Rs 200 crores. ""The EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) of the country and the Nigerian Navy asked for a payment of Rs. 200 crores for our release. We were unable to pay the sum,"" Das tells us. They hired an advocate instead who lead the Nigerian authorities to the seized ship for a search. ""Of course they found nothing there. No drugs. It was a scrap ship. So, we registered a case against them on grounds of human rights,"" says Das. It seemed like a ray of hope when the Nigerian authorities made a deal with them  they promised to withdraw the false charges if Das and his team withdrew their human rights violation case. However, the deal turned out to be a ruse!Recalling the horrific condition of the prison, Das shivers. ""We could not eat the boiled rice and beans they served us. I was diabetic, two of my mates had fractured their legs and there was zero medical facility. After a lot of political red-tapism, the Ministry of External Affairs started sending us Rs 4K each month. We started cooking rise and dal in the cell itself,"" he shares.In the meanwhile, his family back in India was running from pillar to post to bring him back. His daughter Sreyashi, who was a student of animation in Delhi, had to leave her studies mid-way and get a job to support the family. ""Sreyashi managed everything single-handedly. For quite some time, she made sure her mother had no knowledge of my ordeal. However, when all her pleas to the government officials failed to bring any result, she told her mother and both of them met Sushma Swaraj. My sister-in-laws family helped us a lot too,"" beamed the proud father. With the help of Siddhartha Chatterjee, Additional OC, Bowbazar police station and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Das finally returned home on July 3, 2016, after a two-year nightmare.Getting back to the grind is his primary focus now. ""I have not been paid for the last two years. I am hoping my arrears will be cleared soon. I will also have to start looking for a job soon. My family and I would like a fresh start,"" concludes Das."

The trend is similar in neighboring countries and in Brazil, while a declining course was seen in the US and Indonesia, among others.High ozone levels are not only associated with serious health impacts like reduced lung function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), aggravating asthma and respiratory conditions, but also with widespread crop loss.The study also estimates that total deaths due to increase in exposure to O3 increased by 50% between 1990 and 2013 in South Asia. For this report, the health and economic burden of O3 is only based on COPD incidence from it. Total deaths due to exposure to PM2.5 have also increased in South Asia during the same phase, but not as steeply as with O3.Interestingly, even though the cost of O3 related premature deaths are far lower than that of PM2.5 (both household and outdoor), O3 associated economic or welfare losses for South Asia are equivalent to that of North America . The welfare losses due to O3 exposure are to the tune of 0.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) equivalent, the report states.If you consider man days lost, it's about 0.09% of GDP equivalent, it says.Air quality experts said O3 could be a serious concern soon. ""Even before we could deal with health damage from particulate pollution we are falling into the pincer grip of ozone pollution that damages both lungs and crops. This is also the sign that emissions of toxic gases are increasing rapidly in our country . Keep in mind that for estimating health damage from ozone this report has only considered chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The actual cost of health damage could be way higher,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury , head of Centre for Science and Environment 's clean air programme.Ozone is not directly emitted from any source, it is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. It's mainly released from combustion sources which includes vehicles and industries.A 2014 study by scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology estimated that ozone-induced damage to wheat and rice is enough to feed roughly 35% of 270 million BPL population in India."

The subject of their prayers was Sri Srinivasan, an Indian-born judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who is rumored to be a top contender for President Barack Obama to nominate to the Supreme Court.In Washington, Srinivasan is known as a brilliant lawyer, and  what may be more important this year  so difficult to pigeonhole ideologically that his current appointment passed a bitterly divided Senate 97-0.In Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram, though, he is known as the grandson of a local schoolteacher and yarn merchant who drove an ox-cart and typically wore a traditional wraparound dhoti.Neighbors say Srinivasan's grandfather, Padmanabhan Iyer, was neither rich nor powerful, but his ability to commit scriptures to memory made him an object of awe: He was capable of chanting mantras for two hours without as much as glancing at a text. The family is Brahmins, members of Hinduism's highest caste, which was long associated with priesthood.Every morning, at 6:30am, Padmanabhan lined up his six sons for a half-hour of chanting, said Shankara Lakshmi, a granddaughter. All grew up to occupy government posts, except the youngest, who was hired as a mathematics professor at the University of Kansas  and whose son, in turn, became an American judge who may soon ascend to the nation's highest court.""The prayers chanted by the grandfather have descended on the grandson,"" said Kulathu Srinivasan, 62, a distant cousin who organized a special temple ceremony last month to appeal to the deities on the judge's behalf.The cousin's friend, Ganapathy Subramanian, a retired physics teacher, said the practice of chanting enhances memory and cognition. ""These mantras, they are not created,"" he said. ""They are from the universe.""It is one of the Indian rules of existence that ancestral villages matter. Despite the fact that Sri Srinivasan was born in northern India after his parents had left the village, and he emigrated to the United States as a young boy, people here refer to him as ""our son.""This week, as suspense around the nomination built, the temple priest found himself standing barefoot outside the sanctum giving a telephone interview to CNN. At another point, a man who gave his profession as ""drawing master"" came forward with a sheaf of temple sketches that he hoped to pass on to Sri Srinivasan in honor of the occasion.""Here, at the southern tip of India, from the village of Mela Thiruvenkanathapuram, a very great man was born,"" the drawing master, Pon Vallinayagam, said with a flourish. ""This man is coming to the highest position of the greatest court. We, the people of the village, the people of India, we think it is a great honor.""This village, pronounced MAY-la THEE-roo VEN-ka-ta NA-tha POO-ram, has a deserted feel, so quiet at midday that you could hear the squeak of a rusted hand-pump as a woman filled a bucket with water. The community emptied out during the second half of the 20th century, when many Brahmins left rural villages for cities in great numbers and entered modern professions. Many proved to be extraordinarily successful.These days, many of the Brahmin's ancestral homes have collapsed in on themselves, and prayer is the village's most vibrant business. Prosperous Brahmin families return regularly to make donations to their family deities, among them the four-armed, copper-alloy figure called Lord Srinivasan.Such visits can be brought on by a crisis: One family donated a gold tongue to the temple because their child was unable to speak; a wealthy man whose family owns a Dubai-based shipping company made an emergency visit to ask for help when one of his cargo ships was caught in a cyclone, said V. Murali Srinivasan, a third-generation temple priest.The priest had a dreamy look as he thought through the events of the coming days. If Sri Srinivasan is named to the Supreme Court, he said, the village ""will be known throughout India.""Outside the temple sat a farmer named Kanakaraj, who grows rice on a meager half-acre of land. He has been observing the unusual goings-on, and when asked what he knew about it, gave a sudden, dazzling smile.""Our son in America, he is a judge,"" he said. ""I don't know about the family. But a judge  a judge is like a god.""(Hari Kumar contributed reporting. )"

But thanks to this 52-year-old patient in Delhi, doctors now know that psychiatric help may be more effective in treating this stubborn gastrointestinal problem than medication.When medication proved unsatisfactory in alleviating his distress, doctors at AIIMS put Rakesh Bhatnagar (named changed) through cognitive behaviour therapy. According to a paper published on the case in National Medical Journal of India, for 18 years Bhatnagar had complained of frequent passage of loose stools without the feeling of having emptied his bowels. He visited the toilet five to six times every day, spending six to eight hours trying to ease himself.Last year, he was referred to the hospital's psychiatry department. After 24 sessions of therapy spread over nine months, which involved relaxation training to reduce and manage anxiety and eliminate habits like rubbing the abdomen, Bhatnagar reduced the time spent on toilet-related activities to less than 50 minutes.""We do feel the need of psychiatric consultation in many cases of IBS, which is one of the commonest gastrointestinal problems,"" says Dr Anil Arora, director, Institute of Liver Gastroenterology and Pancreatic-Biliary Sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. ""But patients often resist this because they feel the symptoms signify physical illness rather than a mental condition.""Explaining that around 70% of IBS patients suffer from underlying psychological disorders, Dr Nand Kumar, professor of psychiatry at AIIMS, says, ""IBS is more common in people who are hyperactive. Anxiety and moderate depression are common in them. Counselling and behavioural therapies should be considered to improve the symptoms in such cases.""At Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital's psychiatry department, Dr Smita Deshpande, its head, agrees that patients who are so preoccupied with their symptoms that they ignore or lose interest in routine activities should seek psychiatric assistance to complement any medical intervention.Dr S K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, points out that with changing lifestyles, lack of physical activity and poor dietary habits of the present generation, the incidence of IBS likely to go up. ""The syndrome is more common among professionals who lead a stressful life,"" says Sarin. ""It is important to de-stress through exercises.""Sarin has some important advice for those who want to avoid this vexing problem. ""Contrary to common practice, one should have tea, coffee or water only after going to the toilet in the morning,"" he says. ""This is essential for proper bowel strength and functioning."" He also says that following any intestinal infection, a person would be better off having rice and curds rather than antibiotics."

HUL's packaged foods portfolio consists of brands such as Kissan (jams, ketchups and squashes), Knorr (soups, soupy noodles and meal makers), Annapurna (salt, wheat flour) and Kwality Wall's and Magnum (frozen desserts/ice creams).""In the global scheme of things, the atta and salt businesses are inconsequential. In India, HUL was no match to some of its peers in the segment and they want to continue only in businesses where they have a leading position,"" said another banker privy to the company's strategy. ""The company expects a valuation of about Rs 350-400 crore from the sale,"" said the third person who's part of the deal.An HUL spokesperson, when contacted, said, ""We do not comment on market speculation."" Hindustan Unilever entered the salt business in 1995 and the atta business in 1998 but has struggled since to take lead in these segments. The sluggish sales of the food products along with the thin margins have forced the company to take a fresh look at its India strategy in the foods business.As per a HDFC Securities research report, dated January 16, 2016, the company ran a thin margin of 3.2% on its packaged foods segment with a total revenue of Rs 4,695 crore for the third quarter ending December 31, 2015. This was down 7.4%, compared with Rs 5,071crore of revenues in the second quarter ended September 30, 2015. Bulk of this came from the fast-selling segments of Knorr and Kissan. The revenues from packaged foods are just 5.89% of the total revenue of Rs 79,709 crore the company earned for the third quarter.HUL's food business largely revolved around Kissan, Knorr and Kwality Wall's icecream. The company earlier tried various strategies such as clubbing food brands such as Knorr Annapurna and Kissan Annapurna (for ready-to-eat chapattis), but didn't tinker with them eventually.According to Ritwik Rai, VP, Kotak Securities, the atta and salt segment aren't HUL's focus areas. ""In atta, they have already vacated the space to ITC which itself does not make much money. HUL seems to be following the global template and there has been no Indian innovation in the space."""

""Ration dealers owing allegiance to CPM are doing mischief with political motive and some people are supporting them,"" she said. She also said she could have used harsher words, but instead she is polite. According to her, some CPM-controlled panchayats are distributing cards selectively triggering trouble. ""I will not allow any disruption in the rationing system, I am taking this as a challenge. The problem will be solved in a week.""She said, ""Those without new digital ration cards can still continue with old cards. Mistakes in the digital cards will be rectified.

Children are made to write Harisree Ganapathaye Namah on either rice or sand, by a revered person, which is an invocation to Vishnu, Lakshmi and Ganapathi, following which the acharya write Harisree on the kid's tongue with a golden ring. Traditionally, the Karanavar or oldest member of the family is the one who takes on the role of the acharya, but of late, literary figures have also been taking charge of the ceremony. While one's own home or a nearby Saraswathy Temple is usually the Vidyarambham venue, there are certain revered places which have become renowned as Vidyarambham centres. Here are a few:There cannot be a better place for initiating toddlers into education than the Thunchan Parambu, the birthplace of Thunchath Ezhuthachan, better known as the father of Malayalam language. It is not a temple but a memorial trust and research centre located at Tirur in Malappuram.The beauty of the ceremony here has been such that year after year devotees gather at the temple, maintaining the same fervour. Last year, it was reported that around 4,000 families had attended the ceremony. Starting off as early as four in the morning, the rituals are held until afternoon, when parents along with their tiny tots anxiously wait for their kids' turn to inscribe the words on rice.Panachikkadu Saraswathi Temple, situated in Panachikadu village, around 11 km from Kottayam district, has been one of the most popular places to go during the Vidyarambham ceremony, also known as Ezhuthiniruthu. It's a temple dedicated to Saraswathi. While the main deity in the temple is Vishnu, while Shiva, Ganapathy, Sree Dharmashasta, Nagaraja, Brahmarakshassu and Yakshi are the other deities worshipped here.Devotees throng the temple from various places to perform a ritual wherein a special ghee, which is an offering to goddess Saraswathi, is distributed among devotees. The ghee is believed to nourish the intelligence quotient of children and help them make a mark in education. The rest of the Vidyarambham rituals follow.The Dakshina Mookambika Saraswathi Temple at North Paravur in Ernakulam district is equally famous when it comes to Vidyarambham. The queue here for the induction of kids into the world of knowledge and education is so long that parents start lining up the previous night. The pooja is conducted by the head priest at around 2 am, following which the Vidyarambham ceremony commences at the Saraswathy mandapam.Thiruvullakaavu Sree Dharma Sastha Temple was once an abode of the holy shrine amid a thick forested area. The temple, located in Cherpu village of Thrissur district, is dedicated to the lord Ayyappa, also known as Sree Sastha.Vidyarambham is considered one of the most important festivities of the area, and the inception of children into the ritual at the kaavu is believed to make the toddler a scholar in the future. According to the sacred texts, the Lord Shasta is fiery in nature but at Thiruvullakaavu, he blesses children with enough wits to earn prosperity to the point of satiety. Later, they becomewise enough to renounce it and seek the path of bliss. It is thus believed that Thiruvullakaavu is the abode of wisdom.The Chottanikkara temple is located at Chottanikkara in Ernakulam, and has been scaling heights of popularity among worshippers across the State during the Ezhuthuniruthu ceremony. Goddess Bhagavathy is the one of the main deities worshipped in the temple.Various rites and rituals are observed in the temple during the Malayalam months of Chingam, Kanni, Vrischikam, Kumbham, Medam and Karkitakam, of which Vidyarambham is one of the main highlights.The ceremony starts at 8.30 in the morning and may go up to 11.30 am. Infants aged three to six are initiated into reading, writing and arithmetic in the presence of the temple priest."

According to tradition, four unmarried girls are worshipped on Ashadhi Punav. Four girl children are usually selected for the festival. They then visit a spring in the forested area to fetch water in four earthen pitchers after taking a bath there. One copper pitcher filled with spring water is worshipped by keeping a coconut over it enveloped in mango leaves.Not only Udarna, but villagers from other parts of Malkarnem also come to seek blessings of the girl children worshipped on the occasion.Nobody knows when and where the tradition began. Village elders are of the opinion that worshipping four girl children is closely related to the an incident wherein four girls went missing in the forest.Kushali Gaonkar, from Udarna says, ""No one knows what happened to those four girls. Whether they were attacked by wild animals in the forest or met with an accidental death, it is not known till date. These girls appeared in the dream of a village elder one night and since then Aashadh Punav has been symbolically observed. The tradition has remained till date.""In the past, only four girls were worshipped but some young boys too are worshipped by offering flowers and garlands. The girls have to fast for three days before the festival. Devotees throng in large numbers to seek their blessings.This unique tradition prevails among the tribal community of Udarna to express gratitude to womanhood. The festivities go on till late Monday night at the house of Manohar Fato Gaonkar. Devotees feast on cooked rice and khatkhate. The following day, the sacred pitcher or kalash is taken to houses in the village. Next year, the festival will be celebrated by Varchawada of Udarna."

They may be topographic features and other factors that decide the name of a place, but again, changes over decades may have eroded their significance.In Chorao , a small ward called Chamerem gained its name in strange fashion. The small eatery that supplied simple food  culinary delicacies of that time  on the busy Mandovi riverfront prompted locals to name the place Chamerem. But as importance of landmarks keep shifting, the present ferry point has shrouded the other landmark at Chamerem, an interior corner of the island opposite the building that formerly housed the Goa Institute of Management.Chorao or Chudamani, as it is referred in hoary records, was a bustling suburb of former Portuguese capital, Old Goa. Now, reduced to insignificance, the saga of its past grandeur is not totally lost.Fidalgos stayed in Chorao and the first seminary in Asia was set up here on this island, says Salvador Fernandes, a local businessman. The fidalgos would be found often lounging near the ferry point on the south-eastern side of the island, waiting for patmarios (sail boats) to cross over to Old Goa or Ribandar . The wide array of snacks ranging from pao bhaji and samosas to masala dosas were unheard of then.The fidalgos as well as the common folk took great delight in chewing on snacks available then and gulped down hot tea in the shacks.They enjoyed the freshly steamed merem (snack) and sipped the hot cha (tea) at that spot, says Fernandes. And this is how Cha and Merem mingled into a combination of a nomenclature that stuck to the place.Recalling that an elderly village teacher and social worker, Domingo Caetano Abreo, who died a few years ago had told him about it, Fernandes says the snack itself disappeared from the kitchen of local folks.The Chorao ferry point has shifted south to the present spot, where commuters, scooterists and motorists are caught in a whirl of a mad rush to reach office, market, other places or their homes.The Chorao-Ribandar route is the busiest ferry route in the state. According to figures provided by river navigation department, three vessels operating on this route made an amazing 1.02 lakh trips in 2007-08 and 1.31 lakh trips in 2008-09. The department estimated that about 2,99,900 commuters, 1,32,100 two- wheelers and 52,744 cars crossed over on this route. And now, there are more ferry boats, more trips, commuters and vehicles using the route. But there is hardly any time to smell tea or coffee, or the hot samosas in nearby restaurants for the commuters.Riding or driving through the biggest riverine island in Goa, the commuters also pass through Chamerem. But the old ferry ramp is now lost in an overgrown swamp and its view blocked by new structures sprouting along the roadside. Though the hub of the village has shifted from Chamerem to other parts of the island, the burgeoning population is slowly taking up spaces here for housing. There were only a few houses here in the recent past.Chamerem was in the spotlight recently when the first chapel dedicated to St Teresa of Kolkata was inaugurated at its roadside location in September.Some islanders say merem was not one single sweet, but comprised three of them. Khole which was a package of jaggery and coconut rolled by a paste of rice ground to a patem was one of them. The other two were xevieo and ale-bele.Percival Noronha says the Portuguese introduced tea in the 16th century in Goa. Cha e merenda (tea and the evening snack) must have slowly changed into Chamerem, he says."

I do eat them but in moderation,"" said R Siva from Ganapathy Nagar.People are now consciously taking preventive measures to enjoy a healthy life. Afraid of becoming diabetic, several people have cut down on their consumption of sweets. Doctors have also been advising people to opt for foods with natural sugars like fruits.""If people eat too many sweets, it increases the blood sugar levels. Diabetic patients are more vulnerable. It is important they keep away from foods with processed sugars and opt for those with natural sugar which does not cause a dramatic change in the blood sugar level,"" said diabetes specialist Dr M Senthilvel.Endocrinologist Dr S Sridhar from Madurai also advices people to limit their intake of sweets. ""Eating sweets once in a while is okay.

The Kamma community has become influential thanks to the BJP-TDP alliance, and both Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and Venkaiah Naidu are gifting coveted posts to their fellow community members,"" he added.Even as the University of Hyderabad has a Kamma vice-chancellor, as many as five other academic institutes too have people from the same community at the helm. These include the National Academy for Research Management, whose director is D Rama Rao, the National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management with director general V Usha Rani, the Indian Institute of Rice Research headed by director V Ravindra Rao, the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture under director Ch Srinivas Rao and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology which is headed by director Ch Mohan Rao, all hailing from the Kamma community. The director posts in these institutions are akin to the vice-chancellor rank.Observing that the caste factor playing a role in recruitments is a recent phenomenon, political scientist G Haragopal has demanded President Pranab Mukherjee's intervention to ensure that appointments are made purely on the basis of merit.""It is crystal clear that the Kamma community has been given preference thanks to Venkaiah Naidu and Chandrababu Naidu having their say at the Centre. I think the President has to play his role and ensure more freedom to the search committees. He must be proactive in keeping caste politics at bay when it comes to appointments for the top pots in academic institutions,"" said Haragopal.His thoughts found resonence elsewhere as well. ""They say the educational institutions must be free from caste discrimination. But when it comes to practice, they do exactly the opposite,"" said Aldas Janaiah, senior scientist and agronomist.The pointers are clearly at the Union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu for alleged domination of his Kamma community in the higher educational institutions.However, a fellow Kamma leader, K Haribabu, defended the appointments to the premier institutions, including the vice-chancellor of UoH. ""The appointments for the academic institutions are the prerogative of the ministry of human resource development. How can any minister who is not in-charge of the ministry play a role in it? The appointments are no doubt on merit basis,"" said Haribabu, who is Andhra Pradesh state BJP president and Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha member."

Living in a shanty near Ranchi Lake, Rakhi, Madhu and Juhi Tirkey belong to a family of seven including five siblings who were quietly pursuing their studies from Marwari college in 2012 without any ambition when former wrestler and general secretary, Jharkhand Wrestling Federation, Bhola Nath Singh spotted them with immense potential.""We used to pass through the wrestler coaches residence on our way to school when one day in 2012, Bhola sir stopped us and asked if we were interested in wrestling,"" said Rakhi.It was Madhu, then 14, who decided to join the training program first, joining the batch very next day. Rakhi followed the younger sister a day later.""Our family had no objection in letting us play as there was nothing much to do anyway. Bhola sir also visited us to convince our parents. For them, the prospect of bagging a scholarship from government was enough, said Madhu, who has bagged one national level and scores of state level medals in wrestling by now.Rakhi too, has managed to excel, now graduating to senior level in National wrestling. She has twice been selected for national wrestling camps and won a silver medal in Kanyakumari, National Wrestling Championship in 2013. She also participated in 35th National Games, held in Kerala last year where she stood 5th in rankings.Buoyed by the exploits of both girls, Mohan Tirkey, their father, also encouraged their youngest daughter, Juhi, 14, to follow elder sisters' footsteps. The youngest one, also interested in Silambam, a weapon-based Indian martial art from Tamil Nadu apart from wrestling, has also won a couple of medals of her own. Two champions of the Tirkey family are now brining home Rs.36000 annual stipend each, albeit the release of funds is often delayed and inadequate to support the expenses on their diet and grooming.""Our only source of income is selling Handiya, which hardly generates Rs 500 a day on weekdays. The money is simply not enough to raise the kids. I'm happy that they have chosen their path and are setting examples for rest of the kids in the locality,"" said Mohan, who is illiterate.Bhola Nath Singh, who had just three girls in training camp to begin with in 2012, the number has now reached more than 16.""I have always maintained that Jharkhand is full of such talent. It's just a matter of eye and time to seek them out and nurture them. We are proud to say we never had to beg from the government to fund the training of our girls. We don't have any expectations in future as well. We will continue to groom these girls who will bring laurels to state and country as well,"" Singh said."

The tribals believe that the souls of dead persons rest in peace after their ashes are immersed in the holy confluence.Before offering 'pinda' to their forefathers, the tribals immerse the ashes and get their heads tonsured. The offerings placed on three Sal leaves include mud, toothpicks, rice and sweets.""This is a part of their annual ritual called 'Jiling Dahar' or long-term journey.

The incident also brings to the fore the growing involvement of the Maoists with local politics.Sources claimed that the murder of ex-TDP sarpanch was incited by leaders of a certain political party which, in its aim to settle scores with the ruling TDP, fabricated information against him and passed them to the naxals.After the white paper on bauxite mining was released by the state government, Ramana was staying outside his village. Information of his returning to the village was leaked to the naxals by local leaders, it is being claimed. A close aide of Ramana told TOI on anonymity that the slain villager had never acted against the banned outfit even during his term as a TDP sarpanch.Another villager said that allegations were leveled against Ramana that he amassed wealth by grabbing lands. ""That was not true. He had borrowed money from a person in another village 10 days before his murder. He was confident that his party could not mine bauxite as there were many complications in the process,"" he said.According to the villager, certain political leaders were oppressed under Ramana's leadership. They also had a suspicion that he provoked the tribals to obstruct a YSRCP MLA when the person visited the bauxite hill area, he said. Now, TDP and YSRCP have locked horns in the Jerrela area to showcase their dominance.""Maoists top leadership would generally take a decision whether to kill a person or demolish his house. But nowadays, local squads are taking the decisions. A former ZPTC of the Visakha Agency Matya Raju's house was looted by the Maoists a couple of years ago. Around 70 rice bags were looted from his house during the famine raid. Recently, Maoists had called him and reportedly told him that they committed mistake,"" a tribal leader said. ""This is how they are operating in the Agency,"" he said.A senior police officer also agreed that Ramana's murder was political motivated. ""Naxals had committed another 'Sagulu' incident by killing a leader of Bhagata community, which is very strong and considered to be upper caste among the tribals. They killed the Bhagata people at Sagulu three years ago and lost the confidence among many villages in GK Veedhi. Now, they have committed another mistake and would face the consequences,"" he said.The Bhagatas were loyal to revolutionary Alluri Seetarama Raju in the struggle against the Britishers. Many Bhagata community leaders had worked in the erstwhile PWG and now CPI Maoists. ""You won't find any surrendered Maoist from the Bhagata community later working as special police officer (SPO) or home guard post because they are loyal to the revolution in the Agency,"" a senior politician of the Congress party in the Agency told TOI."

Served after the morning or evening poojas, the mouth-watering sweet and ven pongals are a definite attraction.While everyone has their own favourites, there are a few temples whose pongals are popular among food lovers in the city.For Gayathri Shekar, who heads the operations of a city based media company, the sweet pongal served at Triplicane's Parthasarathy Temple is the best.Visiting the temple since she was a child, Gayathri feels that the pongal tastes exceptionally good during the margazhi month. ""Amidst the cold breeze, gulping down some steaming hot pongal is an unexplainable pleasure. My best friend and I have been eating it ever since we were kids.Though he has moved out of the country, we make it a point to visit the temple whenever he comes down and relish the experience,"" she shares.The glossy pongal is said to be prepared in pure ghee and dry fruits and nuts are added to give the dish a rich taste. ""You cannot stop yourself from taking a serving,"" Gayathri adds.The Kapaleeshwarar Temple in Mylapore has been considered as the second bestby food lovers.The ven pongal (salted version of pongal) served at the temple sees devotees throng to the holy ground every morning with the hope of getting a scoopful of pongal.Shruthi Sarangarajan is one such devotee who plans her temple visits in a way that she finishes her prayers when the pongal is being served. ""Embarrassing though it may be, when I leave home to visit the temple, I am usually looking forward to having the pongal more than actually visiting the temple.The dish is so simple yet it tastes so different from the usual home-made pongal.When the dish is served, the ghee is seen oozing out of it. Most of the time, I am seen having breakfast at the temple,"" laughs Shruthi.Pongal serves as a childhood memory for Harish Venkat, a college student living in Thiruvanmiyur, whose favourite pongal is served at Sri Rathnagireeshvarar Temple in Besant Nagar. ""The temple is situated close to my school so every day, my friends and I, finish all our classes, homework and other chores, and meet at the temple.There is nothing extraordinary about the pongal but the buildup leading to the moment made the pongal special for us,"" Venkat shares.Whether it is the expectation of having the yummy pongal first thing after the morning prayers or to simply relish a spoonful of the rice dish after offering prayers post a long day at work, pongal is an important part of Chennaiites for generations will continue to remain so for generations to come."

GM-aspirant Shardul Gagare has discovered that in good measure.The 18-year-old Rahuribased player was playing a blitz tournament in Abu Dhabi in September 2014. Ukranian GM Alexander Goloshchapov, who was following the tournament online, was so impressed by Gagare's raw talent that he wrote an email to the player saying that if the latter trains under him, he is certain to become a GM.There was an online session the following month, spanning about two hours twice a week. In April 2015, the 37-year-old Goloshchapov visited Ahmednagar for a 10-day individual session with Gagare. Then followed a group cum-individual session in November.Result: Gagare is mere three Elo points away from the coveted GM title. Before being associated with Goloshchapov, the IM had attained just one GM norm in July 2013. Since then, he has added two: one in July 2015 and the third in the Qatar Open which concluded on Tuesday.""Goloshchapov made a huge difference to my game,"" said Gagare, a son of two doctors. ""He imparted new ideas to me. He ensured that I use my brain before using the chess engines. He showed me the importance of discipline in calculation. And after giving me some problem-solving tests before the Qatar Masters, he concluded that I'm almost sure of improving my strength.""Goloshchapov had worked with Parimarjan Negi, Shiven Khosla and Vaibhav Suri earlier. With 15 of the 39 Indian GMs not maintaining the Elo 2500 strength in the January list, India No. 27 and World No. 961 Gagare is aware that his tough journey will unfurl new chapters.When he plays the Mumbai Open, which starts in the last week of this month, touching the Elo 2500 mark will be the first challenge because being so near of the title can be quite unnerving. And after getting there, he will have to find ways to protect his ranking: not just by fabricated draws when suitable; but also by winning against higher and lower rated players consistently.Becoming a GM at 15 is not uncommon these days. Gagare has been a late bloomer by that standard. But then, the Gagares are used to challenging life. His father Annasaheb quit his medical practice and has been accompanying his son to tournaments for more than five years now.""Chess can't be a part-time activity like other sports,"" said Annasaheb. ""And it demanded total involvement from my side. I needed to travel with Shardul to various tournaments. It is a demanding sport. Hence I took up a job in medical college, so that I can devote time for his chess. My wife Sumangal takes care of our clinic.""The family must have spent more than Rs 50 lakh over last 8-10 years.Shardul's elder sister Shalmali is also a chess player and a Woman International Master to boot. Currently on a sabbatical, she plans to returns to the checkered board after completing her degree in dental science.Shardul plans to give his 12th Class exams in 2017. He will attempt bigger and meaner exams first, hoping that the GM title will give him lucrative invitations and harder work desired success.How did Gagare treat himself after his third and final GM norm in Doha?""My father was there to take care of my studies, strategy and food,"" said the youngster. ""Though I eat non vegetarian food, I generally eat safe during tournaments. Rice daal, daal khichadi and laapshi are my favourites.""Qatar Open was the strongest ever rating tournament with players above Elo 2300 getting free entry.

A global campaign that began in the United Kingdom, it aims to reduce animal suffering by inspiring and supporting people to go vegan for a month. And it has struck a chord with Chennaiites too, with many resolving to shun animal products.Founded by Matthew Glove and Jane Land, the movement stands apart from its month-long counterparts by focusing on January as it is the time for change, resolutions and new beginnings. ""People find it easier if they have to abstain only for a month or a week and not forever. Fortunately , many of them experience its benefits and turn vegan for life,"" says Bhuvaneshwari Gupta, campaigns and nutrition advisor, Peta India.In Chennai, those who are taking the pledge say it is tough to give up on ghee, paneer and curd rice when those are your favourites. ""It is easy when you are at home as you can try different vegan recipes, which are tasty. But it is hard to stick to it when you are eating out with friends,"" says animal-lover Malavika Madhavi Nori, a vegetarian taking the vegan pledge this year.Though Indian sweets during festivities make it difficult to resist the urge to indulge, the health benefits motivate her to continue. ""Slowly, I am noticing the difference. After lunch, I am able to pay attention without feeling sleepy in office. Also, my acne has reduced considerably,"" says Malavika, who is among 22,000 others who have decided to take the pledge and ditch meat, fish, eggs and milk for a month.But will the month-long promise develop into a permanent change? Vegans say that it may seem tough initially but there are many ways to stay motivated.The vegan-starter kits of Veganuary and PeTA are ideal guides for meat-eaters and vegetarians to discover delicious vegan recipes, substitutes and products. From Japanese to Turkish, Indian to African, animal-welfare sites highlight vegan-friendly dishes in various cuisines, like miso soup, red pepper hummus and chana masala. They also bust myths concerning nutrition and health for veganism.Apps like Meal 'n' Heal developed by nutritionist Preethi Raghav are largely helpful. ""It is informative as it provides statistics on how you save the environment by going vegan.There is also a graph that shows how the diet improves your health,"" says app-user Karuna Devi, whose shift to veganism from non-vegetarianism has benefited her.Regular vegan meet-ups in the city are also a motivation booster. For instance, potlucks organised by Veg Voyages - a vegan adventure tour company, have served as eye-openers for many."

Minz told TOI on Sunday 'This season 72 to 74% was the coverage of paddy in the district. 52% of the paddy coverage got lost/damaged due to scanty and erratic rain fall here'.By this officer's own assertionPalamu had a bare 20-22% of paddy cultivation.Now paddy procured already touched 40,000 quintal figure till February 10 and is counting! Albert Biloung the district supply officer is 'surprised'. District agricultural officer Minz is speechless on this phenomenon of poor paddy cultivation and rich haul of paddy procurement in Palamu.Sources said either the assessment of paddy cultivation in Palamu was underestimated or the ground reality of paddy was concealed from the state in order to bring Palamu in the fold of drought-hit districts.FCI has set up four paddy procurement centres in Palamu one each at Chiyanki, Chainpur, Chhaterpur and Harihurganj.

It was Panda's first formal press conference after he took over the party reign on Thursday.The posters carry two broad messages. The first tries to portray that the Re 1 rice in the state is a central scheme, the arithmetic being out of the Rs 30 per kg rice under the National Food Security Act, the central government is contributing Rs 27, the state government Rs 2 and the beneficiary Re 1. The second message is that the ruling party leaders and influential people grabbed the NFSA benefits. ""We will carry these posters to all the around 50,000 villages in the state,"" Panda said.Panda said the government so far had acted only against lower level employees for ration card irregularities sparing its own leaders who made cards in their name. When Cuttack mayor Anita Behera's figure in the list, she was only asked to resign. The government must register a criminal complaint against her, Panda said.Alleging that the government had totally failed to ensure implementation of the Central Act, Panda said unless the entire exercise was redone, real beneficiaries would never get benefits of the targeted public distribution.Taking a dig at the Congress for its series of eggs hurling at ministers over the issue and the government response of assaulting those involved, Panda said, ""the BJP neither believes in Congress eggs nor in BJD's sticks.""Countering the BJP allegation, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma said the state's implementation of NFSA has been appreciated by the Centre. ""Deepak Kumar, joint secretary of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has described our model as worth emulating by other states. Those accusing us of failure should clarify from the Centre first,"" Dasburma said.Reacting to Panda's criticism for egg attacks, leader of opposition and senior Congress leader Narasingha Mishra said, ""My party doesn't need sermons from the BJP, known for its violence and communalistic approach.""Responding to the government's notice in newspapers, around two lakh people withdrew from the beneficiaries' list by the January 15 deadline, government sources said."
