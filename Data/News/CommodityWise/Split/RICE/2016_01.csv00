""Apne beta ke pet par laat aur doosron ko doodh-bhaat (a kick on the stomach of your own son and milk and rice to others) should not be the policy of the state government. It will not be tolerated,"" said Alok Banerjee, a former trade union leader.Others also weighed in on the decision.""Locals should be given first preference to reside on factory land,"" said Sewa Singh, president of the FCI VSS employees' association, adding that the state government should announce a rehabilitation policy for former factory employees and their families.Dhanbad DC K N Jha, when contacted, said the JRDA required land for the resettlement and rehabilitation of title holders residing in Jharia.The title holders of Jharia, according to JRDA plans, would be given three options to choose from as compensation, said Jha. He added that title holders could choose to take compensation worth the total value of their land and assets along with 100 sq m of land or they they could opt for a constructed flat.""They could also avail the benefits of Coal India's rehabilitation and resettlement policy,"" said Jha."

Unfortunately, time is gradually weeding out the legacy of this extraordinary trade.""You never felt the need to ask about the shop of a warq maker. The little faint sound would naturally draw anybody there. Even a tourist would know. However, when I visited Lucknow this time after 15 years, I had to ask commuters in Chowk where I can find the warq shop,"" says Suraiyya Saleem, who visited her hometown after a long time.Of the 15 shops then, only about four are left now which preserve the traditional art.Asma Naqvi, a resident of the vicinity, says, ""Our ears were accustomed to the soft rhythmic sound of the hammer. Now, I feel a fragment of culture is missing"".Process of warq makingA small piece of silver, less than half inch in width, is pounded by a special hammer after it is placed between the translucent pages of a small book. It is hammered for four hours persistently to become wafer thin.The tiny piece of silver expands by the heat produced and turns into chandi ka warq or silver leaf.The book is called auzaar or instrument as it works like one for them. Its pages are made up of deer skin and Agra is the only place where the book is manufactured. It is boiled with 356 herbs including mush, amber and zafraan (saffron). It is later seasoned with the stone called Makool. The book costs about Rs 8,000 and lasts for about four months. The silver bands are brought from Varanasi and cut into tiny rectangles.History of warq makingSome 2,000 years ago, silver and gold warq were used in Ayurveda medication and by Hakims for its rich medicinal properties to treat infertility and build immunity. It was also believed to cure chicken pox within a short span of three days when one fourth of gold warq was consumed mixed with honey.Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, who ruled Oudh from 1847-1856 made this art a popular trade in Oudh. Delhi, Hyderabad, Bareilly and Varansi are also major producers of silver warq but the warq crafted in Lucknow is transcendent. ""You do find chandi ka warq in Hyderabad. But the warq crafted in Lucknow is unparalleled,"" Says Rafat, a trader from Hyderabad.During Nawab Wajid Ali Shah's reign, the khansamas (chefs) garnished food with silver and gold warq. Moti pulao or pearl pulao was cooked by coating rice grains with silver and gold leaves.Mohd Saleem is a warq maker whose forefathers devoted 250 years to preserve the legacy of this craft. But, he says, the traditional warq making art is gradually dying.""Karigars are leaving because it's not fetching good wages. Machines do the job for less money,"" he says.""A few years ago, residents in the vicinity complained about the constant disturbance due to the hammering sound from morning to evening. The police asked them to either move their business elsewhere or get sound-proof doors. Most people switched business; some relocated their shops,"" said Saleem.A concern he shares is that people nowadays avoid consuming sweets with warq because they believe it to be coated with aluminium or silver foil mixed with other toxic metals. ""In traditional warq making, adulteration is not possible. The warq obtained is pure silver.""But, another shop owner says that the powder-like substance used in the machine during the process is toxic.Besides, as silver is expensive, some sweet makers use foil made up of inferior metals.Differentiating between the original silver leaves and fake ones, Saleem says said leaves made up of other metals like gilat (an alloy of nickel and aluminium) are blackish silver in colour. They usually don't disintegrate on touch but roll into tiny balls. A silver leaf, on the other hand, instantly sticks to one's finger when touched and the colour is bright silver.Saleem also makes gold leaves, used mainly in medicines and rarely in food preparations because it is expensive. One gold leaf costs Rs 300 per piece and silver Rs 3 per piece.Saleem grimly adds that the traditional art of warq making is invincible and the government should take initiative to preserve and promote the legacy of the Lakhnawi culture."

The meet, which comes a week ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's peasants' rally in Bargarh on February 21, coincided with oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan reviewing the preparation for the PM's rally there.""The Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanwaya Samiti, an umbrella body of farmer organizations, discussed how political parties are competing with each other to exploit the agrarian crisis for political reasons without taking sincere steps to address the problems,"" said farmer leader Ashok Pradhan.The paddy belt of Bargarh remains the focus of farmer politics. Bargarh, termed the rice bowl of Odisha, contributes about one-fourth of the total 30 lakh metric tonnes of paddy procured annually in the state. After Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi undertook a padayatra on September 10 last year, chief minister Naveen Patnaik followed it up with a farmers' rally on November 19 two months later. Now, Modi is supposed to address the farmers there.Samiti spokesperson Saroj said the various political parties see Bargarh as a potential political battleground for farmer politics, but they don't really do anything to address their concerns ""A fraction of the amount spent could have solved the farmers' problems. The organizing cost of the two rallies held here (by Congress and BJD) and the upcoming BJP one must be above Rs 30 crore, while the total debt of over 30 farmers who committed suicide in Bargarh district in the last khariff season would not be more than Rs 3 crore,"" Saroj said.""The Samiti is of the view that the government should implement the Swaminathan committee report, which recommended a 50% profit margin for farmers in the minimum support price,"" he added.Speaking to reporters in Bargarh, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said that the PM's meeting is very significant because he will interact with farmers to get a better understanding of the ground situation in the region. ""Moreover, the rally will help agriculturists learn about the benefits of new initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) so that they draw maximum benefits out of it by enrolling them,"" said Pradhan.The Samiti, however, feels that the PMFBY, which the PM is scheduled to publicize during four rallies across the country, including the one in Bargarh, will not make any significant difference to farmers' lives. ""The proposed rate of premium for crop insurance under the PMFBY at 2% for kharif and 1.5% for rabi crops in already in practice in existing insurance schemes in states such as Odisha,"" he said.Buoyed by the large turnout at the PM's Paradip meeting on February 7, BJP has been aggressively mobilizing people for the party event in Bargarh. Tribal affairs minister Jual Oram is scheduled to address the party workers on February 19 followed by Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh on February 20, party sources said."

We receive the second highest number of complaints of bonded labour from Odisha after Uttar Pradesh,"" said Justice D Murugeshan, member of the NHRC, here on Tuesday. He was speaking at a national-level workshop on elimination of bonded labour organised by the NHRC.He said that most of the complaints received from Odisha are regarding the 'bartan' system in which the upper caste employs lower caste families for menial labour jobs for a pittance - as low as 15kg rice a year. ""The 'bartan' system is a major violation of the human rights of a person. Government officers must be sensitive while identifying and rescuing bonded labourers. Rehabilitation of the rescued along with alternate employment is very important so they are not forced to migrate again,"" he added.According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011, Odisha has a total 6,353 bonded labourers of whom 5,413 have been legally freed. Since 2011, a total 1,747 bonded labourers have been identified. The state government has so far rehabilitated 493 bonded labourers and has sought permission from the Centre for rehabilitation of 891 more. The state government and the Centre give Rs 10,000 each to a bonded labourer under the rehabilitation scheme.Senior officers of the state government, representatives of the State Human Rights Commission, voluntary organisations, and representatives of brick kilns, stone crushers and other related industries participated in the day-long workshop.""The objective of the workshop is to familiarize and sensitize district magistrates, sub-divisional magistrates, state labour officers and members of vigilance committees, brick kilns, stone-crushing and other related industries involved in the process of identification, release and rehabilitation of bonded labourers and with the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 and other related legislations,"" said chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi.A large number of people - including from the washermen and barber communities - are still working as bonded labourers in Puri and Cuttack districts.

It was Panda's first formal press conference after he took over as the party state chief on Thursday.The posters carry two broad messages. The first tries to portray that the Re 1 rice in the state is a central scheme, the arithmetic being out of the Rs 30 a kg rice under the National Food Security Act, the central government is contributing Rs 27, the state government Rs 2 and the beneficiary Re 1. ""The second message is that the ruling party leaders and influential people grabbed the NFSA benefits. We will carry these posters to all the around 50,000 villages in the state,"" said Panda.Panda said the government so far acted only against lower level employees for ration card irregularities sparing its own leaders who made cards in their name. ""The Cuttack mayor (Anita Behera) was only asked to resign. The government must register a criminal complaint against her,"" Panda said.Alleging that the government had completely failed to ensure implementation of the Central Act, Panda said unless the entire exercise was redone, real beneficiaries would never get benefits of the targeted public distribution.Taking a dig at the Congress for its series of eggs hurling at ministers over the issue and the government response of assaulting those involved, Panda said, the BJP neither believes in Congress eggs nor in BJDs sticks.Countering the BJP allegation, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma said the state's implementation of NFSA has been appreciated by the Centre. Deepak Kumar, joint secretary in the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution has described our model as worth emulating by other states. Those accusing us of failure should clarify from the Centre first, said Dasburma.Reacting to Panda's criticism for egg attacks, leader of opposition and senior Congress leader Narasingha Mishra, ""My party doesn't need sermons from the BJP, known for its violence and communalistic approach.""Responding to the governments notice in newspapers, around two lakh people withdrew from the beneficiaries list by the January 15 deadline, government sources said."

The board will also examine change of design in Pranahita Chevella and Kanthanapalli projects.The Telangana government had complained over non-sharing of hydro power generated at Sileru project by AP government and asked the board to give necessary orders on the issue. The AP government refused to share power citing that all hydro projects were re-distributed between two states based on their geographical location. The matter is now placed before the board which will pronounce its decision after hearing both the governments.""If we have to give Sileru power, then they have to give us power from Jurala and Nagarjunasagar. Since Telangana is not giving us power from its hyd ro stations, we are not at obligation to give power to Telangana,"" said a senior official in the AP energy department.Similarly , the AP government raised doubts over downstream water availability with the change of design of Pranahita-Chevella lift irrigation and Kanthanapalli projects. It has asked Telangana to provide details of additional water usage by two reservoirs proposed at Tummidihatti and Medigadda.Telangana also changed the Kanthanpalli project by proposing new reservoir at Tupakulagudem. AP irrigation officials are vary over the impact on the water availability in Godavari river once three major reservoirs come up above Polavaram project. The board, though appointed by the Centre 16 months back under the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, could not make any headway in resolving contentious issues between two states. As per the Godavari water sharing award, Telangana was allotted 912 TMC feet water and 509 TMC feet water for AP out of a total 1484 TMC feet water av ailable in river Godavari. Another 64.35 TMC feet water was allotted for hydro-electric projects and evaporation losses.Basing on the allocation both states have proposed new projects resulting in apprehension over future availability of water. Andhra Pradesh already launched Pattiseema project to divert about 8,000 cusecs of water per day during the flood days of river Godavari. Telangana go vernment has raised its voice over Pat tiseema for not obtaining permission from the Central Water Commission.""Blaming it on Pattiseema, the Te langana government wanted to go ahe ad with its new projects without even gi ving us information. We have raised our objection to this unilateral action,"" said a senior official in the AP government.The board led by Ram Sharan to hear the arguments of both parties and give its verdict on the contentious issues as two states have decided to go ahead with their plans to harness the Godavari river in the backdrop of severe drought conditions engulfed the region. In AP , cultivation was hit in East and West Godavari districts which are known as rice belt of the region, due to severe water shortage in Godavri river.The western region of the river where the farmers used to cultivate over 4.5 lakh acres of land, had to limit their operations to 1.5 lakh acres, indicating the severity of the situation.With no inflows into the river and reduced inflows into sub-regions, the farm activity was worst hit in the Godavari delta region.

His assignments have been spread all over the world with the likes of South Africa ' A', Dolphins, Kent and Surrey.The South African is back in the Emerald Isles to help rebuild Sri Lankan cricket after the departure of legends Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Indian cricket is also no stranger to Ford, as he sensationally turned down an offer from BCCI to coach the national side back in 2007. TOI caught up with Ford here on Wednesday.As you go along in life, there are certainly different challenges. We are here on a mission to rebuild Sri Lankan cricket and there are lots of important role-players involved in the process. I have worked hard and rebuilt teams in the past and it is a similar situation here. The loss of great senior players like Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara has had an impact. The hierarchy and the board are now looking at the next crop of players.It varies from group to group and you have to adapt yourself to the demands. When you have a younger group it is a different scenario and it also depends on the leadership of the team. If you have a very experienced captain who likes to lead from the front, you take a more hands-off approach.I am not fussy about what sort of role I am have. At that particular time, I had a very young family and to make it work it was always going to be difficult. But to be involved with any good group of cricketers is what I love and is my passion. I don't mind where in the world that is but I'll be enjoying it.There are some superstars who are wonderful individuals and help the coach along the way as well. I had the great Malcolm Marshall and Clive Rice in the team that I coached at Kwazulu-Natal and I learned much from them. People seem to think that some of them are difficult to handle but very often they help the group a great deal.I helped him a bit as a young player back in Natal. I think we clicked quite early on in his career. Every player has a particular coach they feel very comfortable with and it's just worked well with him. He trusted a lot of what I had to say to him. From then on, I have offered him the odd reminder of things."

The promise was to checkmate rival LDF's Rs 2 a kg rice for the poor scheme. That election, UDF scraped through winning 72 of the 140 seats.Listing freebies in the manifesto wasn't a practice parties in Kerala followed. But in the last polls there was a change, prompted possibly by sops-and-goodies showers in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Only last month, presenting the state budget, CM Oommen Chandy tweaked the scheme and announced free rice for 35 lakh BPL and Antyodaya Anna Yojana category families.""Sops won't really make any impact in elections here because politics is so deep rooted in the state. Every voter has his own politics. Free rice or bicycles won't change his preferences. Parties know this better than anyone else,"" says Prof J Prabhash, political scientist. He talks of the Kerala middle class's skeptical mindset. It takes such promises with a pinch of salt.Senior journalist Jacob George recalls the 1987 election when Congress leader K Karunakaran focused the campaign on 'goat and hen votes'. ""The previous government led by Karunakaran had distributed free goats and hen to the poor. The distribution was so generous that the government thought most beneficiaries would vote for it. But, the results proved Karunakaran wrong,"" he recalls. Political observer and CPM fellow traveller Cherian Philip says poverty levels are much lower in Kerala compared to the neighbouring states. ""Freebies fail to enthuse voters as they can afford these without any concessions.""Cherian Philip, who was an LDF candidate in 2011, says he personally found the Re 1 rice campaign by UDF futile. ""I spoke with many women voters then. None of them seemed to be enthused by the idea. The stock reply was free rice would be of inferior quality,"" he says.Welfare pensions have been an area where both LDF and UDF have invested with an eye on elections. Changing governments added more beneficiaries of welfare pension schemes and the current number of beneficiaries is over 30 lakh, 11% of the electorate. In the recent budget too, Chandy hiked pension to Rs 1,500 for beneficiaries above 75 years."

Some had to return empty handed as there were no pulse seeds. Ajaypal Singh from Mansa said he had specially come to purchase seeds for 'moong dal', but PAU authorities had no pulse seeds.Meanwhile, students of B.Sc six-year programming (10+1, 10+2 and four years of B.Sc course) continued their strike.

The students said the university was not providing them with certificates for 10+2 class and it wants them the six-year certificate that does not make them eligible for jobs. According to the students, the strike would continue till their demands are met."

The onslaught, aimed at the ""grassroots"" Congress worker, betrayed a sense of unease in the Trinamool about an alliance that not too many are sure how it will play out on the ground.""We are happy the veil has finally come off. We maintained the Congress played second fiddle to the CPM in this state. Now, they are making an alliance. We have been proved right,"" said Mamata on Wednesday at DSA Ground in Englishbazar, which witnessed a rather unusual sight of the CM addressing a half-empty venue. With most candidates being from outside, the local leaders did not turn up with their truck-loads of supporters, a source said, adding even residents were discontent with having to vote for ""outsiders"". Many started leaving midway through Mamata's half-an-hour speech.Back in 2011, Mamata had kicked off her poll campaign in Malda. ""I started canvassing from here even last time. I may not have got more than one seat in Malda, but we won the state."" Behind this sentimental veil, her political intention was clear. Aware of the discontent among some Congress workers about the CPM alliance, she said, ""True Congress workers can never accept the adjustment with the CPM. Have you forgotten the CPM torture?"" She went on to tell Congress workers, addressing the grassroot workers of Congress she said, ""In 2004, our party was reduced to a single MP. But we never sacrificed our ideal. NowWhen you (Congress) are making compromises with your ideal, your existence will be at stake."" She was sarcastic, ""Will you (Congress) be able to retain what you had leave alone the dream of increasing your strength."" Not sparing the CPM either, Mamata said, ""You had been in power for 36 years. Why could you not give rice at Rs 2/kg? Why could you not develop roads or hospitals or universities? Now you are desperate to dislodge us with an unholy alliance.""Mamata left no stone unturned to ""unmask Congress"" in its bastion: ""After we left the UPA over the anti-poor policy, the Congress here started hobnobbing with the CPM in the assembly. They would jointly attack us, making their stand clear. This alliance is nothing new. Rather it will make our task easy as people will reject the immoral tie.""Cashing in on popular leaders, Mamata never ignored the impact of eight times Congress MP and former Railway Minister Ghani Khan Choudhury in this part of the world. If her associates like Subhendu Adhikary or Mukul Roy invoked the memory of Ghani Khan, asked Abu Naser Khan Choudhury (Lebu), her Sujapur candidate, to speak before her. Lebu, too, lauded Mamata who, he said, ""followed the late Congress MP Ghani Khan Choudhury's ideal of development"".After her speech, which included lists of Trinamool's development work and schemes for the minority community, Mamata left for a hotel. She will leave for Murshidabad on Thursday.Introducing all 12 candidates of TMC in this district, Mamata said, ""Last time we made alliance with Congress but in number of seats in Malda they put their candidates as independent to defeat us. This time Malda people will not entertain such backstabbing.""Harping on the development issues like food security, infrastructure or health sector, Mamata was particular about the achievement in minority development. To quote her, ""What we have done in four and half years, nobody can do in next 40 years."" In this minority dominated district she said, ""97% of Muslims are getting the benefit of reservation. 59000 Muslim students are getting higher education."" At this point she BJP too came under her attack, ""When they cannot create any division between Hindu and Muslim here they are using agencies against us.""""When the opposition have nothing to say against us, they are busy making political conspiracy against TMC. But we are not scared of anybody. We need no such alliance. We are self sufficient as people are with us"", said Mamata.However, the discontent over the candidates of TMC was evident in today's meeting as merely 8000 odd people were there leaving most of the places of DSA ground empty. Even many began to leave the ground during Mamata's speech. After the half an hour speech Mamata left for hotel at the outskirt of the town where she will stay this night before leaving for Murshidabad tomorrow."

A proposal in this regard has already been sent to the state government for a final nod on the number of family members to be eligible for getting subsided ration and per head quantity.As per the initial assessment by the food and supplies department, the per capita per day requirement of a single person would be about 350 grams of wheat, 150 grams rice and 150 gram sugar.District manager, Ujjain, MP State Civil Supplies Corporation, Dilip Saxena said, ""For supplying food grains to saints and seers during Simhastha, a proposal with initial assessment have been sent to the government. Ration would be made available to people through fair price shops."" The department will set up 40 fair price shops during Simhastha.Foodgrains procurement period cut short to 35 days: The department of food and supplies is expected to complete the procurement of foodgrains in Ujjain district within 35 days between March 16 to April 20. Normally, the procurement exercise continues for about 90 days depending upon the availability of the produce.District supply controller, RK Viker said, ""With Simhastha round the corner, we are targeting to complete the operation in 35 days. This season, we are getting less wheat from farmers because the market price is much higher than the minimum support price.""Viker said that government purchase price is Rs 1,525 per quintal while in the open market, wheat is offered in the range of Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,200 per quintal.As per the initial estimate, the Ujjain department was expecting to procure about 3 lakh MT wheat from farmers through 70 centers this year. As on March 17, 6,000 MT of wheat was procured by the state department in Ujjain district.Saxena expects wheat procurement in the ongoing season to be around 2-2.25 lakh MT as against 2.38 lakh MT a year ago."

The airline has been grounded since October 2012 and the valuation of its trademarks will therefore be revised downwards, they said.""It is likely that they will fail to recover their dues through this process as Kingfisher Airlines has not only been lying low since the last three years but over time has attracted negative publicity, which has eroded its goodwill,"" said Rahul Chaudhry, managing partner at Lall Lahiri & Salhotra, an intellectual property law firm based in Gurgaon.In 2009, for the first time ever, Mallya managed to convince State Bank of India, a conservative public sector bank, to accept an airline brand as collateral for an over Rs 2,000 crore loan.""In 2009, Grand Thornton valued KF airline brand as collateral to raise loans by UB. The brand was valued at Rs 3,406 crore,"" said Suhas Tuljapurkar, founder of law firm Legasis Partners.According to Lall Lahiri & Salhotra, the value of a trademark is directly proportional to how much it can earn through goodwill, which can be established through various methods in which the duration of use and continuity of use play an integral factor. The valuation of Kingfisher Airlines' trademarks when the airline was active and now can't be the same.""Banks should have moved early to monetise Kingfisher trademarks rather than sit idle for three years when it was apparent that Kingfisher Airlines was doomed to fail. Now, it is to be seen if aparty comes up who is willing to invest in the airline business and re-run operations under Kingfisher tagline,"" Chaudhry said.In India, it is acceptable for banks to take reputed trademarks as collateral while sanctioning loans to companies. Unlike borrowings where lenders typically turn to physical assets such as inventory, machinery or real estate to determine size of the loan and terms, a company can borrow a percentage of the value of certain intellectual property, using them as collateral.Brands by themselves have no ascertainable financial value unless they are in use and attract a stream of customers. Banks are interested in access to an asset that can be easily monetised if a borrower fails to meet its obligations.Globally, companies have leveraged the value of their brands to open lines of credit. Walt Disney had done so in 1988 to raise as much as $725 million in the Japanese market. Calvin Klein, through brand collateralisation linked to future sales of its perfume products, raised $58 million in 1993.In India, Gurgaon-based LT Foods used its rice brand Daawat as collateral to fund the acquisition of US-based rice company Kusha Inc. However, the Kingfisher case is not the same - it is an instance of banks acquiring a company's intangible assets after it defaulted on the payment of loans. While the Kingfisher Airlines trademarks may have taken a beating, a range of Kingfisherbranded beers owned by Mallya's UB Group score very high on valuation, recall and sales.""To the end consumer, it doesn't matter if Mallya once owned the beer brand and is now absconding. They will continue to buy the brand irrespective of all controversies around Mallya,"" said a top brand consultant on condition of anonymity."

As truckers are scared to operate vehicles to Tamil Nadu, the worst affected are farmers and traders in the neighbouring state; thousands of tonnes of rice, vegetables, flowers, food products, cosmetics and garments are being transported from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu. Though consumers in Tamil Nadu experience shortages to a certain extent, traders and farmers in Karnataka have incurred huge losses, the trading community says.""We had been receiving around 600 tonnes of Parle and Britannia biscuits from Bangalore. However, ever since violence broke out in Karnataka, the arrival has totally stopped as the truck operations between the two states has been suspended,"" says JJL Gnanaraj, president, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce. This apart, the arrival of flowers, vegetables, fast moving products (FMP) like cosmetics and garments from Karnataka has stopped. Exporters were increasingly worrying about the production losses, meeting export deadlines, and repayment of loans. A large number of medium and small industries were the worst affected, he said.V Ananthapadmanabhan, chief executive officer, Karur Textiles Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that as far as textile business was concerned operations were not in any way affected as they relied only on ports to export their commodities. Bus body building business has been slightly affected as the number of orders have started to slow down these days, he said. Except public transportation, everything was normal, he said.However, K Raju, president, Chamber of Commerce and Karur District Lorry Owners Association, said truckers were largely affected after violence erupted across Karnataka. ""Truckers from Karur, Namakkal, Salem and other places in the southern parts of the state have to use Karnataka to reach Mumbai and Delhi. This has forced them to suspend their operations. Around 10,000 trucks remain parked in their sheds leading to loss of wages for thousands of workers,"" he said.A Thangaraj, secretary, Trichy Onion Commission Agents Association, said, ""Usually we receive 500 tonnes of Bellary onion from Karnataka every day. After the violence, it has come down to 300 tonnes. ""Truckers transporting onions take the bypass to reach Trichy. Moreover, we are getting enough shallots from Perambalur, Namakkal and Udumalaipettai.

The courier allegedly revealed the details of the expected meeting of top Maoist leaders and passed on the information to AP police. At the same time, AP police examined satellite imagery and studied the terrain for two days and planned various aspects of the operation including the time at which security among the Maoists was at its weakest. A decision was taken by the AP police soon to either attack them during the early morning hours as the Maoists would either be sleeping or would be involved in moving to different areas, ideal conditions when they could be ambushed.Meanwhile, reliable sources said prior to the encounter, a meeting by the Maoists was held in the cut-off area which was presided over by AOB SZC secretary Ramakrishna alias RK. Gajarla Ravi alias Uday discussed the loopholes in the security forces and also in the Maoist movement.

BJP sources said the PM would publicise the pro-farmer initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana during the rallies.The BJP's selection of Bargarh as a venue for the PM's peasant rally seems politically significant because allegation of highest farmers' suicide has come from this district. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had chosen this western Odisha district to address a farmers' rally on November 19 last year and announced Rs 35,000 crore package for the underdeveloped western Odisha.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too had chosen Bargarh for a padayatra to highlight the plight of farmers on September 10 last year and had interacted with kin of around 10 farmers who ended their lives over agrarian distress.Of the around 140 farmer suicides across the state, Bargarh district witnessed the highest of over 25 in the last kharif season.

Called 'rural tourism' or 'community tourism', the activity is about living the farmland life for a day or two, where you actually learn to drive a tractor, plant crops and harvest some, too! Say hello to the farm escape that's giving folks an insight into local village life, food and more...Plenty! And it's like a complete return to nature. The idea of just going on a nature trail, having breakfast with butterflies, sleeping in a wooden hut and learning ways to save the environment has caught on. Says Rashmi Sawant of an enterprise dedicated to promoting sustainable rural tourism. ""Citygoers are now looking at leisure breaks that offer offbeat activities. Most travel for aesthetic purposes, which may not really teach you much. But connecting with a local experience like this satisfies the soul. They get a feel of community activities in a rural atmosphere and this makes for an unforgettable memory.""Visitors to such farms also pay a visit to the local cashew and other plantations, they can bathe a buffalo, spend time with rural home-makers, go fishing, visit paddy fields and even have lunch with a potter! What's very popular, especially with kids is to try rangoli and garland making as well as see the pinguli (puppetry) performances. ""Parents are increasingly realising that kids must understand the village set up and way of living,"" she adds.At a farm at Vikramgarh, Palghar district  just two hours drive away from the city  you enter through a mud path, into a 6,000 sq foot area of tribal built mandaps or shamianas made from bamboo and teak leaves. There are waterfalls here even in summer, one learns. Founder Hemant Chhabra says it's quite the antidote to the gadget-hungry crowd. ""More people are opening to a pure honest hands-on farm experience as it is so different,"" says Chhabra. Society folk can live the rural life here  learning to bake bricks, weave bamboo baskets and pick vegetables for the daily meal. ""At a mental level people want to experience what a farmer's life is all about  right from farming, to cooking the food in the right way so as to get the highest nurition from the soil and more, plus on another level it touches the five senses.""Farms like this also grow their own crops and prepare fresh frood using them. One can relish fresh nautral traditonal Indian foods here like bhakri, unpolished rice and local chutneys like khurasini (made of a nut) or even til chutney. A big part of the fun is to harvest fruits. ""Families love to go fruit-picking,"" says Chhabra. ""They pick chikoos and bananas (20 varieties are grown here) as well as apples, starfruit and cherries. They also plant seasonal palak, ambat chuk (sour spinach) and local tomatoes."""

However, the paramedical staff checked Kirubakaran's vital signs and declared him dead.""My father loves dogs, particularly Rottweilers,"" said Balaji. They used to have three Rottweilers along with two Labrador Retrievers and an equal number of German Shepherds but handed them over to a security agency five years ago. ""My father insisted on getting another Rottweiler. So, after a break of two years, we bought the female Rottweiler as a puppy,"" he said. Balaji had brought a three year-old male Rottweiler from his friend in Chennai just 10 days ago as a mating partner for the female.Rottweilers are ferocious animals with powerful jaws and sharp teeth, said Dr T Manoharan, specialist-cum-deputy director (in-charge) of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Vellore. ""They go wild when someone stops or disturbs them during their mealtimes. Rottweilers also turn aggressive during the mating period. They should be trained properly to obey the commands of the owner. Otherwise, they will pose a serious threat,"" he said.Livestock sellers in Rottweil village in Germany created the breed to safeguard their earnings, he said. ""Butchers and livestock sellers would keep the money, which they made after selling the livestock in markets, in a leather belt tied around the dog's neck to prevent thieves from robbing them,"" he noted."

President of the association Simranjeet Singh claimed it was the first time the day was being celebrated in the country, and around 35 progressive beekeepers under different heads -- including trading in breeding, from different parts of the state -- were honoured, along with some senior and experienced beekeepers.He said the event was important as they tried to apprise the gathered farmers to promote and educate others about beekeeping, as diversification was the demand of the time. ""We all know the condition of farmers now is very bad in the state, and beekeeping is a good alternative, as farmers can earn more in it, than from cultivating rice and wheat,"" he added. Kuldeep Singh -- a progressive beekeeper from Sangrur, who was honoured during the event -- said beekeeping had given them tremendous results in the past, making them stand apart from other farmers, who were in dire straits due to traditional farming. Further, he said farmers were not being asked to replace their crops completely, but to take up beekeeping as a side business, which would help them become financially stable.Meanwhile, minister for agriculture Tota Singh -- who was honoured as the chief guest on the occasion -- said the state government had decided not to charge Value Added Tax (VAT) on material used in bee farming. Tota Singh said a minimum sale price (MSP) had also been fixed for purchase of honey from farmers. State director of horticulture Gurkamal Singh said 15,000 metric tonnes of honey was produced in the state in a year, which is 20 per cent of the total honey produced in India, while the total export of honey from Punjab is 13,000 metric tonnes, which is 39 per cent of the total honey exports from the country."

With the monsoon entering the withdrawal stage in north west India , the situation is unlikely to improve in the next fortnight, putting these states at the risk of having the third straight deficient monsoon rainfall year.Punjab and Haryana had deficient monsoon rainfall (June-1-September 30 period) in 2014 and 2015 too. In 2014, Punjab received 243.9 mm of rainfall (50% below normal) as against the normal of 491.9mm and Haryana had an even greater deficit of 56%, with the state receiving 200.1 mm rain as against the normal of 460.3 mm.Similarly, in 2015, the monsoon rainfall recorded in Punjab was 336.3 mm, which is 32% below the normal of 491.9 mm, while Haryana got 287.7 mm (a deficit of 38%) as against the normal of 460.3 mm.As per the data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Punjab has recorded 345.8 mm of rainfall from June 1 till September 16, this year as against the normal of 456.9 mm with an overall deficit of 24% while in Haryana the total rainfall in the corresponding period has been 330.1 mm (24% deficiency) as against the normal of 436.3 mm.This season, many key paddy growing districts of both states have recorded deficient or scanty rainfall, adding to the burden of farmers who have to rely more on fast depleting groundwater to maintain their crops. In Haryana, 12 out of 21 districts have recorded deficient or scanty (more than 60% below normal) rainfall till Friday. On the other hand, 10 districts of 20 in Punjab have received deficient or scanty rainfall.Weak monsoons in the last two years had resulted in putting more strain on the groundwater in both Punjab and Haryana, which are known as grain bowl states of India. With less availability of canal water, farmers in both states rely on tubewells to irrigate their crops, hoping for the normal rainfall to eventually recharge the groundwater. To make the matters worse, area under paddy, including basmati, has gone up in Punjab this year as farmers in the state's cotton belt, which is primarily irrigated by canals, switched to water-guzzling rice cultivation due to fear of whitefly attack. Estimated area under paddy in Punjab this year is 30.14 lakh hectares up from 29.75 lakh hectares in 2015. Cotton acreage dropped to a 61-year low of 2.56 lakh hectares from 4.5 lakh hectares last year."

Under the project, farmers whose agricultural fields are damaged by wild animals will be compensated by way of grains instead of cash. On Wednesday, 16 farmers from both the villages at the confluence New Nagzira and Nagzira wildlife sanctuaries were distributed 223 kilograms of rice.Gondia and Bhandara districts are rice bowl of Vidarbha and hence forests here are surrounded by paddy fields. In the proposed buffer zone of NNTR there are around 150 villages suffering from crop damage by Nilgai, chitals and wild boars. Last year, Gondia division paid Rs 28 lakh as compensation for crop damage while Bhandara division paid Rs 67.25 lakh.WTI has created a corpus fund and the interest generated from the fund will be used for this scheme. ""To start with, our scheme is to reduce man-animal conflict in the buffer and hence 'grain to grain'. There is resentment among villagers against wildlife, who even electrocute herbivores to save their crops. This has led to depletion of prey base,"" says Prafulla Bhamburkar, central India incharge of WTI, a NGO working for wildlife conservation in the region.Farmers have hailed WTI initiative. ""We brothers own seven acre land in Sondlagondi. Despite crop damage we are not able to claim compensation owing to loopholes in GR. As NOC of all farmland owners in a family is needed, it is difficult to get compensation. This initiative will benefit us,"" says farmer Yadavrao Bhore, 42.Many others agree. They say due to this NOC rule, they are unable to claim crop damage compensation from the forest department. Out of 120 families of both the villages, only three applied for compensation this year.Seventy-year-old farmer Devaji Pisde said that government had made online filing of claims mandatory but failed to provide a base. ""We are not computer literate to file online claims. Moreover, we have to travel 14 kms to the nearest internet cafe. This is another reason why less claims are filed,"" he added.Another affected farmer Fulanbai Jindakure said her farmland had a potential to produce 50 bags of paddy but could only get 30 due to damage by wild animals. ""Being on the fringe of Nagzira, every farmer suffers over 40-50% crop damage,"" she added. She was one of the few to get compensation from the forest department.Anil Kumar, project lead (WTI), said a committee had been set-up to monitor and evaluate the cases. ""It consists of WTI personnel, forester, police patil and sarpanch. It will assess the claims for grain to grain for one cropping season,"" he added."

More importantly, BGA opposed grant of GI tag basmati to India ""in totality."" It argued that the assistant registrar of GI in Chennai had ""gravely erred that rice produced in the region of Madhya Pradesh, or for that matter any part of India can bear the basmati tag."" On Friday, however, IPAB rejected the arguments saying BGA had ""miserably failed"" to comply with rules.After APEDA's application was advertised in the GI journal in May 2010, BGA served it a notice. Even though it received a counter-affidavit to its notice and in spite of two extensions, BGA failed to provide evidence supporting its opposition - within the prescribed time and format - under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. So the registry rejected the opposition as 'abandoned' on December 31, 2013, IPR attorney P San jai Gandhi said.BGA's counsel said his client moved IPAB, challenging the registry's order. He said the association filed its evidence ""diligently"" and it was APEDA that countered with missing documents.

Thanks to two weeks of physiotherapy , she now even struts about a bit.Dr Rina Dev , who has been treating the bird at a foster home in the city, says it's rare for a bird to be given physiotherapy. ""It's a miracle she's survived. Usually, paralyzed birds don't make it. Most have to be put down,"" she said.As the veterinarian administers physiotherapy, the bird lies sprawled on the floor, her claws twitching as a medical contraption with two wires is strapped to her. ""The physiotherapy is being given in two forms - cold laser and tens,"" says Dr Dev . Cold laser involves passing infra-red light to damaged nerves. It helps regenerate the nerves. Tens is a form of therapy that stimulates the muscles electrically to help reduce inflammation.When she's not resting in her makeshift sling, the bird tries to take small steps and balance herself. The bird is fed tiny dollops of rice laced with succulent insects and tablets.When the peahen was found and handed over to the forest authorities, she could barely sit, says Pawan Sharma of Resquink Association for Wildlife Welfare. ""It was in critical condition. One of our activists, Priya Nagwekar , fostered it for two weeks when it's state was very delicate.

For someone who played most of his cricket for either club or company in Mumbai, playing in the IPL is no less a dream he has been living since he made debut for Rajasthan Royals at 41back in 2013.Playing his fourth edition of IPL, not much has changed. He seems to continue to reverse the cycle of aging with ease. The leg spinner spoke exclusively to TOI.

Village sarpanch, who has been given a deadline to go ODF by August 15 by the collector, has barred them from availing benefit under the PDS system.Hailing from village Mansekri, at least 15 families had to go to neighbouring town and buy rice and other provisions at market price.Expressing shock, 60-year-old father of a mason Itwariram Patel said the fair price shop has a list of 15 families hanging at the doorstep who should not be given their monthly quota of foodgrain and other items.""Are they blacklisting us from our right to food? For poor people food is more important than having toilets. Shopkeeper told me sarpanch ordered him not to give grocery to us. Sarpanch can't force us to build toilets,"" Patel said. Another mason Durgesh Kumar said they were being forced to construct toilets, ""not that we won't get paid, but depending purely upon this job we expect payment on time, which is not the case. There have been instances when we have got payments after a year. What would we eat if we don't get paid on time?"" Durgesh said they were not against building toilets but this attitude of denying food to us might infuriate everyone even more to be in denial mode. The incident came to the fore after villagers were denied grocery consecutively for two months.""I am not asking them to construct toilets for free, they clearly told me they don't have time for this job. I called a meeting after I was given a deadline to get my village ODF by August 15 and instructed the masons and labourers to contribute in achieving the deadline. While all other villages in the neighbourhood are busy constructing toilets, it's tough to get manpower, hence, I expect cooperation from them. I have taken this decision myself, ""kaam karo fir rashan milega""( work and get provisions from fair price shops),"" said sarpanch Ahilya Korram.When contacted, Kanker collector Shammim Abidi told TOI, ""I haven't issued any such order to deny ration or any sort of payments to the villagers. Nothing can be imposed upon them. This was purely sarpanch's call which is wrong and the food officer has been instructed to intervene in the matter and take appropriate action.""A similar incident was raised in the state assembly on Friday by opposition when Bhupesh Baghel, state Congress chief said that a letter was written by secretary and sarpanch to a society located in Patan Vidhan Sabha region that their ration from PDS would be withheld if they don't construct toilets."

In fact, till a few years ago Telangana was the leader in south India in rice production but the situation has now been reversed, if not turned grim.Agriculture started getting affected from the Kharif season in 2014, which saw deficit rainfall and a steadily plummeting ground water table. Added to this was the dismal power supply situation in rural Telangana. With these factors getting worse over time, farmers recorded huge losses in the Kharif and Rabi seasons in 2014-15 and 2015-16.""Even the total cultivated zone has come down drastically. Due to the dwindling ground water table, farmers now require even more electricity to lift water from borewells, but that is not readily available,"" pointed out a senior official.A look at the total food output underlines the gravity of the situation. Whereas the Kharif season of 2013-14 saw the production of 65.28 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, it fell to 44.72 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This is a steep fall of 31.5 per cent. The decrease was attributed to lesser area under cultivation and an overall decrease in yield of paddy, maize, red gram and green gram crops.The case was similar with the Rabi season. While in 2013-14, the season saw 41.58 lakh tonnes of foodgrains being produced, it fell to 27.46 lakh tonnes the next year, a fall of 33.96 per cent.The worst hit of them all was paddy cultivation, which had earlier thrived due to the introduction of free power to the farm sector. Overall paddy cultivation fell from 65.81 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 45.45 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. An expected further fall in production has stoked fears of steep rise of rice prices in 2016-17. Crops such as maize, jowar, wheat, bajra and ragi too have reported a decline.Troubled farmer associations are now pleading the government to save distressed farmers. ""The state government did not announce drought in 2014-15 though the situation was bad, with nine out of the 10 districts of Telangana reporting more than 20 per cent deficit rainfall and drastic drop in the groundwater table. This year, the government has announced drought, but it is too late,"" said Kirankumar of Rythu Swarajya Vedika. The NGO has done extensive studies on the impact of drought on tenant farmers in Telangana and the reasons behind farmer suicides."

This has also been acknowledged in the recent Economic Survey - 2016 conducted by the Union finance ministry, making the district a model for the other states.Various initiatives like ePOS, integration of bank accounts opened under Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar details and mobile numbers (JAM) of individual beneficiaries for effective implementation of the welfare schemes till the last mile etc., have resulted in the success of Team Krishna led by collector Babu A, officials said.With these initiatives, Andhra Pradesh, as a whole, could achieve a maximum distribution of rice to the beneficiaries. Out of 30,31,942 tonnes of rice distribution target every month, the state is being able to distribute 29,600,400 tonnes to the beneficiaries. This brings down leakages to 2 per cent as against the national average of 15.The idea behind the initiatives is not just to ensure that the beneficiaries receive what they are entitled to but also to prevent ineligible people from getting the benefits.The ePOS system implemented by Team Krishna to strengthen the public distribution system has drawn attention from other states including Gujarat, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Uttaranchal. Babu A recently organised a training camp for the officials of aforementioned states and explained the advantages of ePOS to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian."

""Food products like wheat and rice are already being fortified in 10 states. We need to broaden it to all states,'' the source said.States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka are already using some of the fortified products. Sources said that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been asked to revise norms for these products which will be fortified with iron, vitamin A and D. The target is to ensure complete coverage in the next two years.There are 84 countries in the world that are already using fortified products to counter the problem of under-nutrition.According to health experts, more than 50% of child mortality under five years of age can be attributed to malnutrition."

Some aid agencies say the true number may be up to 1.9 million.There were hopes that the current cessation of hostilities, which came into force on 27 February, would be a turning point, enabling aid organisations to access besieged areas. A handful of aid convoys have since reached 150,000 people, but charities and residents say deliveries have been patchy.""Aid has reached some areas, but deliveries are piecemeal and inconsistent,"" Save the Children's CEO, Tanya Steele, said. ""To have children going hungry and sick just a short drive from warehouses of food is appalling and it's time we ended this shameful situation.""A baby sleeps near the railway tracks at the makeshift camp of the Greek-Macedonian border, near the village of Idomeni. (AFP photo)Access is granted to each convoy individually, and they are only able to take enough supplies to last a few weeks, with no guarantee of when the next delivery will be made.In a report released on Wednesday, a third of 126 residents interviewed by Save the Children say they often go without a single meal a day, and a quarter have seen children in their towns dying because of lack of food. The report paints a stark picture of the cruelties of living under siege - in Moadamiyeh, just a few miles from the capital Damascus, three newborn babies died after medical staff ran out of IV bags.""A relative's infant son died from malnutrition because of the lack of formula and food for children,"" Um Tarek, a mother in the village of Misraba, in the suburbs of Damascus, told Save the Children. ""His mother wasn't able to breastfeed him because she was in such poor health.""Abdul Wahab Ahmed, a civil society activist in Madaya, which has been under government siege since July, told The Independent that more than 300 children in the town were currently suffering symptoms of severe malnutrition. Images on Twitter showed children and infants with distended stomachs.An eight-year-old boy died from lack of food on 27 February - the day the truce officially took hold - Mr Ahmed added. He said the two aid deliveries that had been made had been vital, but insufficient. Before the latest delivery, a kilogram of rice in the city was selling for $230 (160). Aid agencies say that unless there is a more permanent end to the violence in Syria - soon to enter its sixth year - there is little hope of seeing an end to the use of siege as a tactic by both sides.Official peace talks were scheduled to begin on Wednesday, but the High Negotiations Committee, the umbrella body of the mainstream Syrian opposition, has still not confirmed whether it would attend. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura was adamant that initial talks would take place, saying he would be holding ""substantive"" talks between government and the opposition by next Monday.The pause in fighting has given many Syrians a brief respite from the relentless violence, but the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that fighting had killed over 40 civilians in the past two days, more than in the previous eight days of the truce combined. Meanwhile three rockets fired from Syria landed on the Turkish border city of Kilis, killing a four-year-old boy and one other person. Turkey responded by firing at Isis targets in Syria.Initial peace talks planned by Mr de Mistura collapsed in early February, after the start of a Russian-backed government offensive on Aleppo. There are now fears the city may soon face siege tactics like those seen across the rest of Syria. ""We are extremely concerned about the situation in Aleppo,"" said Ashley Proud, of Mercy Corps.

This year, Maha Shivaratri has special significance as it falls on a Monday and is celebrated during the ongoing 'Sinhastha Kumbh' period in Nashik.Dr Satyapriya Shukla, priest at the temple, said, ""The Maha Shivaratri coming on Monday is a rare coincidence. Earlier, the same had happened in 2012. However, the coincidence will be repeated next after 12 years in 2028. Devotees are finding it a rare moment and would arrive to seek blessings of Lord Shiva.""On Maha Shivaratri, Lord Shiva is worshipped as the deity of dissolution. Only cold water and leaves of Bael are offered to Lord Shiva. Other traditional offerings, such as bathing it in milk and Panchamruta (a mixture of milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey) or anointing it with white consecrated rice (Akshata) are not made on this day.The Maha Shivaratri will start at 1.20pm on Monday and will continue till 10.33am on Tuesday. Trustees of Trimbakeshwar temple said more than 5 lakh devotees are expected to visit the temple in the 48 hours of Maha Shivaratri.""Maha Shivaratri is the biggest festival of Trimbakeshwar temple. We receive about 3 lakh devotees every year on this day. This being, we are expecting more devotees,"" said Kailas Ghule, senior trustee of Trimbakeshwar temple trust.Trimbakeshwar is also popular for the 'Kalsarpa' Pooja and Maha Shivaratri is considered as the auspicious occasion for this ritual. Local priests said more than 3,000 families have registered for the 'Kalsarpa Pooja' on Monday.Mythologically, the Shivaratri (night of Shiva) is considered as the night of celebration of marriage of Shiva and Parvati. According to astrology, there is no need to search for Muhurat for tying nuptial knot on this night. ""More than 200 couples will get married on the occasion of Shivaratri in Trimbakeshwar alone,"" said Rajendra Dixit, priest from Trimbakeshwar.Nashik also has some prominent Shiva temples, which will have fair-like atmosphere. The area around Kapaleshwar temple on Godavari ghat, Somewar on Gangapur Road and Naroshankar temple in Panchawati has transformed for the festival.Thousands of devotees would start visiting the temples from early Monday morning.Thousands to take holy dipThe three shahi snans of the Kumbh Mela are over but the Sinhastha parva offers many occasions for the devotees to take the holy dip. Maha Shivaratri is considered one of the most auspicious occasions to take the holy dip in Kushavarta and Ram Kund. ""The Sinhastha Parva will continue till August 2016. This period will have around 40 auspicious occasions, which will see the gathering of devotees at Ram Kund and Kushavarta. These are called 'Parva Snan' and not Shahi snan as sadhus wouldn't be a part of these baths. But the importance of these dates is no less than the Shahi Parvanis. Taking a holy dip on Maha Shivaratri is considered as the most blissful in Sinhastha Parva,"" said Madhukar Dixit, senior astrologer in Nashik.250 special MSRTC buses arrangedThe Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation has arranged 250 special buses to tackle the rush of devotees visiting Trimbakeshwar on Monday. About 100 additional buses will start from Mela Bus Station for Trimbakeshwar. MSRTC controller Yamini Joshi said the planning has been done in such a way that a bus will leave Nashik for Trimbakeshwar every five minutes on Monday. Also, 5 buses will leave from Nimani bus stand, while 30 more buses are kept as reserved to handle the rush.The MSRTC has also focussed on the other pilgrim spots like Taked, Siddheshwar, Paregaon and Dogheshwar. ""About 104 special buses have been arranged from Igatpuri, Bhagur, Nashik Road and Bhandardara for the pilgrimage spots other than Trimbakeshwar. Our aim is to insure a seat for every devotee,"" Joshi added."

He said two persons - Govindasami and another G Sakthivel - of the village had demolished the public utility building and encroached it by erecting a compound wall. Encroachers had also registered the land in their names at the Alandur sub-registrar's office, he said.Despite several representations and complaint to the district collector in August 2014, no action had been taken, he said.He asked the court for directions to the Kancheepuram district collector, Alandur tahsildar and Nandambakkam inspector of police to take action and save the government land.Narayanan said a new public building should be built there for adi dravidar community.When the matter was taken up on Thursday, government pleader S T S Moorthi said the library building was in a dilapidated condition and not in use, and added the land still vested with Nandambakkam town panchayat."

Traditionally served in a(a half coconut shell) or a(small saucers),is the stuff that foodie dreams are probably made of.A typical Goan tradition associated with festivities and food is that of the von-xitt, known mostly as the 'bhikareanchem jevonn' or meal for the poor. ""This meal is usually served before a festive occasion like a wedding, or to commemorate a death anniversary as is said to be served to appease the souls of the dead,"" says cookbook author and restaurateur Ivo Coutinho. Von is the much looked-forward-to sweet culmination to this hearty meal with many opting for a second and even a third helping. ""Such is its popularity that once the meal was done, the von that remained would be taken in a pot and distributed to the villagers,"" he recalls.For those uninitiated in traditional Goan cuisine, von is a sweet dish that is dark brown in colour and has the consistency of a semi-thick custard. ""It is made using simple and readily available ingredients  coconut milk, raw rice and jaggery. A hint of texture comes from boiled halves of channa dal that are added to the dish. The entire mixture is cooked over a slow fire in large, wide open copper vessels and stirred using a long, wooden ladle. The traditional cooking method, over a wood fire, helps impart a subtle smoky flavour to the sweet dish,"" says chef Moses Fernandes.The proportions of the ingredients may vary from village to village, home to home. The approximate proportion for one coconut is two or three pyramids of jaggery and less than 100g of rice. While some prefer using dal sparingly, as just a garnish, some like to be more generous.""Coconut milk forms the base of von. This milk is extracted in two parts. The first, thick extract is kept aside and added at a later stage. The process of cooking the von starts with the second thin extract. Another essential component is the locally- made brown coconut jaggery. This helps imparts both, colour and sweetness to the dish,"" says chef Peter Fernandes.The rice used in this dish has to essentially be powdered raw rice. Why only raw rice? ""The rice is essentially a thickening agent. Par-boiled rice won't do the needful,"" says Moses.Though not tough to prepare, the cooking process is lengthy and involves quite a bit of muscle work with the continuous stirring this dish demands.Also, one needs to constantly watch over the boiling mixture because if it is taken too far, it will turn into another famed Goan delicacy, the dodol."

Besides his love for dogs, he had been rearing the ferocious animals to keep intruders away from the grove.Around 10.20pm, people in the nearby farms heard Kirubakaran screaming in agony and rushed to the mango grove, which was fenced, but were scared to step inside fearing for their safety. They alerted the family members of Kirubakaran.""My mother immediately rushed to the grove. On seeing her, the two dogs went into their cage. My father was found with multiple bite marks all over his body,"" said Kirubakaran's son Balaji.""We don't know what exactly happened after he let the two out of the cages. But everything was over within 20 minutes after he stepped into the farm,"" he said. ""We fed the dogs once a day and usually provided it with chicken.

Before the next general election in 2019, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is aiming for an even higher figure to juxtapose against the quantum of money allegedly involved in scams under the previous United Progressive Alliance government.This will involve eliminating bogus beneficiaries of welfare payments through the use of the Aadhaar ID system , it was decided at a review meeting chaired by the Prime Minister on May 9, senior PMO officials told ET. Aadhaar will be used to ensure that benefits go to the right people under the Public Distribution System (PDS) along the lines of the success in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Full Aadhaar coverage will do the same for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( MGNREGS ).All 21 crore Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts will be seeded with the Aadhaar number to make them ""transaction active."" Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) cells will be set up in all central ministries and states to bring all cash or in-kind subsidy schemes under this system.""PMO is monitoring progress of these issues on top priority every fortnight,"" an official said. The bulk of the savings so far Rs 21,672 crore in 2014 and 2015have accrued from weeding out 3.5 crore duplicate beneficiaries under the LPG Pahal scheme, the official said.""The PDS and MGNREGS have lots of scope for more savings when they are entirely covered by Aadhaarbased payment system. Right now, savings under PDS and MGNREGS are only Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 3,000 cr, respectively, as the Aadhaar-based PDS is being implemented comprehensively in only two big states Andhra and Telanaganawhile MGNREGS cards have only 60% Aadhaar seeding. It is possible to hit the Rs 1 lakh crore figure with these two expansions,"" the official said. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have rolled out Aadhaar-based PDS across all districts.""The PDS savings here have been an eye-opener for policy makers at the Centre. For example, Andhra Pradesh has removed 8.58 lakh bogus ration cards and 69.18 lakh beneficiaries through Aadhaar-based PDS across all 28,600 fair price shops, saving 403,142 MTs of rice and 5,000 litres of kerosene per annum,"" a top official said.Apart from this, 6.54 lakh bogus pension beneficiaries have been removed, leading to annual savings of Rs 541 crore, while Telangana has eliminated 75.14 lakh ghost PDS beneficiaries, On May 23, the rural development ministry wrote to all states asking them to ensure 100% Aadhaar seeding in all 11 crore MGNREGS accounts through special camps by August and to keep the Centre informed of progress. On May 12, the cabinet secretariat wrote to states and ministries asking for internal DBT Cells to be set up by ministries and states to coordinate implementation of the system in various central schemes.""DBT programme has now gathered momentum and its scope extended to schemes where cash benefits are provided to individuals, in-kind transfers as well as transfers made to various enablers of government schemes,"" said the letter accessed by ET.The government is also pushing public sector and private sector banks to seed the PMJDY accounts with Aadhaar so that they are enabled to receive DBT benefits. Though Aadhaar was the primary know your-customer ( KYC ) document for opening a PMJDY account, only 9.32 crore of the 21 crore accounts opened so far under are linked to Aadhaar.""Though the same is voluntary, people will be encouraged to seed their bank accounts with Aadhaar given the benefits of the exercise,"" said an official, adding that 97% of the adult population has been enrolled."

The couple had promised the women good returns if they invested in a proposed rice mill project in Biramitrapur.The women had reportedly lodged a complaint with Biramitrapur police station about one-and-half month ago, but in vain. The accused, Marsalan Surin and his wife Israni Surin, are on the run. According to their complaint, the couple had convinced the tribal women to invest as shareholders in a large rice mill that they were going to set up in the locality.Gullible women from Brahamanimara, Laokathi, Gandhi Road and Kaidaiba of Biramitrapur, all members of Jyoti, a SHG, fell into their trap.The couple helped the tribal women in getting their loan sanctioned from banks and financial institutions. Initially, the accused paid them interest, following which more women invested in the rice mill.The accused had shown them a vacant plot of land as the site for the mill.The women started doubting the intentions of the couple when no construction came up on the land.

They expressed their displeasure over the BJP's failure to keep its electoral promise of implementing agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan's recommendation for fixing the price of paddy.The committee on Wednesday increased the support price of common variety paddy by Rs 60 per quintal thus providing Rs 1,470 per quintal and Rs 1,510 for fine grade variety paddy for 2016-17.The farmers termed it the inability of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government to implement one of its main promises in the electoral manifesto in the general election in 2014.""We expected the central government to keep its promise by implementing the M S Swaminathan recommendations by fixing the MSP at Rs 2,500 per quintal. The latest announcement will further aggravate the agony of the farmers and it will not stop the farmers from committing suicide,"" said general secretary of the federation of farmers association, Cauvery delta districts Arupathy P Kalyanam.According to Kalyanam, paddy is cultivated in 44 million hectares across the country. The government has set a target of producing 108 million tonnes rice for 2016-17, for which the farmers should produce 168 million tonnes of paddy. ""If the central government is unable to fix the price at 50% above the production cost, fearing likely escalation of essential commodities in the open market, the state government should take the burden by announcing an incentive of Rs 500 per quintal. Otherwise, the central government should give Rs 20,000 as incentive per acre,"" said Kalyanam.As of now, the state government is providing Rs 1,520, including its incentive, per quintal as MSP.""Rs 2,500 per quintal of paddy is essential given the escalation in production cost. Free rice provided to people through PDS outlets is preventing the state government from increasing the incentive. So the new state government should consider fixing Rs 2 as the price for one kg of rice that will not burden the people,"" said district secretary of the Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers' protection association Swamimalai Vimalanathan.The farmers said the BJP government was no way different from UPA regime in treating farmers. ""The present stand of the BJP on farmers' welfare is the same as that of the UPA government. We are wondering what Modi will do to double the income of the farmers by 2022 as he is promising,"" said state spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran in Trichy."
58f20251a3d24b245e59e0ec,"To maintain supply of sex slaves, ISIS pushes birth control",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/To-maintain-supply-of-sex-slaves-ISIS-pushes-birth-control/articleshow/51378134.cms,2016-03-13,"DOHUK, Iraq: Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown to her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent her days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter's breath, the disgusting sounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she was tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist's child.It was the one thing she needn't have worried about.Soon after buying her, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips of pills, one of them colored red.""Every day, I had to swallow one in front of him. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was sold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,"" explained the girl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It is a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an obscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure that the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with her.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was practiced during the Prophet Muhammad's time integral to the group's operations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi religious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the fighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can continue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than three dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed to be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters used to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and sometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion in order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do so.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were driven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone, whose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with apprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser's child; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping them.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing being assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant of it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some of the women's captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees observed: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who have sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern Iraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to Dr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a stunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman is between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times the rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads the Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where the victims are being treated.""We were expecting something much higher,"" he said.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first initial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy ponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to inquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not pregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was not enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the date of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a delay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to start bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room, closed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she was about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on her upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.""To make sure you don't get pregnant,"" she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her back onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and girls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the jihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In the months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a community now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from their former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were initially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent. All the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside members of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has stated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just about any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a pamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant slave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic State cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can have sex with her only after she has undergone istibra'  ""the process of ensuring that the womb is empty,"" according to the Princeton University professor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on the topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a child's paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued that the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence whenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one menstrual cycle, according to Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual, the Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also quotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that it was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for other means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A total of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed over three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters insisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others violated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed closely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was that women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given contraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were less versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the Islamic State's governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. ""Each month, he made me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,"" said J., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.""On top of that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, 'We don't want you to get pregnant,'"" she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the Syrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man's mother who escorted her to the hospital.""She told me, 'If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,'"" J. said. ""They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like centrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About 30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn't pregnant.""The fighter's mother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant, validating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter tired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not take her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without ascertaining whether she was carrying another man's child. Several other women reported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control by some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say medical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy were more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk's Ministry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing the treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low pregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war, it has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies  either because the attackers did not use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because they purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68 Croatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more than 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib's center has treated only 35 pregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. ""Even higher than that, if you consider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over many months,"" Dr. Taib said.""I concluded that either they did an abortion before they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions, then there would have been physical signs,"" which would have been noted by the gynecologist treating the returnees, he said. ""There were no signs.""The prohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes that the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims, who dreaded carrying their rapists' children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who was kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she had been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used her as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young Yazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150 milligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she escorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and later in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own teenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the conflicted feelings she had at the time. ""ISIS took our girls as slaves, only for sex,"" Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief. ""No one wants to carry the child of their enemy.""Others described how the fighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to abort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time of her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his slave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause her to miscarry.""She hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren't looking, she spit them out,"" said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of his sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries she suffered. ""They wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the woman.""A 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel nauseated soon after her abduction. ""The smell of rice made me gag,"" she said.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one of the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to location and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by then befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being repeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she, too, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another couple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he knew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with her, and when he did he appeared drugged.""I was telling him: 'I'm pregnant. In your book it says that you can't do this.' He had bloodshot eyes. He acted like he was high,"" she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim of making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the surgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior suggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to abort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove her home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property's wall.

They had to open the buildings before the EC rings the bell for the next Assembly elections.Finance minister O Paneerselvam inaugurated and laid foundation stone of many projects during a function held in his home town of Theni district. It included the foundation stone for the underground drainage that will be constructed at a cost of Rs 19.66 lakh in Palanichettipatti town panchayat. He inaugurated many projects to the tune of Rs 115.50 lakh in different parts of the district. The projects include buildings in 16 places, park established at a cost of Rs 11 lakh in Ammakulam, an integrated noon meal scheme building constructed at a cost of Rs 13 lakh at T V K K Nagar, tower lights that cost Rs 4.50 lakh each.Paneerselvam also distributed marriage assistance to the tune of Rs 3.33 crore to 650 beneficiaries, including 421 undergraduates and post graduates. They received Rs 50,000 each, while those who completed tenth and plus two were given Rs 25,000 each. Speaking at the function, the minister said that the chief minister J Jayalalalithaa had planned the special schemes with an aim to help the beneficiaries for the next 50 years and to remove economical differences among the people in the society. The step is taken to ensure that every citizen has access to basic needs such as food, shelter and dress. People living below the poverty line were also provided with 20kg of rice free of cost.The schemes announced by the chief minister was 100% fulfilled in Tamil Nadu during the last 57 months, he added.Sources said that the inauguration of such buildings were expedited as they will remain unopened if the election commission of India announces the dates for the elections and the code of conduct comes into effect."

It doesn't take long for these workers to realise that freedom comes at a cost.Without documents, land or entitlements, labourers freed of bondage find that little has changed for them after being rescued. A study by the department of social work in Loyola College and International Justice Mission , has thrown light on their lives through a set of numbers: Around 50% of them had debts, 85% of them did not have access to a toilet, 75% didn't have water tap and 70% continued to toil on daily wages that were little more than what they received when they were in bondage.The survey covered 208 workers in four districts - Tiruvannamalai, Tiruvallur, Vellore and Kancheepuram - most of who had worked in bondage for up to 10 years. From 1997 to 2007, the state government has rescued 13,500 bonded labourers, mostly from rice mills, brick kilns, agriculture and tree-cutting units. The actual number, experts estimate could be well over 10 lakh.Gladston Xavier, head of the department of social work, Loyola college , said while the rescue of labourers receives attention, their rehabilitation continues to be poor. ""Our study focused on two areas - relief gap and rehabilitation and trust in the public justice system. It wasn't a pretty picture. While their condition is definitely better in terms of freedom of mobility, it just isn't enough to survive,"" he said.The first big hurdle labourers face is receiving the 20,000 the state provides to start their lives afresh. ""The amount rarely reaches them. They have no papers, no land, no identities. They find themselves ineligible for even the entitlements like the free mixers and fans given by the state government,"" said Gladston, saying while the laws related to bonded labour are stringent, implementation continued to be a problem."

The advisory is aimed at curbing vigilantism by NGOs who work in the school education field. Nilesh Waghmare, district's in-charge of MDM, said, ""Giving access to MDM area to private persons not associated with the school is putting lives of thousands of kids at risk.""The advisory will mention that only MDM officials, among people from outside the school campus, will be allowed to inspect kitchen and cooked food. Waghmare said, ""Every school must note this that we have had reports of people posing as inspection authorities and unnecessarily harassing teachers. So if anybody comes and claims they have come to check quality of MDM, immediately officials from education department must be called.""He reiterated that entry to school premises must be controlled and monitored at all times. ""What if the person entering the premises adds something to the food? Who will be responsible? We take these things very seriously and want schools to get their act together and take no chance when it comes to ensuring safety of MDM served on their campus,"" said Waghmare.On Thursday, Waghmare surveyed some schools to check whether norms were being complied with. ""Even when I come to a school I first report to the principal's office and only then proceed to kitchen area. There is a protocol that has to be followed and it is for schools to enforce it,"" said Waghmare.MDM officials have also started cracking down on schools suspected of pilfering rice intended for MDM use. On Wednesday, a First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against a city school for unaccounted rice sacks. Waghmare said, ""FIR has been registered at Jaripakta police station against Nagsen Education Society as they could not account for over 70 quintals of rice. The police will conduct further investigation but there are other schools already on our radar and we will act as and when we get proof.""MDM monitoring system has improved quite a bit with part of the data now being fed online by schools due to which officials can view entire district's statistics on a day-to-day basis. While that does not rule out pilferage, many feel it is a welcome step as at least decisions can be made faster compared to the earlier system of month-to-month reporting."

This year, even the North Indian community in Kerala has decided to steer clear of bursting crackers, plastic decorations and over-consumption of power, going in for a green Diwali ! Check out how.Mumbaikar Rekha Mahindra and her friends in Wayanad have taken a unanimous decision to avoid non-biodegradable accessories and use only recycled products to spice up their Diwali celebrations this year.""In the past, the rangoli was made with rice and pulses and was used to feed birds. So this year, we have bucked the trend of using artificial colours and returned to the old ways. It is also a good way of sharing food with small birds and ants during the festival,"" says Rekha, adding that she will be using natural flowers from her garden to give her rangoli a finishing touch.To decorate the house, they are using recycled materials instead of plastic accessories. ""Instead of candles and electric lights, we made diyas out of orange peels, coconut shells and wheat dough. And we are gifting indoor plants and kitchen herbs with cards made of recycled paper tied to them,"" Rekha explains.The group are also giving plastic gift wrappers and disposable plates a miss. ""The festival meal will be served in plantain leaves and the drinks in steel tumblers,"" she says.As the festival of lights usually sees a spike in electricity consumption, many in the State will be using natural diyas instead of electric lights. And those who have busy schedules are going for LED lights, which consume less power.Gujarati Rajani Sheth, who is settled in Kochi, says, ""I cannot imagine a Diwali without lights. For safety and ease, I was using electric lights all these years. But this year I will turn off the lights and light up diyas that are bio-degradable. Diwalis from now will also serve as 'save your electricity day' for my family.""Those who took pride in bursting the maximum number of vibrant crackers seem to have finally realised that all that expenditure is unnecessary. Bollywood actor Karan Khandelwal, who was born and brought up in Kozhikode, confesses that he and his friends have often wasted a lot of money over crackers.""This year we plan to donate all the money that we usually spend on crackers to orphanages and old-age homes. We were burning our hard-earned cash in the name of the festival, to satisfy our pride. Why not use it for charity and light up the lives of the marginalised?"" asks Karan.Many in the state have taken patriotism to another level by shunning Chinese products. ""In the previous years, I used to buy Chinese crackers that are more colourful but this year I am going solely for 'Made in India' products. I am a patriotic person and won't encourage the use of crackers from China whose policies are anti-Indian,"" says Kochi-based IT employee Karthik S, a Delhi native.Homemaker Sanjana Bhoi from Chhattisgarh, residing in Kochi, says that Diwali is the festival of lights and not of noise and pollution.Supporting her view, Bunty Singh, a Punjabi entrepreneur in Kochi, says, ""Bursting crackers is part of our tradition and we cannot skip it. However we are going for a noiseless one considering the animals in the neighbourhood. We will be using crackers like ground spinners and fountains that do not produce any sound,"" he says.Animal lover Monica Kothari says, ""Animals are sensitive and can hear noises four to seven times louder than humans. The noise of crackers is traumatic for dogs, cats and even birds. We are all for a cracker-free Diwali.""Many families of the Marwadi community in Kerala have decided to quit crackers to stay away from pollution. ""The pollution levels increase during Diwali celebrations with levels of harmful gases such as SO2 shooting up. This leads to a lot of respiratory ailments such as asthma. So, this year we have all decided to avoid crackers of all kinds,"" says Anju Rajesh Kajeriwal.A lot of people give their healthy diet a miss during Diwali. However, a few have decided to say no to the sugar loaded sweet boxes. ""Instead of milk cakes, peda and barfi, we are preparing sweets at home using millets, brown rice, rice flakes and dry fruits. Some of the sweets we make are healthier alternatives like fruit sandesh and carrot-beetroot halwa. Going a step ahead, we are replacing sugar with jaggery,"" says Priyanka Rajani, a Gujarati settled in Kannur."

Thirteen others, not from either of these two mafias, have been detained since January this year under the Act.Shukla said Sable will spend a year in the Amravati Central Jail. The amendment to the 1981 Act gives powers to the police commissioner concerned to detain sand and foodgrain mafia members and detain them in jail for a year without bail.Shukla described Sable as a ""habitual offender"" and said he has four cases registered against him, including two under the Essential Commodities Act, a case of assault and one under the Arms Act. ""Sable and his accomplices used to threaten ration shop owners in various parts of the city and purchase foodgrains meant for public distribution at throwaway prices. He would then sell the foodgrains at a higher price in the local market,"" she said.Sable was booked by the Nigdi police in 2013 and food grains worth Rs 15 lakh, including rice and wheat, were seized from him. The next year, he had severely injured a social worker who had tried to alert the food and civil supplies distribution office in Kondhwa about his activities.In June this year, the Khadak police had arrested him and seized food grains worth Rs 2 lakh which he had planned to sell in the local market."

With Chhath festival around the corner, prices of veggies and fruits have increased and are only likely to soar further from Wednesday.On Tuesday, the price of bottle gourd (kaddu or gheeya) ranged between Rs 20-Rs 40 at the local markets. Anita Devi, a vendor at Peace Road , said she and her friends are planning to sell them at a higher price since it is one of the vegetables eaten on 'Nahay-Khay'.Sunita Pradhan, a resident of Hinoo and who is performing the puja for over five years, said on the second day, Lohanda and Kharna, which is about a day-long fast ending with eating chapatti (roti) or pancake (puri) with rice dessert (kheer), has also become an expensive affair.

Most of these items, apart from fruits, are essential for 'aragya soop', which is offered to the sun god during the festival.Nannu Devi, another vendor near Raj Bhavan said rpices of vegetables will increase by at least Rs 10 or Rs 20 ahead of Chhath puja.Even fruits such as small sized local apples are available for Rs 50-Rs 80. However, sugarcane which is a necessary fruit offered during Arghya, was not visible in the market. Shanti, a vendor at Birsa Chowk , said sugarcane will be sold from Wednesday onwards. Mohammed, a vegetable seller at Doranda market, said with the onset of winter, prices of vegetables is usually high but post-Chhath, the prices are likely to slide as per the demand customers."

There's also an ethereal 1969 Ganesh Pyne canvas work from a Swiss collection, a 1979 untitled Jagdish Swaminathan, a 1964 Hajera by MF Husain, and a 2008 Rice Fields Palni Holls - II by Jehangir Sabavala.Other South Asian artists in the exhibition include Ali Imam Raza, one of the founders of modernism in Pakistan, and George Keyt, a leading figure in Sri Lankan modernism and a founder of the Colombo '43 Group.Following the major retrospective of the Gaitonde's work in 2015 at Guggenheim, New York and Venice, the painter will lead the London sale in October.The untitled Gaitonde, painted in New Delhi, assembles endless layers of colour, resulting in sequences of prismatic hues in calming blues and verdant greens. The painting was earlier exhibited in Gaitonde's seminal solo exhibition held at the Taj Art Gallery in 1974 and is an example of the artist's signature style from the 1970s.""The painting by Gaitonde is top lot of our sale and features an abstract colour field of beautiful, uplifting tonality, which differentiates it from the artist's earlier paintings,"" said Yamini Mehta, international head of South Asian Art.The Souza painting, meanwhile, is a monumental work touted as one of the most moving, sympathetic portrayals of Christ's agony.The artist takes the iconography and composition from Italian painter Titian's 'Entombment of Christ', allowing it to be truly reborn in his own expressionistic language. The painting forms the 'cover lot' of Sotheby's upcoming London sale.The exhibition forms part of an extensive programme and events in Mumbai, which includes the launch of a three-day course on Contemporary Art."

However, the UDF government had appointed Basheer to succeed P C Chacko, after the latter was defeated in the last parliament elections.The CPI leader and secretary of the Kole Karshaka Sangam N K Subramanian had filed a petition in the high court against the UDF order. Even though the high court had upheld the arguments of Subramanian, the UDF government had filed an appeal against this later.""We have withdrawn the appeal and has issued order appointing Jayadevan as the chairman of the council,"" said agriculture Minister V S Sunilkumar.Jayadevan said the immediate priority will be to convene a meeting of the council. ""The Council hasn't met for the last two years after the previous government arbitrarily appointed Basheer as its chairman,"" he said.About 15,373 hectares of land from Thrissur and Malappuram districts fall under KLDC. The new committee will have to undertake a series of tasks to promote farming in the Kole lands, which lie about 1.5 meters below the sea level.According to agriculture minister the Kole lands, which are predominantly paddy cultivation areas, can make significant contributions to enhance the self-reliance of the state in rice production. The reconstitution will streamline the activities of the council to augment paddy production.Congress leader and president of the Kole Karshaka Sangam K K Kochumuhammed said about 1.20 lakh tonnes of paddy is being produced annually in the Kole lands of Thrissur and Malappuram districts. He said a host of measures like improving the water pumping facilities and introducing mechanization are essential for making paddy cultivation economically viable in the Kole lands. The farmers should also be supported financially to sustain farming there, he added."

He claimed the bank had defrauded him after it later resold his stake for a much higher sum.Despite the case looming over her, Lagarde was appointed in January for a second five-year term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Lagarde has had a high-flying career, first as a top corporate lawyer in the United States, then as a cabinet minister and most recently as managing director at the IMF.At the Fund, she has won praise for persuading the U.S. Congress to approve a landmark reform programme that shifted more voting power to China and other key emerging market countries and has generally been considered a skilful negotiator.As France's finance minister from 2007 to 2011 Lagarde played a key role in Europe's response to the global financial crisis.She joined the international law firm Baker & McKenzie in Paris aged 25 after completing a master's degree in English and labour law, and quickly rose to the top of the Chicago-based firm before entering politics.Born in Paris and raised in the northern port city of Le Havre, Lagarde is a vocal proponent of women as senior executives, once noting dryly that if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters, it might have survived."

A BJP delegation led by president of the party's State unit Basant Panda submitted a memorandum to the Governor and explained to him about the extreme poverty prevailing in Nagada village.Stating that a fact-finding team of BJP has visited Nagada, Panda said the death of 19 children in a span of three months was not only a case of health hazard but also a case of chronic hunger among Juang tribals. The memorandum alleged that Nagada was left out of development projects of the State Government for years and many families in the village have not been provided ration cards under National Food Security Act (NFSA).Since the villagers of Nagada belong to Juang, a primitive tribe, they are to be covered under Antodaya Anna Yojana under which each beneficiary family is entitled to 35 kg rice per month. Most families are yet to be covered under the scheme, the memorandum stated. Besides, the supplementary nutrition scheme for children under Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) has not been implemented in the tribal village and no Anganwadi centre exists there. Claiming that the employment generation programme under NREGA has not been taken up at Nagada since the inception of the scheme, the BJP said the children are deprived of getting free education guaranteed under the Right to Education Act as there is no Government school in the village. The BJP sought the Governor's intervention to protect interests of the people in general and tribals of the State in particular.Panda and BJP State unit vicepresident Samir Mohanty hit out at Women and Child Development Minister Usha Devi for saying lack of awareness among people was the reason for death of children. ""The Minister's statement on Wednesday that there is no concept of family planning in Nagada village and some families in the village have 8-9 children showed that the Government was insensitive to the issue,"" the BJP leaders added."

The aim is to spread the message of organic farming. Vegetables required for the residences of the ministers will be produced there itself, the minister said.The Agriculture Minister launched the kitchen garden at Grace, his official residence by planting a sapling. An agricultural task force comprising a team of officials led by Kudappanakunnu Agriculture officer C L Mini set up the kitchen garden with grow bags equipped with automatic drip mechanism.Along with vegetables, tubers too are are being planted here.

Millions of government employees recently received hefty pay hikes, while more farmers are going bust.The dusty village of Sisauli puts the dilemma facing India's policymakers into clear focus.Sisuali is three hours by rough road from New Delhi, making transporting goods difficult and expensive.Layers of middlemen also clog the supply chain and take their cuts. Some farmers say their produce can go through at least four intermediaries before reaching customers.Malik says he sold rice for 16 rupees (24 U.S. cents) a kilogram to a middle man. In a market 10 minutes away, it retails for three times as much.""Inflation has come down only on paper; in reality, there is no let up in surging prices,"" Sudhir Kumar said in his grocery shop, which also has a small TV set he uses to keep an eye on commodity prices.DECADES OF NEGLECT BUBBLING OVERRural India has long suffered from neglect, but tensions are rising as food prices have surged after two years of drought.Retail inflation in rural areas has consistently outpaced urban areas in the past 18 months, hitting 6.20 percent in June, well above 5.26 percent in cities such as Mumbai.That has pushed overall inflation to a near two-year high of 5.77 percent in June, near the upper end of the RBI's 2-6 percent inflation target.RBI officials have stressed that many of the causes are structural and beyond the central bank's control, but the spike in inflation could complicate the next governor's job.Though India has become the world's fastest growing large economy, political pressure on the RBI is growing to cut interest rates more aggressively to spur full employment, at the risk of unleashing even stronger inflationary forces.Outgoing Governor Raghuram Rajan was lauded by investors for introducing inflation targeting last year, restoring the RBI's credibility by linking price management to numerical targets. Investors are closely watching to see if his successor will stick to tough targets or water them down.Economists polled by Reuters see only one more rate cut over the next year, if inflation does not pick-up too sharply.NO EASY FIXESModi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is already facing a tough electoral test in the state next year. Uttar Pradesh will be a crucial test for its re-election bid in 2019.""You are not ready to pay more to farmers because that is bad economics,"" said Malik. ""But no one complains when hefty pay increases are given to government employees.""The government is making some strides. It is spending on infrastructure and is seeking to weed out middlemen by giving farmers an option of selling their goods across India via electronic trading platforms set up at wholesale markets.But progress is slow, and middlemen continue to hold sway as farmers lack the means to ship directly to buyers.Rate cuts would do little for villagers such as Narpendar Jhinjha, a heavily indebted 52-year-old farmer, who says another bad year will force him to sell his land.""A farmer is hit on both sides,"" Jhinja said, referring to low crop prices and higher prices for goods he needs to buy.""And on top of that we have our loans to pay for. Farmers have been condemned to a life of misery."""
58f21ebca3d24b68099aa4cd,Hike in partition deed tax: KPCC stir from Monday,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/Hike-in-partition-deed-tax-KPCC-stir-from-Monday/2016/07/21/article3539463.ece,2016-07-21,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: THE Kerala Police can now heIn a belated move, the KPCC has announced a stir against slapping of higher stamp duty for registering partition deeds in families and hiking the tax for a few essential commodities. KPCC president V M Sudheeran has informed that Congress activists will stage a dharna in front of the Secretariat and in front of Collectorates across the state on July 25, demanding a rollback of the newly introduced higher tax regime through the revised budget of the new government.Apart from taking up a peoples issue, the stir assumes significance against the backdrop of criticism against the KPCC leadership that a lead is not being given to the party by way of action to overcome the impact and sentiments looming large after the assembly poll debacle. Incidentally, when the UDF unsuccessfully pressurised the government during the first Assembly session recently to not to press for a revision of existing rates for registering family partition deeds and hike the tax for essential commodities like wheat products and coconut oil, neither leading partner Congress nor other coalition partners chose to build up protests outside. The revised budget proposals were adopted by the House and it came into effect the other day.Sudheeran said that replacing a flat Rs 1,000 for registration of partition deeds in families with a 3 per cent stamp duty of the fair price value of land is unjustified.It has put commoners in dire straits. People have to shell out a substantial amount for registering a partition deed. The increase is equivalent to reinstating estate duty, he said.He also pointed out that implementation of Finance Minister Thomas Issacs budget proposals hiking the tax for wheat products, coconut oil and basmati rice is making the life of people miserable. The government had not heeded to the vociferous demand of UDF MLAs in the Assembly to roll back the proposals to impose higher taxes on commoners in the name additional resources mobilization. Now the only option left for corrective measures is to take an agitation course against the new taxes and anti-people policies of the new government, he said."
58f21fe4a3d24b68099aa5cd,A business of a sort,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/A-business-of-a-sort/article14507278.ece,2016-07-22,"The State governments ambitious programme of Re. 1 a kg rice launched to support BPL families is being misused in the district.Many who are not living below poverty line (BPL)have been given ration cards and the rice that they get in fair price shops is resold in the open market for a higher price.The Civil Supplies authorities say that people living above poverty line (APL) have food security cards and were resorting to reselling of the rice for Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 a kg to small traders as they do not consume the rice supplied by PDS.There are instances of small traders moving around in several localities in the town calling out biyyam kontam (well buy rice) to buy PDS rice from the ration card holders.They resell it for about Rs. 15 a kg to flour mills, hotels, eateries, rice millers and sell the same in Maharashtra.This year till date, the Civil Supplies authorities have registered 177 cases under the Essential Commodities Act of 1955 for illegal transportation of PDS rice in various parts of the district and have seized about 2,330 quintals of rice.They say that they have registered cases against 88 ration dealers for their illegal business of selling rice in the open market.The district tops the list of highest number of ration cards distributed in the entire State. The district has 10,98,393 food security cards, including 67,627 Antyodaya Food Security Cards (AFSC) and 677 Annapurna Cards (AC).As per the 2011 census, the total population of the district is 37,76,269 while the ration card holders are a whopping 31,68,836 persons. Going by this, the district is the poorest in the State with the highest number of people living below the poverty line.Incidentally, Minister for Finance and Civil Supplies Etala Rajender represents the Karimnagar district, but has not taken any measures so far to remove bogus ration cards and streamline the public distribution system (PDS).The Civil Supplies authorities say that the illegal transportation of PDS rice could be checked in the district only if the government makes an effort to remove of bogus ration cards."
58f221b4a3d24b68099aa776,The race to light up the last village,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-race-to-light-up-the-last-village/article14592893.ece,2016-08-25,"Jalan Singh, 30, has not removed the cardboard carton that protects the sides of his new Godrej refrigerator. You cannot miss the striking red cooling machine in the room. Having spent Rs.12,000 on it, Singh is proud of his acquisition. Sixty-nine years is a short time in an independent countrys life but it has been a long time for power to reach Singhs village, Tanwarpura, an hours drive from Barmer city in Rajasthan. Power that arrived in the village two months ago, although erratic, nudged Singh to buy a refrigerator. He opens it to show it to us, but its empty. The rains may have tripped some lines, a government official offers an explanation. Rains did lash the village a few days ago. Having been consistent this year, they promise good harvest and some extra income. Singhs spirits are not dampened by the temporary absence of electricity; he reels off his wish list: a fan, a cooler, and an atta chakki (flour mill).Rukh Singh, his neighbour, has beaten him to procuring an atta chakki . The flour mill means two extra hours of sleep for his wife. In the early hours before dawn, Tanwarpura wakes up to the sounds of the chakki as women work it to pound flour. With the manual mill, it took my wife four hours to prepare the flour for our daily meals. The electric one takes an hour, Rukh Singh says. His wife smiles behind her veil, allowing Rukh Singh to speak on her behalf.The Singhs got an electricity connection under the Modi governments flagship scheme of rural electrification launched in July 2015, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The governments goal is 100 per cent electrification by 2019. Official estimates peg the number of un-electrified villages in India at 18,452. Of this, the government claims to have electrified 10,097 villages till date, a figure that doesnt go uncontested.The lifelines of a villageAt least there is light, says 34-year-old Chagan Kanwar, a mother of two. Two weeks ago, for the first time, solar energy lit up houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti in Barmer district where she lives. Designated as a Desert National Park area and situated almost at the farthest edge of the State, a few kilometres before the border with Pakistan, the village has around a hundred households. Power for Kanwar means less pollution. The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining, she says. The inhabitants of this basti were accustomed to travelling 25 km to Gadra village to charge their mobile phones. A shopkeeper there would ask for Rs.10 to charge each phone. We used to take 10 phones once a week to get them charged, says Pan Singh. Mobile phones, lifelines for the villagers and the only connection to the outside world, when powered ran for a week.Their main lifeline, however, is the sun. Under the off-grid scheme of DDUGJY, houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti have been provided with a 100W solar panel which can light five LED bulbs, one standing 12W fan, and a socket to charge a mobile phone. These three utilities come as part of the solar kit, a one-time investment of Rs.1,029 which works out to 5 per cent of the total cost incurred to install the kit in every home. There is no burden of electricity bills.The villagers have become so accustomed to the absence of power that even its presence does not prompt them to switch on the fan. The two villages, Tanwarpura and Salam Singh Ki Basti, are examples of the grid and off-grid programmes of the Centre, which are committed to providing electricity in every village. Explaining the decision for this, the Executive Director of Rural Electrification Corporation, Dinesh Arora, says: States have generally preferred and adopted grid connectivity for most of the villages except in areas where connectivity is either not feasible or cost-effective.In Rajasthan, as at the Centre, a Bharatiya Janata Party government is at the helm. Both Central and State officials are racing to power villages, but they are also wary as the media has turned its gaze to the claims made by the government in rural electrification. Officials everywhere are now tutoring villagers on the art of communicating with the media. With a spate of critical reports on the app-based claims of electrification on GARV making the government more watchful, even the hint of a journalist in the remotest of villages sends officials into a tizzy.Promise of powerMeanwhile, in distant Uttar Pradesh, power is a touchy issue, especially as elections are set to take place next year. When the Centre claims credit for any development, the State is quick to point out loopholes.In Anandpur, a village at the edge of Hathras district which is famed for asafoetida, a dried latex that is indispensable to curries and dals (lentil), power comes and goes. A gift from Delhi, an LED bulb, has brought light into the lives of 70-year-old Ram Prasad and 17-year-old Rahul. The electricity meter, wrapped in plastic, is a prized possession and is precariously mounted on the mud wall of the house that has a small porch, a room, and a tube well in the courtyard. There is a toilet too, Prasad points out, seemingly well-versed in the drill of showing to outsiders the trappings of modernity that have crept into the village. The toilet is pitch dark; light hasnt travelled there yet.For rural India, the DDUGJY brings not only the promise of power to every village, but its attendant trappings too. Our ancestors will be happy. They never saw light, says Savitri, a resident, as she begins cooking potatoes and chapattis under the light of a solitary bulb. The bulb has freed her from having to swat insects that she would have otherwise battled with under the light of a kerosene lamp or candle.Glimpses of a fractious relationshipAnandpur is an odd mix of upper castes (mostly Thakurs) and backward castes. Adversity and deprivation is the glue that holds these communities together. Most of the villagers wear a bemused look as officials from the electricity department come inquiring about the availability of power here. Mukesh Kumar from the State Electricity Board examines 18 meters installed in Anandpur and requests people to show their papers. He looks agitated. We were not informed about the installation. What if the villagers refuse to pay for the power or their homes collapse in the rains? he asks. The question hangs in the air, offering a glimpse of the fractious relationship between the Centre and State.The Prime Minister claimed in his Independence Day address that Nagla Fatela, a village in Hathras, was electrified but the media found surprised villagers and a dark village when it reached there. The embarrassment caused by this episode has left everyone on edge here and the U.P. government is determined to keep a check on every connection by sending its officers to the field. Kumar is one of them. Other senior officials have been dispatched from Lucknow. Says Rakesh Verma wryly: Ideally, the village should be getting 14 hours of power but that seldom happens. Lets see what happens after the elections. The officials wait patiently for Anandpurs residents to show their cards. Others who also wait are the men who installed the meters, the Centres officials.The scheme is premised on the Centre and the State working in tandem. The Centre provides the infrastructure; the State provides the power after working out its availability  12-14 hours a day is what has been calculated. The reality plays out differently as power keeps tripping. Young Anshu whispers that she saw a snake first when the light came on some time at night in her thatched hut just two days ago. Snakes are common in the tiny village of Anandpur, which is ringed by paddy fields. The villagers could not steal power like other villages nearby  katiya , or the illegal tapping of power, is rampant there  as high tension wires made that impossible.The power is erratic and the wait long and uncertain. We wait and watch; so do Savitri and Rahul. Everyone looks at the cooler fan installed upside down, a common jugaad in these parts, which works when the electricity comes. This is a welcome addition to their huts as it helps make the nights less muggy.In Anandpur, the monthly income of a family of five rarely exceeds Rs.2,000. Electricity is a luxury. Agricultural holdings are small, and income is supplemented by selling milk. The villagers are worried; they ask as they wait for the power to come, Do we have to pay the bill? As per the plan, the village will get power from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pointing out the absurdity of the schedule, an official on a visit to the village says, We dont draw the plan. We follow instructions from Delhi. Contesting this, Mr. Arora says, The responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.These villagers are the Antyodaya card holders. In other words, they are the poorest of the poor whose entitlements are a few kilograms of rice and two litres of kerosene a month. The supplies get exhausted quickly and they are forced to purchase these goods from the open market. The nearest school is 2 km away and the villagers are wary of sending their girls to school. Rahul is studying for an examination and he finds the light a godsend. I can study now when the light comes; I dont have to study under the lamp, he says, wistful though for a regular supply.The State government is working out a way to regulate the tariff so that people pay for the power they consume. From the headquarters in Lucknow, the chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Desh Deepak Verma, has been keeping a watch ever since false claims were made about electrification, by dispatching officials to the ground. He says the problem is with the definition of an electrified village. One in 10 homes is all that a series of schemes have focussed on. What about the 9 others? And within the 10 per cent, only poles have reached some villages; last mile connectivity is still distant.Its 6.30 p.m. when dusk falls to herald the night. Thirty hours have passed, but Tanwarpura has no power. Is it because of the rains? Electricity is transformative, but only when it is available, Rukh Singh says. We get it for about two hours a day. A tiny bulb dispels darkness in Jethmal Singhs house. I got my connection under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) governments Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) before it was re-christened by the BJP government as DDUGJY. Only five connections have come in the last six months under the DDUGJY, he says. Thirty of the 35 households which have electricity in this village were electrified under the RGGVY. A Tata Sky dish hangs at the back of Jethmals house. The TV, however, is missing.On August 12, the governments field engineer encouraged us to purchase a television so that we could tune in to Prime Minister Narendra Modis Independence Day address. We bought the set on the 13th, he says. People gathered in Jethmal Singhs house on August 15. But the TV conked off after the Prime Ministers speech and has been sent for repair.Bhiram, who lives ten minutes away from Jethmals house in the nearby village of Tirsingra, also listened to the Prime Minister speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort. The field engineer told me that light would reach my village too, he says. But there was a problem. In April 2015, the government identified 34 un-electrified villages in Barmer. Tirsingra was not one of them.Un-electrified and not on the listA hundred kilometres away from Tirsingra, Mahadev Nagar has a similar story. There is no power in the village and it is not on the governments radar. Surta Ram, 40, calls fellow villagers to gather on the lawns of the primary school to discuss the problems related to lack of power. Photographs of Indira Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar hang prominently in his house. He calls himself a samaaj sevi (social worker). For the last five years, we have been contacting government officials at all levels: the Collector, the MLA, and others. Now they tell us that our name is not in the government survey, he says. Ten days ago, the MLA said that our village will see light this Diwali. Lets see.Mahadev Nagar has a primary health centre, a facility that other villages mentioned as lacking here. But it is just a building. There is no doctor here. No one wants to come here because there is no electricity, Surta Ram says.Adds 39-year-old Puga Ram: Yesterday, three malaria patients had to travel for 5-10 km for injections. The ambulance also doesnt come inside our village. Puga Ram teaches in the village school and is concerned about the childrens education. This is the age of computers. How will these kids get digital literacy if there is no electricity, he asks, distressed. There are five classrooms in the school; one is under construction. The heat inside the room compels the teacher to take his classes on the sands outside under the trees. Misra Ram shows a receipt of Rs.200 dated November 2015. For electricity connections, we had to apply in groups of five. A hundred such forms have been sent from our village. I have applied thrice. But there is no progress, he says.All conversations with the villagers start and end with electricity. Its announcement and presence have fuelled aspirations long bottled up.Back in Salam Singh Ki Basti, Abdul Khan shakes his head, disgruntled with the governments solar-powered electricity scheme that is oddly restrictive as well as liberating. We wanted electricity powered by the grid. The current set-up limits us to a few predefined utilities. There is nothing more that we can do with this, he says. The power limitation of the solar kit doesnt allow them to use other appliances. Unlike in Tanwarpura, electricity in this village doesnt match aspirations. Also, the government is advocating for one kit that fits all. This means that the village school in Salam Singh Ki Basti gets the same set kit as the houses. There are multiple classrooms, but only one fan.In the summer heat in Anandpur, 70-year-old Prasad dreams. Now that we have seen light, we have become a little greedy. Dil aur chahta hai (the heart desires more), he says. That means a few hours more hours of light. And a fan that will make the summer more bearable.The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining.

A two-hour journey on the NH54 that passes through lush green fields will take you there: a small town chock-a-block with people.Further down, a two-km ride on a bumpy road takes you to a nondescript Punjabi village: Kothe Ghurala. When you ask the locals about Shingara Singh, they give a quizzical look. It all changes once they hear his sons name. Avtar toh humaara puttar hai (Avtar is our son), they say, and give you the exact location.Just before you enter, the concrete road runs out and a kuccha sadak takes its place. Because of heavy rain, the narrow lane has become quite slippery. The surroundings remind you of a bygone era  endless fields with cows grazing and small huts. After walking for about five minutes, carefully navigating your way through puddles, you reach the house of Indias brightest hope in judo.Its a single-storey building without a coat of paint, and the first floor is yet to be completed. Avtar has promised to get it done if he wins a medal, Shingara said. There is a hall as soon as you enter. Adorning the wall are medals the 2016 South Asian Games champion has won. Asked when he realised his son had the potential to become a world beater, Shingara said, Avtar burst onto the scene by winning the junior nationals in 2010. In two months, he won gold at the Commonwealth Junior Championship in the 81kg category. Success at the this level prompted a senior call-up in 2011 via a direct entry into the national World Cup team headed for Mongolia.****It was the start of 2015. Desperate for funds but exasperated due to lack of support, Avtar Singh had all but given up. His dream of going to Rio was fading. The then 22-year-old returned to his village, a weary man. His father Shingara, a Class 4 employee in the health department at Naushehra Majha Singhan, the local government hospital, called a family meeting.Avtar needed to improve his rankings to stand any chance of representing the country at the Olympics. The Samsun Grand Prix in Turkey was beginning on March 27. The Judo Federation of India told him that his name had been sent but they couldnt fund the trip.After working for 21 years, Shingara had nearly `4 lakh in fixed deposits: his lifes savings. He decided to withdraw the entire amount the very next day and handed it over to Avtar. He hesitated. Le le puttar (take it son), his father said. After much coaxing from his mother Sukhvinder Kaur and younger brother Jagtar, he was heading to Turkey.****Training hard at the national camp in Delhi, the official release from the International Judo Federation (IJF) finally came through on May 31. He had done it. Avtar was going to Rio in the 90kg category. The first thought that crossed his mind was to call his father. He conveyed the good news. No sound from the other side. Thinking that he got disconnected, he was about to redial. Then, his father answered. Jug jug jiyo! Wahe guru, wahe guru(have a long and prosperous life. Praise the lord).Most judokas need 20-30 events to improve their rankings. Because of financial constraints, Avtar managed only six. From a lowly 200, the six-foot-four judoka reached 79th on the cut-off day, good enough to secure one of the two continental quotas on offer. A key reason for the rapid jump was his performances during the Asian Championships in April. Avtar lost in the semis but defeated Iranian Saeed Moradi in the repechage round.****Shingara had three brothers and three sisters. They had land and cattle to look after. Soon after Avtar was born, his father decided to take up work in the hospital. The name was given by his grandfather. Rishu, as he was affectionately called, was a naughty kid. He would never stop running and jumping. We would get tired of chasing him, Sukhvinder told Express. In an effort to tire him out, he was told to help his mother tend to the rice and wheat on his family farm, and look after their cattle. As he toiled under his mothers supervision, Rishu grew in strength and height.Not that he was a bad student. His grades were good and teachers at the Tagore Memorial Senior Secondary School had no complaints regarding Avtars attendance. The extra work he did helped him gain stamina. By 13, he was six feet. Thats when we decided to send him to the local judo training centre, Shingara revealed.Growing up in a joint family was fun as he got to play with cousins. But squabbles over property led to them moving out.****Humility is a hallmark of champions is an old adage. In the case of Avtar, it suits him to the T. His best attribute is his humility. Despite winning, his attitude towards family, friends never changed. He used to come back from the national camp and play with me. We used to practice judo together. I learn at the same institute as bhaiyya. Im proud of him, Avtars 15-year-old brother Jagtar said.After news reached the village of Avtars selection, everybody went to meet him at the bus stop. People took him on their shoulders and went across the village. Soon after that, he went out to play with neighbourhood kids. He is a shy boy. He loves playing with kids, his mother explained.The house bears a forlorn look on most days as Jagtar goes for training while Shingara goes to work. Most days, Sukhvinder is alone. I love it when Avtar comes home. He loves to eat and I love cooking for him. He prefers roti and any sabzi. Earlier, he used to eat spicy food and drank a lot of lassi. That has reduced. Sometimes I quietly hand him a glass, she added.****No story on Avtar is complete without the mention of the Shahid Bhagat Singh JFI training centre. Located in the Government Model Senior Secondary school, it has a big hall that currently houses 215. Judo belongs to Gurdaspur. The town boasts of close to 30 judo clubs, and its popularity saw JFI tie up with us in 2015. Every household has some history with judo, Avtars first coach Amarjit Shastri said. Gurdaspur has supplied the most number of judokas to the Punjab Services and Punjab Police over the years.Avtar joined the centre in 2005. I always knew he could do it. He never skipped training, irrespective of the weather or health. He was one dedicated kid. Its every coachs dream to produce an Olympian. With his selection, my services as a judo coach for the last 33 years have finally borne fruit.Avtar is not the only gem emerging from the rubble. We have three more world-class judokas. All national champions  Karanjit Singh Mann, Jasleen Singh Saini and Jobandeep Singh. You will hear about them when the next Games come around, Amarjit added.But the institute itself looks in dire need of assistance. It has an old gymnasium with most of the equipment in rusted state. Bathrooms are unclean and it has no doctors. We need a total makeover. Sports medicine has to be brought in if athletes have to reach the next level. We need new equipment. Those who have started winning can afford their own kit and help juniors, but the poor kids suffer. We have a Judo Welfare Society, wherein all judokas who have become officers in the police or armed forces, help maintain the institute, Amarjit revealed. Avtar is an Assistant Sub-Inspector with Punjab Police since 2011. With Avtar going to Rio, Amarjit is hopeful of the future. People have started knowing about the connection between Gurdaspur and judo. Hopefully, some corporate will pump in money.****Both Shingara and Sukhvinder have only seen Avtar on TV or read about him in newspapers. However, they have always yearned to watch their son live, battling on the mat, with a large crowd cheering him on. It was but a distant dream till now. In order to make sure that his parents can watch him during his first Olympic bout, Milaap.Org, Indias largest crowd-funding platform, joined hands with Mother Dairy and Green Bench to raise `8 lakh to fulfil their wish. We will leave for Rio soon, Sukhvinder said.Sports is an unpredictable business. With his family in tow, Indias brightest judo exponent will be battling the odds, hoping for a miracle on the grandest stage of them all."

People being served black carrots juice as part of the organic langar hosted by farmer Jasbir Singh to celebrate Sikh Environment Day on Monday at his village Ghulal (Source: Express photo) .In a fitting tribute to the seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, who was also an ardent environmentalist, a 57-year old farmer from Ludhiana hosted an organic langar on Monday at his farm to observe Sikh Environment Day.In a langar (community kitchen), where more than 100 people attended, the menu included food and drinks prepared completely from organically grown vegetables, cereals and even the desserts were prepared using indigenous breed Sahiwal cows milk.The langar, primarily a Sikh tradition, was also attended by Deputy Shahi Imam Usman Ludhianvi from Jama Masjid, Ludhiana. The attendees were gifted neem and flowers saplings to mark the day.Speaking to The Indian Express, Jasbir Singh Ghulal, from village Ghulal near Neelon, said that it has been almost 12 years now that he shunned wheat-paddy farming and started growing organic fruits, vegetables, rice and flowers.A well-known rose flower farmer in these parts, Jasbirs farm was visited by Prince Charles during his trip to India.The primary source of my income is organic farming now. I know the farmers feel insecure when they think of leaving wheat-paddy farming as organic vegetables market is yet to gather pace. But it is the best feeling when pesticide free veggies and fruits bloom in the farm. Today, I decided to host this organic langar to show that how sumptuous dishes made from organic veggies can be, he said.The menu included dal (pulses), mix vegetables, black carrots juice and pickle, gulkand (prepared from roses) and rotis- all prepared using organically grown crops without pesticides. The dessert was kheer prepared using Sahiwal cow milk and shakkar (organic sugar).Ravneet Singh, EcoSikh South Asia project manager said, Organic food is necessary to revive the true spirit of langar, which is sharing healthy food with the humanity. The campaign aims to make all gurudwara kitchens preparing langar go organic. The target is 50,000 gurdwaras where nearly 50,00,000 people take food daily. It will enhance the demand for organic food, support organic farmers and improve human health.The Sikh Environment Day campaign was started by US based organization EcoSikh in 2010, as a tribute to Guru Har Rai, the seventh Sikh Guru, who planted trees, setup a wildlife sanctuary and a herbal medicinal facility at Kiratpur Sahib.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

58f22554a3d24b68099aa95a,The raconteur of all times,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/The-raconteur-of-all-times/2016/08/02/article3558313.ece,2016-08-02,"HYDERABAD: Ripe rice fields swaying with wet breeze, oxen with tinkling bells ready for ploughing the field, villagers smoking chillam under peepal tree; these snippets of rural India presented by Munshi Premchand, one of the greatest Hindi-Urdu writers of the country are there even today grappling with caste-system and land politics. As the world celebrated 136th birthday of the legendary author on July 31 who is known for his gripping novels and short stories, the country he was born in hasnt been free from the problems the writer so poignantly depicted in his works.The raconteur of Dalit and peasant classes that he was in the pre-independence era, his short-story Kafan is a heart-rending story of two Dalits Ghisu and Madhav who end up spending the money on food given for the latters wife who dies in childbirth. The irony reaches its peak when an old and famished Ghisu says that living beings are more important than the dead ones. The gnawing hunger is a stark contrast in front of Death.In another story Mukti Marg the zamindari system and land politics is highlighted. We see the geo and class clashes between a shepherd and a peasant Buddhu and Jhingur respectively. The story finely depicts the labour of a farmer and his destruction. And then the ultimate happens  cow slaughter as revenge. As a repentance the character is forced to leave his village, living his life in penury and hatred by his fellow-villagers. Even now this story comes alive in different pockets of India resulting in murder, banishment and a lot more that is debatable.Munshi Premchand, perhaps, saw that even in post-Independence era India will still be crippled with the issues of casteism and religious bigotry. What rules the story is dogma of religion that overpowers everything and is a threat to both the society and individuals.In Sadgati, the writer shows how the dead-body of a Dalit isnt touched by the upper-class but removed with the help of a rope. Unfortunately, instances of such stark class division is rampant in India that is living in Google age. Premchand was born in a village near Banaras on July 31, 1880 and hence, observed lives of peasants much like Guy De Maupassant and Anton Chekov. Born Dhanpat Rai, he came to Bombay and wrote the script for the movie Mazdoor, but he left the city within a year. Movies like Shatranj Ke Khiladi, Gaban, Godan, Oka Oori Katha, Bazaar-e-Husn, etc., that are based on his works depict casteism, class difference and extremes of poverty juxtaposed to the luxuries the upper class enjoys. The stories whether on silver screen or in paper-back identify the same problems largely to which many choose to turn a blind eye to."

A resident of the Maadi neighborhood, close to the city's old quarter, he now fears for his two children, wife, mother and other relatives.Khandakani, who volunteers with the city's medical council and documents casualties of war, is among tens of thousands of Syrians trapped in the rebel-controlled part of Aleppo, struggling to survive the crippling encirclement of their once-thriving city. Bread and medicine are being rationed, and as fuel runs out, many are relying on bicycles to run errands past skeletons of buildings and rubble that litter the city's narrow alleys and streets.For those who remain amid the government siege that began July 17, the battle for Aleppo is a pivotal point in the Syrian civil war.""I have seen death in all its forms. I have seen people suffocate. People burn or people under the rubble for 12 hours,"" Khandakani told The Associated Press. ""I would die but not live in exile or live under the regime's hands again.""Aleppo, with thousands of years of written history, has always held symbolic and political significance in the nation's civil war. The city emerged as a key battleground after rebels opposed to Assad seized parts of it in the summer of 2012. Since then, relentless fighting has laid waste to entire neighborhoods, carving the city into rebel- and regime-held zones, killing tens of thousands of people and forcing tens of thousands more to flee.Six years into the nation's civil war, government forces aided by massive Russian air power are on the ascendancy again and have completely encircled the rebel fighters in Aleppo. Holed up in the city's eastern neighborhoods, where they had hoped to set up an alternative opposition capital, the militants are making their last stand.One rebel fighter described a recent visit to the city.""It was like walking into Hiroshima. It is beyond destruction and far worse than what you see on TV,"" Cpt. Abdul-Salam Abdul-Razzek, a spokesman for the Nour el-Din Zinki rebel group, said in a telephone interviewDeserted and bullet-riddled buildings and sand mounds serve as dividers between the city's government-held sectors in the west and south, and rebel-held eastern and northern neighborhoods. Aleppo's ancient quarter, a world heritage site as one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, is divided between rebel and government control in a complicated labyrinth of alleys and streets.In the eastern part of town, the only remaining female gynecologist is running out of asthma medication for her aging mother and can barely keep up with the skyrocketing food prices since government forces encircled the sector where she lives.Fuel is running out and may force the doctor, who gave only her first name, Farida, to protect family members who live under government control, to shutter her medical practice.Yet she has no plans to leave. ""If you empty the city, consider the revolution over,"" the 37-year-old said.Farida has been separated from her parents, who live in the government-held zone, for most of the past four years, even though they live just a few streets a part  easy walking-distance before the war. Now they manage to see each other only occasionally, after taking a long and dangerous route cutting through rebel-held territory.Her mother, who came to visit a month ago, has been unable to return home since the 2 1/2-week-old siege began but considers the government offer to open humanitarian corridors to be more threatening than reassuring.""I would say a quarter of the people I know want to leave, but many won't be able to because they are either related to rebels or are disabled,"" Farida said.In the lower-income eastern part of Aleppo where she lives, there were limited protests against Assad in 2011. When rebels from the northern rural areas pushed their way into her neighborhood in 2012, Farida chose to stay with her then newborn daughter and her husband, one of the area's few remaining eye doctors.A new rhythm was established after the initial celebrations: Roads allowed in goods and fuel and access was possible to other rebel-held territory, neighboring Turkey and even government-controlled areas by using back roads and long detours.Aleppo became the most cherished prize of the rebels and their supporters, who set out to administer their new area. But airstrikes and unguided barrel bombs lobbed from government helicopters soon made death and destruction a new reality.Farida lives near one of the front lines, where approaching can be at a lethal price because of sniper fire.With the sector besieged by government forces, bread is being rationed; there is no stored wheat because of fear of bombardment. Vegetables from nearby farms are scarce. No eggs are available, and people have been largely surviving on rice and cracked wheat.The family has not been able to find chicken, and prices for what is available have skyrocketed: A kilo (2.2 pounds) of red meat now costs about 5,000 liras ($10), up from 3,000 liras ($6) before the siege  already a crippling price for families whose monthly earnings can be as low as 10,000 liras ($20).A new generation is growing up with malnutrition and vitamin deficiency, Farida said, adding that it's the food shortage, not the warplanes that are most scary. ""No one runs from strikes or the sounds of aircraft anymore,"" she said.Wissam Zarqa, a 34-year old English teacher, returned to Aleppo last year from Saudi Arabia where he went after the 2011 outbreak of protests to evade mandatory military service. He now teaches English as part of a condensed curriculum to help students catch up after schools closed. His wife, an engineer, also stayed to help rebuild Aleppo.""Those who stayed behind in Aleppo are many. Those who stay willingly act differently and are ready to defend their existence to the last breath,"" Zarqa said.On Sunday, when a rebel counteroffensive began, residents burned tires, hoping the smoke would obscure the government forces' view and prevent deadly airstrikes.Khandakani marched with the protesters urging them on. Anything, he said, ""is easier than surrendering, even if we are besieged for two years.""Although supplies of medication are dwindling  only 600 ampules of a drug used to stop post-natal hemorrhages remain  Farida's biggest fear is losing her four midwives. ""If they leave we will really have a problem. I find myself praying they don't,"" she said.Still, she is determined to maintain her spirit.""The siege is just starting. If we all pass on negative energy to one another, we will not be able to survive,"" she said."

By the end of August 2015, the combined water in Periyar credit was around 2300 mcft. This year, it is only 690 mcft. That says the entire story, said S. Kanagaraj, Joint Director of Agriculture.Officials said that the area under kuruvai cultivation this year was only 979 hectares, which is not even one-tenth of the 10,328 hectares cultivated last year. The kuruvai cultivation this year is being done mainly in Vadipatti and Chellampatti blocks, which depend on well irrigation.M. Thirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, who is dependent on Periyar irrigation, said, Ideally, Periyar water for kuruvai must have been released by mid-June or the latest by second week of July. Since it was not released at all, I did not sow, he said.He said that Cauvery delta being the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu, government had given special focus there for kuruvai crop. With no such support available here, none of us are willing to take the risk, he said.V.R. Muthupeyandi, a farmer from Pullaneri, said that the rainfall in September would be crucial for samba and thaladi crops. We need copious rainfall in the next one to one-and-a-half months so that there is adequate water in Periyar credit, which can be released for cultivation at least by second week of October, he said.A senior official from Public Works Department, however, said that the likelihood of that happening was low. We must have received good rainfall by now. With the prospects of meeting drinking water needs itself in doubt, chances of having adequate water for samba is unlikely even if there is reasonably good rainfall in the coming month, he said.For mitigation, Mr. Kanagaraj said that his department was taking a number of measures. We are asking the farmers, who are not able to go for kuruvai, to at least sow green manure seeds like dhaincha and sunn hemp, which can be ploughed back to improve soil fertility. It is better than leaving the land barren as it will help in improving the samba yield, he said.He added that the department was also planning to aggressively push for System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and machine transplanting techniques for paddy to reduce the water need. Last year, the SRI coverage was more than 50 per cent. With government increasing the subsidy from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 per hectare for SRI this year, we are hoping to persuade more farmers, he said."

With 24 per cent of the tribal population, the State government may not be able to ensure food security as per the needs of the poor people of Odisha, the memorandum said.Choice to beneficiariesWhile identifying the beneficiaries under the NFSA, the State government provided a choice to beneficiaries to select the combination of five kg of food grains basket (five kg rice or four kg rice and one kg wheat... to one kg rice and four to five kg wheat).Rice-wheat ratioAll beneficiaries under the NFSA had indicated their choice and after collecting the information and that of Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) beneficiaries, it was found that the rice wheat ratio was 85.82:14.18 for all the NFSA beneficiaries, the memorandum said.Under the AAY, which has been continuing under the NFSA, all beneficiaries were being provided 35 kg rice in Odisha prior to the NFSA. So it was decided by the State government to provide them 35 kg of rice if they were otherwise eligible under the NFSA.But, the Centre was also making wheat allocation for them, the BJD MLAs said.Notwithstanding the peoples food choice, the Centre has been allocating rice and wheat at the ratio of 78.83:21.17 on the ground, which was the ratio of allocation and lifting prior to the NFSA implementation.But the reality is, in the last three-and-a-half-years since April 2012, the ratio of lifting of rice and wheat has been 85:15 at 70.60 lakh tons of rice and 12.41 lakh tons of wheat by Odisha, they pointed out. As the people of Odisha prefer rice than wheat, the ruling party demanded that the Centre not dump wheat on the State. - PTI"

The latter brings heavy rain over India. Changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere, combined with current climate model outlooks, suggest the likelihood of La Nia forming later in 2016 is around 50%, said the agencys press statement. Its good newsthere is a good chance that La Nina conditions will begin to show up in the second half of the monsoon. August could mean heavy rain and we might see some monsoon rain in October also, said Madhavan Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences.Gains for agriculturePrivate weather agency Skymet said on Wednesday that it expected all of the monsoon months, except June, to record rains well above whats usual and would translate into gains for agriculture.In 2016, the total area under kharif food grains is expected to increase by 15 to 20% over last year. Accordingly, the kharif food grains production is expected to be around 129 to 130 million tonnes. Area under oilseeds including soybean, groundnut, pulses and rice may increase. Area under cotton may reduce marginally while total agricultural land under sugarcane may remain the same as the previous year.According to the IMDs latest update, the monsoon is likely to set in on June 7 over Kerala. This was partly due to a depression in the Bay of Bengal that morphed into cyclone Roanu and brought heavy rains to Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and killed at least 20 in Bangladesh.The monsoon-rain-bearing systems were yet to gain enough force to coast over India and though the El Nino was gone, it would take some time for its effect to spill over into the atmosphere and aid the monsoon, said Mr. Rajeevan."

While he lost his investment due to lack of adequate rainfall in 2014, rodents ate away a part of his field last year.This year too, as kharif season began, he is anxious as he is yet to find an effective method to eradicate the rodents.""As soon as the transplantation of the crop begins every year, I spend sleepless nights. I grow paddy in 2 acres and I lose about six bags of the crop due to rodents,"" he lamented.Not just in Ponnur mandal, the peculiar problem of losing crops to rodents is very common in the area of cultivation in Krishna western delta. The Tenali revenue division, which has 18 mandals and 305 villages, is the worst-affected in the district. ""It is very painful to see the crop eaten away by rodents. A farmer's life is very difficult as everything is dependent on nature. Even if the rain gods are merciful, the rats and bandicoots don't spare us. I lose tens of thousands of rupees every season despite using prescribed rodent poison which fails to serve the purpose,"" said K Vasu from Bapatla. According to information, the rodent problem is endemic in about 1.5 lakh hectares in Guntur district. Agriculture minister Prathipati Pulla Rao, who took stock of the issue, said that the rodent menace results in crop loss of Rs 200 crore every year. To address this problem, the agriculture department has embarked on a massive eradication drive on Wednesday in all the 18 mandals in Tenali revenue division. Even though the agriculture department has taken up various eradication programmes in the past four years, the results were not encouraging. So this year, the officials decided to take up measures on a massive scale that too at once for effective results. District joint director of agriculture V D V Krupa Das said that the department has given away poison bait to all the farmers to eradicate the menace.""Rodents are intelligent creatures. If they are suspicious of something, they send signals to other rodents to avoid consuming whatever we offer. Hence, we began the exercise of eradication on a massive scale right in the beginning of the crop season to ensure that the rodents are killed even before transplantation begins,"" he said.The poison bait is a combination of rat poison, broken rice and vegetable oil in measured proportions. The district agriculture department in the last two months pooled in 1,550 kg of vegetable oil and 75 metric tonnes of broken rice from rice millers, water user associations (WUAs), farmers and other organisations. ""As the materials required for the poison bait are costly, we convened meetings and organised sensitisation programmes with various stakeholders. Vegetable oil is anyway available at subsidised government price, so we pooled in other items and made the poison bait,"" the JD said.The officials gave away 20 packets per acre to all the farmers for free. The officials added that the bait is very effective and works within hours of the rodent consuming it.""We have also demonstrated the technique to the farmers so that they can emulate it. If this method is done periodically once a year, we can control the rodent problem significantly,"" they added. Farmers, ZPTCs, MPTCs, village heads and other public representatives also participated in the drive."

He was mostly invited for judging community (sarvajanik) installation of Lord Ganesha during the festival. As a momento, he received these idols which were lying with him. One fine day, he decided to display it in his museum. To his surprise, his friends started gifting him with Ganesha idols from various places in India and foreign countries. His friend Anand Khandeparkar then gifted him with the antique piece and thus his collection started growing.""I am in the process of categorizing them in different folk art to bring out the folklore of that particular place.

And Diwali , which is celebrated across communities from the North to South, means different kinds of festive delights  every household has its own specialities . Here's a look at what will be on the tables of Hyderabadis this Diwali.Sweets are a big part of our festivals at home. We always have prashad for all the pujas. But since everybody is a little more conscious now, all the sweets that are made at home are sugar-free. I generally don't have too many sweets, but during Diwali, I indulge. TamannaahWhen it comes to Diwali sweets, I'm crazy about kaju katli. But there's something about maa ke hath ka khana and I love the 'special mutton kheema' with paratha she makes. She's been making it on Diwali since I was a kid and I relish it the same way I used to as a kid. And not to forget the kheer - it's just yum! CharmmeThe coconut milk payasam made by my granny is what I really look forward to every Diwali. In fact, it's very easy to make, even I can make it. We cook unpolished brown, rice with palm jaggery and when it's soft and well done, we add coconut milk and garnish it with nuts and raisins. As simple as it sounds, it's very, very tasty. When it comes to Diwalidelicacies made by my mother, she makes the best gajar ka halwa. Adah SharmaThe day begins on a sweet note with the offering to Goddess Lakshmi, which is a payasam made of milk, semiya with lots of dry fruits. Since we do a puja at home, the meals are strictly vegetarian. For lunch, there is a hearty pulao with all the vegetables and curries. For me, the highlight of the day when it comes to food is the evening snack. Just as the chill in the October air sets in, we start making pakodas (with onion, capsicum and gobi). The family then gathers together, lights all the lamps and sits together for a chat over the hot, hot pakodas. Yamini Reddy , dancerDiwali brings back a lot of 'sweet' memories. Gur sandesh and flavoured sandesh are my favourites. And of course, I love rasgulla. But more than anything, Diwali was synonymous with the kaju barfi that was made at home. I used to gorge on those. Shraddha Das , actressNo festival is complete without puran poli and shrikhand but Maharashtrians have a special place in their hearts for the laddu in all its avatars. So they figure in our on Diwali spread as well. We gorge on rava laddus, boondi laddus and besan laddus. Saurabh Gharipurikar , theatre artisteFor Tamilians, Diwali begins early with the Naraka Chaturdashi the day before Diwali . When it comes to food, it's the usual sweets and savouries. But the most unique part of Tamilian Diwali are the other things we have on this day. The day starts with making an offering of everything to the gods  even crackers. Then, we have beetel leaves and nuts before we go in for an oil bath (called Ganga Snanam). Then come out the new clothes after which we drink what we call Deepavali Marandu (or legiyam). This is medicinal and has ingredients like ajwain, dry ginger, jaggery, dry grapes, dried root of pepper and many more. Each household makes it differently. As a child, I remember going out and bringing all these ingredients that need to be then dried and powdered. Now, you get them in stores too. And this marundu is extremely good for health and especially given to women who have just given birth. Geetha Ganesan , dancer"

The tightly-scripted action was to rework the framework of engagement with Pakistan, while the overt acknowledgement was necessary for the domestic audience.The government laid out the ground in the preceding days, briefing key countries about the spike in infiltration and mounting evidence gathered by India including captured terrorists. These included the P-5 countries and key nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE, all Pakistan allies. China was briefed during the Sept 27 counter terrorism dialogue.The Indian line that thecame after intelligence pointed to an imminent large-scale strike may have been intended more for the domestic constituency . However, the government expects some degree of retaliation by Pakistan.The next step was to mount a diplomaticpolitical offensive, which included giving information to the Pak envoy and responding to its invective in the UN.Modi's Kerala speech lulled people into thinking proactive diplomacy would be all India would do but more robust actions followed this week -cornering Pakistan on Indus Waters Treaty and cancelling the Saarc summit. India is now expected to review the MFN status accorded to Pakistan and restricting Pakistan's use of Indian airspace.DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh described the strikes as being ""along the LoC"" but anybody looking at the targets, terrorist launch pads, is aware they are across the LoC. One of the DGMO's first actions was to inform his counterpart of the strike, clarify it was a oneoff and express sympathy for deaths of Pak soldiers stressing the intent was to go after terror camps. The strike was pitched as a counter-terror op, not a military operation, giving Pakistan reason to resist calls for retaliatory escalation.After the strikes, national security adviser Ajit Doval called his US counterpart, Susan Rice.The White House readout later said Ambassador Rice ""strongly condemned"" the attack in Uri.Before going public, the government briefed the President, vice-president, former PM Manmohan Singh and the J&K leadership.Foreign secretary S Jaishankar later briefed foreign journalists, 28 envoys, think tanks and TV commentators."

India had demanded market access for products including non-basmati rice, pharmaceuticals and several fruits & vegetables among others.Indias goods trade deficit with China has surged from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16. Beijing has been denying market access to India's non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its concerns included the likelihood of a pest called Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.China was the worlds largest rice importer in 2015-16 followed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq.Mill inspectionOfficial sources said after several requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials have finally agreed to visit India during September 19-28 to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are situated in states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.To export to countries including China, it is mandatory for Indian rice exporters to be registered with the NPPO  the Indian government body in charge for inspecting these mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO will assist its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection from September 19-28 for pest risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian commerce ministry is also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.The inspection is a very significant stage in the process, A. K. Gupta, Director (Basmati Export Development Foundation, foreign trade, World Trade Organisation-related matters & agri-export zones), APEDA, said. He expressed hope that following the inspection, China will soon issue a formal notification regarding permission for non-basmati rice exports from India.The Chinese authorities had carried out a similar inspection in 2009, following which in 2011-12, they gave their nod to basmati exports from India to China, Mr. Gupta added.Pointing out that the 19 mills are involved in processing non-basmati and basmati rice, he said, therefore, the inspection will cover both varieties.Rajen Sundaresan, Executive Director, All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA), said he was also hopeful that the Chinese authorities will shortly give green signal for non-basmati rice exports from India to China. He said a recent joint survey done by AIREA and the leading agro-chemical (including pesticides) firm UPL found that the allegations regarding the presence of Khapra beetle in processed Indian rice were wrong and vastly exaggerated.Pakistani importsPointing out that China imports non-basmati rice from Pakistan, Mr. Sundaresan said Beijings objection to Indian non-basmati export seems more political in nature than anything else.Trade sources said there are reports of rice (basmati & non-basmati) exports from India to China happening through Hong Kong and Thailand. In 2015-16, India exported 6.2 million tonnes of non-basmati rice worth Rs.15,000 crore, he said."

Bogus ration cards, even those of deceased persons, are widely used to steal subsidy by showing fictional transactions on paper.Curiously, ration shop records often show that 90 per cent of beneficiaries drew their PDS quota on the last day of the month.The inspections will start at the point of sales and move up the supply chain to identify and plug loopholes that allow corruption and theft. Investigators will randomly check whether PDS commodities are released in the presence of beneficiaries. They will verify stock positions in warehouses and ration shops.Surplus stockPresence of surplus stock indicates hoarding for illegal diversion.Retailers are mandated to prominently display the stock position of foodgrains, kerosene, sugar and flour in ration shops. There are an estimated 14,300 ration shops in the State. Vigilance investigators will also tail trucks moving PDS commodities, particularly kerosene, from warehouses to depots to detect pilferage, if any.Officials say subsidised PDS foodgrains ended up as branded products in the open market. The profits involved are manifold. FCI warehouses will also come under the Vigilance scanner.The agency has received complaints that the physical movement of grains from warehouses to retailers is often just on paper.Blatant corruptionIt is alleged that trucks carrying PDS grains often drove straight from warehouses to factories owned by private branded rice product manufacturers.Illegally diverted PDS kerosene ends up as fuel in fishing boats, earthmovers and generators that power cinema halls and marriage auditoriums.Past studies indicate that only 40 per cent of the PDS commodities reach intended beneficiaries"

Thomas Isaac has sought to give a big push to infrastructure development using extra-budgetary resources even while attempting to raise tax revenue with better tax administration and fresh imposts and provide a healing touch to different vulnerable sections.The new imposts listed in the budget would push up the prices of a few commodities, notably coconut oil, packaged wheat products, and basmati rice on account of a 5 per cent tax, and textiles thanks to a 2 per cent levy. In a first, he has slapped a fat tax on food articles of conspicuous consumption such as pizzas and burghers sold through branded restaurants. Land transactions would cost more with the Finance Minister hiking the registration levies. He has slapped a green tax on vehicles aged more than 15 years and increased the levies on stage carriages. The various additional imposts are expected to net Rs.805 crore. The fresh levies notwithstanding, Dr. Isaac anticipates a year end deficit of Rs.746.69 crore.The Finance Minister has announced Rs.12,000-crore package to fight economic slowdown by taking up major infrastructure projects. The necessary funds would be raised through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) issuing bonds, raising term loans from banks, and creating funds that have the approval of RBI and SEBI.The government would stand guarantee for the funds thus raised. Appropriate legislative changes would be brought about and governance mechanisms created to facilitate this. On the welfare side, the Finance Minister has announced an across-the-board hike in social welfare pensions to Rs.1,000 and promised a comprehensive insurance scheme covering treatment of all major non-communicable diseases. The State government will also bring forward a comprehensive legislation to offer protection to migrant workers, pay pension to transgenders aged above 60 years, and create a separate department for women.Productive sectorIn the productive sector, there will be massive deployment of resources to ensure value addition in agriculture through the establishment of a string of agro-parks at an estimated outlay of Rs.500 crore, acquisition of 5,100 acres of land at an estimated Rs.5,100 crore over five years to set up multipurpose industrial zones, adoption of soil conservation as a key activity under MGNREGS, greater mechanisation of the coir industry, creation of Kochi-Palakkad industrial corridor, and a Rs.1,325-crore initiative to promote the IT industry.In the energy sector, the government's strategy will be to lean more on solar energy. A beginning in this direction will be made this year by launching a scheme to install solar panels atop homes to generate 1,000 MW power."

Rajendran said that paddy production can be augmented with scientific farming practices even with currently available area.Inaugurating a training programme on upland farming at the Directorate of Extension, Mannuthy, the Vice Chancellor said willpower was the most wanted ingredient in farming.We can resume farming in unused paddy fields and barren uplands. We can introduce second and third crops where only one crop is raised and we can use more productive varieties and productivity enhancement techniques. All these steps together will trigger a three-fold increase in production, which is so significant in todays scenario. But the basic ingredient is the will to do it. Fortunately, the State government is offering support and we, agricultural professionals and the farming community, should strive to make it, he said.KAU Director of Extension S. Estelita, in her presidential address, said current paddy production in Kerala can meet the requirements of two months only and rice for the rest ten months is imported from other States.The necessity to enhance production and productivity is obvious. Upland farming will help us realise the importance and relevance of paddy cultivation and enthuse the younger generation. The encouraging response to this training programme is a positive sign, she said.Principal Agricultural Officer A. A. Prasad said the Department of Agriculture has initiated steps to spread upland farming in 500 ha in Thrissur district and the KAU training programme has come as a shot in the arm for the initiative.ATMA (Agricultural Technology Management Agency) district project director V.

Farmers are also to be supplied other inputs under the scheme.Chairing the farmers grievances day meeting here on Friday, S. Palanisamy, Collector, said farmers interested in taking up mechanised direct sowing during the samba season would be provided a subsidy of Rs.600 per acre and the subsidy would be extended for 16,000 acres in the district. Farmers would also be given Rs.500 an acre for ploughing fields. The subsidy would be extended for about 1,50,000 acres in the district. Farmers would also get Rs. 10 per kg of seed as grant to get quality seeds.As weeds were likely to sprout in direct sowing, farmers would get Rs. 280 per acre for herbicide. The subsidy under this head would be extended to cover 1.05 lakh acres.This apart, a subsidy of Rs.200 an acre would be provided for applying zinc sulphate and the subsidy would be extended for about 30,000 acres.

Pulses bring in more profits, take lesser time to grow, require lesser water than paddy and fix nitrogen in the soil, thus reducing the use of fertilizers for the next crop.Though the price of pulses in the retail market is quite high, farmers dont get much. The end consumer pays thrice the amount the farmer gets for his work. It is the middlemen who make a killing. If we find proper buyers, who will procure our goods on a continuous basis, it would help us take up pulse cultivation, said V. Ravichandran, Nannila Progressive Farmers Forum from Thiruvarur district.Though the Agriculture department has been suggesting that rice fallow cultivation be taken up, farmers say if they sow urad seeds a few days before paddy crop is harvested, mechanical harvesters destroy the seedlings or chop off the top of tender plants.Also, farm labour is tough to find and many of us share mechanical harvesters. In such a situation, only those who have pumpsets prefer to take up urad cultivation under irrigated conditions, Mr. Ravichandran said, adding the government could consider renting out pump sets or offer subsidised rates to small farmers so that they too could benefit. Around 85 per cent of Indian farmers are small farmers, who cannot afford pumpsets.Agriculture scientist M.S.Swaminathan said though the government fixes a minimum support price for pulses, it does not procure them. There is no procurement mechanism in place as in the case of paddy or wheat. When that comes, it would attract more farmers to take up pulses cultivation and break the pattern of three paddy crops a year, he said at a recent consultation on increasing pulses cultivation.Lack of storage facilityP.K. Deivasugamani, State president, Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangangalin Kootu Iyakkam, said the government should create facilities for storage and intervene when prices are less. For instance, ten days ago farmers sold onions at Rs. 7 a kilo a big loss for many. When the prices go up only those who have storage facilities benefit, which is why we have been demanding creation of storage facilities and procurement by the government when prices go down, he said.Sources in the Civil Supplies department said as of now pulses production was very low in the State and most of what is consumed is sourced from elsewhere.Government procurement alone will not help. Even with respect to paddy, which the government procures, of the total production of around 100 lakh tonnes only 1516 lakh tonnes are purchased by the Civil Supplies Corporation. If the farmer becomes a player in the agricultural commodity market, his interests would be protected, explained a former Civil Supplies department official.Though they need less time and water and fetch a good price, it is middlemen who reap the benefits"

He asked the officials to chalk out an action plan for summer, giving top priority to Neeru-Chettu works to reap maximum results before the start of monsoon rains in June. He exuded confidence that compared to last year, the drinking water problem would be less severe this year.The Collector, who inspected the Handri-Neeva canal works from Anantapur border to Punganur, warned that strict action would be taken against contractors and engineers if works were not executed as per schedule. Providing drinking water through HNSS canal by August is top on the governments agenda. If the officials and contractors have any problems at the work front, they should immediately bring it to the notice of the government. Tunnel work should be expedited and completed within 90 days, he said.Farm pondsMr. Siddarth Jain observed that in view of difficulty in cultivation of paddy and sugarcane crops in western mandals, particularly bordering Anantapur and Karnataka, steps would be taken to give a major thrust to horticulture in the region. He directed the officials to go in for optimal use of mechanised farming by deploying all available technological knowhow, and galvanise farmers to adapt to modern farming. Creation of farm ponds is given top priority, and this will go a long way in rejuvenating the groundwater levels, he said.The revenue and civil supplies wings would be prompted to set up centres to purchase about 4 lakh metric tonnes of slim-variety rice from farmers at Rs. 1,450 per quintal.The Collector maintained that steps would be taken to release budgets to all the welfare hostels in the district promptly and biometric system would be made mandatory for more efficient administration.Tamballapalle MLA Shankar Yadav, Sub-Collector Kritika Batra, HNSS senior engineer Muralidhar Reddy, officials of various government departments took part in the meeting."

But the coverage is skipped by readers and viewers because it doesnt have a local resonance, said Ms. Jayashree. It is our duty to show that climate change is part of our life too, she added. The faddish nature of environment news coverage and the urge to create sensationalism was obscuring crucial aspects of the climate change debate, said M.S. Arasu, Tiruchi region co-ordinator, ClimaAdapt, a research programme that focuses on climate change adaptation in agriculture in India.What we are getting is only a macro-level examination of environmental issues, with most of the studies being done in north India, said Mr. Arasu. For example, it is not widely known that methane emissions from rice fields are being studied for its role in global warming and climate change. We get more rains now than before, but at a more unpredictable rate.Nancy Anabel, director, Information Education and Communication, MSSRF, said that using technology to help farmers to adapt to environmental change is the way forward in local climate action. Everyone has their own lens to view the problem, but we have not been able to reach out with relevant information to those most affected by it. For example, mobile phones could easily be used to convey useful data such as market rates and rainfall trends to farmers, so that they can plan their crop patterns, said Ms. Nancy.Fisheries are equally affected by the rising sea levels due to climate change, she said, which requires more efforts to be directed towards saving marine resources."

Niranjana, Vice-Chancellor of Gulbarga University, has expressed concern over the adverse impact of global warming on agricultural productivity and food security.Delivering the inaugural address at a national symposium on Recent trends in plant pathological research and education here on Tuesday, he called upon agricultural scientists to orient their research to address issues that could possibly arise out of climate change.The symposium was jointly organised by the Indian Phytopathological Society and University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur.Adverse impactClimate change will definitely adversely impact food productivity and lead to rise of prices of foodgrains worldwide. The scenario will lead to social unrest and famine. Projections have shown that the production of major cereals will be decreased by 2020. The production of rice will come down by 11 per cent and that of wheat by 14 per cent. The elevated carbon dioxide level will lead to reduction of nutritional quality in many crops. Global warming will impact the rainfall pattern and also lead to increase in the number of pests, Mr. Niranjana said. He stressed the need to develop crop verities resilient to climatic fluctuations.Pest controlPointing out the role of pests in the drop in yield and increase in the cost of production, Mr. Nijanjana said that 500 million tonnes of foodgrains were lost annually duo to plant diseases. He said that the current pest control methods were, to some extent, costly and inefficient.Mr. Niranjana said that there was a need to put all tools of modern science to work for better management of our limited resources, reducing pre and post harvest losses and improving the capacity of hungry people to purchase food.Utilisation of technology for Indias development is more dependent on practical experiences of farmers than the statements on acceptance or rejection of new technologies. Plant pathologists need to come up with technologies that are safe for humans, animals and environment, he said.CounsellingA.H. Rajasab, Vice-Chancellor of Tumkur University, said that there was a need to counsel farmers and agricultural labourers in distress to prevent them from taking extreme steps.Only development of technologies wont save the country. A laptop or smartphone cannot produce food. It is hard working farmers who do it. There is an urgent need to protect our farmers and agricultural labourers. Agricultural universities must take up the task of counselling farmers in distress, he said.P.M. Salimath, Vice-Chancellor of UAS-R; C.D. Mayee, former chairman of Agriculture Scientists Recruitment Board; B.V. Patil, former Vice-Chancellor and Director of Education of UAS-R; and plant pathologists M.K.

Paddy cultivation in the State was marked by a decline in area and low production, the Economic Review 2015 released earlier this month says. The area under rice has been shrinking consistently over the last three decades. Kollam, Alappuzha, and the northern districts of Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod showed a decline in area as well as production in 2014-15. In Kottayam, despite an increase in area of 9.8 per cent, production did not go up.According to C. Bhaskaran, former Professor of Agricultural Extension, Kerala Agricultural University, the government response to the growing crisis in the paddy sector was high on promises and low on delivery. The procurement mechanism had not been effective and spending on promotion of paddy had failed to match budget allocation. The substandard quality of inputs like seeds and organic manure had also impacted on the production. It is estimated that labour accounts for almost 60 per cent of the production cost of rice.Paddy farming is costly and requires greater effort than other crops. It needs sustained intervention from the government and local bodies to overcome the disincentives for farmers. But unlike rubber, the paddy sector is largely unorganised and lacks lobbying power to influence policy making, Dr. Bhaskaran points out.An RTI inquiry by a city-based lawyer, V.T. Pradeep Kumar, revealed that the State budget proposals to establish rice bioparks in Palakkad and Kuttanad in 2012-13 and three rice mills in Kuttanad, Palakkad, and Wayanad in 2013-14 had remained nonstarters. The rice procurement mechanism lay in tatters, with the government owing Rs.28.23 crore to farmers by February 1, 2016.Paddy sector is largely unorganised and lacks lobbying power to influence policy making"

And yet, none of these promises have been fulfilled.As a result of this, the Irular Association passed a resolution in a meeting recently to boycott the Assembly elections altogether. As a mark of protest, Irulas have raised black flags on their houses (huts). Tiruvallur is said to have around 80,000 Irula voters. Our children study with candle lights and under street lights. We live in thatched huts with no facilities and there is no safety for us from natural calamities. All these years, we have received only promises, said R. Prabhu, founder, Tiruvallur District Irular Development Association. Irulas from different parts of Tiruvallur district organised a series of protest meetings near the Tiruvallur Collectorate for the past few months to draw the district administrations attention to these grievances. The protest meetings were preceded by signature campaigns and street corner meetings at Irula settlements in the district. Also, for over two years, community elders had given several petitions to the district administration at public grievances meetings.The Tiruvallur district administration ignored our plight. We decided to boycott this assembly election as voting all these years have not improved our lives, said R. Saravanan, an Irula in Sripathy Nagar of Pakkam village, near Avadi.According to sociologists, Irulas migrated to the city outskirts especially Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts in the early decades of the 20th century. With traditional occupations of snake trapping and wood cutting having been banned, Irulas are now mostly employed as agriculture workers in flower cultivation and loadsmen in rice mills.At present, areas such as Kannimanagar near Kadambathur, Palavakkam and Elapadi near Uthukottai, Narasimangalam and Chatarai near Tiruvallur and Thadaperumbakkam near Gummudipoondi have Irula populations.Most Irulas in the Chennai outskirts migrated from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and worked at brick chambers and rice mills, S.T. Akilan, assistant professor, Department of Sociology, University of Madras (Chepauk campus), said.None of the promises"

Instead of providing protection to the affected people, the police were siding with the caste Hindus , Chinnasamy had complained.Relatives of Chinnasamy assert that he was drowned in the well. There is certainly something fishy about the death since Chinnasamy knew to swim. Moreover, the well had water only to the hip level. How then could Chinnasamy have fallen into the deep well without sustaining any external injury, a relative said. The body of Chinnasamy is expected to be handed over to family members after second autopsy at the Government Hospital, Coimbatore, on Wednesday or Thursday.Dalits in Rice Mill Pudur locality fear that they would be subjected to harassment by the caste Hindus in future. According to Senthamilan, a resident of Rice Mill Pudur colony, the Arundathiyar community also feel intimidated by the police.There are about 125 families dependent on employment in fields owned by the dominant caste Hindus .Organisations working for Dalit welfare complain that the district administration has not responded appropriately to the incident, as per the provisions of The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules 1995.ReliefThe rules mandate the police to provide security to the people and the district magistrate or sub-divisional magistrate to arrange for providing immediate relief in cash or in kind or both to the victims of atrocity, their family members and dependents.

Sitabhog and Mihidana are rice-based sweets from Burdwan.The GI tag is necessary for these items to protect them from cheap imitations.

Millets are not only nutrition rich, but also climate resilient, M.S.Swaminathan.In the past, our food basket was very wide, consisting not only wheat or rice but also a wide variety of millets - what is normally described as coarse cereals.Later, public procurement and distribution tended to be confined to rice and wheat. Thenoon-meal programme in schools also did not include the nutri-millets, he said.I got millets included in the National Food Security Act of 2013, so that there will be both the minimum support price and public procurement. This will help to widen the food basket and insulate farmers from a failure of crops under conditions of low rainfall and moisture stress, Mr. Swaminathan said.Millet farmer and organics promoter Pamayan of Madurai suggested that the government consider supplying coarse cereals through the PDS in cities where awareness levels are higher."
