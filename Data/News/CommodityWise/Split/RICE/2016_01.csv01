58f253fba3d24b68099ac3fa,On an organic food trail in Chennai,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/On-an-organic-food-trail-in-Chennai/articleshow/53810213.cms,2016-08-23,"Famous American author-journalist, Michael Pollan, once said, ""Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognise as food."" But while that would mean giving up on all things junk for this generation of foodies, as it signifies food in its original, unadulterated form. Or what we, with great flourish, call 'organic food'. There were no pesticides, no unwanted chemicals , no MSG, no other additives in the cuisines our grandmothers dished out. Not only that, they loved millets, in all its various, fibrous, nutritious glory. For a while, organic food had come to mean 'upmarket' in the city, but now, with a resurgent love for eating healthy, many restaurants have come up in the city that swear by grandmothers' organic recipes and the ingredients they used.With 28 items, including five starters, three rows of vegetables, sambhar, rasam, curd, mor kuzhambu and red rice, one would think Rajakeeyam, the King's meal at Sanjeevanam is a very heavy meal. But Murugan, the operations head here, says, ""A normal thali will come up to 1,800 calories, but the Rajakeeyam with all the dishes only comes up to 1,024 calories. This is a perfect meal that is not too heavy on your tummy, is nutritious and easily digestible."" The meal follows naturopathy concept and is completely satvik. ""We don't use tamarind, red chillies, refinied items, polished sugar or maida in our food. We have supplements for all of this and our masalas are freshly ground. Our vegetables are grown in our farm and the food is fresh,"" he says. Their millet dosa and upma are big hits with patrons. Murugan adds that their vazhaipoo and corn vadai that are the show-stealers. ""You will not find deep-fried bajjis and bondas here, for snacks; you get sundal, ela ada and kozhukattai. Our food is rich in vitamins, fibre and proteins which is the concept of naturopathy. It is very important to change our lifestyle and avoid junk food. A lot of our health issues will automatically be resolved then,"" he says.Located near the Aranganathan Subway, Tamil Unavagam is a tiny outlet, which offers a variety of dishes at reasonable prices. ""We generally deliver food to corporates for lunch and provide a wholesome meal that includes organic sambar rice, curd rice and poriyal. A lot of office-goers these days prefer millet-based food because it keeps them fit. Everybody has become health-conscious these days,"" says a partner of the place, AK Ravishankar. The common myth about organic food is that it is expensive. Ravishankar agrees and says, ""Demand for organic food is more and the supply is limited, which is why organic food is costly. If all the farmers turn organic, this issue will never arise,"" says Ravishankar. Puttu, keerai dosa and paniyaram are their must-haves. Wash it down with paruthi paal, panakarkandu paal or jigarthanda. Ravishankar also points out that Chennai needs more number of organic restaurants. ""There are hardly 10 restaurants that serve organic and healthy food. Bangalore has several options when compared to Chennai,"" he says. Ravishankar and his team also take cooking classes for women so they can start preparing organic food at home.If you are looking to eat something that is light, healthy and refreshing, then Mahamudra is one place you can head to. Started in 2010, the restaurant is famous for its wheat bisibele bath, akki and ragi roti and wheat payasam. ""A lot of people have forgotten how to make traditional dishes like ragi kanji. We want to serve dishes that our grandmothers used to make on a regular basis. Making millet-based food is easy and is not very time-consuming. The dishes that are usually made with rice batter can also be made with millets, by simply substituting rice with millets. As for the younger generation, I believe that their mindset has to change. They have to start adapting organic food in their lifestyle. One must include ghee, jiggery, and honey in their meal to lead a healthy living,"" shares Meena Thennaapan, who takes care of the quality check in the restaurant. But where do they procure the ingredients from? ""We get a lot of our basics from Coimbatore and we also procure rice and other things from the local market. We try and make the food as natural and organic as possible,"" she says.Prems Graama Bhojanam is a two-year-old restaurant tucked away on the first-floor of an old building. It has a varied customer base, from young foreigners looking for an authentic meal, to the 60-year-old, who is looking for a taste of home-cooked food at a restaurant. The owner of the restaurant, NS Krishnamoorthi, loves being the chatty host. He says, ""It is our lunch meals that pull in most of the crowd. The thali includes the varagu sambar saadam, kuthiraivali rasam saadam, samai thayir saadam, a sweet made from jaggery and millet, karakozhambu with ragi, bajra and millet balls and bottle gourd curry mixed with peanut powder. In fact, our drinking water has edible camphor, tulsi, cardamom and cloves in it, because that is how people used to drink water back then. It has immense health benefits, too."" The restaurant also has a list of tiffin items to choose from like thatte idli, kuzhi paniyaram and benne dosa. Hailing from a small village near Hosur, Krishnamoorthi grew up eating organic food all his life, and wanted to recreate the same experience in Chennai. ""Back in my day, food was not this adulterated. We lived with basics, ate good food and life was not this fast. Today, youngsters earn good money, but are losing their health. Lifestyle and food habits have changed and it starts reflecting on our health after the age of 30. We need to get closer to nature. People these days want bigger papayas and sweeter mangoes, which is why growth-enhancing chemicals are added to the crops. We should embrace what nature gives us. Over the last couple of years, however, youngsters are becoming more conscious of what they eat and want to consume healthy food,"" he says.Ka Unavagam follows the farm-to-farm concept. Anita, one of the partners at the restaurant, explains what that means. ""We procure seeds from a company and give it to the farmers, we then buy the produce from the farmers and the organic waste is returned to the farmers so that they can make manure with it. So we take from the farm and give it back to the farm,"" she says. Opened in April in Besant Nagar, the most popular dish at this joint is their agar agar dessert. ""Going organic is not just about millets and bajra. We produce only organic vegetables and rice. Anything that is produced without the involvement of chemicals is organic. But the issue, these days, is that nothing can be labelled 100 per cent organic. The land is way too polluted and it takes a good six years to get the soil back to its original form. The other advantage with growing organic food is that it improves the ground water. So besides millets and ragi, we also serve the usual white rice, sambar, etc that is organic,"" shares Anita, who is hard to catch during the weekends as the restaurant keeps her busy. But is organic food becoming popular among youngsters? ""People are educated these days. They come back to the restaurant again and again because the food doesn't give them indigestion and is light on their stomachs. I don't see the need for youngsters to have pizza and burger. The superfood that people talk about these days, like chia seeds, and quinoa, is unnecessary. When we have our version of rice flakes and millet flakes, I don't think we need oats,"" points out Anita. Don't miss their ragi kozhukattai, kambu koozh, kombucha and paniyaram that are delicious and a quick bite for those who are on the move. They also have a Chinese section to please the crowd. ""We don't add ajinomoto and our noodles are made out of millets. We need to watch what we eat, only then the next generation will follow our footsteps,"" she says."

This time, popular cartoon characters like Angry Birds, Doraemon and Chhota Bheem have made their way to rakhi shops as well.Compared to previous years, rakhis with attractive designs have flooded the market. ""We used to get a few rakhis with cartoon characters on them, but this time, there's a visible change,"" said Pratap, who runs Santhosh Stores on Sampige Road, Malleswaram.Vedika P, a school student, who wants to buy rakhis for her seven brothers, is spoilt for choice.""Each of them has dif ferent preferences.Every year, it's a struggle to find the best rakhi for each one of them. If one likes silver rakhi, another wants one with rudraksha beads. The youngest brother, who's 10 years old, wants one with a Chhota Bheem picture. If rakhis are grand, grandeur will be the gifts. I just can't compromise on it,"" said Vedika.Mansoor Khan, who sells puja thalis with raw rice and rakhi, said there's good demand for these plates as they can be used even after the festival. ""We have to give orders for the best rakhis available in the market weeks before we start selling thalis. As 90 per cent of them come from Kolkata, we have to be on our toes to get the eye-catching ones based on demand,"" he added.Online portals, too, are cashing in on the festival fervour. With 5-in1 combos and zari or stone works on them, online shopping has been quite an interesting option for people like Juhi Mathur, a resident of Koramangala. ""I always buy rakhis with rudraksha beads on them but the collection I saw on Amazon blew my mind away . I bought a set of two rakhis for both of them. I've also asked them to place an order for a gift for me on the website itself, I hope at least this time I won't get only a box of chocolates,"" she said.BONDING WITH BHABHISRajasthan's famous concept of tying the Lumba rakhi, specially meant for sister-in-laws, is making waves in the city.Lumba rakhi is a traditional custom of the Marwari community, originally from Rajasthan. Lumba in Marwari means bangle, so the thread which can be tied to it is called the Lumba rakhi.Sanjay S, who has an exclusive rakhi stall in Malleswaram, said: ""Girls generally tie the thread on their brothers' wrists but in the Marwari community a lot of spiritual importance is given to bhabhis (sister-in-laws) on Raksha Bandhan day. Since, they are the better halves of the brothers, they too have the responsibility to protect sisters. We also design couple rakhis for the brother and sister-in-law."""

The court has granted a five-day remand to the police for the interrogation. ""The primary interrogation of the 13 accused, including Sunil Rajendran also cleared that they had developed some websites which had some literature that was creating myths in the minds of people who were coming to buy ""radioactive"" material. The website and gang members said that they used to tell that the authenticity of a radioactive substance is judged with the fact that if it pulls rice towards it like a magnet it is radioactive. This claim of the gang is totally wrong in terms of science but people used to believe them,"" said Yogesh Yadav, superintendent of police, Dausa on Wednesday .""The gang members had distributed various jobs among them. There were people who used to first select the soft targets, and then there were guarantors. Now, their clients who used to be more educative used to ask them on how they will verify that the things they are getting are radioactive they used to give the address of websites like ricepuller.com and were creating a myth.

This Onam season, Kochi Times takes you on a tour to its history-laden lanes to witness how a Kerala sari is born.The journey begins in Rajapalayam in Tamil Nadu, from where 100% cotton yarn is brought to Balaramapuram.Bhagavati, a middle-aged woman, is busy readying the yarn which will soon be transformed into a beautiful sari. She says, ""First, the yarn is kept soaked in water for close to 15 hours. It is then dried in the sun for two hours; retaining just a bit of moisture. The yarns are then taken to centres where they are made into threads by winding it around cylindrical tubes, which are then inserted on traditional winding machines."" After this, the threads are taken as bunches for the next process, gumming.Balaramapuram is the only place in the world where the process of gumming is done at a 100 metre length,"" says Satheesh Kumar, Kerala Handloom Protection Forum Secretary. And what is the process for? ""For dyeing. The cotton thread is stretched and pasted with a mixture made of rice and tapioca. This work begins at 4 am and goes on till 10 am. This process gives the thread the off-white colour and the right thickness.""Did you know that a Kerala sari has exactly 4500 threads? ""The weavers count these threads each time, as otherwise the length and breadth of the saris will differ,"" he says.The threads are taken to the weavers. The wooden clatter of their looms once used to be the music of Balaramapuram but sadly, the handloom industry is slowly dying. The weavers use the traditional throw-shuttle pit looms to make the basic texture of saris, in its last stage of production. The finished, woven portions get wrapped on to the wooden frame at the loom's end.The fine golden threads or zari, known as 'kasavu kara' are attached and woven on either sides of the sari at this stage. ""In the past, we used threads made of pure gold. Now, silver threads pasted with gold are used instead,"" says Kannan, a weaver. The kasavu also makes an appearance on the special motifs made on the off-white body of the sari. Most of the designs are inspired from nature and are punched on to the saris using specially made wooden seals.""It takes a day to weave a simple Kerala sari with minimum designs,"" says Satheesh. ""The total time taken to weave depends on the intricacy of the design. There are even saris that take months to finish."" These elegant beauties are unlike other saris as they look identical on both sides of the fabric.""Girls come to us with various intricate designs but the simple, plain Kerala sari is what Malayali women still hold close to their hearts,"" say the weavers.- Natural colours made out of rice and tapioca are used- Best for Kerala's tropical climate (Our ancestors seldom used coloured clothing)- Looks identical on both sides- Made of handloom, not power looms- An original handloom sari will have identical designs on both sides- Its kasavu will have a better glow compared to the fake ones- The kasavu portion will be thicker- The fabric would be softer"

Mangla said the directions to the police were issued in the wake of a number of specific complaints that the biryani vendors were serving beef. After Mewat, sampling will be done in other districts as well.Why just biryani and not any other preparation like mutton curry and kebabs? Mangla believes he has got the logic right. ""Selling beef openly is difficult,"" he says. "" According to the complaints we received, the vendors are mixing a little rice with the meat to camouflage it.""Haryana has one of the most stringent cow slaughter acts in the country with a maximum jail term of 10 years.The police have been told to immediately book vendors if they find beef. ""At the same time, we have also asked the food and drug administration to ensure early reports of tests,"" he said.Former minister and senior Congress leader from Mewat, Aftab Ahmed has termed the move as an attempt by the BJP government to embarrass and humiliate the particular community and a particular district.

Though priority ration card holders expressed their happiness at the scheme, they said they find it difficult to obtain coupons for their monthly ration. Food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department has been making coupon system for foodgrains compulsory across the state.Many beneficiaries of the scheme gathered at Jana Mana, an interactive programme organized by district in-charge minister B Ramanath Rai A beneficiary, Ahmed Bava from Kuppepadavu , opined at the event, ""I am extremely happy that my family of seven members gets 21kg of free rice and 14kg of wheat under the scheme. While the price of one kg of wheat flour is nearly Rs 45 in the market, we get wheat at Rs 3 per kg from fair price shops. However, it is difficult to get coupons for food grains as we have to walk over three kilometres to the gram panchayat.""Another beneficiary Rehana Bajal said the coupon system was introduced in September, even before coupon distribution centres were opened.""Beneficiaries are facing difficulties as they are forced to stand in serpentine queues in front of Mangalore One centres. The government should introduce half-yearly or annual coupons, so that people need not visit distribution centres every month. Coupons should also be made available online,"" she added.The minister said the government will consider issuing half-yearly or annual coupons for food grains through PDS.Milk on all working daysDuring the discussion on Ksheera Bhagya Scheme, children demanded that milk be provided on all the working days instead of thrice a week.Rai said the government has earmarked Rs 5.72 crore for the implementation of Ksheera Bhagya in Dakshina Kannada district.

But it is not just the natives who have been charmed by the beauty of the festival. An enthusiastic bunch of foreigners who are married to Malayali men and settled here vouch for the 10-day extravaganza, and take part in the festivities in full spirits. We talk to a few of these 'foreign bahus' who have adopted a Malayali lifestyle and enjoy being part of the celebrations every year.Wearing a kasavu sari is tricky for new gen Malayali girls themselves, so it's no wonder that the foreign bahus need help with it. ""I have gradually become comfortable wearing the Kerala sari. But I still need help in draping it (laughs). As the material is stiff compared to others, it's easier to handle. But wearing it from morning till evening is still difficult!"" says Josefin Radtke, a German who is married to DJ Akhil G Kakkur from Trivandrum.Josefin also finds the process of making the pookkalams more exciting. ""This will be my fifth Onam with my husband Akhil. It is great to see my in-laws get together at Kozhikode every year. We make the floral patterns together in the morning and it's quite fun.""Evgeniya Tekekut, wife of actor Babu Antony , is originally a Russian. She says that making Onasadya has been one of her favourite memories of Onam. ""I think it was around 2002 that I had a proper Onam celebration, at Babu's home in Ponkunnam. My best memories are of preparing the sadya with his mom. I was surprised to discover the traditional style of sitting on the floor and eating from a leaf! I had never imagined such a possibility even in my wildest dreams. I too prepare moru kachiyathu, sambar, rice and parippu curry in traditional Kerala style. My favourite Onam dish, however, is ada pradhaman."" Interestingly, her sons too love the custom of sitting on the floor and having sadya, says Evgeniya.She adds, ""We lived in India for nine years and left after Babu's mom passed away. I haven't been able to enjoy Onam time as much before. However, this year, we will be joining a Malayali association in Austin, US, to celebrate Onam.""French Bharatanatyam dancer and actress Paris Laxmi, who is married to Kathakali artiste Pallipuram Sunil, tried her hand at making a sadya once and is now in awe of all those who prepare it year after year. ""Making all those dishes on the same day at one go is quite a challenging task. Everyone from abroad is in awe of the culinary expertise of Malayali women,"" she says.For French native Amelie Weigel , former director of a French Cultural Centre in Trivandrum, and wife of Sukumaran Mani, a native of Trivandrum, the best part of the sadya is eating it by hand. She says, ""I like the sadya by itself! You can test so many different preparations in the same meal. And the best part is that you can eat with your hand mixing everything together. That's something unique! My son and my husband are just addicted to payasam. It is their favourite delicacy."" As for Josefin, though she does not eat much of rice usually, she enjoys eating every bit of the Onasadya on Thiruvonam day.Euginea Cano, a Mexican mime artiste, has been residing in Kerala for a while now. And what struck her about Onam is its striking resemblance to a festival they celebrate back home  Christmas. She says, ""Both are about spreading happiness; only that while it is all about lights for Christmas, Onam is more about flowers."" Like for Christmas, it's the season where entire families get together from the farthest corners of the world, feels Amelie, also a mother of two. ""The festival entwines people and cuts across age groups and religions, making it a truly secular festival. The energy imparted by the interesting competitions is infectious. It is a wonderful sight to see everyone celebrating together, be it in schools or offices, wearing beautiful saris, singing Onam songs together and eating sadya,"" she says.Laxmi is also a big fan of pookkalams. ""I love walking the streets early in the morning and admiring the pookkalams before each house!"" she says. Laxmi recalls that she was only five years old when her family first came to India, and since then they have been coming every year during the holidays. ""The excitement and joy in the air when the families come together is palpable. Everyone wants to get close to their loved ones during Onam and celebrate together."""

Tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan and backward and minorities welfare minister S Valarmathi participated in the function.People consider the function to be an essential one to ensure normal delivery of baby, as the ritual is said to relieve stress through the clinking sound of bangles. A set of healthy diet is to be followed by pregnant women to ensure a healthy baby.""Doctors are advising to wear bangles and we are following it. We take good things from any religion,"" said a Muslim woman attending the function.Valaikappu is held on the seventh or the ninth month of pregnancy, especially among Hindus. But as many families could not afford to hold the function, the state government kick-started the programme in 2013-14.In Trichy, 12, 227 pregnant women were covered under the antenatal mother care programme in 1,828 Anganwadi centres through Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), said project officer of ICDS T Bhuvaneswari.A total of 4,320 pregnant women will benefit from the Valaikappu function in 108 places in the district, she said.A healthy woman'shaemoglobin count should 14 and should not fall below 10. Unfortunately, mothers from rural parts have only 5 to 6 haemoglobin count. Pregnant women in rural areas should visit doctors at Primary Health Centres (PHC) from where they should be referred to tertiary care centres.Women who attended the ceremony on Sunday were provided five varieties of food - sweet pongal, coconut rice, tamarind rice, lemon rice and curd rice. They were advised to take such healthy food till delivery.The reluctance of adolescent girls and antenatal mothers to consume folic acid and iron tablets supplied by the state government also affect their health severely at the time of pregnancy. Not only the low age but also the higher age of mother (above 35 years) is also a factor for low-birth babies in addition to health complications of mother which also causes underweight."

The investigation was ordered by vigilance director Jacob Thomas. The investigation team will be led by DySP Firoz M Sheikh. The probe will be akin to reseach analysis, said VACB sources.""The investigation will be a Benefit Tracking Audit (BT audit). The method is more like a research study,"" said a VACB officer.The probe will look into projects of all major departments mentioned in any of the complaint received by VACB. The officials will look into at least three projects of the offices in Attapadi of all these departments. All departments under investigation are meant to be functioning for the welfare of tribals. More than 190 colonies exist at Attapady. There are also more than 28 department there engaged in the welfare of tribals.The vigilance have conducted more than 35 probes in the Attapady block since 1998. If a tribal family is getting Rs 1,000 as fund allocation then the government has to spent at least Rs 2,500. A sack of 150 kg rice will feed 250 people as per the calculation of 5 people per kg, but only 100 people are being fed with one sack of rice in Attapady, said vigilance sources.In the last three years alone, 595 infants died in this tribal block. Following a series of infant deaths, the state government announced a Rs 400 crore package two years ago. But this has not yielded the desired effect as pregnant women are not getting adequate medical care. ""Most state government initiatives are in limbo, be it the community kitchen, sanitation or improving anganwadis.

They also ate a lot more variety of wild meat as against the broiler chicken, which has become standard fare now.No accessToday, we dont have access to many of these items, as we have been cut off from the forests, and that is affecting the health of young children, said one grandmother.These revelations were part of a survey conducted by a team of researchers at Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, who recorded the weight and height of 5,344 students in classes one to five in government primary schools in the three districts.They found that children below the normal range of body mass index varied from about 29 per cent in Yadgir to about 31 per cent in the tribal block of H.D.

While economic levels are a factor, the researchers second what the grandmothers feel: changes in dietary patterns could be contributing to malnutrition.Link to malnutritionThere is a need to look at the contribution of changing food culture to malnutrition. For instance, families have stopped eating millets because cultivation has reduced, and rice has become the staple food because of easy availability, said professor Shreelata Rao Seshadri, who anchors the Health, Development and Society Initiative at Azim Premji University.Research coordinator Suraj Parab told The Hindu that for many members from tribal communities in Yadgir and H.D.

Malarvizhi and Superintendent of Police Ziaul Haque, seeking their intervention, after failing to resolve the issue in a peace committee meeting chaired by the Tahsildar on July 4 .The Dalits alleged that they were not allowed to contribute (Rs. 1,300 per family) for the festival and denied permission to take part in some important events such as mulaipaari eduththal (taking sprouts or germination of nine grains in pots), the major event in the 10-day long festival, which begins on August 2. We are prevented from preparation or serving food during annadhanam and from performing oyilattam and kummi (folk dances) at the festival, R Karuppasamy, who had been fighting for the rights of Dalits, said.Dalits could offer worship but could not light camphor in a plate or directly garland the trishul. We are also prevented from directly taking thiruneer (sacred ash) from anywhere at the sanctum, he said. The height of discrimination is that we should not go anywhere near the place where annadhanam is prepared, he told The Hindu . Only the caste Hindus could prepare and serve it. Dalits who wanted to offer annadhanam could donate only the money. We cannot even buy rice and grocery items for it, he said.After fighting for the rights for several years, only recently we were allowed to take part in fire walking, carry theechatti (fire pot ceremony) and perform angapradikshanam, he said.Siranjeevi, who represented caste Hindus in the peace committee meeting, asserted that they could not deviate from the existing practice lest they would earn the wrath of the Goddess.The local unit of Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front and Communist Party of India (Marxist) have decided to stage a demonstration, in protest against the alleged discrimination on July 28.When contacted, Collector S. Malarvizhi said that the issue was pending before the court with caste Hindus seeking a direction to allow them to celebrate the festival by following the conventional system.

There is no change in the rates for these two categories, the Central government official clarified.Ever prior to the enactment of the NFSA in 2013, the State government has been expressing reservations regarding various provisions of the Act. The principal objection of the State is that only 50.55 per cent of the population will get covered under the law.We are for universal public distribution system. We are following the policy of food security for all. As of now, there is no change in this position, R. Kamaraj, State Food Minister, told The Hindu on Friday evening.No to extra allocationApart from increasing the price, the Centre has decided not to provide additional allocation of rice to the State. Every month, around 24,000 tonnes are being made available and the price comes to Rs. 22 per kg.If the State were to get this quantity from the open market, the rate will be at least Rs. 30 per kg.Also, the price of wheat for the APL category of card holders has been increased from Rs. 6.1 per kg to Rs. 15.25 per kg.The Central government official added that only Tamil Nadu and Kerala are not following the NFSA. Recently, Kerala told the Centre that it would implement the Act soon."

Photo: VAIDYAMinister for Agriculture Krishna Byre Gowda has called upon agriculture scientists to educate the farmers in Malnad region about cultivating paddy in an economically viable manner by adopting scientific practices.He was speaking after inaugurating Krishi Mela, a four-day agriculture expo at the University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS) campus, Shivamogga on Friday.Mr. Byre Gowda said that paddy was the main crop in Malnad earlier and this was why the region was known as the rice bowl of Karnataka. Paddy is cultivated using the traditional rain-fed method in Malnad region. Owing to a decline in profit in cultivating paddy, farmers here are switching to commercial crops. The decline in area of cultivation of paddy will pose a threat for the food security of the nation, he said.Agriculture scientists should provide farmers with paddy varieties that are suitable to the climate of Malnad. Farmers should be trained on mechanised transplantation of paddy saplings, removal of weeds and harvesting. The mechanisation of agricultural operations would help the farmers save expenses incurred by labour. By adopting these measures it is possible to earn lucrative returns from paddy cultivation, he said.Mr. Gowda said that in the wake of the drought prevailing in the State for the second consecutive year, it had become necessary to re-contemplate the utilisation of water for cultivation of paddy. Less water-intensive practices such as System of Rice Intensification (SRI) should be promoted, he said."

She wanted to study hard and do well, he said, tears running down his cheeks.Hospital authorities said the post-mortem examinations of three bodies would only take place on Friday. Of the four others injured in the accident, q young woman, Jayshree, has been admitted to hospital. She had multiple bruises and a suspected abdominal injury.

Vijayalakshmi, principal, Chellamal College for Women, talked about the issues students face in getting to college. Our children have to get down either at Guindy Bus Stand or Little Mount, she said.

An exhibition displaying recent and popular sugarcane varieties, farm machines, drip irrigation technologies and a bio-acoustic device to ward off wild boars was also organised, according to a release from Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Sugars.Inaugurating the meet, A. Ramamourti, Director of Agriculture, Puducherry, said farmers were losing interest in raising sugarcane owing to drought, shortage of labour, incidence of pest and diseases and high cost of cultivation. Research institutes, in collaboration with sugar factories, should identify reasons for low yield and declining sugar recovery in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Introducing short-duration varieties, encouraging community farming and custom hiring of machineries, including harvesters, could improve and sustain sugarcane productivity, he said.Bakshi Ram, Director of ICAR-SBI, said sugarcane yield and sugar production in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry remained low owing to adverse climatic conditions and water shortage. There had been a marginal improvement this season.Chenthil Rajan, Managing Director, Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Sugars, said sugarcane yield had not improved significantly in the past 40 years unlike rice and other crops.P.

Mustafah: Despite tall claims by the State government that it had ensured targeted intervention in tribal belts of Attappady to fight poverty and undernourishment, infant and neonatal deaths continue to stalk the region where multi-crore welfare schemes have failed to reach out to pregnant and lactating mothers and children.Five-month-old Prayaga of Sholayur tribal hamlet died on Saturday of underweight-related complications and heart ailments at the Government Medical College in Thrissur. The child was referred to Thrissur by Government Tribal Super Specialty Hospital at Kottathara three days ago as there were no specialst doctors there. Two weeks ago, 12-year-old R. Manikandan of Swarnapirivu tribal colony died of anaemia. Health Department officials confirmed that anaemia and malnutrition still existed in the tribal belt and there was no age barrier in this case. Health workers have already prepared a list of over 3,000 anaemic tribal children requiring immediate attention in the region. Prayaga was the sixth among infant deaths reported in Attappady since January this year.Figures with the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) and the Tribal Speciality Hospital say at least 10 cases of neonatal deaths were reported here since January this year. There were at least nine near-term intrauterine deaths and a minimum of 23 recorded cases of spontaneous abortion since January.Most of the malnutrition and infant mortality cases have been reported from remote areas of Pattimalam, Vellakulam, Nellipathi, Kottamala, Kavundikkal, Palur, Vattalakki, Kallakkara, Thoova, Upper Manjikandi, Lower Abbanur, Kolappadi, Chavadiyur, Upper Mulli, Veerakallu and Bhoothivazhi.Going by the 2011 census, Attappadys tribal population has dwindled from 90.26 per cent in 1951 to a bare 34 per cent of the areas total population now. In absolute terms, there are only 30,658 tribespeople in the 192 hamlets of Attappady now. Three years ago, the Central and State governments had launched no less than Rs.500 crore worth of schemes for them, but that does not appeared to have reached the tribespeople in any life-altering ways.Last week, Health Minister K.K. Shailaja had visited Attappady and promised steps to revitalise all defunct community kitchens, which offer at least one nutritious meal a day to children and pregnant and lactating mothers. Each community kitchen requires provisions like milk, eggs, pulses, millets and quality rice to bridge nutrition deficiencies. But in practice, only rice and one variety of pulse reach most of these community kitchens. Besides, the anganwadi workers who are in charge of the community kitchens are now being given additional responsibilities and are not able to concentrate much on nutrition-related challenges, said an official in ITDP."

The previous LDF government headed by him initiated strong measures to directly procure rice from other States to sell it through the PDS at a controlled price of Rs.14 a kg. Then the price of rice in the open market was Rs.42 a kg.If the LDF came back to power, it would sell essential products at controlled prices, he said.At the function, Mr. Achuthanandan released the development document of the Dharmadam constituency published by the LDF."

But, it will be done soon, she added. Recording details will be useful for many purposes as consumers could ensure availability of ration products for them; prevent purchase by others using fake family cards and help taluk supply officers monitor the sale.

They claimed that Pusa 1509 basmati paddy should be milled and its grain should be delivered to the Union government's central pool.The state government's procurement agency Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation (Markfed) has floated tenders to sell 1.88 lakh tonnes of Pusa 1509 basmati paddy. At the prevailing market price, the state government expects to raise nearly Rs 400 crore by selling the unmilled grain. Tenders have been called for April 22 and financial bids will be opened on April 25.Rice millers have decided to move the court against tenders on Monday and alleged that government was for the welfare of farmers not to act as a trader. To support farmers, Punjab government had purchased Pusa 1509 basmati paddy at Rs 1,450 per quintal  the minimum support price (MSP) for Grade A common paddy  as the rates of the long-grained commodity had dropped drastically. Before the government had entered the market, it was being sold for as low as Rs 1,000 per quintal due to which farmers protested saying they were suffering losses.Punjab Basmati Rice Millers Association general secretary Ashish Kathuria and legal cell head Ashok Aggarwal said, ""The state government had purchased Pusa 1509 basmati paddy at the MSP of Rs 1,450 per quintal when its rates were low to support the farmers and millers. Government was meant to deliver rice to central pool after custom milling. The government should not act as a trader for calling tenders to sell grain since due to its act, the farmers and millers might have to face losses as prices may not increase in the coming season. We have prepared a petition and will file it in Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday.""Kathuria alleged acting as a nodal agency, Markfed had decided to sell Pusa 1509 basmati paddy on behalf of three state-run agencies and tried to wipe out small players from the selling process as it had fixed minimum quantity at 600 tonnes. ""The paddy though was purchased at Rs 1,450 per quintal but by adding storage, transportation, various types of taxes, paddy costs the agencies nearly Rs 2,100 per quintal.""When contacted, Markfed general manager (procurement) H S Bains said, ""The state government is not acting illegally. The Centre has de-listed paddy and has allowed the state government to sell it in the open market."" He said that last time, tenders were floated in March at Rs 2,066 per quintal but nobody turned up so no reserve price has been fixed and purchaser has been asked to quote the price. As for quota of minimum 600 tonnes, he said that the state had to sell 1.88 lakh tonnes and the target could be achieved by fixing the minimum limit."

The Act aims at providing food grain at a subsidized rate to the people of the country who are categorized under the Antyodya households and priority households as part of the Antyodya Anna Yojana.While priority households are entitled to 5kg of food grain per person per month, Antyodya households are sanctioned 35kg per household per month.The Centre has allocated 11, 796 metric ton of rice for implementation of the Act from April and the state has already provided Rs30 crore in the 2016-17 fiscal as the state's share for implementing it. While launching the Act, the CM urged the people to extend support for its successful implementation. Cautioning the stakeholders to work sincerely, he said the state officials concerned should thoroughly monitor the process to curb misuse of the scheme. The defaulters would be punished following appropriate provisions of the Act.Deputy CM Gaikhangam said the state had created history by launching a scheme that was put forth by the then UPA government in 2013 for the citizens of the nation."

Suddenly, a news flashed on the screen: ""Madan Mitra parajito"" (Madan Mitra defeated).Madan covered his face and a stony silence swept the room. Mitra, who expected to win from Kamarhati, knew that his political career was at crossroads.A close aide of Mitra opened the door and murmured ""they sabotaged"". Before the aide could explain, Mitra said, ""I lost because of some councillors."" Mitra had reports that at least two of his key campaigners were seen with a CPM leaders before the polls. But being confined to the hospital made him powerless and he could hardly do anything.Few days before his constituency went to polls, Mitra told one of his aide that this year he needs to win in order protect his family. ""In politics when you are out of power, people don't come to rescue when your house is on fire. This time I have to protect my family,"" Mitra had reportedly told the aide. The aide who stood outside his cabin in SSKM on Thursday said, ""It will be tough for him now. Especially when the party has performed so well this time.""Mitra's wife Archana, who has been inside the cabin since morning, tried to break his silence. She requested Mitra to have some food. For the past few days, Mitra was having problems with digestion. Silently he pulled the rice plate towards him and started eating. Madan's enthusiasts and supporters from Kamarhati were missing sisnce morning. The few who were waiting outside the hospital could not muster courage to meet him.Just then, Madan's son swung open the cabin door and his elder son Swarup came inside with the new-born baby. ""Abar notun kore suru korte habe. Rajnitite kichhui sesh hayna"" (We start afresh. Nothing ends in politics),"" added Mitra, the moment he saw his son. But for Madan, starting afresh will not be easy given his heath conditions.Although Manas Mukherjee managed to snatch the seat from Mitra, Left Front's overall performance had stymied the joyous mood. ""People have not accepted someone who siphoned off money from Saradha,"" added Mukherjee. TMC supporters, however, were happy with the party's performance but Mitra's defeat had saddened them.For the handful of loyalists gathered downstairs the only silver lining is the belief that he will be released on bail. ""He is no longer an MLA now. There is no way he can influence the Saradha enquiry,"" a loyalist said. Mitra is due to appear at the Alipore Court on May 31."

Speaking to The Hindu , Malkangiri District Collector K. Sudarshan Chakravarthy confirmed that 15 children had died of JE till Tuesday morning. As per reports, another four-year-old child Nandu Kawasi, of Dangasakhala village, with symptoms of encephalitis died during treatment on Tuesday, taking the toll to 16.All the victims were in two to eight years age group.All deaths and most cases of the disease have been reported from Kalimela, Korkunda and Pandiripani blocks of the district. Blood samples of 31 ailing children from Malkangiri district had been sent for tests to the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar. According to Mr Chakravarthy, 15 of these samples have been found to be positive of JE causing virus. We are trying to do our best with available resources to check the transmission of the disease caused by mosquitoes, he said.Fifteen remote villages where incidence of this disease is the maximum have been identified and remedial measures are being taken. Children with symptoms of the disease are being referred to Malkangiri district hospital for treatment. An expert team from MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur reached Malkangiri district on Monday to take stock of the situation. This four-member team visited affected areas on Tuesday.To stop the spread of JE, an awareness drive as well as measures to curb mosquito menace has been started in all rural areas of the district. In most prone areas fogging is being done to destroy the vector of the disease, mosquitoes. This is a viral disease with no cure. So the emphasis is on vector eradication. The pathogenic virus of Japanese Encephalitis is transmitted by Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui mosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed mainly in flooded rice fields. Bodies of pigs are major breeding points for this pathogenic virus. These factors are prevalent in remote rural areas of Malkangiri district. So, areas with high domestication of pigs are under strict vigil of medical authorities.In 2012, around 30 children had allegedly died due to Japanese Encephalitis in this district. Some cases of the disease were also reported from the district in 2013. In 2014, ten children were suspected to have died due to it in Malkangiri district."

The Kulsumpura Masjid has been spruced up with fresh coat of lime green colour on the arch for the holy month of Ramzan, the beginning of which will be announced by Ruhal-e-Hilal committee anytime tomorrow. It is likely that the first day of Ramzan fast will be on Tuesday as the committee would announce the sighting of the moon followed by evening prayers marking the beginning of the month of fasting, said an official of Mecca Masjid.The massive wazoo (tank for ritual ablution) of Mecca Masjid has been cleaned up by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board and some broken tiles have been replaced. It should be dry by morning and it will take 24 hours to fill the whole tank, said the official.Night shoppingRamzan, which spells night shopping near Charminar for many people in Hyderabad, will have to wait this year as the road pedestrianisation project has left a huge stretch of road unusable. Even with one-way traffic being directed towards Sardar Mahal, Panjeshah Road and Gulzar Houz it was chaos in and around Charminar. This work has been going on for one month. We hope to finish this in the next one week. Other part of the work will be taken up later, said the work supervisor at the site.Work on the 130 metres by 4.5 metres stretch has disrupted tourist shopping as well. The stones that are being used for laying the pedestrian path are much bigger than the ones laid in the earlier round of Charminar Pedestrianisation Project near Sardar Mahal and towards Gulzar Houz.Incidentally, Ramzan shopping is one of the biggest events in the Old City calendar where thousands of people invest in mobile shops ranging from pushcarts to small vendors who peddle foodstuffs in the evening.This year, the GHMC officials are focussing on the hygiene as well as the safety aspect. But while some restaurant owners are already selling haleem, which is now a one of the few food items with geographical indication status, other restaurant owners are yet to announce their prices. We will announce the price on Tuesday, the first day of Ramzan fasting, said an employee at one of the biggest outlets for haleem in the old city.The State government has issued a circular allowing all government employees belonging to Muslim faith, including teachers and out-sourced employees working in government offices to leave their work places by 4 p.m. on working days during the Ramzan tentatively till July 5 to perform necessary rituals."

Late at night, when his parents are asleep, as an adolescent boy admires a picture of Misty Mountains, Los Angeles former favourite porn star, lasciviously posing in a car, a real car comes crashing down the terrace of the house. The boy goes outside to find the other casualty of the accident  a car that looks similar to the one in the picture. And in it, lies Misty Mountains, dead and naked. He takes off his jacket to cover the body of the woman he had been fantasising about a few minutes ago.The scene is a hark back to several Hollywood noir classics set in LA. The deceitful world hiding government corruption with a private eye in hot pursuit as in Chinatown, the mysterious disappearance of Hollywood-hopeful starlet from Mulholland Drive, the inner circles of the porn industry as in Boogie Nights. Deliberately or not, it also has two important cast members from LA Confidential that was based on the citys dark underbelly in  Russell Crowe and Kim Bassinger.The Nice Guys is a comedy but not a dark one. For one, it doesnt take itself too seriously. The film by Shane Black is completely comfortable in being a light, fun film. Even though the humour is silly, there is drollness in it. And with a handful of characters solidly etched, we also have decent drama. Holland (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to investigate the dead porn star  Misty Mountains. It leads him to encounter Jackson (Russell Crowe), another private eye on the case, but with less reputable credentials. They dont really get along very well. They are never on the same page. Yet, there is a brotherhood, an understanding that they need to watch each others back. Meanwhile, Jackson also develops a fondness for Hollands daughter and vice versa. Together, their quest to find the truth about the murder becomes an LA adventure through private poolside parties, hotels and hilly driveways. The film is set in late 70s and the period gives the film a warm, retro, fluid texture.But more than anything else, The Nice Guys works because the chemistry between its actors is crackling. Gosling shows great comic timing as the low-on-confidence single father, Crowes perfect as the ageing officer who has his own way of doing things. Angouri Rice as Goslings good-hearted and courageous daughter adds to the buddy-movie fun. The familiarity of where the story is heading stops it from being a piece of its kind. None of the twists really have the shock but the action has a whimsical quality about it.The Nice Guys is a nice-ish film that doesnt try too hard. And that is a relief.SANKHAYAN GHOSH"

Photo: Special Arrangement: Three months have gone since S. Ranganathan, a long-standing farmer of Mannargudi, visited Beijing and Shanghai to study agricultural practices and systems in that part of China. He is yet to get over his excitement of having seen a wonderland.In a five-hour-long train journey between the two Chinese cities over a distance of 1,500 km, the farmer noticed not only high-rise buildings, normally found in and around any major urban centre, but also extensive wheat crops.Mechanised farmingNeither human life nor any cattle was visible anywhere. It looked to him that the entire planting of wheat crop must be by mechanical methods, without manual operations and naturally, harvesting must also be by machines. I saw miles and miles of standing crops, which cannot be either planted or harvested manually, he recollects.Mr. Ranganathans admiration for China does not end there. His visit to Beijings Ecology Science Popularisation Park was quite revealing.Equating it with a rural development community or a commune, he says the Park consists of a housing colony and developed plots for an integrated farming covering animal husbandry, fishery, mini-forestry, horticulture and arrangements for full-fledged crop planning for paddy, wheat, sugarcane, and pulses besides having bio-gas power plants for self-consumption and other needs of the community.The veteran Mannargudi farmer was one among 20 farmers from different parts of the State who went to China in May, as part of an initiative taken by the Tamil Nadu government to arrange exposure visits to four countries. His regret was that he could not get to discuss various issues with farmers or agricultural scientists of China. A private firms representatives had briefed his team.V. Sathyanarayanan, another farmer hailing from Seruvamamani, near Tiruvarur, and nine other farmers interacted with scientists at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila. For him, the IRRIs lack of emphasis on the System of Rice Intensification, a method being promoted by the authorities in India for better paddy cultivation, was a surprise. Besides, contrary to the advice rendered to farmers frequently in India, farmers in Philippines do not follow the rotation of crop or provide a considerable gap of time between two crops. They seem to be adopting paddy cultivation throughout the year, without adverse effects.Two other groups of farmers went to Thailand and Israel.Adept in marketingC. Chandrasekaran from Palayamkottai, who went to the south-east Asian country, says that even though there does not seem to be extensive farming or very high degree of state support, Thai agriculturists are apparently adept in marketing their produce, a quality which is missing in Indian farmers.They are skillful in doing value addition to what they produce and package them suitably for international market, he says."

He gets paid only Rs. 350 for each saree by a master weaver. His sons did not find this expertise useful and instead went out in search of better pastures.To make ends meet, Muttaiah continues to do his job, as he can do nothing at the age of 65.

Officials also withdrew his antyodaya card recently, denying him the benefit of receiving 35 kg rice a month.There once used to be around 2,000 expert weavers of Gollabhama sarees. Now that number has reduced to not more than two dozen, says Tumma Tulasiram, a master weaver.

Selvam said that there were 22,292 traditional native paddy strains in the country till some decades back. Almost all of them have been lost due to deplorable chemical farming practices. In our quest for feeding the burgeoning population through increasing productivity, we have lost the wonderful native paddy strains forever. Instead of enriching the soil, it would be better if farmers save the soil fertility than trying to increase productivity.Natural farming expert Dr. Uma Maheswari of Karaikal said that more diseases were caused by food due to excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides during the cultivation stage.Use of organically produced rice and vegetables could play a vital role in ensuring a stress-free life.Nutrition and dietetics expert M.

Rajamanickam had declared that 500 acres of pokkali fields would be brought under cultivation this season in Chellanam panchayat. However, nothing had been done to implement the declaration. The Samithi described as a farce a notice issued to a group of pokkali land owners by the Fort Kochi Revenue Divisional Office (RDO). The Samithi alleged that the official machinery was not implementing the regulations in existence to protect pokkali farming.The statement also said shrimp farming in pokkali fields should end by April 15 every year and salt water should be pumped and fields allowed to dry. The sowing operations begin in June. The pokkali variety does not require any artificial fertiliser and can resist salt content in the waters and are ready for harvest between 90 and 110 days. These qualities have earned the rice variety a place in the GI registry.However, pokkali fields have fallen into the hands of the shrimp farming lobby, which seeks to maximize profit by not allowing pokkali cultivation so that there is shrimp farming throughout the year, the Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi has alleged. The Samithi members have also said that the end of pokkali farming would cause serious environmental damage. If paddy cultivation in these fields is abandoned, the fields would gradually be reclaimed for commercial purposes.Action council alleges that pokkali fields have fallen into the hands of the shrimp farming lobby."
58f495baa3d24b68099aef5d,Can the Aam Aadmi Party win Punjab?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Can-the-Aam-Aadmi-Party-win-Punjab/article14468549.ece,2016-07-02,"Pre-monsoon rains bring some relief in the June heat as farmers sow paddy in the fields. The fields gradually give way to the bustling, noisy Sirhindi gate in Malerkotla. The only Muslim-majority town in Punjab, which remained untouched by violence even during the dark days of Partition, convulsed in anger on the night of June 24 after torn pages of the Koran were recovered outside a cemetery. Vehicles were torched and a few people, including local policemen, were injured. Elsewhere in Punjab, pages from the Bhagwad Gita were found strewn on the street in Ludhiana in November last year; a month prior to it, the Guru Granth Sahib was mutilated in many towns of the State.Taheed Mohammad, a fruit-and-vegetable vendor in Malerkotla, lays the blame squarely on politicians for such mischievous acts intended at diverting attention from the real issues ahead of the Assembly elections in the State some months from now. Im not going to vote this time. Its a sheer waste of time and effort. They [political parties] are all the same. After grabbing power, they are least bothered about our problems, says Mr. Mohammad, in a rush to sell his wares so that he could be home in time to break his roza (fast).Many in the Malerkotla market share Mr. Mohammads cynicism, of the sameness of Akali and Congress rule. So, it is not without reason that there is guarded optimism about the new party on the block, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which made a spectacular debut in the State by grabbing four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general election. As it bids to make a winning debut in the Punjab Assembly next, the AAP is making a lot of noise here. Posters of a recent CVoter survey predicting an AAP victory are plastered all over town in Malerkotla. We want better roads, regular water supply and jobs for youth, and if AAP assures us of these, we might consider supporting it, says Mohammad Shamshad Hazi, a local barber across the street, as customers waiting in line for a snip nod in agreement.The third playerAs battle lines get drawn in Punjab between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine and the Opposition Congress for the 117 Assembly seats in early 2017, theres a third player on the horizon seeking to tap into bipolar anti-incumbency  the AAP  turning it into a three-way contest.The ruling Akali-BJP government, in power for over nine years, is battling a deep agrarian crisis, which has led to indebtedness experts peg at roughly Rs.60,000 crore, with 20 farmers committing suicide every month on average. The rampant drug menace in the State has only added to its bag of woes. With inter-sectarian fights between religious groups to boot, many are taking a dim view of the stranglehold of the Badal family  Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and Deputy-Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal  on the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (that manages all gurdwaras in the State) and State politics at large.The AAP, which is pitching itself as the alternative to the Akalis and the Congress, is preparing its cadre at the grass-roots level harping on anti-incumbency. We present an honest alternative. We will get support from all sections, specially those [aged] between 18 and 40 years which will be the deciding factor in these elections, says Sanjay Singh, in charge of Punjab affairs for AAP, adding that the party will focus on the agrarian debt, the drug mafia, the transport mafia and the sand mafia which he alleges enjoys the patronage of Akali leaders.It is easier said than done, though. Says Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute for Development and Communication, Chandigarh, The ruling party is under pressure this time on these issues but I doubt whether this will work to AAPs advantage as it is unable to address the complexities of Punjab politics. The AAP does not have a historical baggage, but neither does it have historical advantage.For starters, finding a leader with mass appeal across the State and deciding on candidates have proved to be the biggest challenges the party is grappling with. Insiders say Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, State convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur and senior leader H.S. Phoolka are the top chief ministerial contenders but as Dalit writer Desraj Kali points out, the party does not have a local mass leader who can pose a challenge to heavyweights such as Parkash Singh Badal and Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh. In fact, the CVoter survey in April that predicted a win for AAP had Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as its chief ministerial party face for Punjab!The campaign constituenciesThe AAPs campaign is primarily endeavouring to tap into the unrest and anxieties of farmers, youth, women and marginalised sections such as the Dalits. Borrowing a leaf out of its successful Delhi playbook, it is leveraging bands of volunteers in every Assembly constituency at the booth level. In Ludhiana zone alone, the party has 10,000 active volunteers on its rolls. All AAP wings  those for farmers, industry & traders, youth, women, ex-servicemen and Dalits  have team heads in place for outreach activities. Within one week of the Parivar Jodo campaign in February, we had connected with over seven lakh people, claims senior AAP leader Kanwar Sandhu.Dalits account for nearly 32 per cent of the population in Punjab, the highest percentage among States, and it is in the Doaba belt  Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Nawanshahr districts  that they are in large numbers. The district is also known as the NRI hub of Punjab due to the significant numbers migrating overseas. Hence, all parties, including the AAP, are courting the Dalit and NRI vote in this belt. Mr. Sandhu claims the party is getting huge support from this unexpected quarter [NRIs]. The Doaba belt has had support for the Bahujan Samaj Party in recent years, but could rally behind the Congress this time unless the AAP has a clear programme for Dalits, says Gurmeet Singh, a senior Jalandhar-based political commentator.The party is also focussing on women and youth by linking issues such as drug addiction to the two demographics. Drugs and liquor have ruined the lives of my husband and son. I have tried to get my son treated at de-addiction centres, but all efforts failed. Its the [drug] supply chain that has to be cut. No NGO has approached us, but an AAP volunteer of the village made a commitment to me to help out, says Baldish Kaur of Diwali village in Jalandhar. With the youth constituting more than 30 per cent of the States population, Mr. Kejriwal, the partys national convenor, will release a Youth Manifesto for the Punjab polls in Amritsar on July 3. But manifesto apart, there is a lot of work ahead if one goes by what Vineet Bajaj, a BTech final-year student of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, has to say: I dont think AAP will be able to make a huge difference in Punjab as they are not performing well in Delhi. However, people are fed up of Akali-BJP rule, while the Congress is marred by infighting. So AAP has the chance to grab a few seats.The agrarian crisis has given the AAP the opportunity to tap into farmer resentment. In Dhudike village of Moga district, consistently lower prices for the produce against rising prices of farm inputs have pushed farmers into a debt trap. We have been suffering losses year after year but the government hardly pays adequate compensation. Last year in April, my wheat crop failed due to unseasonal rains and while I was lucky that my rice variety fetched a decent return during the last kharif season, many farmers in the neighbouring villages suffered huge losses as prices of basmati rice crashed, says Nirbhay Singh, who owns 14 acres and has mortgaged three acres with Rs.20 lakh still to be repaid to local moneylenders and a bank. Mr. Singh feels that a new government at the helm may just be what it takes for his fortunes to change  a sentiment shared by fellow farmer Balwinder Singh, though he hints that he is still undecided between the AAP and Congress.The challengers challengesThe AAPs first list of candidates will be out in mid-July or July-end, followed by lists every fortnight. The campaign will go full steam in October. Our message to the voter is that you have seen them all  they are all the same. Try us this time, says Mr. Sandhu.But the message has been foreshadowed by mutiny in the AAP ranks. Two of its MPs, Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa, had their primary party membership suspended in August last year after raising their voice against what they termed as Mr. Kejriwals autocratic style of functioning.If AAP plays its cards well, it still has a chance. But if people of dubious character from other parties are enrolled, it leads to the perception that AAP is not a party with a difference... and this is exactly what is happening, says Dr. Gandhi, adding, The Punjab unit of the party is being controlled directly from Delhi like a colony.The way old dedicated volunteers are being marginalised by Delhi and Punjab leaders, many would leave as I did, says Harmeet Kaur, who has now joined the Swaraj Party, the rebel group of AAP floated in May by Manjeet Singh which is backed by the Swaraj Abhiyan of former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.The Punjab Congress unit, which fancies its chances after the long spell of Akali rule, considers the AAP to have already peaked during 2014 parliamentary elections. In 2014, the AAP got the advantage of double-disillusionment in Punjab  the nationwide disillusionment after 10 years of Congress rule at the Centre and a strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Akali-BJP combine in Punjab, says Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh.The AAP peaked then but its progressive decline started soon after. Today the party is not in a position to win even a single seat in Punjab, he claims. The Congress chief is, however, mindful of their appeal: he has scaled back his trademark style of addressing large rallies in favour of an interpersonal outreach through campaigns such as Halke Vich Captain, i.e. Captain in your constituency, for you.The ruling SAD-BJP government too claims the AAP is no threat. Arvind Kejriwals anti-Punjab stance had been exposed in the Sutlej-Yamuna canal issue. He displayed a soft corner for Haryana as he hails from that State, alleges SAD spokesperson and Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema.Whether the AAP peaks in time or not, the dismissive attitude of its opponents will turn into no-holds-barred attacks as the campaign plot thickens in the months leading up to the elections.The AAPs campaign is primarily seeking to tap into the anxieties of farmers, youth, women and marginalised sections such as the DalitsThe Punjab Congress unit, which fancies its chances, considers AAP to have already peaked during the 2014 parliamentary elections.

Immediately, the pilot too announced that the plane would make a diversion and land at Kazakhstan.Everyone was asleep when the announcement came and the pilot was calm and landed the plane smoothly, said one of the passengers, M. Venkat, contacting through WhatsApp.We landed at the airport within 15 minutes of the announcement. We are right now inside the airport waiting for the last six hours for the replacement aircraft to arrive from Delhi. They served us soup and bread from the airport kitchen. Luckily, my mother had packed lemon rice for us, he said.Mr. Venkat, his family of four - including wife and two daughters, along with his brother M. Venus family of wife, two boys and a girl, who came to the capital for a wedding, along with several other Telugu passengers, flew from Hyderabad to Mumbai on Wednesday night to catch the Newark flight scheduled to depart at 2.30 a.m.He said there could be about 300 passengers and crew on the flight, and the airline and airport staff were doing their best at the moment. We landed at Aktobe airport at about 8 a.m., and I am not sure if we will be moved into a hotel before the replacement flight arrives at 10 p.m., as has been indicated to us, he said.While there was no panic among the passengers, everyone is weary and the fatigue was compounded without proper sleep, and without a good shower for several hours now. I guess we would be delayed by at least a day to our destination if everything goes as per plan, Mr. Venkat added, before signing off in order to save battery. The IT professional immediately sent a message to his relatives living in Erragadda here. We received a message from my son stating that there was an emergency landing and that everything is fine. We are hoping to hear from them as soon as they land in the US, said his father, M. Ramu Sarma, a retired State Government official.Later in the night, a back-up Air India plane landed at the airport much to the relief of the passengers."

Photo: By ArrangementThe Tirupati wildlife divisions combing party nabbed, late on Friday night, 12 woodcutters at Pulibonupalle near Nerabailu forest close to the famous Talakona waterfalls, 65 km from Tirupati.What has baffled the officials is that the accused are residents of Madireddipalle village of Yadamarri mandal of Chittoor district, bordering Vellore district of Tamil Nadu.Forest officials say that some families of the village were hardcore followers of slain forest brigand Veerappan, and had worked for him in decimating the precious white sandal trees in the four Southern States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala three decades ago.Speaking to The Hindu , Divisional Forest Officer (Tirupati Wildlife) T.V. Subba Reddy, who led the Talakona operation, observed that all the 12 arrested were aged between 25 and 35 years.They are Tamils living in the border village of Chittoor and their families have relatives in the north-western districts of Tamil Nadu. Several families of Madireddipalle had direct patronage of Veerappan and indiscriminately cut the white sandal trees in the forests of Madanapalle, Punganur, Kuppam, and Palamaner. They ventured into the southern States to work for Veerappan.During interrogation, it was found that the woodcutters from Madireddipalle were influenced by their relatives in Tamil Nadu to fell red sanders trees. They were also lured by quick money in the smuggling of red sanders.After the white sandalwood disappeared from the western mandals 30 years ago and the eventual killing of Veerappan, the families of Madireddipalle switched to various vocations.Cause for concernThorough probe has revealed that the 12 woodcutters are on their second trip into the Seshachalam before being caught. But the fact that they are from a village that served Veerappan for three decades is something worrying us. After 30 years, the young generation of the village has focused on the red sanders wealth in the Seshachalam hills. It is a disturbing development, the official said. The DFO said that preliminary investigation revealed that these woodcutters were employed by two seasoned smugglers based at Palamaner and Tirupati.Special teams were deployed to nab them.Meanwhile, the combing party seized a mini load of provisions such as rice and other ingredients, cooking utensils, and woodcutting equipment from the nabbed persons."

Rama Rao.Initially, more than 2,000 pilgrims were fed a day under the scheme, which was grounded on April 6, 1985. From then on, there was no looking back for the prestigious institution, which, at present, feeds more than a lakh pilgrims daily. The corpus fund of the TTDs Nitya Annadanam Trust, which runs the scheme, reached a staggering Rs. 660 crore as on December 31, 2015.While around 55,000 pilgrims are offered food at the monolithic Sri Tarigonda Vengamamba Complex (STVC), food packets are supplied to more than 25,000 at the massive Vaikuntam-II complex. Another 8,000 pilgrims are offered free food at the Pilgrim Amenities Complex (PAC). On festive occasions, the number nearly doubles.With the scheme gaining popularity and funds pouring in, the TTD has extended its reach to Tirupati for the benefit of devotees. At present, 8,000 pilgrims are fed at Srinivasam and Vishnu Nivasam complexes in Tirupati, while another 4,000 are offered food at the temple of goddess Padmavathi at Tiruchanoor everyday. In addition, the TTD also provides free food to over 6,000 patients, along with their attendants, at SVRR hospital, BIRRD, SVIMS and maternity hospitals on a regular basis.Around 10 tonnes of rice and six tonnes of vegetables, in addition to one tonne of Bengal gram, are cooked at the massive STV complex at Tirumala everyday. The complex is equipped with four big dining halls, each with a seating capacity of over 1,000 pilgrims. More than 300 regular and 700 outsourced employees, in addition to 200 Srivari seva volunteers, engage themselves in the herculean task of cooking and serving food in two shifts daily at the elephantine complex.Meanwhile, the annual contributions, which had been hovering between Rs. 50 to 55 crore till a couple of years ago, touched Rs. 85 crore in 2014-15. Officials are optimistic that donations are sure to cross the Rs.100 crore mark during the current financial year.Speaking to The Hindu , TTDs Deputy Executive Officer (Annadanam) S. Venugopal said even though the TTD derived an interest of Rs. 55 crore on its corpus fund, the annual expenditure of the trust is put at more than Rs. 75 crore, which includes salaries and other expenses. An additional Rs. 200 crore towards the corpus will definitely make the trust self-reliant at least for the time being.He added that during his two-and-a-half-year stint, he had never received any complaint with regard to either quality or quantity. All that I have received is only appreciation and accolades from the pilgrim fraternity, he said."

(AP)BATON ROUGE, Louisiana: The Latest on flooding in southern Louisiana (all times local):In flood-ravaged south Louisiana, mental scars are already showing on the youngest victims of a disaster that prompted more than 30,000 rescues and left an estimated 40,000 homes damaged.Children who endured harrowing rescues are returning home to a jarring landscape that even their parents can scarcely grasp: Homes filled with ruined possessions need to be gutted. Scores of damaged schools and daycare centers are closed indefinitely. Working parents must also line up caretakers for their kids.Denham Springs resident Michelle Parrott says the floods have traumatized her six children, who have slept in cars, a shelter and a hotel room since they had to be rescued by boat. Parrott says her children are hearing phantom thunder storms and ask if the floodwaters are coming again when it does rain.___The sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish in Louisiana is changing the start time of the parish's curfew.Sid Gautreaux said in a news release Friday the nightly curfew will begin at midnight, instead of 10 p.m.The curfew's end time will remain 6 a.m.Gautreaux said the curfew is still needed to maintain the safety of residents and first responders and to provide security for homes and businesses devastated by flood waters.The sheriff said the curfew will still allow for individuals to travel to and from work and make food, fuel and other deliveries.___A university scientist says flooding has cost south Louisiana rice farmers an estimated $14 million in fields that were destroyed after being completely submerged.Dustin Harrell, Louisiana State University's rice specialist, tells The Advertiser (http://bit.ly/2b6iuf2) that doesn't include yield or quality losses from rice that was damaged, but can still be harvested, nor does it include equipment and infrastructure losses.Harrell said in some ways the damage is worse than from previous hurricanes.He says with a hurricane the water recedes quickly, but in this case the backwater flooding is still there.Rice farmer Richard Fontenot says his fields have been flooded five days. Harrell says crops can generally survive complete submersion about two days.Fontenot, who farms rice and other crops, said the ultimate loss in rice will likely almost double Harrell's initial estimate.___Even as most schools in the Baton Rouge area ready to reopen in the coming days, public schools in the hard-hit town of Central area won't reopen until after Labor Day at the earliest and perhaps later.Central Superintendent Michael Faulk tells The Advocate (http://bit.ly/2b2KamB) only one of Central's five schools, Tanglewood Elementary, sustained flooding, but it's a large school. Faulk says cleanup there should be done by the end of next week, but renovations will take longer.The town has its own school system.Also, roughly 60 percent of Central school employees suffered some kind of flood damage to homes or vehicles.Faulk said he wants schools to reopen but won't rush it to the point of causing problems later.The East Baton Rouge Parish school system, the state's second largest school district, will reopen classes Wednesday.Officials say six schools in the East Baton Rouge system sustained major damage and will remain closed after the other 70-plus schools reopen.___Crews with Entergy-Louisiana from four states are walking through neighborhoods across south Louisiana, inspecting electrical equipment and working to re-energize lines where it is safe to do so.As of 5 a.m. Friday, the number of customers without power due to flooding had dropped to just under 6,000 from Tuesday night's peak of more than 32,000 customers. The process of restoring power to the remaining customers will be a slow one, as customers who had received floodwaters in their homes or businesses may have to make repairs to their electrical system before power can be restored.Customers in the Baton Rouge, Denham Springs and Gonzales areas who were not flooded but who are still without power also may have to wait a little longer. Entergy said power cannot be restored to their area until all meters are inspected on their circuit as well as other devices, such as transformers and fuses.___Victims of catastrophic floods in Louisiana's capital city say they've seen people pull together  white and black, officers and civilians  in ways that give hope amid a summertime string of tragedies.It's been a summer of pain in greater Baton Rouge, a city rocked by the July 7 killing of black man Alton Sterling at the hands of police  then the retaliatory slayings of three officers by a black gunman. After that came deadly floods that swamped thousands of homes and claimed more than a dozen lives.The anti-police rhetoric that followed Sterling's killing seems to have quieted somewhat, and officers once viewed with suspicion often risked their lives to rescue people in the floods.Observers say the test will be whether a sense of unity remains once floodwaters fully recede."

For instance, families have stopped eating millets because cultivation has reduced, and rice has become the staple food because of easy availability, said professor Shreelata Rao Seshadri, who anchors the Health, Development and Society Initiative at Azim Premji University.Research coordinator Suraj Parab told The Hindu that for many members from tribal communities in Yadgir and H.D. Kote, the variety of vegetables and meat available had reduced as they were now restricted from entering forests.While the number of traditional foods had gone down, the number of snacks had gone up substantially.

In the last two years alone, the number of vehicles seized from the Ottappalam-Shornur- Thrithala stretch of the river crossed 550.Two weeks ago, we auctioned 400 vehicles. The remaining vehicles would also be auctioned soon. I will send out a strong message against illegal sand-mining, said Ottappalam Sub Collector P B Nooh. Mr. Nooh, however, says of late the tough measures initiated by the Revenue Department have started yielding results.Unlike the previous years, our special squad remains active throughout the night. We also have large-scale public participation in efforts to nab those engaged in sand-mining. Boats used for collecting sand in the river are dismantled instantly, said Vijayabhaskar, Deputy Tehsildar who is leading the special squad comprising a dozen senior officials and their assistants.The result is astonishing. No case of illegal sand-mining has been registered in the last two months from the Ottappalam-Thrithala stretch due to foolproof preventive measures. ``Our squad comprises only those specially identified truthful officials and they act with the support of local communities. We have ensured zero illegal sand-mining in the three taluks. The progress is remarkable in the case of Pattambi region, which had earned notoriety in the previous years, said Mr. Vijayabhaskar.The fine collected from violators in the last one-and-a-half years alone was around Rs 1 crore. In spite of regulations and prohibition, sand-mining had continued rampant on the riverbed of Bharathapuzha all these years. Water tables dropped dramatically, and a land once known for its plentiful rice harvest now faced scarcity of water. We have to integrate both conservation and livelihood, said Mr. Bava. In most parts, the 209-km long river is covered with shrubs and weeds, and looks more like an unkempt ground than a water body.Sand-mining has affected water supply schemes in Ottapalam, Shoranur and Pattambi, which depend on the Bharathapuzha water. Every year, the well in the middle of the river course for drawing water for the water supply schemes has to be dug deeper due to the depletion of the water table, says environmentalist P.S.

Even as he was filing his nomination papers with transport minister R Ramalinga Reddy, an argument broke out between the candidate's supporters. One of them took exception to the other shouting anti-Rahman slogans and broke a glass bottle on his head. The situation was immediately brought under control.But the huge crowd prevented Sharief from reaching the venue to file his nomination papers, and he had to ride up on a supporter's scooter.Later, he told the media he was confident of winning the bypoll. However, he could not immediately recall the Congress government's flagship programme Anna Bhagya, describing it as the ""Re 1 rice scheme"".He claimed he was well-versed with the constituency, which he lost in the 2013 assembly poll by a margin of 5,000 plus votes. Earlier, Rahman and Sharief met chief minister Siddaramaiah. Though Rahman reached Cauvery, the CM's official residence, around 9am, he wanted his grandfather to join him, leading to speculation that Siddaramaiah had delayed meeting him.Sharief said he had to take his insulin dose before going to the CM's house. ""In the CM's house, I asked them to serve me something to eat and we discussed the poll strategy over snacks. The CM told Rahman he should work hard now that he has been given the ticket. I told the CM he should ensure all his ministers and leaders work with the same zeal if the ticket had been given to somebody else,'' he added.BJP candidate YA Narayanaswamy , who was the first to file his nomination papers, offered puja at Sanjaynagar's Radha Krishna temple.

And yet, none of these promises have been fulfilled.MeetingAs a result of this, the Irular Association passed a resolution in a meeting recently to boycott the Assembly elections altogether. As a mark of protest, Irulas have raised black flags on their houses (huts). Tiruvallur is said to have around 80,000 Irula voters. Our children study with candle lights and under street lights. We live in thatched huts with no facilities and there is no safety for us from natural calamities. All these years, we have received only promises, said R. Prabhu, founder, Tiruvallur District Irular Development Association. Irulas from different parts of Tiruvallur district organised a series of protest meetings near the Tiruvallur Collectorate for the past few months to draw the district administrations attention to these grievances. The protest meetings were preceded by signature campaigns and street corner meetings at Irula settlements in the district. Also, for over two years, community elders had given several petitions to the district administration at public grievances meetings.The Tiruvallur district administration ignored our plight. We decided to boycott this assembly election as voting all these years have not improved our lives, said R.

'Get Set' was added to Google Play Store on July 18 last year.""A head injury at the age three had made us worry about his future. It left him very slow with reading and writing. 'Taare Zameen Par' proved to be a turning point in our life. We decided to give him the best education. Soon, Vinayak started responding well and began showing his technical skills,"" said Vinayak's mother Nidhi Sareen.""After he finished Class X, though we wanted him to go for law, going by his liking he started learning computer programming. In Class XI, he developed his own website.When he found some problems in transferring heavy data files on WhatsApp, he started developing an app in December 2014 and for next six months kept working on it and has succeeded in developing Get Set,"" said Vinayak's father Umesh Sareen, a rice miller.Vinayak said, ""Get Set takes 11 MB space, one can send data files up to 2 GB at very fast speed. I made a provision for 'secret chat' by setting up a timer. After the time set for chat by any mobile user is over, it is automatically deleted from the phone. I intend to buy my own server and I am busy with other things to be done on computers and mobile phones."""

However, as Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt will ascend the Paryaya Peetha at the 800-year-old Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple for a record fifth time on January 18, the organisers are expecting a lot of donations.Hence, a Horekanike Store Hall has been erected on 34,000 square feet of land near Rajagana Parking Space. The Horekanike donations, which started on January 5, will conclude on January 16.The store hall has 14 separate stalls for maintaining items such as coconuts, de-husked coconuts, tender coconuts, bananas, plantain leaves, pumpkin, yellow pumpkin, rice murras, rice, eggplant, elephant yam, coconut oil and pulses.The maintenance of the store hall has been entrusted to the Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP). In order to make the store hall attractive, the members of the SKDRDP have created structures of agricultural and horticultural products.As one enters the hall, one is greeted with a mantapa made out of maize corns. There is a chariot made out of arecanuts. Behind it is a hexagonal shed made out of tender coconuts, and a paddy kanaja next to it. All these structures are about 10 feet tall. There is also a four-foot-tall statue of Lord Krishna.Mahaveer Ajri, regional director, Udupi region, SKDRDP, said that these structures were made out of agricultural and horticultural products so that people could not not only see the items donated but also know that it was possible to use them artistically.The hall leads to the Adhokshaja Mantapa, where cultural programmes are held at 7 p.m.People coming to the cultural programmes come here to appreciate the beauty of these structures, Mr. Ajri said."

This is Bandari Layout near Pragati Nagar where homes have been deserted for the past 10 days and residents are scared of coming back.Inside the JMJ Court apartments, the water is bubbling out of a pillar. Similarly, in the other apartment complexes, water is flowing out of the borewells which the residents are pumping onto the road. Many of the apartments are still sandbagged as a protection from water.The house owners have vacated and are now living with their friends or relatives. Most of them are afraid to come back as the water is seeping out of the pillar and they are afraid what might happen to the building, says Rakesh Chowdhury, a shop owner adjacent to the complex. The water flooded in the night and I could salvage only so many things. Everything that was at knee level has been destroyed, he says, pointing at a wall marking up to which the water reached.Supervising the clean-up of the cellar of the apartment, Shrikant, an IT professional and house owner, says: This is what the lake has dumped here. Four vehicles are damaged. Shrikant saw the flood water rise slowly before the water roared on the roads in the night flooding the cellars of the apartments.The residents are torn about living and leaving the apartments. While the house owners say that they are safe and not worried about the future, the tenants want to leave the apartments. According to an estimate by electricity department, about 1,500 apartments are affected. We have changed about 500 electricity meters and we have to change another 1,000. Most of the meters have become unusable as water entered the circuitry, said an official of electricity department, as workers installed meters in an apartment complex whose cellar was flooded to a height of eight feet destroying the backup generator as well.It is not just apartment owners who have been affected. We have lost everything. We dont have dal or rice or clothes. We are living with the clothes we managed to salvage as the water entered the cellar, says Rajamma, whose husband is the watchman of an apartment complex. For four days we used a ladder to get food from the next apartment. All the house owners vacated and left the day after water entered the cellar. We have nowhere to go, she says."

While the Standing Committee is yet to decide, officials have short-listed five NGOs for the job. Of these, three are currently supplying midday meals to the SDMC, while two are new entrants.No agreement finalThe agreements are yet to be finalised, but the Congress says the SDMC is about to outsource the work to organisations that have either been black-listed or whose food samples have failed testing.Farhad Suri, the Leader of the Opposition in the SDMC, said: Among the NGOs selected is one that has been black-listed. Samples of those that are currently supplying midday meals have failed tests for required protein levels and calorific content.He added that one of the agencies being considered had been indicted by a court.In fact, the Education Department has admitted in an internal document, a copy of which is with The Hindu , that over 50 per cent of samples taken from the existing suppliers in the past three years have failed.A total of 165 samples were taken from kitchens run by Ekta Shakti Foundation, Iskcon Food Relief Foundation and Jay Gee Humanitarian Society from 2013-2014 till 2015-2016. Of these, 93 samples in total failed.Citing this, Mr. Suri asked: Why are organisations that are providing sub-standard food to children not being penalised and being allowed to enter into new contracts.However, the BJP leadership of the SDMC denied the charges. Subhash Arya, the Leader of the House, said that the results of tests had changed when the testing methodology changed.Meals failed testThe midday meals have not failed. Earlier, the tests of calorific value were done on uncooked rice and wheat, and there was no problem. But, when the tests started to be done on cooked food, samples of midday meals across Delhi  both corporation and government schools  began failing, said Mr. Arya.He said that the raw materials for the midday meal scheme was being provided by the Delhi government, so if the quality of ration is improved, the cooked food would as well.He added that the SDMC would look into the other allegations, and assured that no black-listed organisations would be given a contract."

Natarajan said the country was in need of increasing food production to meet the growing needs when it launched the green revolution and introduced use of chemical fertilizers to get high yield.After realising that millets had the right ratio of protein, carbohydrate and vitamins, people were reverting back to traditional food.Recalling that rice was rich mans food about five to six decades ago, local MP A.

Rice also reiterated US' support for India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group (NSG) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).No such support is forthcoming for Pakistan, whose leaders bailed out of the meeting fearing international pressure on its out-of-control nuclear weapons programme. Pakistan's proxy military rulers sent a low-level bureaucrat for the summit after Islamabad cited the terrorist attack on Lahore for PM Sharif skipping the meet. The fact that the attack was directed against Pakistan's beleaguered minority Christian community has also attracted opprobrium in the US.But in a bizarre twist, the Pakistani military wheeled out an alleged Indian spy purportedly operating in Balochistan to paper over the crisis in Islamabad and Lahore. The two sides made no reference to the spy spat, but, significantly, the White House NSC statement said Rice and Doval ""discussed US-India counter terrorism operations, including against LeT and JeM""."

""What we never imagined was that it would be in Tashkent,"" says Sameer, who runs a small landscaping business in the city. The brothers set up a restaurant, 'The Gabbar's' in Uzbek capital Tashkent last year. ""It is a multi-cuisine restaurant and though we serve European, American and Chinese dishes too, Indian items are the most popular.""As part of an MIDC Industries Association's tour to Tashkent to scout for business opportunities, Sameer returned with the thought of opening a restaurant there. ""What attracts tourist to Tashkent is its prostitution business. But the place also has lot of sites of historical importance too,"" he says. ""Being the biggest producer of cotton, it gets a lot of Indian business travellers too. For them, just like as it was for us, food is a problem,"" says Wargantiwar explaining how he thought of setting up the restaurant. ""The markets sell a lot of Indian whole spices and lentils. Cooking and serving Indian dishes is easy,"" he adds.It took him and his younger brother Aniruddha, who is living in Tashkent now, nearly 1 years to get the documentation done and to find a place. ""After initial struggle, we could rent an old abandoned restaurant with a sprawling area of 8000sqft. We retained the furniture that came with it but had to redesign the kitchen to accommodate Indian style cooking,"" Wargantiwar says.Though most ingredients are available, yet it was a struggle. ""Wheat flour available is very sticky. So we had to try out many varieties before choosing Kazakhstan variety, which is suitable for tandoori roti and parantha,"" Wargantiwar says and adds he still carries curry leaves from India. ""We are using Pakistani basmati rice only for Biryani. For other dishes, I have been carrying and stocking rice taken from Nagpur."" The staff and chefs too are from the city.The locals are gradually warming up to Indian tastes. ""There are at least 25 regular customers who just tell me their mood and I select the menu for them,"" says Wargantiwar and adds they are serving five different varieties of butter chicken and even saoji chicken with mild flavours. ""Many visit us for vegetarian food and love dal, vegetable jalfrazie and paneer items that we serve."" The ambience is also very Indian. ""There are 182 Indian families who visit us regularly. We screen Indian films and also play Bollywood music,"" says Wargantiwar who believes that restaurant business is good for maintaining PR. ""Dignitaries of various countries come regularly. We were food partners during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit here,"" he adds.The brothers want to single out developing countries for setting up restaurants. ""But our ultimate destination is Rome,"" says Sameer.

Madhusudan, joint director, Department of Agriculture, has said that paddy was so far grown under traditional semi-aquatic and water-intensive methods in the command area of Bhadra reservoir. Under this, the water is made to flood the fields.Drop in supplyThe availability of water in Bhadra reservoir for agriculture has fallen owing to scanty rainfall in catchment areas and an increase in the number of human habitats dependent on the reservoir for drinking water. In the wake of these developments, it was necessary to re-contemplate on the existing paddy cultivation practices .At present, 32 tmcft water is stored in Bhadra reservoir of which 13 tmcft is considered as dead storage and 7 tmcft is reserved for drinking purposes. It is possible to release water for kharif crops for nearly 35 days along the canals with the remaining 12 tmcft water.The CADA, optimistic that the monsoon will become more active in the catchment areas of the reservoir in the coming days, has assured the farmers that they would get water for 100 days.Other methodsMr. Madhusudan said that it was necessary to create awareness among farmers on System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and other methods of cultivating paddy without flooding the fields.Rather than keeping the field flooded, the farmers can provide water for the plants once a week. This will result in minimisation of anaerobic conditions and will pave the way for healthy growth of the roots. Instead of raising the nurseries of paddy seedlings on to fields that require more water, the farmers can opt for the tray method. The machines can be used for transplantation of paddy saplings to ensure proper spacing.By adopting these practices, the water requirement for paddy cultivation can be reduced by 50 per cent compared to the traditional method, he said.The CADA and the department will organise two seminars each in rural areas of Shivamogga and Davangere districts this month on the economic utilisation of water.In addition to this, it has been decided to raise a demonstration plot on the cultivation of paddy under less water-intensive methods at the main campus of UAHS, Shivamogga, and on the premises of Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station in Kattalagere in Davangere district, Honnavile in Shivamogga district and Bhavikere in Chikkamagaluru district.The Bhadra CADA and the department will bring the farmers to these plots to sensitise them on the less water-intensive methods, he said."

The President is reported to be resisting demands that Hanoi and even Communist Chinese installations be bombed if he orders a resumption of air raids on North Viet Nam.

Anshuman Phadikar, Snehamoy Chakraborty and Subhasish Chaudhuri were on the road in three districts on Wednesday to gauge the extent of the problem and what the police are doing to address it. Chanda is a part of life, says police officer A schoolboy climbs up to the window of a truck on Kolaghat-Jashar Road on Wednesday to demand subscription while another fills up a coupon. Picture by Jahangir Badsa Place: Kolaghat-Jashar Road (East Midnapore) Time: 9am to noon What we saw: Groups of five-six persons stop vehicles by walking onto the carriageway. When the trucks stop, one or two of them climb up to the drivers window and demand Rs 100. The bargaining goes on for a few seconds. The two sides settle for Rs 30-50. The drivers cough up the money and the vehicles are allowed to pass. There are hardly any policemen around and in places where there are cops, they turn a blind eye. This happens every year, which is why truckers tend to avoid transporting goods around Kali Puja. Between Jhargram and Kolaghat, I have been stopped for chanda in at least 20 places and have had to pay over Rs 1,500, said Soren Murmu, 45, a truck driver from West Midnapore. Such instances of extortion were seen by this newspaper on the Tamluk-Panskura Road and the Heria-Khejuri Road too. Nearest police station: The Kolaghat outpost is less than 1km away. What the police said: We havent seen or heard of anybody being forced to pay. There are no official complaints. Requests for chanda before pujas are a part of life. We are not paying attention to it, an officer said. East Midnapore police chief Alok Rajoria said he had issued instructions for stern action against such extortion. We are keeping a close vigil on the national and state highways. Maybe these things are taking place on some village roads. Nevertheless, I have instructed all police personnel to make immediate arrests and take follow-up action if there is any extortion, Rajoria said. Pay up or tyres will be flattened A suspected member of the local Nabarun Club in Santipur pastes a sticker on a Tata Ace from which another has collected chanda. The sticker is being pasted so that the vehicle is not stopped by members of the club again. Picture by Abhi Ghosh Place: Kashyap Para crossing on NH34 in Santipur town (Nadia) Time: 10am-2pm What we saw: Three-four teenagers stop vehicles by getting in the way. Two of them walk up to the driver and demand Rs 100-200. Following haggling, during which the drivers are threatened with flattening of tyres, they pay Rs 10-50 and asticker is pasted on the windscreen as a licence to pass. The boys disappeared when they saw they were being photographed. Residents said the boys were members of the local Nabarun Club. Policemen were nowhere to be seen. I was asked to pay Rs 50. When I refused, they threatened to deflate the tyres of my bike. I have so far paid Rs 150 as Kali Puja subscription, said Tirupati Chakraborty, a rice stockist. Such incidents are also seen on the Chakdaha-Ranaghat bypass, the Ranaghat-Krishnagar bypass, the Phulia-Badkulla road, the Badkulla-Hanskhali road, the Ranaghat-Dhantala road and the Kalyani B5 road. Nearest police station: Shantipur police station is less than 1.5km away. What the police said: In Nadia, over the past week, cops in civvies and posing as motorists conducted raids and rounded up over 100 youths for demanding chanda, but most were let off with a warning. Twenty-odd were arrested on the charge of extortion. We have been conducting regular patrols to control the menace. However, it is quite difficult to monitor each and every road, said the sub-divisional police officer of Ranaghat, Indrajit Bose. Not linked to festivities but will take money A teenager climbs up to the window of a truck to demand subscription at Layek Bazaar in Bolpur. Picture by Indrajit Roy Place: Near Lalpool on Nanoor Road (Birbhum) Time: 10am to 1pm What we saw: Groups of three-four young men waylay vehicles that are not from the area. Starting with a demand for Rs 101, they settle for a minimum amount of Rs 21 per vehicle. No vehicle is allowed to pass without paying up. Drivers who argue are threatened with flattening of tyres. Residents said some of the youths were not even associated with any puja and go on a chanda-collection spree several times every year, especially before festivals. No policemen were seen. We have been stopped at six places between Burdwan and Bolpur. So far, we have paid Rs 200. This is so irritating, said 45-year-old homemaker Kalyani Chowdhury, who was travelling to a relatives home in Santiniketan with two teenaged children. This newspaper saw similar incidents in Bolpurs Layekbazar, the Kashipur crossing and Suratheswartala on the Burdwan-bound flank of NH2B. Nearest police station: Lalpool is within 1km of Bolpur police station. What the police said: We take action when we see something, or when people lodge specific complaints. Neither has happened this year, an officer at the police station said."

A GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities that are unique to that origin. Two organisations - Lotus Progressive Centre, Nalbari, and Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Guwahati - recently submitted additional documents to the Intellectual Property India (IPI) office in Chennai to get a GI tag for boka saul, a soft variety of rice. The two organisations had applied for the GI tag last year. Tapan Baishya, secretary of Lotus Progressive Centre, said they recently submitted additional information on the paddy's historical background, area were it is grown and logo, among others, with the assistance of Assam Science, Technology and Environment Council (ASTEC). Baishya said his centre was a registered society working for the conservation and preservation of native rice varieties and that they represented the interests of farmers growing boka saul. In response to a query from the IPI office, the organisations said boka saul was a special class of quality rice famous for its value-addition properties like instant preparation of Continental delicacies and regular dishes and zero-fuel cooking requirement. The rice can be eaten after soaking it in water for 45 minutes or in lukewarm water for 15 minutes. "" Boka saul is different from other parboiled varieties of rice since there is no need of fuel for cooking. It can be made even more delicious with the addition of curd or milk, jaggery, sugar or bananas,"" Baishya said. There are two varieties of boka saul - Santi Boka and Ronga Boka. These are sown in the third to fourth week of June and harvested in November-December. Regarding the historical background, the applicants gave detailed literature dating back to Mughal era when it was recorded how Ahom soldiers subsisted on a variety of rice which was soaked in water and eaten without cooking. Other accounts included records by British officials in The Agriculture Ledger 1910 No. 1, Literature on the Races of Rices in India, Office of the Reporter on Economic Products in Government of India, Agrarian System of Medieval Assam by Jahnabi Gogoi Nath and A Statistical Account of Assam by W.W. Hunters and other literature, including poems. On the area of growth, the organisations submitted a map and details of the places after accessing data from the Assam Remote Sensing Centre. It was certified by the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Shillongani in Nagaon district. The RARS comes under Jorhat-based Assam Agricultural University. The paddy, which is sali or winter crop, is grown in Nalbari, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Goalpara, Dhubri and Barpeta in lower Assam, Sivasagar in Upper Assam and Darrang and Lakhimpur in central Assam. The information was submitted to P.K.S. Bhairapannavar, examiner of trademark and geographical indications, in Chennai. The organisations said a logo had been created for boka saul and a committee would be formed to act as an internal watchdog to ensure that the quality of the product was retained. The committee members will include a senior scientist from RARS, Shillongani, programme coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nalbari, an official of Patent Information Centre, ASTEC, regional coordinator, CEE, and project director, Lotus Progressive Centre."

The blanket ban on fishing activities is initiated to facilitate breeding of olive ridley sea turtles. However, it affects the livelihood of over 2,000 fishermen from Kendrapara, Ganjam and Puri districts. Therefore to financially help them, the government has decided to pay them an amount of Rs 5,000 per annum. ""The sole objective is to provide financial assistance to poor marine fishermen who are adversely affected by the ban imposed on account of sea turtle protection and marine fisheries resources conservation,"" said deputy director, marine fisheries, Basant Kumsar Das. A new scheme - Livelihood Support to Marine Fishermen During Fishing Ban Periods - would be operational very shortly to strengthen the livelihood of the fishermen, said an official. ""We are happy as the government has decided to extend monetary aid to us, but Rs 5,000 is too less to make up for our loss. The sum of the financial assistance needs to be revised. We are losing almost two-third of the fishing season each year. People living on sea-fishing have taken up different income sources,"" said a fisherman from Paradip, Radhakant Maiti. Keeping in view the dipping income sources of the affected fishermen, the state government had earlier launched Rice for Olive Ridley Conservation Programme. The beneficiary families are being provided 25kg rice every month at Re 1-a-kg, said another official. Over 8,000 marine fishermen families from the seaside villages of Kendrapara, Ganjam, Puri are being covered under the social security scheme, said additional fisheries officer of Paradip, Bharat Bhusan Sahoo. In accordance with the Odisha Marine Fisheries Regulatory Act, 1983, the prohibitory orders on sea fishing remains effective from November 1 to May 31. The legal embargo on fishing remains in force to ensure the safety of breeding turtles who perish in large number either by getting entangled in mono-filament fishing nets or by getting hit by propellers of fishing trawls."

(Hardeep Singh) Ranchi, Sept. 24: The RIMS authorities today referred to Rinpas five mentally challenged persons, including the destitute woman who was seen eating rice and curry straight from the hospital floor in a picture that went viral and triggered a massive controversy yesterday. RIMS director Dr B.L. Sherwal said that they had been shifted to Rinpas this afternoon for proper treatment. The probe into the matter revealed that the woman in question was a destitute, who was never admitted to RIMS. Further probe revealed that there were four more persons in different wards who were unattended and required special care, Sherwal said. According to a hospital source, the five persons are Muni Devi (55), the woman in the picture published in newspapers, Ashok Adhikari (61), Raghu Runda (26), Gopal Lohar (35) and a 45-year-old woman, whose identity could not be ascertained. State-run RIMS came in the line of fire yesterday for what was seen as inhuman treatment meted out to a poor woman. While RIMS authorities sacked a worker, chief minister Raghubar Das asked principal health secretary K. Vidyasagar to send a fact-finding team to the hospital. Also, a bench of Chief Justice Virender Singh and Justice S. Chandrashekhar took suo motu cognisance and issued notices to the chief secretary, principal health secretary and RIMS director. Sherwal today said he had initiated measures to prevent repetition of such incidents in future on the RIMS campus. I have asked all RIMS staff to pay proper attention to persons found unattended on the campus. I have also asked them to serve food properly to even patient, he said. Sherwal said he was also contemplating to rope in NGOs or old-age homes to take care of destitute persons dumped at the heal hub. Rinpas director Dr S.

Mr. Obamas visit will also resuscitate the memories of the U.S.s difficult past of war and conflict with these two current partners in Asia.Mr. Obama will be the first serving U.S. President to visit Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities on which the U.S. dropped atomic bombs in 1945. Many historians believe it was necessary to end the Second World War. Jimmy Carter visited Hiroshima in 1984, after he had left the White HouseFocus on tradeThe visit will also underscore the significance the Obama administration attaches to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement that is the cornerstone of the U.S.s Asia-Pacific policy, despite it being hotly contested in the ongoing presidential campaign. Maritimes disputes on the South China Sea will be part of the discussions at the G-7 meeting in Japan.This trip is a manifestation of two key elements of the rebalance. First, building new partnerships with emerging powers in the region like Vietnam; and second, strengthening our treaty allies including, with Japan, which is at the heart of our Asian strategy, Daniel Kritenbrink, National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs, said. This will be Mr. Obamas 10th visit as President to East Asia.The U.S. opened full diplomatic ties with Vietnam in 1995 but the relationship is far from smooth. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush visited Vietnam once each and this will be Mr. Obamas first trip to the country that shares a border with China. Some reports suggest that Mr. Obama may ease arms sales to Vietnam, which has been suspended since the war. But concerns regarding human rights violations in the country still rattle U.S. administrations, and Mr. Obama will interact with civil society organisations in Hanoi.War veteransGiven the domestic sensitivity of the visit, National Security Adviser Susan Rice met with representatives of U.S. military veterans, for whom the war in Vietnam and the bombing of Hiroshima have subjective meanings too. [I]n that meeting, Ambassador Rice was able to explain to our veterans organisations the reasons why were conducting this trip, what our objectives are, what we hope to achieve going forward. But she also emphasised well never forget the sacrifices of our veterans and the great contributions that theyve made  [that] is what in many ways has allowed us to achieve what weve achieved today, Mr. Kritenbrink said.The White House had earlier said the President would not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb while visiting Hiroshima. He will not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb at the end of World War-II. Instead, he will offer a forward-looking vision focussed on our shared future, Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, said earlier in the month."

So it was for the Prime Minister, who reached Kerala around 10 days after Onam for the BJP national council meeting.On Sunday, he was treated to a 100-dish sadya, according to PTI, which added the spread included five varieties of payasam (the sweet dish known as kheer or sevaiyan in some other parts of India and payas in Bengal.) Asked over the phone from Thiruvananthapuram, some BJP leaders said they could count only 50 dishes and two payasams. Hairs were split with such precision probably because the BJP national councils political resolution focuses on a hard-to-swallow concoction called povertarianism. Usually, a sadya, which is vegetarian, will have around 26 dishes and costs between Rs 300 and Rs 2,000 a head,depending on the category of the hotel. The dishes can be stretched to 100 by having various types of vegetable preparations, pickles and payasams. Served on a banana leaf, the dishes have to be placed in a particular order. Some of the dishes have to be eaten in a particularsequence. It is unfair to accuse the BJP of cooking up or mixing up its sadya statistics. For the uninitiated, it will be difficult to keep count as well as keep the rice and curries from flowing out of the banana leaf. A picture clicked by PTI showed a contemplative Prime Minister concentrating deeply on the leaf during the lunch. The way his fingers are made into a cone suggests (but not confirmed) he is trying to have a brown payasam from the servingleaf  a task that requires a fair amount of skill. Sources said one of the payasams was made of green gram, which mixed with jaggery can be brown. Payasam-slurping, executed clumsily, can leave incriminating splotches on the white clothes that the Prime Minister (as a true-blue sadya gourmet should) is wearing. Some faint-hearted and butter-fingered modern Malayalis drink the payasam from a tumbler  a sadya sacrilege to say the least. A minor transgression seems to be that the Prime Minister is seated at a table. Ideally, he should have sat cross-legged  childs play for a yogi like Modi  on the floor and enjoyed the feast. The Prime Ministers leaf looks more or less wiped clean  a sign that will be appreciated by the host because it suggests the guest had a hearty meal. Rajnath Singh has a long way to go but his posture and the absence of a mound of rice on his leaf suggests he is about to give up.Yes, you are allowed to slurp and lick your fingers at the end. But it is not clear ifModi did either."

58f4bd7260de4776e3694547,Tea garden hands drop return plan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160210/jsp/siliguri/story_68456.jsp,2016-02-10,"Feb. 9: Over 350 people who left the ailing Bagracote Tea Estate for other states in search of jobs have cancelled their plan to return home after the management backtracked from an assurance to pay workers their dues in phases from January 31. Bagracote in the Dooars is one of the 14 estates owned by the Duncans Industries Ltd and workers complained that there had been irregularities in distribution of rations and payment of wages in all the gardens since April last year. On January 22, the management told the state government that workers would be paid their dues in phases from January 31 and activities in the garden would be regularised from February 1. However, the Centre authorised the Tea Board on January 28 to take over seven of the 14 gardens. Following the decision, the management decided not to go ahead with the January 22 assurance in the remaining seven gardens, including Bagracote. ""So far, 372 men in Bagracote have migrated to states like Kerala, Haryana, Punjab and Tamil Nadu and are doing odd jobs at industrial establishments and construction sites to run their families. The migration had started in June and even last month, a number of workers left the garden in search of jobs,"" said Hemant Pradhan, a resident of Bagracote. According to him, these people were sending money to their families who were still staying in the garden. ""They could at least save their families from death because back in the garden, it is only rice which is available from the state government. Many of them would speak of the problems they are facing at the new workplace,"" said Pradhan. The dues in all the 14 Duncan gardens were said to be around Rs 70 crore. Several deaths have also been reported in some gardens although the suspected cause - malnutrition - has not been conclusively established. After the January 22 assurance by the management, over 350 men, most of whom were workers in Bagracote, decided to come back home from their current work sites. People like Francis Lakra who is in Chennai and Kishore Chhetri who is in Kerala, decided to buy train tickets. ""Those staying outside Bengal were happy to hear the promise. The family members told them that it was imperative that they were back in the garden and collected the dues. They had to spend extra money to get the train tickets. We had spoken to them and they were so happy to know that the impasse was finally over,"" Laurantus Kerketta, another resident of Bagracote, said. However, the ray of hope faded away within a week. ""As the central government issued a notification on January 28, mentioning the acquisition of seven tea estates of the Duncans Group, the management wrote to the state labour department on January 30, saying it was deferring its plan. The migrants were contacted by the family members and asked to cancel train tickets. They were also told to continue working at their respective places,"" said Pradhan. ""I have spoken to at least a couple of them. They are desperate to return home at the slightest opportunity but cannot afford to do so. Otherwise, their families would be struggling to live,"" he added."
58f4bd9a60de4776e3694585,'I am just a small child like Govinda',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160123/jsp/odisha/story_65403.jsp,2016-01-23,"The perception in political circles is that your party leadership has selected you to lead the state unit because of your RSS background. It seems that through you the RSS will guide the party in future! This is not true. There are leaders such as Suresh Pujari, Jual Oram and Debendra Pradhan, who had headed the party in the state, though they didn't have any RSS background. The RSS teaches us to love the country and its rich cultural traditions. Is it a crime to love these? If so, I am ready to commit the crime. There is nothing wrong if they guide us. But, I would like to make it clear that the BJP and the RSS are two different and independent organisations. Though they share similar ideologies at the intellectual level, they don't interfere in each other's sphere of work. The BJP is a political outfit and it decides its own policy and acts accordingly. You have been picked by the party and not been elected by the party's rank and file. The BJP seems to be following the Congress path by nominating a president instead of electing one. There seems to be no internal democracy (where workers elect their leaders) even in your party. We have had presidents from different backgrounds. People from humble background such as Amit Shah, Murli Manohar Joshi, L.K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have headed the party at the central level. This is unlike the Congress culture, where the president is from the Gandhi family only. In my case, I was elected and not nominated. I filed the nomination papers and got elected. No one had thrust me on the party. All the leaders have extended their support to me. Just before the elections, the state BJP vice-president Pratap Sarangi had expressed reservations against your appointment... We are all eligible for the post. There is nothing wrong if someone airs his views. All of them, including Pratap Sarangi, Bijoy Mohapatra and others, have blessed me. But we noticed that senior leaders such as Union tribal welfare minister Jual Oram, Bijoy Mohapatra and others were absent during your election. I talked to them, including Bijoy Mohapatra. Jual Oramji was in Australia on some official work and Dilip Ray was not well. All of them have assured me of their support. You are being projected as Union minister of state for Petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan's man in the party. How do you react to it? I never believe in worshiping an individual. For me the organisation is important. I am backed by everyone and not by a single individual. I am just a small child like Govinda who aspires to break the dahi handi (the curd-pot) climbing on the shoulders of others - the human pyramid. Do you think the shoulders on whom you are banking are strong enough to give you that support? Public perception seems to be different. Public perception will not always guide my family (the party). We have our own issues, which we will be dealt with differently. But, it requires commitment and hard work of the leader, who has been entrusted with the job of leading the party. I must say that these shoulders on whom I will be banking to reach the target are quite strong. I am committed to the cause. Ups and downs will come, but that will not deter me in pursuing my goal. I believe in a poem written by renowned writer Kuntala Kumari Sabat - in which she says you should never feel tired before reaching the goal - I will not get tired. I will go to the grassroots level to gain the confidence of 40 lakh supporters of the party. You are talking about 40 lakh primary members in your party. But, we noticed that there were no elections at the districts and taluks level. All the office-bearers were nominated. Do you think that we should indulge in infighting so that you get news. We believe in internal democracy. Our party is not an organisation that centres around an individual family like that of the Gandhi-Nehru family. Here the common man is able to take the mantle of the party. We have so many examples of this .... which you may not find in other parties. When you were being elected as the party president, a CB> There is politics in it. Dilip Ray had already given his statement explaining his stand. I will not comment on the functioning of the CB>. One of the central ministers had raised fingers on the functioning of the CB> and hinted that there was slowdown in its investigation on mining and deposit collection scam that had hit the state. Both deposit collection and mining scam investigations are being monitored by the apex court. There is no scope for interference either by the BJP or the Centre. The CB>, being an independent agency, is going step by step. I have nothing more to say on this issue. After assuming power, you raised the issue of Re 1-kg-rice scheme, the BJD's flagship programme. The Congress had raised the same issue and had said the subsidy provided by the state government was peanuts compared to the contribution of the Centre to provide rice at Re 1. It had even filed FIRs, saying that the government, instead of giving 35kg of rice to the families, provided 25kg in the state. The issue fizzled out and the Naveen Patnaik government came to power with a thumping majority. Do you think the rice issue will click? Even small leakages can destroy a big reservoir. We need to make people aware of how the Centre is giving Rs 27.38 in each kilogram of rice and the state government is only giving only Rs 2 per kg. We will invite the BJD to come for a debate on the issue. Take the example of Tata's Nano factory controversy at Singur in Bengal. While Mamata Banerjee had turned it into a negative campaign, Narendra Modi invited the company to Gujarat and helped it set up its plant. With this kind of initiatives, he became the Prime Minister. We believe in positive development. We will make people aware and once they are sensitised, they will reject the Naveen government. There is a public perception that the BJD and the BJP are hand-in-glove. It is because both the parties had shared power for a decade. Even when Amit Shah had come to Odisha last year to attend the Mahasangram rally, he did not utter a word against Naveen Patnaik. In the coming days, we will certainly try to break this perception. We will launch a serious agitation against the Naveen government. We will take the agitation to the grassroots level. You will see the difference. The BJP was decimated in the last general elections in the state. You could win only one Lok Sabha and 10 MLA seats. How do you hope that the party will come to power? In the 1980s, we had only two members in the Lok Sabha. Because of consistent effort by our leaders and lakhs of workers, the party came to power under Atalji's leadership. Later, Modi came with a thumping majority. You just wait... the same thing will happen in Odisha... but one has to keep patience and work consistently. In politics, there are no friends and foes. So if political compulsion dictate, will you tie up with the BJD again? Yes, I do agree with that. Personally, we are not against any one, not even Naveen Patnaik. But, we have ideological differences and we had bitter experiences with the BJD in the past. Keeping that in mind, I can say that we will not go for any sort of alliance with the BJD in future. Voices are being raised over growing regional disparity in the state. How do you to propose to address this issue? We are committed to overall development of Odisha. We do not believe in the development of a particular region whether it's north, south, west or east Odisha. We try to fulfil the aspirations and expectations of every region. Those, who had earlier gone against this principle, I call them krutaghna (ungrateful). They got support from a region for the overall development of the state but ignored the interest of that particular region. Let me cite an example - children will insist before the mother to accept their every demand. But, the mother has to take a balanced view and to see to it that all the children are equally developed. She does not make discrimination among her children. The demand for formation of a separate Koshal state has gained momentum, threatening to divide Odisha. What are your views? If the BJP comes to power, it will work for the overall development of the state and not lay emphasis on the development of a particular region. But, one needs to go deep into why such demands are being raised and address the issues. Keeping in mind the BJP's stand on smaller states, will you support the demand of Koshal? The BJP is in favour of smaller states. Earlier, it had helped to carve out smaller states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand. But, the issue of Koshal is different. People have to go deep to analyse the root cause behind such a demand. Why are such demands coming up time and again? It's the intensity of the people's agitation and the central government's attitude that decide the formation of a state. I am a small sipahi of the BJP. Why are you dragging me into it? At the moment, the question of formation of Koshal state has not come up for any discussion in the BJP. I hope such issue do not come up at any time for discussion. Now you will have to quit as the BJP legislature party leader. Who will step into your shoes? The party will decide who will be the BJP's legislature party leader. I am nowhere in the picture. Once the party takes a decision on this, we will abide by it."

He, along with around 20 friends from his school, was busy practising for the 67th Republic Day celebrations. ""We will showcase various feats using the roller skates, such as circling around while holding hands, which require a lot of co-ordination. We have been preparing for the show for the last one month,"" said Tanish. Students from various schools and colleges are busy preparing for the parade to make sure that their steps remain perfect on the Republic Day parade. Rani Aishwarya Chowdhury, a student of Saraswati Sishu Vidya Mandir, has been taking part in the parade for the last five years. ""This is a great venue to meet new people and make friends. It is a fun-filled affair and one gets to learn teamwork and dedication,"" she said. Like every year, a daredevil stunts show by the students of Maharishi College will be one of the main attractions of the parade. A group of 15 boys and girls of the college will showcase their riding skills in 10 bikes. This year, they will present a lotus formation. Two rounds of march-past are being conducted between 2.30pm and 5.30pm every day in which 89 troupes, each consisting of 32 persons, are taking part. Apart from the cadets from schools and colleges, jawans of Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Railway Protection Force, 120 Infantry Battalion Territorial Army, home guards and traffic police are also taking part in the drill. Volunteers of several organisations, such as Red Cross and Brahma Kumaris, will also be a part of the parade along with four cultural groups from Ganjam, Koraput, Kalahandi and Puri. Police are continuously providing instructions to improve the performance of participants. They are focusing on every minor detail, right from maintenance of gap to guiding the flag bearers. While as many as 20 platoons of police will be deployed in and around the parade place, additional 10 platoons of police force would be deployed at various parts of the city. ""We will intensify frisking of vehicles in the city. Night patrolling will also be intensified,"" said deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi. Adivasi Mela From creating colourful mud houses with thatched roofs to bamboo adornments, participants at the Adivasi Mela are putting in their best efforts to present a grand show during the fair. The 15-day fair will start on the Adivasi Ground from January 26. With the major attraction of the fair being graphic representation of tribal lifestyle, people from around 25 tribal communities of the state are setting up replicas of their hamlets on the fair ground. Products, including food ingredients and tribal jewellery, are also highlights of the fair. Badis (pulse cakes), turmeric, fumigant, tamarind paste, pulses and cereals such as black gram, kendul, mustard and cumin seeds, cinnamon and a large variety of rice will be available apart from handicraft items such as dongriya shawl, comb, wooden and iron crafts of Bhatra and bamboo crafts. This year, around 150 kiosks will be set up. Adequate security arrangements will be made to ensure smooth conduct of the fair, while CCTV cameras would also be installed. The annual fair is organised by the state scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) department."
58f4be8260de4776e36946cc,Green power on Nalanda mind,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160201/jsp/bihar/story_66791.jsp,2016-02-01,"Nalanda University, once constructed, will have a self-sufficient energy source. In doing so, it will join the league of universities such as University of Illinois, University of Massachusetts, Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and IIT-Jodhpur closer home. The upcoming varsity in Rajgir will also focus on economic development of its neighbourhood villages. The university plans to generate power from solar photovoltaic panels, which will be fitted above water bodies on the campus. It would generate power from rice husk, biomass and other renewable sources. According to Nalanda University professional adviser A.R. Ramanathan, as the varsity will meet much of its energy requirement through rice husk and biomass, help and cooperation from villagers will be required. He said: ""The university will purchase rice husk, cow dung and biodegradable waste from nearby villages for power generation."" (Non-biodegradable waste does not break down for many years. Plastics, plastic grocery bags, plastic water bottles, metal and glass are examples of non-biodegradable waste.) Sources said 1 tonne of rice paddy produces around 220kg of rice husk. Similarly, 1 tonne of rice husk produces around 400-550kWh. (kWh is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilowatts and the time in hours.) Sources said the benefits of rice husk technology are numerous as by-products of rice husk, can be used in cement and steel industries. According to Nalanda University officials, farmers selling rice husk and biodegradable waste stand to benefit as regions across Rajgir and Nalanda have an agrarian society with high production of paddy and potatoes. Moreover, the role of university will not be confined to just purchasing raw material from villagers. A team of the university will also enlighten the villagers about the technology. Elaborating the point with an example, Ramanathan said: ""Much of the water requirement will be met from a centrally located pond. The university will focus on harvesting rainwater. Big towers will be constructed to act as air-conditioners. These towers will suck in the outside air, absorb moisture and release it inside the campus."" The university construction work will begin from March-end. Nalanda University vice-chancellor Gopa Sabharwal said: ""The university's academic activities are not just confined to classroom teachings. As part of their curriculum, our students have been visiting nearby villages and interacting with the residents there, imparting knowledge and seeking their cooperation."" The villagers, naturally, are delighted. Ram Naresh Singh, a resident of Rajgir, said: ""We are happy that Nalanda University will help us in social and economic development. It should also focus on educational development of the region. The town is so educationally backward that it doesn't even have a single college to cater to the needs of its residents."" Singh, who runs a grocery shop at the Rajgir market, added: ""The university should take initiatives to open colleges for the youths here. Not everyone here will get a chance to study at Nalanda University."" Colleges and universities essentially operate as self-contained small cities, providing huge amounts of energy to its campuses. Given the large energy needs of our college campuses, combined with the social conscience of today's faculties and students, it is not surprising that institutions across the world are beginning to take a leading role in development and implementation of renewable energy projects."

Normal ration card holders have not received any food items since the past seven years, barring 2.5 litres kerosene per month. Those with an annual income of below Rs 1 lakh are entitled to get this card but there are allegations that many card holders are above poverty line and even serving in government offices, the applicants said. They said they had been asked to submit their applications through a person with a political background. Bina Rani Mandal, 60, wife of late Netai Chandra Mandal of ward 11 in Mistry Patty of Dhubri town, has eight family members. Though one of the two sons is a bread earner, they can hardly manage two meals a day. ""One of my sons is physically challenged and the other works as a carpenter and is our source of income. But he does not earn even Rs 40,000 per year,"" Bina said. She submitted her application to a political leader, reportedly a member of the selection committee for BPL cards. Himangshu Mandal and Gopal Mandal are also residents of the same area and earn less than Rs 1 lakh yearly. They also submitted their forms to a local political leader who claimed to be the member of the selection committee. ""When I went to the local leader he asked me how many votes his party had got in the last civic body poll. Only 22 votes, so how did we expect to be recommended by him?"" said Himangshu Mandal. The applicants demanded that government officials should verify their claim and issue cards instead of leaving it to a committee to recommend their applications. They alleged that if government officials investigated cards that have been issued already, then the truth would come out. Dhubri deputy commissioner Nazrul Islam warned those who had obtained their cards through unfair means to surrender them, else action will be taken against them.

Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, April 4: Five senior PLFI leaders and two members of its armed squad have been arrested from various parts of Ranchi district in, what police termed as, a big blow to the CPI(Maoist) splinter group that has been trying to strengthen its base in rural pockets vacated by the Naxalites in the face of sustained operations by security forces. The arrested PLFI leaders have been identified as Ranchi zonal commander Tulsi Pahan, Bundu-Tamar area commander Bheem Mahto alias Mangal Pandey, Jonha (south) area commander Sunil Kacchap, Jonha (north) area commander Dev Singh Munda and Nagri-Tupudana area commander Birsa Mahto. These apart, Raja Patar and Mukesh Mahto, both members of the outfit's armed squad, have been nabbed during two separate raids carried in Jonha and Nagri area on Sunday. Nine fire weapons, including two double-barrel guns, four country-made rifles and three pistols, around 50 live cartridges, note books, backpacks, levy receipts and 12 mobile phones were recovered from them. Following a tip-off, the Ranchi police, with the help of CRPF, had planned Operation Mahadev to capture the PLFI rebels, who had assembled in Jonha area of Angara, some 45km from the capital, on Sunday apparently to plan some big crime. ""On April 2, police received an input on the movement of around 30 PLFI rebels in Jonha area. Accordingly, Operation Mahadev was planned in coordination with CRPF. During the raid, the joint forces captured Tulsi Pahan, Dev Singh Munda and Raja Patar from their hideout in Jonha on Sunday morning even as others managed to escape,"" Ranchi SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi said at his office where the arrested rebels were produced before the media on Monday. During interrogations, the SSP added, the arrested rebels revealed that the other members of the organisation had fled towards Nagri, around 30km from the city, where they were supposed to loot a petrol bunk. Working on the input, police planned another strike and nabbed the four - Bheem Mahto, Sunil Kacchap, Birsa Mahto and Mukesh Mahto - from Nagri following a brief encounter on Sunday afternoon. No one was injured in the firing. More than a dozen extremists, however, managed to flee. Dwivedi said that the rebels were planning to loot a local petrol pump and terrorise rice factory owners and road contractors for levy in Nagri. ""All the rebels have admitted to their association with PLFI. PLFI head Dinesh Gope and commander Jidan Gudia had instructed them to strengthen the outfit's base in rural areas of Ranchi to replace CPI(Maoist). Gope and his aide Gajju Gope had trained them and used to provide them arms and ammunition. But the arrests have dealt a body blow to the PLFI,"" he added. The rebels have also confessed to their involvement in several incidents of crime, including the attack on a road construction of Madhucon Project Ltd at Salgadih in Tamar last month. A group of PLFI rebels, led by Mangal Pandey, had raided the site along the NH-33 and torched five vehicles engaged in a Rs 1,500-crore four-laning project in Tamar, around 60km from the capital, in the wee hours of March 4. They had also looted the mobile phones from company employees. According to police, Pahan, who was out on bail for last few months, was wanted by police in as many as 10 criminal cases, including murder.

Picture by UB Photos Shillong, Feb. 9: The Meghalaya government is all set to implement the much-awaited National Food Security Act, 2013 from this month. It is expected to benefit more than 21 lakh citizens. The act provides subsidised rice and wheat at a cost of Rs 3 and Rs 2 per kg respectively. Around 21,48,095 citizens - of whom 50.87 per cent are in urban areas and 77.79 per cent in rural areas - will benefit from the act. The beneficiaries will be entitled to 5kg of subsidised foodgrains per month. For those under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), each family will receive 35kg of foodgrains per month. Making the announcement here today, food and civil supplies minister Clement Marak said the state had already received foodgrains allocation from the Centre under the act. He said as per the allocation, monthly quantity of rice for AAY category is 448.53 tonnes while that of wheat is 75.7 tonnes. For the priority category, the amount allotted is 8792.18 tonnes of rice and 1483.85 tonnes of wheat. Marak, however, said the allotment was short of the designated amount as fresh identification of beneficiaries under the AAY scheme is under process. He said this is done to identify genuine families who are the poorest of the poor. At present, only 14,977 AAY families have been identified out of the designated 70,200 families. Marak said that the identification process would be completed in a month. The minister said besides having a dedicated team to implement the act, an end-to-end public distribution scheme computerisation project would facilitate execution of the food security project. Through the computerisation project, foodgrains allocation would be online replacing the manual and strenuous process. Citizens can also avail of the grievance-redressal mechanism."
58f4c09b60de4776e369499e,SC 'secession' lash on Gujarat for food law,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160202/jsp/nation/story_67086.jsp,2016-02-02,"New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Supreme Court today came down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat for failing to implement the National Food Security Act, 2013, wondering whether it wanted to ""break away from India"" and had scant respect for Parliament. The apex court also asked what Parliament and the Centre were doing when the state was not implementing the food law. The bench felt that if Gujarat was allowed to have its way, other states following the law would also stop doing so, citing Gujarat as an example. The food law guarantees 5kg of rice/wheat to each member of a family. Under the programme that seeks to cover 75 per cent of the families in rural areas and 50 per cent of the households in cities, the rice is to be provided at Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2. The court was hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, Swaraj Abhiyan, saying the act should cover all families in 11 drought-affected states. Ranjit Kumar, representing the Centre, told the bench during the hearing that Gujarat was one of the states not implementing the food law at all. Kumar - who at the last hearing had been asked to collate information from all states on the scheme - said Gujarat had certain reservations over the programme. The reply invited the wrath of the bench, comprising Justices Madan B. Lokur and R.K. Agrawal. ""You (Gujarat government) want to break away from the Union of India? It is an act passed by Parliament. Tomorrow, Bihar will say we are not implementing it because Gujarat is not implementing it,"" Justice Lokur, heading the bench, told Kumar. Neither Kumar nor the Gujarat government's standing counsel, Hemantika Wahi, could give any convincing reply, except for saying the state was yet to take a decision. At this, the bench observed: ""A law is passed by Parliament. Tomorrow, some other states will say we will not implement it. What is the Government of India doing? What is Parliament doing? What about the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code)? Tomorrow, some other states will say we are not going to implement it (CrPC), we will not implement the IPC, the Indian Evidence Act."" The solicitor-general replied that besides Gujarat, eight other states were not implementing the food law but pleaded that he did not immediately have details about them. ""Today it is Gujarat, tomorrow Bihar.... Then, Chhattisgarh, Haryana will say the same thing. Where is the system going? Jharkhand has been implementing, but from tomorrow they will be saying Gujarat is not doing it, we will not do it. Karnataka is doing it (implementing the scheme), they will say we will not implement. Madhya Pradesh will say we are not implementing. Telangana will say the same thing,"" Justice Lokur observed. As Kumar tried to make some submissions, the bench asked twice: ""Gujarat is unique? Gujarat is unique?"" The court made it clear that ""we are nobody to tell you (the Gujarat government) what you should be doing"". ""But the question is whether you believe in Parliament, or Indian laws? As of now, the law (Act) stands or not? If not, why?"" the bench asked. Later, the bench directed the solicitor-general to place before the court details of the scheme's implementation in various states by February 12 and posted the matter for further hearing on February 15. Swaraj Abhiyan counsel Prashant Bhushan and Pranav Sachdeva pleaded that besides 5kg of rice/wheat free for each person, all families in the drought-hit states should be given 2kg free dal and 1kg of edible oil. Children should be provided an egg free daily or 200ml of milk. The NGO has also sought an increase in the 100 days of guaranteed work each year for a household under rural employment scheme NREGA to 150 days in the drought-affected states. The states are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh."

Ramaswami presenting seed money cheques to members of a women farmer group at a meeting in Agricultural College and Research Institute in Madurai on Monday. Photo: R. AshokConsidering the steady decline in cultivable area across the State, it was high time farmers learnt the nuances of technology in farm activities, said Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Vice-Chancellor K. Ramasami here on Monday.Inaugurating a one-day awareness-cum-interaction programme for progressive farmers on system of rice intensification (SRI) technique, he said that despite limitations, agriculture sectors contribution to countrys economy had been pivotal. A look at the five year plans indicated that there had been vast improvement from the third five-year plan to the seventh five-year plan in terms of production of foodgrains.In the event of changing trends, farmers were compelled to learn new techniques and advancements which would ensure that the sector survived, Dr. Ramasami said and added that sharing success stories and learning through seminars and interactions with scientists at agricultural universities and research stations would certainly help farmers to a great extent.Distributing cheques for Rs. 10,000 each towards seed money to various women farmers groups from the district on the occasion, he urged them to look for value addition to their produce to attract more consumers.In his presidential address, H. Philip, Director (Extension), said that students and farmers were the two eyes of the agricultural university. Through the Krishi Vigyan Kendras, research activities were on in full pace. New techniques attracted youngsters and by roping them in to take up agriculture, the State can bring in more awards and rewards, he noted.AC and RI Dean I. Muthusami and Home Science College Dean C. Parvathi offered felicitations. Earlier, Joint Director (Agriculture) S. Kanagaraj welcomed the gathering and programme coordinator P. Subburaj proposed a vote of thanks.SRI techniqueLater, in a brief chat with reporters, he said that presently, eight lakh hectares in the State were covered under SRI technique and it had been decided to cover 12 lakh hectares shortly. Out of 58 lakh hectares covered under the cultivable area in the State, 12 lakh ha had been held by corporate houses and industries for non-agricultural purposes. As a result, the farmers were compelled to adapt modern technologies and use machines to speed up the process and reap in profits as well as step up productivity.On July 5, a scientific workers conference would be held at Coimbatore in which new varieties developed by scientists would be presented, he said."
58f4cab4a3d24b0b70c19777,The ambiguities of gurudom,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-ambiguities-of-gurudom/article14391469.ece,2016-06-05,"Newspaper reports on the Jawahar Bagh killings in Mathura followed in quick succession accounts of the extravaganza hosted by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on the floodplain of the Yamuna in Delhi. Both reports reinforce convictions that our world is best described as topsy-turvy. There was a time when statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru believed that religion was dangerous because it convinced followers that hunger, filth and misery were their natural lot. Today god-men, accomplished practitioners of the art of politics, wield considerable power and political clout. But they wilfully overlook, and thereby sanction misery, hunger and filth.Consider the paradoxes of this rapidly growing phenomenon. Men of god are expected to be renouncers. New-age gurus dress in flashy apparel, travel in luxurious private planes, host celebrations attended by pomp and splendour, and endeavour to arouse shock and awe among devotees. Ministers, Supreme Court judges, high-ranking bureaucrats, police officers, corporate honchos, and media personalities genuflect at the feet of self-styled gurus. Never have religious leaders fetched such unthinking obeisance, and untrammelled power as they do today. It is not surprising that they have neither time nor inclination to do something about the ills of our society.Down the agesThis was not always so. In all religions, visionary spiritual leaders have challenged hierarchies and disparities, exploitation and discrimination of the community. From the sixth to the sixteenth century the Bhakti movement launched a powerful attack on caste-based discrimination in Hinduism. Till today the subversive poetry authored by Kabir is remembered, recited and sung. Pandit, he addressed the Brahmin, look in your heart to know. Tell me how untouchability was born  untouchability is what you made so.Right up till the turn of the twentieth century, a number of religious leaders driven by the quest for a moral order, and fired by the belief that untouchability was a later appendage to Hinduism, tried to retrieve the spiritual essence of the religion. Over the millennia, others threw up their metaphorical hands in despair, broke away and established new religions  Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Hinduism, smudged deeply by social exclusion, became the object of struggle, the target of social reform movements, and often the butt of ridicule.Do we see any of this questioning by cults today? Perhaps not. Self-styled gurus can hardly launch a critique of a system of which they are the beneficiaries. When the spiritual leader of the infamous Swadheen Bharat Subhas Sena, Jai Gurudev, died in 2012, he reportedly left property and land worth Rs.12,000 crore, a school, a petrol pump, a temple that secured him immortality, ashrams, assets, and luxury cars. Hinduism is a religion that teaches detachment; ironically, leaders of cults are passionately attached to worldly possessions, power and pelf. Their power is on public display. Certainly, Indians have bowed their foreheads before gurus, renouncers, holy men, savants and peripatetic sadhus since time immemorial. But these transactions between believers and faith leaders were private, confidential and sacrosanct. These days transactions are public affairs; conspicuously orchestrated mega-events are televised and breathlessly consumed by a global constituency.Soulless world and leadersWhy do then thousands of people flock to new-age gurus on show? Perhaps there is an answer. Within the tradition, the guru spent many years mastering philosophical knowledge because his role was that of a medium between individuals and the divine. He himself was never the divine. Yet access to the spiritual leader was restricted through elaborate rituals of exclusion of castes and often women.The prime attraction of todays guru is that he/she is accessible to all. The gates of spiritual wisdom have been thrown open, gatekeepers have been dispensed with, and religious philosophy has been democratised. Whether the leader himself is a democrat is questionable. But that does not matter for people who have been left rudderless in a world of vulgar consumerism and stark disparities. They have lost confidence in their ability to negotiate the demands of a market-driven society. In capitalist society the value of a person is judged by the value of her possessions. Individuals themselves become commodities at considerable cost to their self-esteem and assurance.Social norms breed despair, and the guru becomes the healer, the confidant, and the protective patriarch or matriarch. In a commodity-driven world, where ordinary people lurch  like a fragile raft on stormy waters  from one crisis to another, religion becomes as Marx had said, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of the soulless condition. The problem is not with religion, it is with this soulless world that many seek to negotiate with the help of a religious leader.The quest for reassurance and validation of the self through face-to-face interaction with a local deity, or saint or a god-man is not new. In Punjab, for years Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs worshipped together at roadside shrines, or at the tomb of a Sufi saint. In the town of Malerkotla, Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs offer money, jewels, and cooked sweet rice at the mazaar of Sheikh Sadr-ud-Din, the founder of Malerkotla and a Sufi saint. Thousands of people visit a fair held on the first Thursday of every month. In 1904 the author of the Malerkotla Gazetteer wrote in a puzzled mien, It is strange that these fairs are mostly attended by Hindus though Sadr-ud-Din was a Muslim saint. This is a town of Sufi tombs, temple bells hang in front of mosques, and Om is tattooed on the hands of the keeper of the shrine. Notably Malerkotla has never witnessed a communal riot, simply because joint worship created a political community. It is debatable whether modern gurus teach followers to live in harmony with other fellow beings. At best, they teach instant moksha , at worst they exploit followers.Hindutva versus god-menIronically personalised worship to a new-age guru has recreated multiple centres of belief that are characteristic of Hinduism. Historians tell us that the unified religion we call Hinduism is a colonial construct, because it were colonial administrators and missionaries who lumped various groups, philosophies, faiths, and ideologies under the umbrella term Hinduism. Neo-Hindu leaders, buffeted by criticism of practices sanctioned by Hinduism, responded to the colonial encounter by projecting a pan-Indian religion.Over time this religion provided identity and inspiration to sections of the nationalist movement. V.D. Savarkar refused to accept that Hinduism is of relatively recent provenance, and suggested that the religion goes back into ancient time. He called it Hindutva, an ideology that forms the crux of the homogenising project of the religious Right. The irony is that Hindutva can only go so far, it contributes to identity formation through differentiation, but it cannot fill empty or half-filled pockets, give jobs, assure dignity, promise security, or allay insecurities and complexes. That only an urban-based guru or a cult, which has replaced the traditional roadside shrine, can give.The contradiction is that even if gurudom feeds into the project of Hindutva, spiritual leaders exercise, for the state, dangerous autonomy. For example, Jawahar Bagh developed into an independent township within the precincts of a sovereign India. Its inhabitants established an economy, an educational system, a currency, and imparted training in violence to the children. They also created a rather wacky political and economic agenda, but one that posed a challenge to the government. That gurus influence considerably the electoral fortunes of the local candidate is the worst-kept secret in India. That is why politicians court them.We know that Hindutva is fractured along the lines of caste and class. But it is also a brittle construct because it has to compete with personalised religious cults for the loyalties of citizens. Over time, the project is bound to come a cropper, because what we call Hinduism is nothing but a time-bound coalition of cults, religious groups, personalised modes of worship and localised gods. These relentlessly subvert the homogenising ideology of Hindutva. For the rational, god-men are irrational, for the votaries of Hindutva they provide a rather major headache.Neera Chandhoke is a former Professor of Political Science, Delhi University.These days transactions are public affairs; conspicuously orchestrated mega-events are televised and breathlessly consumed bya global constituency"

Telegraph picture Dhubri, Feb. 10: The son of AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal and legislator from South Salmara Assembly constituency, Abdur Rahman Ajmal, today staged a sit-in in front of the Dhubri deputy commissioner's office with a host of party leaders and workers, protesting against gross anomalies in selection of beneficiaries under National Food Security Act, 2013, in Dhubri district. The AIUDF leaders alleged that a committee has been formed to select beneficiaries of the food scheme who are below poverty line, but its members comprise Congress workers. They added that the ruling party is selecting those who are either its supporters or members as beneficiaries of the scheme. They alleged that a large number of beneficiaries have already been enrolled under the scheme who are not entitled to get ration cards, but now they get rice at Rs 3 per kg. On the sidelines of the sit-in, Ajmal junior alleged that the selection committee had tried to select beneficiaries on the basis of their allegiance towards the Congress without following the guidelines of the act. ""This is out and out injustice to the people who deserve benefits under this scheme, but they are being deprived of it. We are staging a sit-in to voice their grievances,"" he said. Working president of the AIUDF, South Salmara ""district committee"", Solaiman Hoque, alleged that a seven-member block-level selection committee was formed, headed by the BDO as chairman, and its non-official members were from the Congress. ""The discrimination is an open secret when the first list of beneficiaries was published recently and cards were issued,"" Hoque said. He said they were surprised to know that the persons selected as beneficiaries are government employees, pension holders, advocates, established businessmen and owners of vehicles who do not fall within the provisions of ""small and marginal categories"" as specified in the act."

""She said there were some complications in taking over the estates as they were under the BIFR.

""Mr Trump's own statements lead us to conclude that as president, he would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world,"" the signatories wrote in a letter yesterday. ""Furthermore, his expansive view of how presidential power should be wielded against his detractors poses a distinct threat to civil liberty in the United States,"" said the letter, which was posted on a blog called War on the Rocks. The full text of the letter can be seen at http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/. The signatories include Robert Zoellick, a former World Bank president and deputy secretary of state; former US homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff; and Dov Zakheim, a top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush. They represent both centrist Republican foreign policy circles and neo-conservatives who favour a robust US international role and wielded clout during Bush's 2001-2009 tenure. Billionaire businessman Trump won the largest number of states in this week's Super Tuesday nominating contests, intensifying moves by the party's establishment wing to derail his path to the nomination. Today, Trump in an interview with ABC News flatly rejected the criticism in the letter and blasted the nation's military leaders as ineffective. Bryan McGrath, a retired US Navy officer and adviser to Mitt Romney's unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign who helped organise the letter, said at least two persons declined to sign because of concerns it would fuel Trump's campaign theme of being an anti-Washington candidate opposed by the establishment. ""This is really drawing a bright moral line and saying that if we're going to keep our souls we can't cross it,"" said Eliot Cohen, who served as counsellor to former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and helped spearhead the letter. He said the list of signatures had grown to at least 75 by this morning. The signatories did not include several high-profile former officials such as Rice, Bush national security advisor Stephen Hadley or former secretary of state Colin Powell. It was unknown if they were invited to sign. The letter rejects numerous Trump foreign policy statements, including his anti-Muslim comments; his demand that Mexico fund a wall to control illegal immigration across the US border; and his insistence that Japan pay much more for US security assistance. ""As committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a Party ticket with Trump at its head,"" the signatories said. ""We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office."" The War on the Rocks blog calls itself a platform for former diplomats, military and intelligence officers and scholars to comment ""through a realist lens"" on global affairs. Trump has alarmed some mainstream Republicans with vows to shred international trade deals. Many fear a Trump presidency would severely strain ties with allies and are concerned about his stated willingness to work more closely with authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also has criticised the Republican Party for its backing of Bush's 2003 Iraq invasion and has said he supports the controversial practice of waterboarding and other similar interrogation techniques. Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign and supporter of the Iraq invasion, was among the letter's signers and said he ""would sooner work for (North Korean dictator) Kim Jong-un than for Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is objectively more dangerous than Kim Jong-un and not as stable."" Kurt Volker, a permanent representative to Nato under Bush, said he did not sign the letter because of concerns that any letter from ""national security intelligentsia"" could backfire. ""He would actually use it as a bragging right,"" said Volker, adding that he had no intention of working for Trump but wanted to be free to offer advice to any future president."

It will be put into effect in Kohima and Dimapur districts from June 1 and in all the other districts from July 1, he said.Paswan said the state government had assured him that all the pre-conditions for implementation of the act would be fulfilled. New ration cards are being printed and online allocation of grains will be started immediately, he added.The coverage of Aadhaar cards has gone up to 65 per cent and ration cards will soon be seeded with Aadhaar to improve transparency in the public distribution system, he said.Asked whether allocation of rice could be increased in Nagaland in place of wheat, since the state is a rice-consuming state, the minister replied that if the state government requests the Centre, it could be considered.Paswan said on the state's request, a special task force, comprising officers from the state government, the Food Corporation of India and the Centre, had been constituted to settle the hill transport subsidy claims of Nagaland, mounting to over Rs 700 crore.The committee is to submit the report, regarding bills/claims pending for over 20 years, by July 30.Over the years the state has been marred by anomalies in the civil supplies. The Action Committee Against Unabated Taxation, Nagaland, has demanded immediate implementation of the Food Security Act in the state.Paswan said he would visit Dimapur in October to attend a rally of Lok Janshakti Party."

(AFP) Nay Pi Taw (Myanmar), Feb. 1 (Reuters): Hundreds of lawmakers from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League of Democracy were sworn into Myanmar's parliament on Monday, with enough seats to choose the country's first democratically elected government since the military took power in 1962. The NLD won some 80 per cent of elected seats in November's historic vote, catapulting it to power as Myanmar's ruling party after decades of struggle that saw many of its members imprisoned. But the junta-drafted Constitution means the party will have to share power with the army that for years suppressed, often brutally, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and her allies. The first sitting of the NLD-dominated parliament is another step in Myanmar's drawn-out transition, which started with the election and will go on until the NLD government officially begins its term in April after parliament has picked a President. ""This is Myanmar's first parliament in years that was chosen by the people,"" said Pyon Cho, who is now a lawmaker and spent 20 years in jail as a member of the anti-junta group the 88 Generation Students. ""We have the majority. We have the duty to fulfil our manifesto and change the lives of the people in this country."" Some new members looked disoriented as they wandered through the enormous parliament building in the purpose-built capital raised by the junta in secret from the rice paddies. The presidential nomination process is likely to take place later in the month, NLD members said. Under the 2008 Constitution, Suu Kyi is barred from taking the position because her children are not Myanmar citizens. She has given no indication as to who will take over from outgoing President Thein Sein and the NLD has no clear number two. Suu Kyi has said she will be ""above the President"" and in complete control of the government, but the NLD has not explained how she will do this. Each of the parliament's two chambers will choose a presidential candidate and the military officials who hold a quarter of seats will also put forward their own nominee. A combined session of the chambers will then vote on the three candidates. The winner will become President, with the other two serving as vice-presidents. This week, the NLD will focus on appointing parliamentary speakers, who were announced last week. It will also prepare for the start of state and regional assemblies on February 8, some in places dominated by large ethnic minorities such as Shan State in the east or Rakhine in the west. Expectations are towering for Suu Kyi, who is regarded with an almost religious zeal in the Southeast Asian nation. Suu Kyi spent 15 years under house arrest after the NLD won an election in 1990. The junta never recognised the result of that vote. Myanmar's 51.5 million people expect the NLD to fix everything, from completing the transformation of an economy stunted by decades of isolation to bringing peace to states riven by ethnic conflict."

I carry items like wheat, onions and rice to towns in north Bengal at least 10 times a month,"" truck driver Joginder Singh said showing the card. The driver said the card system had started about six months back. ""We are approached by agents at the roadside eateries who collect the money and issue the cards that are with them in bunches and have serial numbers. Our vehicle number is written on the card, along with its validity period,"" another driver said. NH31 starts from Dalkhola in North Dinajpur district. The highway enters Kishanganj for 7km and again runs through the Bengal district for about 43km through Chakulia police station area. According to police sources, there are three check-posts of the Chakulia police along the route. ""The check-posts are meant to carry out the scrutiny of the goods trucks carry and check if the vehicles have valid permits. Even the identity of the occupants of the trucks is verified as the highway leads to Nepal,"" said a police source. The drivers alleged that the Kishenganj and the Chakulia police harassed them to no end. Kishenganj SP Rajeev Ranjan denied that the system was prevalent in his jurisdiction. ""In any case NH31 passes through the town area and if there was such extortion, we would have come to know. No one has complained to me. I have asked the North Dinajpur police superintendent to look into the allegations,"" Ranjan said. North Dinajpur police superintendent, Amit Kumar Bharat Rathore, said: ""I have not received any complaints but I will definitely look into the matter."""
