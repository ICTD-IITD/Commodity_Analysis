58f4cfd260de470aa339bfe3,10-yr yearning for a hospital,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160322/jsp/northeast/story_75826.jsp,2016-03-22,"The public health centre at Dwarbond. Picture by Nilotpal Bhattacharjee Mitra Das, a resident of Pratappur village, lost her husband last year owing to lack of medical facilities. Rajesh Dohar's mother Anima, 73, of Dwarbond had recently died while she was being taken to Silchar Medical College and Hospital. These are not isolated incidents as many deaths were reported in the Greater Dwarbond area in the past several years because of the absence of medical facilities. ""Our nearest hospital is Silchar Medical College. The Greater Dwarbond area comprises four gaon panchayats and has a population of around 50,000. We have been demanding a 30-bed hospital in Dwarbond for the past many years, but our pleas fell on deaf ears,"" Piklu Bhattacharjee, a member of Dwarbond Hospital Demand Committee, said. Prior to the Parliamentary elections in 2004, chief minister Tarun Gogoi, while campaigning for Congress candidate Santosh Mohan Dev, had assured that he would grant a hospital if Dev was elected. ""Since then more than 10 years have passed, but we have not yet got the hospital,"" Bhattacharjee added. The Greater Dwarbond area falls under Dholai Assembly constituency of minister Girindra Mallick. ""The medical college is around 40km from my village Pratappur which is located on the boundary of Cachar and Hailakandi districts. As the area is located on the outskirts, there is hardly any public transport. After dusk, it becomes difficult to get any transport,"" said Indrajit Sinha, a schoolteacher. The area also has seven major tea gardens and most of the people there are poor. ""There is a public health centre at Borjalenga, but we hardly get any sort of facilities from there. Medicines are always unavailable,"" said villagerLakshmi Charan Akhura. ""Several people living in the area are tea garden labourers. They get Rs 105 as wage per day which is not enough to look after a family of four to five members. When someone falls ill, it becomes very difficult to take the patient to the medical college because it requires transportation cost,"" Akhura, who was a former worker of Iringmara tea estate, said. There is a public health centre near Dwarbond village. Despite having complete infrastructure, the residents complain that the centre has not yet been inaugurated. When this correspondent visited the centre, there were rice straws dumped in the rooms. The nearby buildings of the centre have become a shelter for animals. ""The buildings have been lying abandoned for the past several years. Why build a health centre when it was never supposed to serve people? It was an instance of how public money is being wasted. On a lighter note, I want to say that this is the picture of development that has taken place in Assam,"" said Arun Goala, a shopkeeper. The area is plagued by water scarcity, diarrhoea is rampant. ""Most of the waterbodies dry up during winter. In some areas, people need to walk miles to fetch drinking water,"" said Akhura. Hillol Bhattacharjee, a social activist, fears spread of Maoism in these rural areas. ""The Maoist cadres may take advantage of the abject poverty. A few months back, police picked up two persons for being involved in Maoist activities. They were, however, released later,"" he said."
58f4cffb60de470aa339c019,Uncertainty grips hoteliers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160205/jsp/northeast/story_67527.jsp,2016-02-05,"Performers rehearse in Guwahati on Thursday for the opening ceremony of the South Asian Games. Picture by UB PhotosGuwahati, Feb. 4: An air of uncertainty prevails among hoteliers here over non-receipt of advance payments for rooms blocked by the 12th South Asian Games organising committee till this afternoon and cancellations only days prior to the event. The Games, billed as the biggest multi-disciplinary international event in the Northeast, will get under way at different venues in and around Guwahati and Shillong from tomorrow. ""There is uncertainty prevailing here, as despite a meeting with the administration and the organising committee on Tuesday, the 30 per cent advance payments (which is a part of the agreement) are yet to be made to most hotels here. However, despite the odds, we are doing all that we can to ensure that the occupants are at home,"" a hotelier who owns a resort in the Sonapur area told The Telegraph today, requesting anonymity. The lack of a Games Village for the event meant that the organisers had to put up delegates in as many as 84 hotels and lodges in Guwahati and about 50 in Shillong. ""Worse still, as of now, we have just 40 per cent occupancy with the organisers cancelling the rest of the rooms just a few days back despite blocking them for the entire duration of the Games three months ahead of the event. This means that we might incur losses. The agreement was signed with our resort on January 19,"" he said. To be fair to the organising committee though, the number of participants, including athletes and officials, has come down from about 4,000 to 3,333 because of last-minute pullouts. ""Coordination on the part of the organisers is questionable. We do not know when the players/officials are checking in. We are offering 35 rooms to the Pakistani team/officials but only 15 were occupied till late last evening,"" said a hotelier in the GS Road area. However, a source from the organising committee here said since some of the bills were submitted by the hotels only yesterday, they had to be verified. The money was credited into their respective accounts this evening, he added. One of the hoteliers (connected through a WhatsApp group), said the money had not been credited into the account of most hoteliers till late in the evening. In Shillong, hoteliers alleged that the organising committee has not, till the eve of the Games, entered into any agreement for the rooms blocked. ""The organisers have so far maintained silence on written agreements with hoteliers here. Everything has so far been verbal,"" the owner of a guesthouse in Laban told this correspondent. As it is, most hotels here and in Shillong are offering discounts on tariff. The owner, however, expressed satisfaction over the rates offered by the organisers on the menu. Food for thought The hotels are offering an elaborate menu for the participants, including complimentary breakfast. Breakfast: 17 items, including fruit juice, cereals, fresh fruits, eggs, milk, bread, curd, idli, uttapam, dosa, poori-bhaji, baked beans, tea/coffee, bakery items, meat (lamb/chicken sausage) and noodles. Lunch/dinner: 13 items from Indian, Continental and Chinese spreads, including soup, salads, fresh fruits, curd, paneer, dal, vegetables, rice, noodles, assorted Indian bread ( naan, roti, paratha), sweets (gulab jamun, gajar ka halwa, sevainyan, rasgulla, rice kheer) and desserts (ice cream/souffle/custard/pastry)."
58f4d00e60de470aa339c034,Lights! Camera! Organic!,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160205/jsp/northeast/story_67541.jsp,2016-02-05,"Participants in the workshop. Telegraph picture Jorhat, Feb. 4: For these filmmakers, the land and the soil beckon. What they are out to promote is organic. Filmmakers Ishana Raj from Mumbai and Krista Slavik from the US have accompanied Peggy Carswell of Fertile Ground, Vancouver Island, Canada, to make short films on pesticides, fertilisers and how crops can be grown without chemical additives in Assam. They were accompanied by linguistic expert Emily Rainton from the US. The four were participating in a training workshop on organic farming and seeds preservation organised by the Internal Quality Assessment Cell-NAAC and Community College, UGC, in collaboration with Annapurna Seeds Library, Kathgaon, Meleng and NGO Fertile Ground at Kendriya Mahavidyalaya, Kenduguri, here. Fertile Ground, headquartered near Vancouver, has been working with farmers of Assam and small tea growers to promote sustainable traditional agriculture and strengthen grassroots organisational capacity since more than a decade now and has taken up a few projects here, besides providing support to small organic tea growers in acquiring small-scale processing equipment. Ishana is preparing to release her first feature film - to be a comeback vehicle for Arvind Swamy of Roja fame. Ishana said she was drawn to what Fertile Ground was doing and contacted the group over the Internet. She had also gone to Vancouver Island where she met Krista and formed a tie-up. Krista said they had already shot small videos that showed trainers in action and other clips on how to make compost from materials available. ""We hope to shoot more, showing how pesticides and fertilisers can be made without chemicals and then put them up in public forum like YouTube and other websites so that the whole world can access them,"" she said. Fertile Ground had earlier uploaded one such video on YouTube, which has garnered 82,000 views. In her presentation, Peggy raised the issue of genetically modified (GM) crops. India has allowed the growing of 14 GM crops, including mustard and brinjal. Many countries, including Canada, Mexico and England, have said no to GM crops. It is up to you how you deal with this issue. It will contaminate the local variety of seeds and we would like farmers to work and grow what they have as their own,"" Peggy said. Mahaan Bora, a farmer who has collected more than 800 varieties of indigenous rice seeds from all over the state and has planted them in small areas in his farmland in order to keep the germplasm in tact, also appealed for the purity of the indigenous varieties. He also appealed to all the colleges to maintain a biodiversity register so that all the herbs and plants could be documented. Students had brought their own collections of rice seeds, which were on display in an area of the college. Fertile Ground is doing two projects - one at Digboi in collaboration with the IOCL, Rotary Club and Axum Agri, an NGO and the other at Kakojan College where they have set up a model organic farm and are trying to chalk out a certificate course on organic farming. It is also working with Axum Agri in five villages of Margherita in Tinsukia. Apart from this, it is involved in training farmers and small tea growers. ""We are looking for an experienced person in organic agriculture for the post of manager. Apart from this, we also require volunteers and trainers. A website is in the making where all organic growers can connect. From February 10-14 there will be the Organic Small Tea Growers Association of Northeast conclave at Dimakusi, Udalguri district, and we are expecting farmers from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh to come. Buyers of organic tea from Canada are also scheduled to arrive and attend the conclave. We would like this to become a movement,"" Krista said."
58f4d03860de470aa339c06b,Exporters brace for tough time in Iran,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160127/jsp/business/story_66012.jsp,2016-01-27,"New Delhi, Jan. 26: Indian exporters are set to face a stiff competition in the Iranian market following the withdrawal of sanctions as other countries will try to sell their products at a competitive price. However, New Delhi will try to take advantage of the robust rupee trade between the two nations during the sanction era and build on that. ""The competition will intensify following the lifting of sanctions and exporters will have to competitively price their products and enhance standards to compete in the Iranian market,"" S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo), said. The withdrawal of sanction is expected to add pressure to the global crude price, which has touched a low of around $30 per barrel. Refiners can now source more crude from Tehran, which had lost its market share in the country. ""Iran will gradually ramp up production by 0.5 million barrels per day over the next six months. This will add to the overall supply glut and further softening of crude prices,"" K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president at rating agency Icra, said. India's import of crude oil from Iran has dropped to 10 million tonnes (mt) in the last fiscal from 21mt in 2008-09. The share of Iranian crude in the country's total oil imports has slumped to less than 5 per cent during this eight-year period from more than 16 per cent. Ralhan said India should focus on exporting both goods and services in sectors such as IT, iron and steel, chemicals and machinery as investments would increase in Iran. India mainly exports cereals, man-made fibres, plastics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, steel and aluminium to Iran. However, exporters of agricultural commodities such as sugar and barley maintain that they will lose the rupee trade advantage as other countries will be able to price their products competitively. ""Iran is shifting to other suppliers such as South American countries who are selling at much lower prices compared with India. We cannot compete,"" B.V. Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors' Association of India, said. However, All India Rice Exporters' Association expect the export of aromatic, high-quality basmati rice to Iran to rise to 1mt this year."
58f4d0a960de470aa339c11c,‘Please have some mercy’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/odisha/story_76448.jsp,2016-03-26,"An internal rebellion has been cooking up in your party for the past two years. The difference of opinions among leaders, even ministers, have come to the fore. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout raised his voice against you on potato scarcity. What is happening? Our party is democratic. We may have some difference of opinion. Our outlook on a particular issue may be different. But, there is no question of dissension. When the leadership decides something, we all stand by it. Besides, Rout is a senior leader. If he advises something, we try to follow it. Sometimes, I give my views. But it should not be treated as serious difference of opinion. But, Rout has said that the potato crisis was caused by lack of co-ordination among various departments Ours is a potato-consuming state. We have 10 agro-climatic zones and each zone is identified with certain crops. We have not been able to produce the required amount of potato to meet our demands. Besides potato production has come down by 30 per cent in the neighbouring Bengal. With the launch of Potato Mission, we have come up with an integrated planning to meet the needs of tuber. This year, there will be a constant flow of potato to the market, but the price of potato will remain on the upper side. To overcome shortage of potato in the future, we are coming up with a number of cold storages. But will our dependence on Bengal continue? We have to depend on Bengal as it is a neighbouring state. Both on transport and economic grounds, it is advisable to bring in potato from Bengal. We have already told the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to rethink the issue and see how more trucks of potato can come from other parts of the country. Besides, the Centre has brought potato and onion under the purview of essential commodities. So now, there will be barrier-free movement of these two products. People are not getting rice under public distribution system as there are lapses in the distribution of ration cards. Genuine beneficiaries are not getting ration and bungling of ration cards has been a major issue As we have taken up the exercise, many lapses may occur. But we are trying to make it error-free. Once digitisation of ration cards is complete, all these issues will be sorted out. If mistakes are noticed, we will rectify those. But to bring 3.5 crore people under Food Security Act is a huge task. The state is demanding more rice. Do you expect the Centre to oblige? The people prefer rice. If the Centre forces us to take wheat, what can we do? We have put pressure on the Centre to give us required rice and not wheat. The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG) has found out a number of lapses in the technical education imparted even in government-run colleges. How do you react to the charges? After placement of the report in the Assembly, I have asked for compliance of the report from the department, particularly on the loopholes. Once it is over, I will be able to give you a clear picture on this issue. Question marks have been raised on the quality of technical education We are taking a number of steps to reform the technical education sector. Earlier, our students had to appear the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) and all-India JEE. But we have now opted for JEE so that our students compete at the all-India level. We have got the desired results as well. But technical education at the national level faces a number of hurdles. Employment opportunities have come down in the core subjects. But, there is a demand in computer and software-related subjects and the situation is not alarming. You had started a special recruitment drive for the technically qualified people. But it has been stopped midway We had prepared a vision chart taking 10 factors into account. We have been able to achieve five targets, such as winding up of the diploma entrance test, opting for the JEE (Mains) and a few other things. But in the case of recruitment drive, we have not achieved success so far. When we were preparing to move ahead in this matter and hold discussions with 23 industrial houses, a lot of politics took place over the issue. We had an aim that the government would provide the platform. As it has not been possible so far, the deemed universities and the respective colleges are doing their own campus recruitment. However, I agree that unemployment is still a major problem. You are in the news as your opponents have alleged that you had taken undue favour from money collection company Artha Tatwa by accepting an SUV I expect the media to be just. I have taken loan from Vijaya Bank to buy the SUV. This can be checked from the bank and from the regional transport officer (RTO) as well. If anyone has any doubts, they can approach the CBI. But people think that you had taken favour from the deposit collection company Please have some mercy. If I had taken the vehicle as gift from the company and someone proves it, I will consume poison and not show my face to anyone. Have some sympathy for me. Why are you not examining the documents which were circulated by my political opponents? Please verify the authenticity of the documents from the advocate generals office or from the CBI. Nearly 4,000 people from your constituency had taken out a rally from Brahmagiri and demanded arrest of Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra who had made these allegations The Congress had called a 12-hour Brahmagiri bandh on the issue. But the people of Brahmagiri have reposed their faith in me and they want to take the case to a logical end. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra had used some harsh words against you... The people of Brahmagiri and Odisha will decide this issue. But I will wait and will take proper action at the proper time. I express my deep regrets if I have ever used any foul language against my opponent in the media. I dont want to stoop to such a level where people will equate me with Mohapatra. I had also lost election in Brahmagiri in the past, but had never done any vilification of anyone. After I won the election, I was expecting the same democratic values. But no due recognition was given to the democratic process. What can I say if somebody crosses the limits and behaves like a mad person? Did you raise the issue with your party president? I have already informed him about all these political developments, particularly how I had got the SUV by taking loans from the bank. There is no need to explain to him in details as he had already experienced a bit of the political heat during his tour to Brahmagiri. You have been the BJD youth wing president for nine years. You are also closely associated with the decision-making processes of the party. There is a perception that both the BJD and the BJP have a tacit understanding even though your party continues to oppose some of Centres decisions We are maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Being a regional party, we have our regional aspirations. Our prime and foremost duty is to see that we should get our due from Centre. The tax should be equally distributed among the states and there should not be any regional disparity. Our demand for special category state should be given due importance and other issues, such as Polavaram irrigation project, which will submerge vast swathe of area, be addressed. That means you will continue with your demand for a special category state status? Yes. We will do it to fulfil the aspirations of the people of this region. While you are saying you are opposing the BJP-led government at the Centre, your actions dont show it. All of you, including your partys 20 MPs, remained silent on the issue of shifting of wagon factory from Narla in Kalahandi district to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh till it came to light through an RTI activist The chief minister had personally written to the Centre regarding the wagon factory. When it was made public, we had also raised the issue in the Assembly. We had made our stand clear in the Assembly and later it was supported by the Congress. So there is no need to be suspicious about the states motive. Though Naveen Patnaiks leadership remains undisputed, has he created a second rung of leaders within the party? The people of Odisha have reposed their faith in Naveen babu and with his inspiration everyone is trying to take Odisha forward to fulfil Biju Patnaiks dreams. The BJD does not need an alternative leadership at this moment."
58f4d0d460de470aa339c15a,Effort on to find new tea owners: Nirmala,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160104/jsp/siliguri/story_61965.jsp,2016-01-04,"Nirmala Sitharaman in Bundapani tea estate in Alipurduar on Sunday. Picture by Anirban Choudhury Jan. 3: Nirmala Sitharaman, the Union minister of state for commerce who is touring tea estates in north Bengal, today said the Centre was working in co-ordination with the state government to find new owners for gardens that are shut and are not mired in litigation. Sitharaman visited two estates in Alipurduar district - Bundapani, which is closed, and Birpara that is ailing - and in both the places workers told her that the Centre should take steps to open the gardens as they did not want to live on subsidised food grain. There are nine closed tea gardens in the Dooars. Fourteen tea gardens of Duncans Industries Ltd are ailing and the company is in the sick bay, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. At Bundapani, a garden worker told her: ""We get food grains but it is inadequate and the quality of rice substandard. Also, there is no water supply and we have to draw water from nearby water bodies."" The garden has 1,041 permanent workers, according to government records, and 400 casual hands. Sitharaman said: ""I have come here to know the state of affairs in the closed gardens. The Prime Minister has told me to visit this region and find out how people are living here. Once a tea estate closes down, it is the state that has to take the necessary initiative. After closure, the state provides financial assistance and other relief to affected workers. She added: ""We have been working with the state and trying to find out prospective entrepreneurs for the closed gardens which do not have any cases pending in any court. We will speak to state government officials and other stakeholders tomorrow to resolve the impasse along with the state government."" Sitharaman reached Bandapani, around 140km from Siliguri, around 4.45pm. The garden has been shut since 2013. In October last year, the state had cancelled its land lease after the owner stayed away from tripartite meetings. After her tour of Bundapani, the minister visited the Birpara estate, owned by the Duncans Industries that has 2025 permanent workers and about 1,000 temporary labourers. Over 30 deaths have been reported in the garden since April last year, when wages and disbursement of rations became irregular. ""We are in a fix as our garden is not shut, neither is it functioning. We are not getting benefits such as financial assistance from the state government, unlike the workers of closed tea estates,"" a worker told the minister. ""Our children, who are supposed to go to school, are going to river beds to crush stones. There is lack of adequate medical care that is leading to deaths. There is no electricity in the garden and our quarters are in a shambles. There are wages and retirement benefits due."" Sitharaman said that under the law, the company that owns the garden, whether it is open or shut, is liable to make payments of gratuity, provident fund and pension. ""If any company is not paying these benefits, it is against the law. We will speak to state officials and other stakeholders to see that such dues are paid."" Around 7.15pm, Sitharaman left for Siliguri. She will stay in the state guest house today and will visit Danguajhar Tea Estate, on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri town, tomorrow. ""It is an open garden, owned by a major tea group and is fully-functional. The Union minister wants to have information about an open garden to draw a comparison with the closed or ailing gardens,"" a source said. ""Later in the afternoon, she will hold separate rounds of talks with different stakeholders."" Tea board officials and Darjeeling BJP MP S.S. Ahluwalia were with her today. Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung was with Sitharaman in Bundapani. When she landed in Bagdogra, Sitharaman accepted that the plight of workers in the closed and ailing gardens had become a serious issue. Sitharaman refused to get drawn into any blame game against the state government ""as it involves the lives of several thousand workers who are not getting wages""."
58f4d14760de470aa339c209,Cong for SC Panama probe,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160408/jsp/nation/story_79041.jsp,2016-04-08,"New Delhi, April 7: The Congress today said a fair investigation into the revelations in the so-called Panama papers was ""absolutely impossible"" without direct monitoring by the Supreme Court as many of those said to be involved had links with top functionaries in the ruling establishment. Party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh claimed that Lokesh Sharma, managing director of sports management major Twenty First Century Media (TCM), was given a contract by the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) in 2000 because of his links with finance minister Arun Jaitley. Sharma's name figured in the papers released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The papers revealed that Sharma has two companies registered in the tax haven of British Virgin Islands. Ramesh read out from the minutes of a meeting that Jaitley, then the DDCA chief and law minister, had chaired on October 14, 2000. ""The fourth point is - Chetan Chauhan, vice-president of the DDCA, is authorised to negotiate and sign the agreement with the Twenty First Century Media regarding in-stadia advertisements for three years."" He said the company also got the contract to sell 35 corporate boxes. ""Can Jaitley investigate this company?"" Ramesh said. ""We have no faith in any agency working under the finance ministry probing the Panama papers. It is absolutely impossible. The other names include corporate houses close to the Prime Minister and brand ambassadors of the government.... Only a special investigation team (SIT) monitored by the Supreme Court can ensure a fair investigation."" Earlier this week, the Narendra Modi government had ordered an investigation into revelations of secret financial dealings involving many Indians following leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm more than a year ago. The papers contain information on offshore entities connected to people in more than 200 countries and territories, said the ICIJ, to whom the documents were leaked. Asked how Jaitley's culpability could be presumed for a contract given by the DDCA in 2000, when Sharma was found to have companies in the tax haven only now, Ramesh said: ""The relations are known to everybody. We don't believe Sharma's credentials were not known to Jaitley."" As the tenuous argument could not establish Jaitley's link, Ramesh cited the example of Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh's son Abhishek, who was not investigated by the Modi government despite revelations over a year ago. Ramesh said: ""Papers released earlier by the ICIJ showed one Abhishak Singh having companies in the British Virgin Islands. It was found out from the address given there that the Abhishak Singh was actually Abhishek Singh, Raman Singh's son and now the BJP's Lok Sabha member from Rajnandgaon. The ICIJ website shows Abhishak's address as Raman Medical Store, New Bus Stand, Ward Number 20, Vindhyawasini Ward, Kawardha, Chhattisgarh."" Ramesh added: ""It is interesting to find the same address in the Chhattisgarh Assembly website for Raman Singh. Everybody in Kawardha knows who the Raman Medical Store belongs to. But is Abhishek being investigated? We raised issues like Lalitgate (the Lalit Modi controversy), rice scam and several other corruption cases but this government did not react. A probe is on into (the) Vyapam (scam) because of the Supreme Court. Hence we want an SIT probe monitored by the Supreme Court into the Panama papers too."" When told that the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team to unearth black money had already asked for an analysis of the Panama papers, Ramesh said: ""That's not sufficient. We want the SIT specifically for these papers. The finance ministry's multi-agency probe will not do."" The finance ministry had said a team comprising officers from the investigative unit of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and its Foreign Tax and Tax Research division, the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Reserve Bank of India would monitor the flow of information in each case."
58f4d19360de470aa339c273,Lives touched with extraordinary passion,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160101/jsp/nation/story_61559.jsp,2016-01-01,"HAND THAT FEEDS G.C. Shekhar in Chennai Picture: Arun Shanker Just before six in the morning, one corner of Pycrofts Road in Triplicane, central Chennai, wakes to the bustle of traffic and the tea stalls. But to one man waiting on the terrace of a two-storey building, its already breakfast time for his 3,000 friends. For the past hour, C. Sekar had been placing clumps of boiled rice, washed in water, on a dozen wooden planks. He inspects his work, washes his hands and steps back into the narrow staircase. Dont worry, theyll be here any minute, the 62-year-old says. As if on cue, a flurry of green wings arrives, screeching. A few at first, then a dozen more, till there are hundreds of them, as though Chennais entire parrot population has invaded Sekars home. For the next one hour, its a wavy sea of green on the terrace, broken at the edges by the black of a few pigeons, outnumbered in their own backyard. The parrots line up on the mesh of TV cables and eye the terrace gingerly before dropping onto the planks.As one batch finishes, another flies in amid an incessant cacophony of parrot talk. The occasional bus horn or vroom of a motorbike sends them into a brief tizzy before they land back on the planks. One hour later, the last of the parrots flies out, leaving behind the handful of local pigeons. Theyll be back at five in the evening for dinner, Sekar says. I tried counting them along with a few college students, and our estimate is that we get about 3,000 parrots a day. The love affair began in December 2004, a few days after the tsunami, when Sekar spotted a few parrots on his terrace. He threw a handful of grains at them and found they were only too happy to polish them off. I realised they were unable to find food, so I kept some rice ready next evening only to see more birds arriving. Their numbers kept increasing and they began arriving in the morning as well, expecting me to feed them twice a day. Sekar, who repairs cameras and has a collection of over 4,000 vintage cameras and accessories, some as old as 200 years, uses up 60kg of boiled rice every day, which comes to Rs 600 a day. Initially, all the money came out of my own pocket but seeing my dedication, several nature lovers now contribute every month. So my personal expense is only Rs 12,000 a month. A local trader supplies the rice at wholesale rates, Sekar says. A wildlife official who visited him after hearing about the parrots has told him the birds come from a national park near the IIT, from the Theosophical Societys large gardens and from a few cemeteries. He said the parrots do not fly more than 10km for food and are happy to find a regular feeding spot on my terrace.The routine means Sekar has rarely stepped out of Chennai these last 11 years. He left on his latest outstation visit, to a relatives wedding, after laying the breakfast spread in the night and returned before evening. A few of his neighbours tried to copy Sekar by laying out the same rice breakfast but the parrots simply ignored them. I gave up after a few days as the parrots preferred Sekars food to mine, said Shyam Das, who sells automobile spares and lives two streets away. Still, Sekar has to watch his friends eat from the staircase: They are wild creatures, you see  theyd fly away as soon as they see anyone on the terrace. The pictures had to be taken with a remote camera or from another terrace, hiding behind a cloak. During the recent floods, the number of parrots nearly doubled to 5,000 as they couldnt find food elsewhere, says Sekar. Every shower washed the rice away and Sekar, wearing a raincoat, kept replenishing the planks. This went on for almost 10 hours during non-stop rain on December 1. Sekar cant think of life without the parrots. Im willing to give away my camera collection to a museum; Ill be happy to spend the rest of my life feeding the parrots. What will happen to the birds after him? They found me, Im sure theyll find another like me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MAN O SCRIPTS Muzaffar Raina in Srinagar Picture: Muzaffar Raina When hundreds of his peers from Srinagars old city were trotting across the Line of Control to receive arms training a quarter century ago, a young Manzoor Ahmad Daikoo was keeping alive a legacy often associated with the Valleys fleeing Pandits. He was collecting rare manuscripts, some over a millennium old, that were getting lost to the mayhem following theadvent of militancy. I have more than 11,000 manuscripts, more than the state archives department has and perhaps the largest individual collection in north India, Daikoo, now 50, says. He calls the collection, stacked in racks and gunny bags at his home in suburban Nishat, the Kashmir Research Institute. Sure enough, it keeps attracting scholars from across the country and abroad. Many of my manuscripts are from unknown authors and without a second copy. Many are original, unpublished scripts, Daikoo says. Ive manuscripts written on paper, birch bark and even cloth.... They can buy me a fortune but Ill never sell them.Daikoo has what his mentor Triloki Nath Ganjoo, former Sanskrit professor at Kashmir University and a Shaivism expert, avers is a rare complete manuscript of the famed Kathasaritsagar, a 10th-century collection of stories. Most of the manuscripts are in the Sharda Lipi, the ancient script for Kashmiri and Sanskrit writing, or Persian.I also have manuscripts in Kashmiri (in the calligraphic Nastaliq script), Punjabi, Hindi and English.... I have pieces written with fingernails, called khat-e-nakhoon, an ancient art, Daikoo says. He explains that these were written without ink, by using specially pruned and nurtured fingernails as styluses to make fine grooves on paper that last centuries. I have a couple of manuscripts of nail-written religious literature in Sharda, around 300 years old. They are among my most prized possessions. What inspired Daikoo? Like many others in the Valley, mostly the Pandits, he had inherited a collection of manuscripts from his forefathers. When the Pandits migrated, many left behind their valuable collections, much of which was in danger of falling into the hands of thieves. Besides, the security forces, in their hunt for subversive writing, were questioning people over every piece of literature they possessed, prompting many to destroy their manuscripts. Even my uncle dumped a bag of scrolls once in the Jhelum to save his skin and mine, Daikoo says. That motivated me to do all I could to preserve these documents. I tried to convince whoever would listen that they were precious. I started buying as many as I could. He says he has travelled to Hyderabad, Badaun and Punjab to procure parts of his collection. But most of it was from Kashmir, covering aspects of Kashmiri life ancient and modern, from history, philosophy and religion to politics, literature and medicine. Many are about Kashmiri Shaivism or Trikishastra as it is called. There are translations of the Ramayan and the Mahabharat in Persian. One book shows how much our ancestors knew about the veterinary sciences. He says he has unpublished writing by Urdu poets from the last century, such as Brij Narain Chakbast and Nand Lal Farsi. Daikoo, who translates oriental literature for a living, had inherited large tracts of land, some of which he sold  he says they would fetch crores at current prices  to buy the manuscripts. Ganjoo says Kashmirs rich tradition of writing grew partly from its cold winters when many would sit indoors and write. He said there were 30 lakh Sharda manuscripts across the world, much of it taken away by western scholars during British rule. Daikoo also has thousands of books, administrative orders and key documents of past regimes, and old photographs, coins and newspapers. He says he never received any assistance. Only once I received preservatives worth Rs 1.6 lakh from the government. Most of his collection is therefore poorly preserved, stacked in gunny bags and easy prey for termites. Preserving them scientifically costs a lot. I approached the state government but it offered no help, he says.Nor did the Centres director of manuscriptology when Ganjoo met him, he says. Only 3,500 of Daikoos manuscripts are catalogued. You need experts to do that and you have to pay them. I spent Rs 2.6 lakh on cataloguing; I couldnt afford more, he says. He is saving up to build a preservation chamber on his lawns. It will take me Rs 30 lakh to build but I shall be better able to preserve them, he signs off. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FACE OF SCARRED MEMORIES Muzaffar Raina in Chahal, Baramulla When human rights activist Khurram Parvez wants to put a face to Kashmirs disappeared youths, he thinks of a very wrinkled one. Its the face of Baramulla farmer Atta Mohammad Khan, 82, who Khurram says is the only man in the Valley ready to declare he has buried nameless dead brought by the security forces  all 235 of them. Rights groups that estimate 8,000 men went missing in custody  the state says the number is far lower  want an international probe to find out who are buried in the unmarked graves. They claim to have found 2,700 unmarked graves containing more than 2,943 bodies in three of the Valleys 10 districts alone: Bandipora, Baramulla and Kupwara. Khan was the only gravedigger who came forward to speak about these graves and thus became the face of that expose. He said that at the most he could get killed, said Khurram, coordinator of the J&K Coalition of CivilSociety. I have buried some 235 people there (the local graveyard), Khan acknowledged at his ramshackle home in Chahal village, 80km from Srinagar. He gave them a proper burial, after conducting a funeral, when the security forces came from nearby camps with bodies and asked the village to bury them  a common occurrence across the Valley during the height of militancy.Khan volunteered because none else would, fearing trouble from either the forces or the militants. That was from 2002 till 2006, before the graveyard ran out of room. Manzor Ahmad points to one of the graves. Pictures: Muzaffar Raina Now Khan is bedridden with multiple ailments and his memory is almost gone. But one thing he doesnt forget is to keep reminding his son Manzoor Ahmad to take care of the graveyard. One of those buried at the graveyard was a six-month-old girl. I remember the army saying she was killed in crossfire. Nobody has ever come looking for her, Manzoor said. If that was one of the most heartbreaking sights Khan had to see, he was spared another. When the forces brought the body of his nephew Mohammad Salim one day, Khan was not home and, for once, somebody else buried him, Manzoor said. Later, when we checked the photograph (clicked by the police), he turned out to be a cousin of mine. He was not a militant but had been missing for a year or so. Khan, despite his failing eyesight and memory, tried to remember the appearances of the bodies he had buried so he could later help families who came looking for missing loved ones. Around half a dozen of the graves now have tombstones with names inscribed on them. My father helped identify them, Manzoor said. Some of them, possibly, were militants and some were not. Manzoor said the burials affected his fathers health over the years. I would help him bury these bodies, which were badly mutilated and in many cases defaced, he said. Every burial would leave him deeply disturbed and haunted by bad dreams for days. After the rights groups came out with a report titled Buried Evidence in 2009, with Khan the sole gravedigger who testified, the forces came looking for him and asked troubling questions. We faced harassment but were not harmed, Manzoor said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TURNING A CORNER Nishit Dholabhai in New Delhi Good morning, sir, the cabbie says in English. His accent, body language and ease of manner suggest a college education. Er, how far did you study? I ask hesitantly, wondering if he might see it as unwarranted curiosity. Well, I have a degree in civil engineering, he says after a moments pause and bursts out laughing. I join him, in disbelief and surprise. Ramit Arora, 29, had sometime in 2012 decided that signing up with Ola Cabs made better sense than sticking to his Rs 10,000-a-month construction supervisors job with realtor Gaursons India Limited in Ghaziabad. Id learnt by word of mouth how much they earned, the Ghaziabad businessmans son who graduated from a private engineering college in Meerut said, changing gears as he tackled the evening traffic at Mandi House, New Delhi. So, borrowing a little from friends, he bought a car. Today, he says, he works over 12 hours a day and earns at least Rs 90,000 a month. Ramit explained he had to pay Ola a portion of the fare, which rises sharply during the peak hours  6am to 11am and 4pm till late evening (a 25km ride in Delhi between 4.30pm and 6pm on December 6 cost me Rs 478). But the key is the incentive of Rs 225 per trip that Ola pays him during the peak hours  to pre-empt attrition in a fiercely competitive taxi-hailing industry. I hardly have to wait 10 minutes between two trips, said Ramit, looking smart in his Ola uniform  white linen kurtas with shoulder straps and matching jootis. But the road to prosperity offered a few tricky turns. First, the family found his new profession demeaning. When his sister, a lawyer, got married Ramit told his family he had hired a driver for his cab  just to spare them embarrassment before the in-laws. Harder to handle has been the condescending attitude of some of the passengers, who would address him with a tu and often speak disrespectfully. One afternoon there were some extremely impolite passengers; I dropped them halfway, near another cab, with folded hands and said I didnt want the fare, Ramit said. The company told me my ratings (which Ola seeks religiously from the passengers) would drop but I said I cant compromise on self-respect. Aprameya Radhakrishna, who founded TaxiForSure with Raghunandan G. before selling the company to Ola, said the average monthly income of a cabbie attached to a taxi-aggregating company was Rs 50,000. Theres a social mobility, with even students working as part-time drivers, he told The Telegraph. But Radhakrishna warned that Ramit and his peers might be enjoying a first-mover advantage that might not last. As the taxi-hailing industry grows  estimates suggest a combined fleet of 300,000 taxis in major Indian cities  only a handful of competitors would be left standing and the fares would rise while the incentives for drivers fell, he said. Ramit, whose father runs a wholesale grocery business in Uttar Pradesh, has inspired a cousin, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering, to become an Ola driver too. Ive been driving a cab for two years but my family doesnt know. Ill tell them once I buy a second car and hire a driver  that will raise my status, said the young man, who earlier worked in the machine tools department of a well-known gear company near Delhi. He asked that his name not be revealed lest it interfere with his marriage prospects. Ramit ducked a query about his marriage plans, smiling and saying he needed to save money first. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A LONG INNINGS Piyush Srivastava in Muzaffarnagar Pictures: Naeem Ansari When a young Vijay Singh walked out to bat  stage a dharna outside the Muzaffarnagar collectors office, actually  P.V. Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister and Sourav Ganguly a mere Test hopeful. Almost 20 years from that day  February 26, 1996  the frail-looking 54-year-old is still at the crease, on the same dharna, protesting large-scale land grab in his village of Chausana, 73km away. Thats nearly two decades spent non-stop on the roadside in rain and shine, 44C summer to 5C winter, protected by a canvas tent, surviving on roti and vegetables he cooked on a brick chulha and then a kerosene stove, leaving his post only to use the nearest public toilet. Except that one time the ex-schoolmaster had to visit Chausana when his father died in 2002. And, oh, that other time in 2006 when he had to be taken to hospital after suffering a mild heart attack. A few things have changed since last year, though. A sympathetic administration has allowed him to shift to an unused veranda inside the collectorate premises, where he has set up home with three plastic curtains. And he has an LPG cylinder, provided by an admirer. Masterji, enough is enough, go home now, a fresh-faced additional district magistrate would tell him now and then. Only after you meet my demands, would be the instant reply out of the 5-foot-7, 65kg frame. The DMs dont talk to him: he has seen off 23 of them, including a few who tried to browbeat him. Nowadays he sometimes leaves the spot to speak on human rights at school functions. Masterji has become part of Muzaffarnagars lore. The hawkers give him Hindi newspapers for free every morning. His handful of fans now contribute Rs 2,500 every month, so hes stopped accepting the money that his nearly estranged family of well-to-do farmers used to send through acquaintances. Singhs wife Pushpa, whom he left to bring up three young children all by herself, and son Gopal, a 21-year-old BSc student, look after their 23-bigha land, which grows sugarcane, paddy and wheat. Daughters Kalpana, 25, and Sakshi, 23, are doing MSc and BEd, respectively. Initially, my wife would call me a godly character because I was fighting for others. But after the first four-five years she began objecting. Now they all think Im crazy, Singh rued. Gopal and Kalpana accuse their father of being uncaring and doing nothing for them. The son last visited him three years ago but his daughters sometimes call him. In Singhs conservative boondocks, his wife isnt expected to travel and meet him in public. Does he feel guilty about abandoning them? Occasionally, yes, but he believes the cause is bigger. A boys cry It wasnt Singhs plots the mafia grabbed but 4,000 bighas of the government-owned gram sabha land, leased to Chausanas landless to grow food. Since 1982, when he was 21 and had just begun teaching economics and civics at the village school, Singh had been writing these victims applications and accompanying them to the collectorate. My life changed on a February evening in 1996 when, on my way home from school, I overheard an eight-year-old begging his mother for roti. She had none to give because the familys plot had been snatched, he said. I wept through the night. While there was so much fertile land, a child was sleeping hungry. I decided to quit my job and take up this fight, but I hadnt the foggiest that it would stretch 20 years. Within days, he had pitched his tent at the dharna sthal, a designated place for protests just outside the collectorate gates  a feature in many Uttar Pradesh districts. As a rich landowner, he could have led a comfortable life but chose to fight for others. Thats why we respect him, said Devraj Panwar, the man who provides the LPG cylinders. It was here that Singh had felt chest pain one day nine years ago. I had the phone number of the then city magistrate, V.K. Singh, whom I somehow managed to call from my mobile. He came and took me to hospital, Singh said. Nowadays, when I occasionally catch a fever, I can go to any doctor in town. They all know me and never ask for fees. We know his struggle is genuine but the land mafia have political patronage, said a district official, pleading anonymity because chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is seized of the matter. Singh had undertaken a 19-day, 610km padayatra to Lucknow and met Akhilesh on April 28, 2012. Akhilesh ordered a probe, which helped free 300 of the 4,000 bighas the same year. But progress has stalled again. Appreciation has been coming, though, with the Limca Book of Records in 2011 declaring Singhs protest the longest continuous one-man agitation in the country and the India Book of Records honouring him for his non-political, non-violent satyagraha the following year. What if he achieves his end some day, will he go back home? A shadow crosses Singhs face. I dont know if I can, he says. Since most of the land-grabbers are my fellow Thakurs, I fear ostracism if I return to Chausana. Besides, my familys alienated from me. So will he spend the rest of his life on this veranda? Havent thought about that yet, he replies slowly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INSULT TO CRUSADE Basant Rawat in Rangpar Picture: Basant Rawat Ratna Ala couldnt see their faces but the mocking laughter rang in his ears. What use is information for a blind man? Get lost, son, the sarpanch said to a chorus of guffaws. That moment changed the now 39-year-old Alas life, turning a mild-mannered, disabled herdsman in Kathiawad into a Right to Information crusader feared by the mafia and corrupt officials alike. This was sometime in 2007. Ala had been listening to a radio programme on the RTI Act, enforced since October 2005, and was impressed. Why dont I do something about my problem? he thought. So he turned up at the local panchayat office in Rangpar, 40km from Rajkot, to ask why they werent repairing the rutted village road he was finding difficult to negotiate. Their rudeness deeply disturbed me. But it made me think, Ala told this newspaper. He wondered how much a man who could only read Braille do. Ala had lost his father at 15 and studied till Class X with help from a philanthropic organisation. So, when he learnt about the RTI helpline run by the Ahmedabad-based NGO Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel, the first question he asked Pangti Jog, one of its officials, was: Can a blind man file an RTI plea? Of course, why not? she assured him before teaching him how to draft an RTI application. Since then, Ala has been unstoppable. The reply to his first RTI query told him the village road had been repaired twice in the past two years. On paper, that is. Ala got a local newspaper in Rajkot, 40km away, to publish the story, and the road was repaired soon. The same year, 2007, Ala prevented 281 acres of village pastures from being illegally handed over to a clock factory by local officials. In 2010, he exposed Rangpars incorrect voter list braving threats from a political group that thrived on bogus voting. A friend told me that when he went to correct his name on the voter list, he saw many names without photographs, Ala said. His RTI plea revealed that the rolls carried the names of 35 who had left the village and 10 who had died. A grateful Rangpar fielded him as a peoples candidate in the local polls three years ago and elected him its deputy sarpanch unopposed, sending him to the office from where he had returned insulted five years earlier. He then found out that the mining mafia was scooping out moram, a soft gravel, from village grazing land at night.They had political patronage and tried all kinds of tactics, he said. Some people came to my home in my absence and warned my wife Ila that since both of us are blind, they would eliminate us and nobody would be the wiser. Like the former sarpanch, they would soon learn that abusing his blindness only helped stiffen Alas resolve. So they tried a new tack, offering to build Ala a two-storey house. My fight goes on, the 12-bigha owner said in the two-room thatched house he shares with Ila and school-going sons Ajay and Ashish, a few yards from a polished village road that stands witness to how Ala humbled the scoffers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THUMBS-UP TO LIFE Ananthakrishnan G in Kochi Sometimes, asking the wrong question can lead to a right answer. Its perhaps the best lesson little Amrita Antony of Kochi has learnt in school. An anxious query by the Class III girl, heartbroken at a younger mates brain tumour, has triggered a campaign by her school that will help save lives and was highlighted before the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Except that the Prime Minister did not know of Amrita, or teacher Abhilash T. Prathap who found the answer to her query, or the unfortunate Bhavana Lakshmi who had inspired it. Cant we give her a new brain? an anguished Amrita had demanded at the school parliament at St Marys Upper Primary School, Kochi. She had just learnt that Lakshmi, the Class I girl who had stopped coming to school last year, was severely ill even after two brain surgeries. No, what Amrita had asked for was impossible. But it provided to the young Sanskrit teacher Prathap his eureka moment. It was an innocent question from Amrita. Its impact hit us a little later, and the discussion veered to organ donations. Participants wondered what we could do to spread awareness, said headmistress Shajimol K. Thomas. It was then that Prathap suggested the map. It was this colour map of India, printed on a sheet of cloth and covered with white thumb impressions that give it a mottled look, which was sent to Modi with a request to promote organ donations. The 2,500 thumbprints signified 2,500 signatories. Four large pieces of cloth were sewn together for the map, which was displayed as our 400 pupils organised a street play on organ donation on August 11, Prathap said. The onlookers and passers-by gave their thumb impressions. Till now, the school has got 150 adults, including many of its teachers, to actually sign up with an authorised NGO, pledging their organs after their death. Of course, organs can be harvested only from beating-heart cadavers  patients who have suffered brain death while being attached to a ventilator that keeps their hearts and lungs functioning. This is a possibility when death is caused by conditions such as head injury (as in road accidents), stroke or a brain aneurysm. Still, signing up formally means that if any of the 150 are eligible to donate organs after death, their relatives cannot block it. Initially, I was surprised: why a map of India from thumb impressions? Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat broadcast on October 15, before lauding the schools efforts. When the school celebrated its newfound fame, it invited Lakshmi too. She was happy but didnt seem to understand what it was for, Thomas said. Lakshmi has been advised 30 chemotherapies but the family had to stop after three as she was growing increasingly nauseous. We funded the second surgery in July by mortgaging our house, her father R.S. Moorthy, an auto driver, said.Prathap has his own problems. Like many other teachers in government-aided schools, he and his wife, a fellow Sanskrit teacher in another school, are not paid because the government is yet to recognise their posts. The matter is in court while Prathap, father of a nine-month-old girl, works part-time as a welder and gas-stove repairer to sustain the family. All the while devising new ways of thumbing his nose at adversity, no doubt. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FOR THEM, WORLDS A SCHOOL Nalin Verma in Araria Kerala Public School is hardly a signboard youd expect to see in a north Bihar town, 10km from the Nepal border and 2,500km from the state whose name it bears. Nor would the school have existed in Araria, or drawn the Election Commissions attention during this years polls, if gun-toting Naga militants hadnt visited the home of the owners  Bindu and N.J. Shaju  in Assam a decade ago.If thats confusing, first things first. After getting a BA in English in her home district of Wayanad, Bindu had trained as a nurse and joined a hospital in Lumding, Assam, in the late 90s. It was a low-paid job in a small hospital. Id been a good student and wanted to shift to teaching which I loved, Bindu, 40, said. I applied and got a job at Don Bosco School, Lumding, in the year 2000. Her family married her off the same year to Wayanad boy Shaju who, after graduating in English, was running a grocery. He was only too glad to join his wifes school as a fellow teacher. We lived happily. Then the terrorists targeted migrants, Bindu said. Four men brandishing firearms and sickles barged into our home and set us a deadline to leave. Many of the couples relatives and friends from Kerala, working as professionals, teachers and nurses in Lumding, left because of the threat. After several fearful days, we received a call from some of our relatives and friends who were working in southeast Bihars Maoist-hit Jamui-Munger region, where missionaries from Kerala run several educational institutions, Shaju, 43, said. We caught a train to Jamui. But the wages at the private school that recruited them were very low. So they left for Lakhisarai to work at a girls school. Members of the land mafia were on the schools board and fought among themselves. The school was in perennial turmoil: our wages were kept pending for months, Shaju said. So, on to north Bihar and Araria. This time they opened their own school from a rented house. It was 2009.We were given two small rooms at a congested place. The landlord fleeced us, and we didnt attract enough students, barely 15-20, Shaju said. We began looking for another neighbourhood. Picture: Nalin Verma A violent tropical storm that struck in April 2010 and killed 90-odd in north Bihar also left an asbestos-roof house in Ararias Mahadev Chowk devastated. The owner was very generous; he rented it out to us on a nominal rent and asked us to open the school, Shaju said. We had no money; so we removed the debris ourselves and shifted here in 2010. Five years on, Kerala Public School has 320 students including 80 girls and stands as a beacon in a district whose literacy rate of 55.1 per cent trails the national average of 74.04. Of the 15 teachers, 11 are from Kerala. People here believe that teachers from Kerala are better. We too feel a connection because we believe we have something to offer to these backward areas whose new generation wants to study, Shaju said. Literacy is high in Kerala, so is the competition in the field of education. Bihar gave us the chance to follow our passion. The English-medium school, affiliated to the CBSE, draws the children of Ararias middle class and its elite  district officials, Sashastra Seema Bal officers and local businessmen. Bindu said the tuition fee was Rs 450 to Rs 500 a month. Its an extremely good school, an SSB officer averred. My kid is doing well. Shes learnt to speak English. The couples younger son Shabil, 11, lives with them but the elder Shabin, 13, studies in Thiruvananthapuram.The school caught the eye of the election authorities who paraded its students on Ararias streets ahead of the Assembly polls to urge people to vote. District officials and townspeople had perhaps told them what they told this newspaper: that Bindu and Shaju ran Ararias best school."
58f4d19560de470aa339c276,SWEET START TO '16,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160102/jsp/bihar/story_61590.jsp,2016-01-02,"Patna not just welcomed the first day of 2016 with new calendars, cards and greetings on Facebook and WhatsApp, but also with picnics. People thronged the hangout spots, including manicured parks and the zoo. And, if New Year's Eve parties were about sizzling style statements, big money and hard liquor, the first day of the year was about wholesome togetherness. Piyush Kumar Tripathi sums up the mood on Day I of the year. Hot hangouts People were in a festive mood on the opening day of 2016. After exchanging wishes in the morning, it was time for the residents to finalise their outings for the first day of the year. Eco Park was the most favoured destination for revellers, while Patna zoo also registered heavy footfall. Those fond of sandbar fun headed for the Sabbalpur diara, while many others went to eateries and cinemas with friends and family. Weather watch The city ushered in the New Year with foggy weather. Mild fog engulfed the city in the small hours. Though it was not visible much on the ground level during the day, condensed moisture kept blocking the sun. Thankfully, the breeze was not bone-numbing, allowing people get out of bed and head to the New Year spots. ""The fog in the upper level of atmosphere would keep the skies hazy over the weekend. The minimum temperature would be around 9C, while the maximum would hover around 22-23C,"" said an official at the Patna Meteorological Centre. Dense fog engulfs Patna Junction early on Friday morning. Picture by Ranjeet Kumar Dey Picnic pals From granddads to besties, from sons to fianc, neighbour to office colleague, anyone game for fun and food was a picnic buddy on Friday. People preferred to take some fresh air in the open at the zoo and parks to kill the hangover from the New Year's Eve parties. Selfie shots Clicking selfies took the cake as people preened and posed for virtual immortality. Eating, listening to music and dancing away to glory came close second. Playing cricket and badminton were a joint third. At Eco Park, youngsters had most fun inside the underpass tunnel connecting the two flanks of the park as they kept howling and cheering in excitement for the new year. Groups of young girls were seen clicking photographs and playing antakshari. Food faves When it comes to grub, Patna is old school. So, puri or chapatti, sabzi or chicken or mutton and steamed rice or pulao were among the favourites. Panipuris, sweets, chips and soft drinks worked as appetisers in places they were available. City restaurants also offered mouth-watering delicacies for a delicious start to the year. Music mantra Music heard on headphones may do for every other day but a New Year picnic is meant for sharing your playlist. So, cellphones connected to small speakers were the top accessory of the day. Foot-tapping numbers like Gulabo from Shaandaar, Badshah's DJ Wale Babu, Dance Basanti from Ungli and G Phaad Ke from Happy Ending among others got people in the mood. Retro hits like Saat Samundar and Ho Jata Hai Kaise Pyaar or Bhojpuri chartbuster Lolliop Lage Lu... Patna played on. Security shield Static forces, comprising 200 male and female constables, were deployed across congested points in and around the city. Under every police station, patrol vans kept vigil. No untoward incident was reported till the filing of this report."
58f4d22e60de470aa339c360,Gift Pack,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160204/jsp/opinion/story_67296.jsp,2016-02-04,"Recently, the state education minister declared that shoes would be distributed free of cost among students studying at the primary level in government schools of West Bengal. Reportedly, the chief minister had been so ""touched"" on finding barefoot children in a primary school that she immediately advised the education department to provide them with shoes. Later, the education minister said that this scheme is being undertaken to attract more students to school. This is a touching gesture, no doubt, although one wonders why the chief minister had not noticed the lack before, or happened to notice it in this particular year of the assembly elections. Besides, it is not just primary students who often go without shoes. In the rural and semi-urban areas of the state, the sight of older children walking barefoot to school is fairly common. (If their feet are shod at all, it would usually be with torn slippers or with ""kito"", the cheap, locally-made sandals that are famous for giving blisters.) However, given the way malnutrition impedes the growth of children in poorer families - a reality brought to the fore by the recent National Family Health Survey, which shows that 34 per cent of children under five years are stunted in the rural areas of West Bengal - Mamata Banerjee could easily have mistaken some secondary-level students as primary-level children. A teacher who works at a government school in Gosaba said that she felt as if she was holding a bird when she had to pick up and carry a Class-VII student who had fainted in the classroom. That child had fainted out of hunger. Her breakfast had consisted of a cup of tea with a single biscuit while the previous night's dinner had been a bowl of muri. With the midday meal, slated at 2 pm, still a long way to go, the child had slumped in her seat in the middle of the first half before the lunch break. Incidentally, this child had no warm clothes on even in these wintry days. Perhaps Banerjee should visit some of these rural schools and announce a scheme to distribute free cardigans. It is not that the state government's plans of luring students to school by giving them anything from free textbooks to cycles or shoes is not working. The cycles, for example, are sure to increase attendance although many students are selling off their gift cycles because they are defective. As for the shoes, one doubts how long they will serve their purpose since, in all probability, they, too, will be of poor quality. Most of Banerjee's plans to improve the condition of students skim the surface while the real problems continue to roil in the depths. There is no point in cladding children's feet in shoes if they continue to remain half-clad above the feet, go hungry to school and cannot do well in studies because of impaired cognitive skills resulting from malnutrition. The anganwadi system, meant to provide pre-school education, nutrition and basic healthcare to children till the age of six, is run in a perfunctory manner in most of the rural areas of Bengal. At such a centre in the interiors of Howrah, I found the children showing little or no interest in the khichdi, which is their daily fare. There have been several complaints that the daal and the rice used in the khichdi are substandard. The cooks complain that they cannot make the meals tastier because the allotment amount for ingredients such as oil and spices is meagre and fixed. According to the latest NFHS, 53.7 per cent of the children under five years in Bengal are anaemic. If Banerjee really cares about the poorer children in her state, she can start by making the anganwadi system more efficient. The process of learning will get easier for children once their health gets better. Gifts of shoes or cycles may or may not give Banerjee success in the elections but it certainly cannot do the children any real good."

(Bhola Prasad) Forgot to get packed lunch from home on a busy working day and would like nothing better than a machli-bhaat lunch? Or want to enjoy an evening out with friends over chilli fish and fish fingers but don't want a huge restaurant bill? Jamshedpur entrepreneurs Saumitra Verma and Sujit Kumar, both 34, who opened an online fish store www.freshmachli.com successfully last year, tying up with Chandil fisherman to help customers literally net fresh catch, will now diversify their business into open-air fish stalls serving affordable curry and snacks at 10 spots across the city. To be called Jharkhand Fresh Fish, these stalls will come up at Mango, Sonari, Kadma, Golmuri, Sakchi, Bistupur, Telco, Parsudih, Adityapur and Gamharia by first week of March. Before this, the duo will meet Dhalbhum SDO Suraj Kumar for his final seal on the locations. The stalls would not only sell raw rohu, catla and pangasius (basa), but also fish curry and rice for lunch and snacks in the evening, from crispy fried fish pakodas to fish fingers and chilli fish. Stressing on hygiene, he said: ""Fish needs to be cut, de-scaled and cleaned properly before cooking. We will take care of that. Also, each team of two members deputed at each of our 10 stalls will wear caps, aprons and gloves. Our dishes will be packed in foil and paper containers."" Prices would be much lower than those in restaurants, he said. Armed with a PG diploma from XLRI and MBA from Symbiosis in Pune, Saumitra said he and his friend Sujit, a BTech from BIT-Mesra, had always planned to diversify. ""Once our online Fresh Machli caught on, we wondered what next. When we did a survey on roadside eateries in the city, we found great demand for fish snacks and wholesome fish-and-rice lunches, but customers had hygiene concerns. Many wondered if fish sold on roadsides was fresh. Based on these findings, we decided to launch Jharkhand Fresh Fish stalls from the first week of March,"" said Saumitra. Saumitra added they had taken permission from state fisheries department to use idle Fresh Fish pushcarts. Last year, the department had flagged off a project to help fish vendors with subsidised catch but the venture had failed. ""Most iron-and-tin structures given by fisheries department to fish vendors last year are lying abandoned. According to an understanding, we will pay the department a one-time sum to take the fish stalls and open Jharkhand Fresh Fish Stalls,"" Saumitra said."

Starting with 75,000 people on day one the foundation is now serving about 2 lakh pilgrims a day at 15 locations near ghats and Pushkar Nagars, according to Project coordinator K. Pattabhiram.The kitchen which has 19 cauldrons that can cook food for 12,000 persons in just 15 minutes is headed by foundations city chapter president Maha Vishnu Dasa.Dishes like bisi bele bhath, khara pongal, lemon rice, vegetable biryani, zeera rice, coconut rice, sweet pongal and tomato rice are being distributed in plastic containers to the pilgrims.NGOs and associations like Krishna District Rice & Oil Millers Association, Sri Satya Sai Seve Organisations, Seethapathi Rama Annadana Trust, Pithapuram, East Godavari district and several others are actively contributing food to the pilgrims. Thousands of volunteers, including students from the city and other parts of the State, are behind these organisations.Chaos at timesHowever, on the flipside distribution of food in packets, instead of serving it in buffet style or with seating facility arranged, is causing chaotic situations now and then at the ghats and Pushkar Nagars.Sometimes its like distributing food during floods. Extending help to pilgrims is a great deed but an improper way should not lead to problems or minimise access to all, said Satyanarayana Raju, a pilgrim from East Godavari.I waited for half an hour in the crowd but failed to receive anything as food was finished. Government must set up specific counters from where food can be distributed in an organised manner which will prompt everyone to have it, he added. Also giving away food in packets and plastic containers excessively is leading to wastage as many pilgrims are dumping them later.It is servingfood to about2 lakh pilgrimsevery day at15 locations"

58f4d78a60de470aa339cbf0,A painter prepares for the President,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160108/jsp/jharkhand/story_62665.jsp,2016-01-08,"Haren Thakur fixes one of his paintings to be exhibited at the art gallery of the newly revamped Audrey House in Ranchi on Thursday. Picture by Prashant Mitra In the golden afternoon light of Thursday, Ranchi's leading contemporary artist is deep in thought as he adjusts a painting, looks at the light and the backdrop of a wall. Satisfied, he briskly goes to the next. Haren Thakur is preparing for the display of his paintings at the newly revamped Audrey House, an annexe to Raj Bhavan dating way back to 1854, which President Pranab Mukherjee will inaugurate on Saturday evening. The President will not just do the honours for Audrey House, but also launch Ranchi's first exclusive multi-arts gallery complex on its distinguished grounds, along with a solo exhibition of Thakur. It's a rare honour for the soft-spoken artist with the trademark ""more salt, less pepper"" hair and beard, Jharkhand's possibly best known export in painting these days. Santiniketan's Kala Bhavan alumnus of the mid-1970s, Thakur's work in mixed media speaks of equal parts imagination, skill and rigour. Uncluttered, minimalist yet forceful, the images of tribal people, flora and fauna also have that rare quality, sparkling wit. For example, one of his paintings, Clever Cat, has a feline with a fish strapped on its back, the tail of a mouse underneath one paw and a fishbone in its belly. On Thursday, two days to go for the big day, Thakur is hard at work, arranging his paintings to best effect at the gallery hub that is all poised to become Ranchi's take on India Habitat Centre in New Delhi or Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal. For the artist, display of artworks at the gallery is not something to be taken lightly. He needs to make the display appear to best advantage in sync with the colour and height of walls, lighting arrangements and even the entry and exit of the gallery. Was he excited that the President would be able to see his paintings at some length? ""This is why I have selected as many as 60 of my works for display here, some even painstakingly selected for my upcoming solo exhibition at Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai next year,"" Thakur said. ""Of the 60, I will finally put up 48 to 50 on the walls. The idea is to have a good representation of the works but also let the paintings breathe."" Thakur uses paint, ink, Nepali rice paper, paperboard, even golden paper to create his signature style. Yet, his paintings, even those measuring 4ftx3ft, look simple at first glance. Gradually, the visitor notices the detailed craftsmanship of Thakur's narrative as he tells stories of life in the Chhotanagpur region. Thakur is visibly pleased with the revamp of Audrey House and the new gallery hub. ""Ranchi needed such a facility. The gallery is ideal for holding an art exhibition with the standard set-up for display of paintings. Being centrally located, it will attract more visitors than Ram Dayal Munda Kala Bhavan at Hotwar,"" he said. Built by Captain Hannyington, the deputy commissioner of Chhotanagpur between 1850 and 1856, Audrey House came up in 1854. Its renovation, complete now, took five years. Of its four new art galleries, three will have permanent exhibits comprising paintings, sculptures, artefacts and tribal jewellery while the fourth will be open for interested artists or groups to hold exhibitions. It also has seminar hall and an open-air theatre."

Telegraph picture Calcutta, Jan. 27: Come Sunday, foodies in Calcutta, who have probably had their fill of Chinese, Thai and Mexican, will have a chance to get adventurous and step out of their comfort zone to taste khar, tenga and the heat of bhut jolokia, with a couple of silkworms thrown in for good measure. Northeastern food curator Gitika Saikia will be here to take the residents of the city, as well as Assamese residents here who have been pining for some authentic cuisine from back home, on a gastronomic journey through the hills of Assam. The pop-up is scheduled to be held at Club de Ville in Udita Bengal Ambuja on the EM Bypass, to highlight a medley of urban and rural cuisine of her state. A pop-up restaurant is a temporary set-up, often operating from a private home, restaurant or borrowed space, mainly during festivals and other occasions. Saikia, currently based in Mumbai, will cook simple yet mouth-watering dishes from Assam, with an emphasis on indigenous food. She had also held pop-ups in other states and abroad. Famous for her blog Gitika's Pakghor and her pickles, she will provide some of her signature dishes, including lai xaak gahori or pork with broad mustard leaves, til maas (fish cooked with sesame seeds) and rongalao murgi (tender chicken pieces with ripe pumpkin). For a real challenge to the tastebuds, she will present the fiery bhut jolokia, in chutneys as well as with pork and bamboo shoot. The event is the brainchild of food blogger Anindya Sundar Basu of Pikturenama, and his wife Madhushree Basu Roy, cook and food stylist. Connecting over social media, Saikia and Basu hit upon the idea of holding this pop-up to showcase the hidden flavours of Assam. ""Foodies in Calcutta are very open to trying out different kinds of food. The city offers plenty of scope for the introduction of Assamese cuisine. I am sure foodies will embrace the unique flavours of Assam,"" Basu said. ""I quit a more than 10-year-long corporate career in September 2014 to pursue my passion of promoting the unexplored Northeast, its culture and its customs. Since I am passionate about cooking, it was the best medium I could come up with,"" said Saikia. ""I first entered the kitchen when I was in Class II to make a fried egg. I remember it was a disaster and never tried it again till Classes VI or VII. I was a bad cook throughout and then moved to a hostel, limiting my cooking skills all the more. After marriage, my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook, taught me indigenous fare. Seeing her cooking, my interest grew and every time I visited home, I would come back with new recipes and the availability of organic ingredients in the kitchen garden influenced me to try different things,"" she added. On Sunday, the guests will be served black tea served with homemade pithas (rice cakes) on arrival. The main course will comprise lai xaak gahori, guti alu aru tita phool bhaji (baby potatoes stir fry with red bitter flowers), topola bhat (sticky rice), til maas (river fish cooked in black sesame with a hint of herbs) xukan khorisa, mosola paat bhut jolokia gahori (pork with smoked bamboo shoots, bhut jolokia and Arunachali herbs), rongalao murgi, lau khar (bottle gourd and masoor dal cooked with organic alkali and flavoured with Assamese coriander) and steamed plain rice.

Picture by Sudeshna Banerjee The affable Japanese diplomat who until a year ago had headed the consulate general of Japan in Calcutta is back in Bengal in a new, post-retirement role. Mitsuo Kawaguchi, 64, is now visiting professor at Visva-Bharati, teaching his native tongue to senior students at Nippon Bhavan. Seated in his chamber after a class with PhD students, Kawaguchi laughs on being reminded of the song he had sung at his farewell in March 2014 - Kabhi alvida na kehna - and how that line mirrors his unbroken bond with Bengal. ""I really had no idea then that I would be back. This was an unexpected offer,"" he says. As consul-general, Kawaguchi had visited Santiniketan five times. ""The (then) vice-chancellor (Sushanta Datta Gupta) would sometimes talk to me about the Japanese department. But when I made a short trip to the city after my retirement I had no inkling that he would offer me a teaching post,"" he recalls. Kawaguchi went back to Tokyo undecided, and it was only after his family agreed to let him go that he accepted the offer. ""My wife and daughter know how much I love Bengal. And I had always wanted to be a teacher. It was my second dream job after a diplomat's,"" he admits. For someone used to city life, settling in a district town must have been difficult. But Kawaguchi makes light of the challenges. ""Yes, there are mosquitoes in winter; yes, the tap water is sometimes dirty. But these things can happen anywhere."" He was more worried about being a novice in teaching. ""To be a teacher, you need enthusiasm and the heart to think for students. I have both, but you also need to know the technique,"" says Kawaguchi, displaying two books on how to teach Japanese. A year into the job, he is a favourite among the students. ""He has a lot of knowledge about Japan's relations with other countries. While other teachers stick to Japanese history and literature, he tells us about his own experiences as well,"" says Ashok Vardhan Ojha, a PhD student. A couple of MA final-year students attend Kawaguchi's PhD lectures with his permission. ""He is drawn to Tagore's philosophy and has a dream that we, the Visva-Bharati students, will take Tagore's legacy forward,"" says Piyali Roy. ""And the kind of information he shares with us is not there in any text book,"" adds batch mate Aneesah Nishaat. Kawaguchi's passion is reflected in his teaching schedule. He is required to teach for nine hours a week, but has voluntarily added eight extra hours to his routine. For obvious reasons, his department wants to retain him for as long as possible. ""I am here for a year more. After that, let's see if my health permits,"" says the 64-year-old. He takes care not to eat anything outside the university canteen. That limits the menu. ""The only options are fish or meat, rice or roti."" But he does not mind. ""I was never fussy about food. I like Indian dishes."" Twice a month, he goes to Calcutta. ""A friend runs two Japanese restaurants. They serve authentic cuisine,"" he smiles. A Bengali friend has given him a Tagore CD. So will it now be Rabindrasangeet for the man who used to sing Kishore Kumar hits in his days as a Hindi student at Banaras Hindu University? ""I mean to pick up at least two, including Aami chini go chini,"" he says. But he doesn't want to learn Bengali. ""If I do, my students could slip into their mother tongue in class. I don't encourage that."" Back home, some of his colleagues had wondered how a diplomat used to the perks of the profession would get by in rural Bengal. He admits they had reason to do so. Kawaguchi the consul-general would travel by car with a retinue of guards while Kawaguchi the teacher cycles everywhere. He cleans and dusts his own room too. ""But they (his colleagues in Japan) have no idea what it means to live a dream,"" he smiles. It is evening when Kawaguchi walks out of Nippon Bhavan, dragging his bicycle along. The man has spent 15 years of his life in India, seven of them in Calcutta. ""Even in Tokyo, I was desk chief for Indian affairs three times. That makes it 22 years of involvement with this country. One of the reasons I agreed to take this job is because it is Tagore's university,"" he says, a smile lighting up his face more than the light from a street lamp. All his acquaintances know of Tagore and Kawaguchi doesn't find it surprising. ""In Japan, 100 per cent people know of Tagore.... He had visited Japan five times."" Kawaguchi has devised a course on ""Tagore and Japan"" for his students, complete with study material authored by him. ""I wanted to learn about Gurudev along with my students. I am doing just that,"" he says, cycling along the red-soil path."
58f4da2860de470aa339cf9b,$200m for agri sector,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160108/jsp/northeast/story_62713.jsp,2016-01-08,"Guwahati, Jan. 7: The World Bank will be providing $200 million to Assam to help its agriculture sector get into ""entrepreneurial"" mode and produce high-value commodities. While the bank will provide $200 million for the Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project, the Centre will contribute $50 million. It would take some time for the project to finally get cleared as more documents have to be prepared. Official sources said the broader objective would be to instil a collective entrepreneurial spirit where producers shift from being ""price takers"" of primary produce - with no or very little influence over the market - to being more business and value focused. The project information document says a key project thrust will be on enhancing agglomeration of producers to improve economies of scale in producing, processing and marketing. In parallel with this, the project will support agriculture and livestock productivity (including value and incomes) through essential technology transfer in production and improved post-harvest and market operations, and also explore and pilot possible financing modalities to support entrepreneurship and agri-business. It says the recently concluded Assam Agricultural Competitiveness Project (AACP), which was termed satisfactory by the bank, had laid the foundations for long-term agriculture transformation in the state by shifting the focus from rice production towards diversification into high-value agriculture production (vegetables, spices, fish and dairy, among others). This move offers opportunities to increase contribution of agriculture to Assam's growth. ""Overall, the support of the project will be towards development of higher value commodities and more efficient supply chains will underpin ongoing structural transformation of the economy and offers the opportunity to increase gross state domestic product growth by stimulating private sector investment and agri-enterprise development in Assam, a special category state,"" it said. In Assam, agriculture and related sectors are the principal occupation of the vast majority of rural population in terms of employment and livelihood. Agriculture and the allied sectors support more than 75 per cent of the population, providing employment to about 50 per cent of the total workforce. Considering the multiplicity of regulatory authorities in the state, reforms would be needed not only to harmonise the regulatory regime in the state, but also for the development of alternative marketing options for farmers. The #bank says that the Assam government is committed to transforming the agriculture and allied sector to a more commercial and market-oriented production, promoting small enterprises and implementing necessary reforms."

Pictures by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 21: The meteorological centre today recorded a maximum temperature of 42.2 degrees Celsius here. This is not only the highest in the state, but also the all-time highest witnessed by the city in March since 1952. This is the second consecutive day when Bhubaneswar emerged as the hottest place in the state. It had recorded a maximum temperature of 41.7C yesterday. The second highest temperature recorded in the city in March was 42C in 1989, 1991, 2004 and 2014. Bhubaneswar meteorological centre director Sarat Chandra Sahu told The Telegraph that the present weather condition may continue till March 26 while squally weather may make a comeback later in the month that could pacify the temperature by two or three degrees. ""Hot winds continue to blow from the western part of the state. Today, the speed of the wind was comparatively slower than that of yesterday. It was blowing at 15 to 20kmph that helped decrease humidity and push up the temperature. The clear sky also adds to the heat,"" said Sahu. Environmentalists blamed the merciless cutting of trees and rapid urbanisation for such climate change. ""The administration is cutting trees indiscriminately and planting none to replace them. On the other hand, rapid urbanisation resulting in an increase in vehicular traffic and construction work is resulting in such change in climate,"" said environmentalist Sailabala Padhi. Residents are taking to the local dish, pakhala, to beat the heat. The city celebrated Pakhala Diwas on Sunday. The fermented rice water is the most popular lunch item now with the mercury climbing. The dish that hydrates the body is advised as a remedy against sunstroke. ""The typical Odia dish of pakhala rice is indeed helpful in this temperature that can literally bake you if you are outdoors,"" said Biren Mohanty, a young corporate employee. Youths conduct an awareness drive on water conservation during Raahgiri. Telegraph picture ""We are even ordering pakhala for lunch at office since it is available at all small and big hotels and restaurants,"" he said. Pakhala has indeed entered the menu of all top restaurants and even roadside hotels and dhabas. Women can be spotted with faces wrapped with cotton stoles and every one is using umbrellas and sunglasses. Roadside kiosks offering cool drinking water also dot the city. The unusually high temperature has brought in focus the significance of taking care of the environment. The youths in the city are already spreading awareness to save water ahead of the World Water Day on Tuesday and Holi celebrations coming up later this week. On Sunday, a group of youngsters, along with some senior city residents, hosted a mourning procession for water wherein a huge artificial water drop was loaded on a cart. Members of the procession shouldered it and wailed for water that would be wasted on Holi. ""We wanted people to be aware about importance of water and this is why we took out this rally. We had done this last year too. Hopefully this unbelievable heat and our efforts will make residents aware about the importance of saving water,"" said Mahua Maharana, a member of Bakul Foundation that had taken out the procession."
58f4dbbb60de470aa339d1d7,State borrows despite central funds flow,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160113/jsp/bengal/story_63644.jsp,2016-01-13,"Calcutta, Jan. 12: The Mamata Banerjee government today borrowed Rs 1,000 crore from the market although the state had more funds in its coffers this year because of higher central cash flow on the basis of recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. The fresh loan took Bengal's borrowings since May 2011 to Rs 98,546 crore. A state government official said if the trend continued, the cumulative borrowing of the Trinamul government would reach Rs 1 lakh crore by next month or so. Both state and central governments scoop up money from the market by issuing bonds to bridge the gap between income and expenditure, but Bengal's binge borrowing has raised several questions. First, Mamata was a fierce critic of the Left government's ""profligacy"" and so it was expected that she would rein in unproductive expenditure to reduce the state's debt burden. ""But that has not happened and this government has set a record in terms of borrowing from the market,"" another official said. Second, the reliance on borrowing even in a year when the Centre has sent more funds to the state suggests that the fiscal management of finance minister Amit Mitra has not been up to the mark. According to a Facebook post of Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in June, the amount the Bengal government has been getting from central tax devolution has gradually increased over the past three years. The post also mentions that during the same period, the state has got a special grant to take care of its revenue deficit, the difference between revenue earned and money spent. ""Instead of utilising the money prudently and appreciating the efforts of the finance commission, the Bengal government has continued with its spending spree and is criticising the Centre for alleged non-payment of dues. The real story, however, is different,"" a 14th Finance Commission member in Delhi said. The fact that the funds available with the Bengal government have been more this fiscal is evident as the state has borrowed Rs 14,300 crore so far this year, less than the limit of Rs 23,000 crore. ""The use of only around 62 per cent of the borrowing limit till January shows that the need was less this year because of the flow of central funds,"" a state finance department official said. But because of political considerations in view of the Assembly elections, the state stepped up expenditure in the past few months and Mitra had to tap the market for funds. Sources said the state government had spent over Rs 700 crore to give bicycles to more than 20 lakh school students. Another Rs 500 crore was spent to give compensation to farmers partially affected by heavy rain over the past few months. In December, the finance department had to release a portion of the Rs 1,100 crore required to give subsidised rice to around 2 lakh people who are not beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act. The outgo will be more in the next few months as the state government will have to release more than Rs 600 crore in the last three months of the financial year to keep its subsidised rice scheme running. The government is also shelling out an additional Rs 250 crore every month to pay the increased dearness allowance to employees since January. An official said when the state's coffers are strained, either it should cut expenditure or increase revenue generation. ""After the central funds started flowing, the situation improved. The state could have explored the option of prepaying a part of the debt and that would have been good for the coffers. But the government squandered the opportunity by spending recklessly,"" the finance commission member said."

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today spoke to all the 30 district collectors through videoconferencing to give final shape to the populist scheme. At present, the scheme is being implemented in five cities - Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Rourkela. In the subsequent phase, it will include all the 103 urban local bodies in the state. Under the scheme, the government is providing rice and dalma (a combination of dal and vegetables) at Rs 5 to more than 22,000 people at 21 centres in the five cities. It intends to add nearly 30,000 meals at the 29 district headquarters. Official sources indicated the government would launch the scheme on March 5, coinciding with the birth centenary of Biju Patnaik, in whose name the ruling party has been founded. On December 29, The Telegraph had published a report - ""Govt readies Aahar for one lakh people: scheme to be expanded from March 1"" giving details of the government's plan. Urban development minister Pushpendra Singh Deo said the chief minister directed the officials to get the Aahar kendras (cheap meal serving centres) ready by February 25. All the infrastructure such as sheds, drinking water, sanitation, transport and training to the employees would be ready by that time. Official sources said 57 centres would be set up in 29 districts (barring Sambalpur) across the state. These centres would serve 30,300 meals every day. Singh Deo said societies had been registered in almost all the districts and implementing agencies had been selected. ""The societies are in touch with their respective funding agencies,"" he said. At present, the scheme is being financed by the state-run public sector undertakings such as the Odisha Mining Corporation, Odisha Power Generation Corporation and the Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation. They were roped in after the central public sector enterprises such as Nalco and the MCL had backed out allegedly under pressure from the BJP leaders. Sources said the cost per meal comes around Rs 15 and the meal is heavily subsidised. On December 23, a preliminary discussion on extension of the scheme to all the urban local bodies was held with district collectors through videoconferencing. Sources said the district collectors were asked to find out financing agencies and come with a concrete plan."

The head of water and environment department of AN College, Ashok Ghosh, said: ""The five-year project will start within two months. A total of five research professionals would be engaged in the project. Apart from assessing the arsenic contamination in groundwater of Bihar and Bangladesh, we aim to provide arsenic-free water in one of the villages of Bhojpur district, which has the highest amount of arsenic presence in its groundwater. The amount of arsenic is 1,861 parts per billion (ppb) against the permissible limit of 10 parts per billion. An arsenic-free borewell would also be dug up in the village."" Ghosh said his department was working on this issue for over a decade during which 18 districts were found to have high levels of arsenic. The districts include Darbhanga, Supaul, Purnea, Begusarai, Bhojpur, Munger and Lakhisarai. Ghosh said: ""Arsenic contamination in water is a grave issue. In Maner, when we carried out a project, we found at least 35 people suffering from diseases related to arsenic contamination in water. People were found suffering from melanosis (abnormal dark pigmentation of skin), keratosis (rough patch on skin) and skin cancer. We hope the project brings out many more aspects of arsenic contamination."" Ghosh said in another research conducted two years ago, it was found that arsenic contamination was affecting agriculture in the state as well. He said: ""Among the various rice varieties, arsenic was found in Sonam, Sarna and Turantha among others while among edible crops, arsenic was found in tomato, maze, wheat and spinach among others."" Ghosh said this was not the first time that his department was collaborating with foreign universities. ""Sandra Downes, a professor at the University of Manchester, has earlier worked with the faculty members of Water and Environment Science Department of AN College to find the solution of fluoride contamination in groundwater in Bihar. Fluoride is the second most contaminating factor after arsenic in the state. Excess fluoride content is dangerous for human consumption because it leads to problems such as accelerated tooth decay, painful warping of bones and skeletal as well as dental fluorosis,"" said Ghosh."

""The country's 16 crore farmers will get soil health cards in two years. The step, taken by the Centre, will benefit the farmers and increase productivity,"" Kundariya said while addressing the 41st foundation day of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) at its research complex at Lamphel here today. The Centre launched the soil health card scheme in January last year. The flagship programme aims at improving the soil health and reduce input costs for the farmers. The card is a printed report that will be given to farmers once in three years for each of his/her land holding. It will contain crucial information on macro nutrients in the soil, secondary nutrients and other physical parameters. The card will be accompanied by an advisory on the corrective measures a farmer should undertake to improve soil health and get better yields. Official sources here said several states, including Manipur, were very slow in issuing the cards. Stating that the scheme would increase the country's foodgrain production, the Union minister said all the stakeholders like the agriculture minister, state government, ICAR, agriculture universities and the farmers should work together to reduce the production cost and at the same time increase the output. He said the current scenario in agriculture and the steps taken by the state governments# would be reviewed during a two-day meeting of states' agriculture ministers and officials, convened by the Union agriculture ministry, in New Delhi next week. The minister did not say much about Manipur's farmers. He, however, said the Centre would pay attention to the problems of the farmers in Manipur. The minister emphasised the need to avoid the use of chemical fertilisers and instead go for organic farming. He appealed to the farmers to be aware of the harmful effects of using chemical fertilisers on the general health of the people in the long run. Manipur's agriculture director Louis Ngasainao stressed the need to utilise the state's farmlands in such a manner that the production of rice, oilseed and pulses are increased. According to Ngasainao, Manipur's requirement of rice is 677.80 metric tonnes annually while the present production has fallen short by 169.77 metric tonnes. Similarly, pulses have fallen short by 10,900 metric tonnes and oilseed by 5,125 metric tonnes. Central Agricultural University, Imphal, vice-chancellor M. Premjit said 170 hectares of paddy fields remained idle after harvest."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160114/jsp/northeast/story_63765.jsp,2016-01-14,"Jorhat, Jan. 13: If you are among those who burn their fingers trying to turn out those wafer-thin til pithas ahead of Bihu festivities and gives up in a huff, then hang on. The Assam Agricultural University has made a device that makes this difficult-to-make savoury delicacy a child's play. Priyanka Das, a senior scientist who designed the device, said it halves the time taken and fuel consumption, besides turning out the pithas in a uniform shape with minimum breakage. ""Since making the pithas this way is so easy, it can be made by working women who are pressed for time and would also be of commercial benefit as it consumes half the time in making as well as in fuel and cost,"" Das said. ""The device is so simple in its design that it should have been made years ago."" The device comprises three round plates or two of oval-shaped ones with slightly upturned edges so that the powder does not trickle off and are joined together at the base with a plate and a thin, long handle to hold it over the fire. When placed over a gas burner it turns out two cylindrical pithas or three single-flap moon-shaped pithas at one go in two minutes flat whereas in the traditional method of pitha-making, one can be made in two to three minutes and also entails burning one's fingers if you are not an expert. People often get their fingers burnt while trying to flatten the glutinous rice powder on the hot upturned tawa or griddle as fast as possible so that it does not burn. In this case, the layer of glutinous rice powder is already placed on the plates in a thin layer and then put atop the burner. The back of a spoon is all that is required to fold it atop the coconut-sugar mixture or a sesame-jaggery mixture placed in the middle in a straight line. ""We have demonstrated its use to a self-help group here and to housewives on the campus and have received very positive reviews. A list of comments by members of the group to a questionnaire prepared by Das affirmed that the pitha made on the plates tasted just as good, were easier and faster to make, saved on fuel and there was less of burning and breaking. One response even stated that usually the glutinous rice, powdered in a dheki (husking pedal), made good pithas, but in this case, the rice powder made in a mixer produced equally tasty ones. Das said homemade pitha usually tasted better as those prepared on a commercial scale were made days ahead of the festivities and sometimes the core of coconut and sugar mix developed a rotten taste, or the amount that made up the core was so little that one hardly got any taste except for the thickened rice exterior, which was mostly hard. With this device, even a novice can make delicious pitha in a jiffy. All one needs is a stock of the glutinous rice powder stored in the refrigerator because this usually spoils fast if uncooked. Abhijit Bora, principal investigator of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Post Harvesting Engineering and Technology, under which the work was done, also made a slide presentation at Tamil Nadu Agicultural University at Coimbatore earlier this month."

OR NOT QUITE? A CRPF jawan removes some empty chairs from a Trinamul camp near Our Lady Queen of the Missions School in HB Block, Salt Lake, on Monday, while two lonely party supporters look on. The Election Commission had allowed only a table, two chairs and two personnel inside a camp this year. In last years civic polls in Bidhannagar most such camps were spilling over with armies of Trinamul workers and outsiders.Picture by Mayukh Sengupta Dress like gentlemen, they were told. And lest they still arouse the suspicion of central forces, areas outside the township had been carefully marked for the group to assemble stealthily ahead of the mission. From carrying water bottles for polling agents to offering a chicken-and-rice meal to security personnel, Trinamul's vote syndicates employed every trick that hadn't been tried before to push outsiders into the booths during polling in Salt Lake on Monday. But the party's best-laid plans for its foot soldiers to escape the men in uniforms' surveillance radar went bust. Metro highlights how the battle against the vote mafia was won in Salt Lake and its adjoining areas. Tea boy trojan A bottle of water and a cup of tea - surely the central forces would make this small allowance for polling agents on a long, hot day. Trinamul's objective, of course, was to push in outsiders on the pretext of providing refreshments. Dressed in proper shirts and trousers, they were to carry water bottles and tea in kettles into the polling stations. Once inside a booth, they would try and cast false votes at every opportunity with the help of the party's polling agents. What Trinamul's think tank for subversion didn't foresee was that central forces would treat even the tea and water boy as a potential threat to a free and fair poll. Across booths, central forces either refused entry or free access to outsiders carrying tea or water for polling agents. According to a local Trinamul leader who had been entrusted with the task of co-ordinating the entry of these outsiders, security forces turned them away from several places, including booths in AB-AC, FD and CD blocks and the Rabindra Bharati University campus. ""The central forces wouldn't let them enter the booths even for a minute. Our agents protested but were sternly told that they would have to step out if they wanted to have tea and biscuits,"" the party leader said. In the few booths that these outsiders were allowed to enter with tea or coffee, a jawan would follow them everywhere. As soon as they had finished distributing tea and water bottles, the jawan would escort them out of the booth. Metro spotted a middle-aged ""water boy"" near a booth in Karunamoyee pleading with a group of jawans to allow him entry to serve tea and biscuits to the polling agents. They asked the overly eager carrier to pour out a cup of tea and drink it. The man did as told, at which a jawan quipped: "" Chai pi liye, ab jayiye yahan se (You had your tea. Now go away from here)."" As the would-be rigger reluctantly retraced his steps, he wore the look of a man who had just been beaten at his own game. Fringes of fortress Salt Lake is a fortress but Lake Town is lax, or so the vote-theft gang thought. Two councillors of South Dum Dum Municipality entrusted with the responsibility of arranging for 500 to 600 outsiders to infiltrate Salt Lake on polling day had gathered them in under-construction houses in Lake Town and along Jessore Road. The gang had been told to specifically avoid attracting the attention of the central forces and head for the booths in small groups. Every member was armed with fake voter identity cards. Each card bore a picture that could be passed off as that of the bearer in his younger days. The outsiders were advised to memorise the details on their respective cards to ensure that they did not hesitate if security personnel asked them questions. The plan for Lake Town, Bangur, Dakshindari and Dum Dum Park was based on the premise that security wouldn't be as stringent as in Salt Lake. Metro spotted a 50-strong group seated on plastic chairs and smoking cigarettes on the ground floor of an under-construction building in Lake Town's B Block around 1.30pm on Monday. The men appeared to be raring to go until central forces raided the building and drove everyone out. Those who protested were shoved and pushed out of the building. The few who still stuck around were chased out. The strict scan on entry points to Salt Lake had apparently helped sanitise the nearby areas, too. According to Trinamul insiders, a councillor in South Dum Dum Municipality had been asked to send his supporters to Salt Lake through the footbridges over the canal along VIP Road. The councillor and more than 150 of his men had assembled near Golaghata to try and cross over to the township using the footbridges at Baisakhi, Golaghata, Tank Number 4 and Tank Number 7. They were surprised to find central forces blocking their way at the entry points each time. When members of the gang went back to their original meeting point in Lake Town's Block B, a quick-reaction team of the central forces was there to intercept them. The security personnel charged at them and the councillor was injured in the melee. Conspiracy cooking Trinamul's offer of a free meal of rice and chicken proved inadequate for its army of fake voters to curry favour with the central forces. A makeshift food camp had been set up by the ruling party around 250 metres away from the polling station at Polenite Free Primary School in Polenite, an added area under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation. Several outsiders had been asked by their leaders to assemble in this camp. The plan was to offer voters lunch. Then the outsiders would mingle with the crowd and head for the booths in ones and twos to cast false votes. A few more food camps were set up in other parts of the added areas of Salt Lake. A party leader in charge of multiple such camps admitted that the strategy didn't work. ""Some jawans asked one of my boys where they were preparing food. They asked him to take them there as they were hungry. He happily obliged and took them to the camp. Once they reached there, they overturned the utensils and lathicharged my supporters. Around 20 of my men were injured,"" recounted the leader, himself nursing a swollen calf and an injured hand. Those at the camp had tried to reason with the central forces that food was being cooked for the party's four polling agents in two nearby booths, but they could not explain how four persons would consume 12kg of chicken and a huge quantity of rice. According to another leader running a food camp in Sardarpara, bordering a bheri, security personnel deployed in that area did the same to beat back his men. Guest appearance At Duttabad in Salt Lake, Trinamul leaders had asked their supporters to let outsiders stay overnight in their homes. Many weren't able to enter Duttabad because of tight surveillance of all vehicles entering and leaving Salt Lake across 24 check points in the township. Those who managed to sneak in and spend the night before polling in the houses of Trinamul supporters were asked to start moving towards their designated booths after noon. This plan too fell flat on its face, thanks to the security arrangements. Central forces and Bidhannagar police teams patrolled Duttabad at regular intervals. Whenever they would spot a group of men, the brief was straight and simple: chase them out. The security personnel checked homes at random and wherever they found anyone who aroused suspicion, they would ask for proof of identity and address. Those who could not prove that they were residents of the neighbourhood would be ordered to leave immediately. One of those at the receiving end of this proactive vigil was Nirmal Dutta, a Trinamul councillor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation. He was headed for the polling station at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan with a group of men when central forces blocked the way. ""I was going to the booth with genuine voters. The central forces unnecessarily chased us out,"" he complained on Tuesday. Zonal marking Trinamul tried its unsuccessful Salt Lake strategy in Rajarhat-New Town with similar results. Groups of men from South 24-Parganas had camped in Kalikapur, Mohammadpur and under-construction buildings in the vicinity, hoping to infiltrate polling booths and turn the elections into a farce like they had done in Salt Lake during the municipal polls last October. According to a Trinamul leader entrusted with managing the vote-rigging operation in Rajarhat-New Town, a group of 150 party supporters from Bhangor had assembled in an under-construction building at Chakpacharia, near Baligari, on Sunday. The ground floor of the building had been used recently to hold the traditional rice ceremony of someone's child and the decorator was asked by the local Trinamul leadership not to take away the tables, chairs and fans. Several cycles and mini-trucks were kept ready to transport the outsiders to the polling stations. The men were supposed to embark on their mission at 11am. Local party workers who were registered voters were to go to the polling booths, cast their votes and relay the security status to their leader. The leader, in turn, was to ask his men to move out on receiving the green signal. The 150 men who had been requisitioned to rig the elections waited and waited but the signal to start the operation never came. Central forces had cordoned off all the culverts leading to different polling stations in the Rajarhat-New Town belt and were frisking everyone who tried to enter the area. At least a couple of scouts sent by the Trinamul leader to assess the risk of the outsiders getting caught while trying to go through the security sieve were chased and beaten by the men in uniform. The rig gang had lunch and bided their time, but the central forces wouldn't let down their guard even for a second. Many in the increasingly restive group were soon taking a nap or whiling away the hours drinking multiple rounds of tea and smoking. Late in the afternoon, the men tried to breach the tight security cordons in groups of five or six. While most were stopped and ordered to turn back, some did manage to enter New Town or Rajarhat. But gaining access to the polling booths proved more difficult than they had imagined. ""Some of my boys did manage to cast votes. But the number is insignificant. Polling day did not go according to plan,"" the leader of the gang told Metro the day after. The credit for Monday's rigging-free poll in Salt Lake goes to...Tell [email protected]"

The foundation stone was laid on an 1.5-acre land in Narsingi for the construction of a technologically-advanced kitchen that would serve mid-day meals to thousands of children.The kitchen, which will be operational from next academic year, can prepare rice for 1,000 children in just 15 minutes and sambar for 2,000 people in two hours.Not just that, the kitchen will also provide direct and indirect employment to around 500 people. The new facility is coming up with the support of funding to the tune of Rs 10.5 crore by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. as part of its CSR initiative. The upcoming kitchen will be the 26 such facility of the Akshaya Patra Foundation in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Speaking at the stone-laying ceremony, the chairman of the Akshaya Patra Foundation, Madhu Pandit Dasa, said that from feeding 1,500 children in 2000, the foundation now provides food to 15 lakh children on a daily basis. Our target is to feed 5 million children every day by 2020, he said. By providing nutritious food, we are not only supporting the childrens education but also making the child a capable citizen who can contribute to the country, he said.We are trying to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. There are 120 million school children in this country, and if any of them do not get proper food then it is a shame to the countrymen.He said that the foundation was leveraging modern technology in its kitchen to prepare high-quality food, and they plan to start another kitchen on the outskirts of Hyderabad in three months.According to the members of the foundation, they are spending Rs. 60 lakh every day for the initiative, even after financial support from the government.

58f4dedd60de470aa339d5c1,Ration Achilles heel for govt before polls,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160214/jsp/bengal/story_69230.jsp,2016-02-14,"Calcutta, Feb. 13: Mamata Banerjee's subsidised foodgrain scheme is likely to be an Achilles heel for her government in the run-up to the Assembly polls, with protests over the plan spreading from one district to another. The developments have revived memories of the 2007-08 flare-up during the Left regime, when hundreds of ration shops across the state were set ablaze in protests against the ""faulty"" public distribution system. The problem According to Nabanna officials, the root of the problem is that around 15 per cent legitimate beneficiaries who had been left out of the purview of the Centre's National Food Security Act, 2013, are yet to be covered under the chief minister's plan. ""They could not be covered under the state government's scheme (launched on January 27) because of faulty planning,"" an official said. According to the list of beneficiaries published last year under the NFSA, 6.01 crore people in Bengal were eligible for subsidised foodgrain. But the central list did not include about 20 per cent of the beneficiaries who used to get cheap foodgrain under the BPL and Antadaya Anna Yojana (AAY) schemes earlier. CM steps in Sources said the chief minister, probably sensing that the issue could soon snowball into a bigger problem, launched the Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana (RKSY) to provide cheap foodgrain to another 1.5 crore people. Officials said Mamata did not attack the Centre for excluding around 20 per cent of the beneficiaries from the new list realising that people in rural areas still hold those running the panchayats responsible when deprived. In Bengal, around 70 per cent of the 3,354 panchayats are run by Trinamul. ""But the execution of the RKSY appears to be faulty. Nearly 1.5 crore people were included in the state scheme, but now it appears that around 15 per cent of those not included in the central list are yet to be taken care of,"" a senior official said. Sources said the government had made a mistake by engaging the panchayats and municipalities to execute the RKSY. Allegations have been made that the list of beneficiaries has been packed with Trinamul loyalists. ""The Opposition parties have milked the issue and protests are spreading from one district to another.... Ideally, we should have engaged ration dealers. They are in the know of things in the rural areas,"" a minister said. As a firefighting measure, Mamata announced on Monday that cheap foodgrain would be made available to all people in the state. Officials said they were hopeful that in three months, all those left out under the central scheme would get ration cards. But the major concern for the ruling party is that it would be very difficult to resolve the problem before the Assembly elections. Ad hoc solution The chief minister's announcement that all 9.2 crore people of Bengal would be eligible for subsidised grain has made the situation more critical, a senior official said. After Mamata's announcement, the number of beneficiaries has shot up from 7.5 crore to 9.2 crore overnight. The public distribution system in Bengal is not equipped to meet the enhanced foodgrain demand, an official said. ""The requirement of rice for 7.5 crore beneficiaries was 2.5 lakh tonnes a month. It has now shot up to around 3.75 lakh tonnes. It is tough to arrange and supply the additional rice to ration shops in a short time,"" the official said. Through a notification on Wednesday, the state government directed ration dealers to issue due slips to consumers if they run short of stock. The slips will mention that foodgrain will be made available within two weeks. But the dealers are reluctant to adhere to the directive, saying they are not sure that the additional grain would reach them within two weeks. ""The food and supplies department should ask the BDOs to issue the due slips.... I cannot take the risk because I have to depend on the government to get the foodgrain,"" said a ration dealer in Birbhum. Not only supply, officials said they would also face problems in arranging the additional foodgrain. Earlier, the food department had planned to buy 45 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers to get 30 lakh tonnes of rice in a year and meet the monthly rice requirement of 2.5 lakh tonnes. ""Now, we have to buy around 68 lakh tonnes of paddy to meet the monthly rice requirement of 3.75 lakh tonnes. We don't have the infrastructure,"" an official said. Storage of such a huge quantum of foodgrain would be another problem for ration dealers. ""According to the plan, we were supposed to develop our storage capacity in phases over the next one year.... But right now, I don't know how to store the additional foodgrain,"" a ration dealer said."

Picture by UB PhotosTitabar/Borhola (Jorhat), April 1: Ajan pir threw his staff across the river and it became a bridge for him to cross it. Thats how pious a Muslim he was, says Rashid Ahmed, 65. I am a Muslim too, but I wont vote AIUDF. Not that I have anything against Badruddin Ajmal, but there are different kinds of Muslims, you see. Generations of our family have voted for Congress and I intend to do the same. The pir now lies buried at Sarogua chapori in Sivasagar district, 80km east of Titabar, a prophet of communal harmony in Assam. Snuggled by lush green tea estates, Ahmeds village, Borera Gaon, is an Assamese microcosm: surnames ranging from Kurmi to Ahmed to Orang, Gogoi, Barhoi and Shyam, religions from Hindu to Muslim, Christian and Buddhist and livelihoods from agriculture (the area is referred to as Assams granary) to employment in tea gardens to small businesses and weaving. The river Ahmed refers to is the Brahmaputra that takes, on a good day minus storms and the annual flood, an hour-and-a-half to cross by ferry, from Majuli  the constituency where the BJPs chief ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal is fighting the elections from  to Jorhat. Around 22km south of Jorhat lies Titabar, chief minister Tarun Gogois constituency, his personal turf, one that has made him return to the state Assembly thrice in a row. The drive takes one across Dhodar Ali, a road that Ahom king Gadadhar Singha had constructed using dhods  human sloths. It stretches a good 212km, right up to Joypur in Dibrugarh district, through Golaghat. Borera Gaon had waited all day to hear Gogoi address an election rally that local Congressmen had painstakingly put together. No buses and trucks lined up by the roadside but a steady flow of people for hours, till the field was filled by a few thousand. Former Union minister Paban Singh Ghatowar, from the tea workers community, speaks to the gathering till Gogoi arrives. Rashid Ahmed in his house in Borera Gaon. Picture by Umanand Jaiswal Titabar is a constituency of beneficiaries. It was the Congress who raised your tea plucking wages from what it was, 50 paisa a day, during the British. We brought it up to what it is now  Rs 126 a day. We want to raise it further and have gone to the court to get this done. If the BJP tells you they can raise it to Rs 300 or Rs 400 just like that, remember karo baaper dom nai (no one can bring about that kind of a quantum increase, just like that) He goes on: Tea workers now have provident fund, your womenfolk have three months of maternity leave with full pay. What has the BJP done? After they came to power in Delhi they started out by stopping your rations. That is how much they care for you. Vote for us and we will give your more. Public memory is short and Gogoi then takes his time poking holes in the BJPs promises. Did you get the Rs 15 lakh the BJP promised for each of you? They instead took away Assams special category status. Do not be swayed by misinformation. My opponent Kamakhya Tasa of the BJP will stand with tea garden owners. We have and will be with the workers. I am one of you. The economic climb in Titabar may have been slow but shows steady signs of growth. Rashid Ahmed is in the process of building concrete walls to his ramshackle tenement. A plumber by profession, Ahmed has been home for 12 years, ever since he met with an accident. The government gave him a tricycle to go around after his accident. His son now resells broiler chicken while his wife is part of an atmo xohai got, a self-help group, which is a big thing in these parts. Hers is a group of 10 women and they have taken and repaid two loans totalling Rs 2.5 lakh. The money has been used by members to weave and do various other things. We make around Rs 6,000 a month each, says Majida Begum, who is now a part of the decision-making process. We had a difficult time when the Rs 3 per kg rice scheme was stopped for three months but it has now been restored, says Ahmed, referring to the delay owing to the standoff between the Centre and the state over the formers bid to distribute both wheat and rice to the beneficiaries under the Food Security Act, which Dispur had opposed because most people in Assam do not consume wheat. The standoff resulted in the delay of distribution by over a month. Finally, it was only rice, but the standoff had just about doused the fire in Rashids hearth. Flogging the system to put out freebies (or virtually such) has, however, had its downside. Around 18km away to the south, at Borhola, septuagenarian Punam Chand Pincha is a worried man, having borne the brunt of social welfare freebies that both the BJP and the Congress so generously dole out. Borholla used to have 72,000 quintal surplus rice in 1972. Today it is down to less than 7,200 quintal. I dont see the situation improving much, Pincha, owner of one of Borhollas oldest mills, says. Apart from fragmentation of land holdings over the years, the flooding of Rs two-three per kg rice supplied by states such as Punjab under the governments welfare schemes has played a key role in the decline of rice output. Not good news for an area which prides itself as Assams granary. Born and raised in Borholla, Pincha says no effort seems to have been made to help farmers switch over to something more rewarding like organic farming, now that paddy cultivation is no longer profitable. One must be honest to deliver. Politics too must have honesty to deliver, he says. No one  neither Congress nor BJP  promises to make a change on the freebie front. His poverty notwithstanding, Rashid Ahmed though has other things on his mind. Dadri happened, as did the Babri Masjid demolition and it happened under BJP rule, he says. Its not that we have anything against anyone but we will vote Congress. A security and freebie combination can be a hard act to beat."

Telegraph picture Kohima, April 15: Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan today asked the Nagaland government to implement the National Food Security Act for the benefit of the people. Paswan, who arrived in Dimapur today to meet officials on food security, said the act was passed in July 2013 and within a year all the states in the country had implemented it, except Nagaland. ""At present, the total allocation of food grain is 1,127,668 tonnes. If the act is implemented, the allocation will rise to 1,138,000 metric tonnes. This will only benefit the state government,"" the minister said. He said if the act is implemented, about 80 per cent people in the rural areas would get wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg. On transportation cost, he said 75 per cent of the cost would be borne by the Centre and the rest by the state government. He also spoke on hill transport subsidy which is utilised for transporting food grain from the FCI depot to the intermediary godowns. Nagaland has not claimed this subsidy for quite sometime, he said. For implementation of the food security act, Paswan said four criteria have to be fulfilled - digitisation of beneficiary list, online allocation, supply chain management and grievance mechanism. He said chief minister T.R. Zeliang had assured implementation of the act soon. Stating that Dimapur was the only FCI district in Nagaland catering to the needs of around 20 lakh people, Paswan said Kohima will also be made an FCI district soon. ""For this, a godown will be constructed in Kohima. It will be completed by September and I will come to inaugurate the godown,"" he said. The minister asked the state government to fulfill all the conditions for implementing the act at the earliest. He also held a meeting with state officials on adequate supply of food grain to needy people."

A kilogram of chicken now sells at Rs 200 in Maniktala market. In February, it was available at Rs 130. Soumen Das, who has been selling chicken at the market for 10 years, said there was surplus supply in February. ""I sold dressed chicken at Rs 120 a kg on some days. The price has been going up since March... on weekends I sell chicken at Rs 220 a kg,"" he said. The story is same in markets across Calcutta, from Baranagar to Behala, where chicken prices have hit an all-time high. ""The last time the price had peaked was three years ago during the bird flu outbreak. But even then, it did not cross Rs 190,"" said Mithun Jana of Gariahat market where chicken is being sold at Rs 220 a kg. The supply has dwindled because of the extreme heat, which lowers the food intake capacity of domestic fowls, resulting in slow growth. Moreover it is election time and men from various political parties are picking up chicken in bulk from poultry farms and wholesalers to prepare lunch and dinner for cadres. Result: whatever is available in the market is selling at a premium. Manager Bamdeb Ghosh of Suguna Chicken in Barasat said temperatures in the range of 24-28 degrees Celsius was ideal for the growth of chicken. Once it reaches 33 degrees, the birds start gasping and cannot take in much food. When the temperature crosses 37.5 degrees, they die of heatstroke, he said. ""Generally, a bird takes about 37 days to turn into a full-grown chicken. By then it weighs around 2.3kg. Nowadays they are barely reaching 1.3-1.4kg in the same period because of the heat,"" Ghosh said. Calcutta has seen an exceptionally hot start to summer this year with the mercury touching 41.3 degrees Celsius on April 11. The situation is worse in places like Basirhat, Barasat and Burdwan - from where the city sources its chicken - which have had temperatures hovering around 40 degrees or more for most of April. Speaking about the demand from political parties, a poultry farmer in Basirhat said he had supplied more chicken to party cadres than wholesalers in the past three weeks. ""It is difficult to say no to them. Yesterday (Monday), I had to give 100 birds to Trinamul cadres. I haven't received any payment and I don't know when I will get it,"" he said. A wholesaler in north Calcutta said he had supplied ""200 whole chickens"" to the party on Monday when the fourth phase of elections was held. Rice and chicken curry comprise the staple diet of Trinamul cadres in the districts. In the city and on the fringes, the menu has been fried rice and chilly chicken. Restaurants and food joints have had busy poll days supplying chicken delicacies to party workers. On Monday, three eateries in Baguiati supplied 250 packets of fried rice and chilly chicken to Trinamul party workers around 1.30pm. One of the owners quoted a worker as saying: ""We will take these to Kestopur, Baguiati and Teghoria where our agents are working in polling booths."" Anindya Mukherjee, a Trinamul leader in Dum Dum, said chicken biryani and chicken chaap used to be the staple diet in past elections. ""But the menu has changed because of the heat. When you are out in the sun for a long time, biryani is not a good option. So, we opted for light chicken curry and rice this time,"" he said. Many restaurant owners said they had felt the pinch because of rising prices but had chosen to let the rates remain unchanged in the hope that chicken prices would come down as the polls got over and the temperature came down. Some caterers have changed the rates of chicken dishes. ""For current bookings we are charging Rs 30 to Rs 50 more than the actual rate,"" said Supriyo Sen Sharma of Delicious Catering."

The act will cover 6 lakh people out of the state's total population of around 12 lakh. The National Food Security Act, 2013, was launched in Mizoram recently by state food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister John Rotluangliana. The act will cover 6,44,882 people, including beneficiaries under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) which is being availed by 83,052 people, and 5,61,830 people and priority household. There are 25,785 families under the AAY, which would receive 35kg of rice per month at the rate of Rs 3 per kg, while each priority family member would get 5kg rice each month at the same cost. This act provides food and nutritional security by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Mizoram government decided that the remaining 5,97,229 people who are out of the beneficiary list would also be able to purchase 8kg rice under the scheme at Rs 15 per kg, while the priority beneficiaries can also purchase an additional 3kg of rice at the rate of Rs 15 per kg. The total number of ration cards under the act will be 1,36,873, while 1,07,638 ration cards will be issued to the people who do not come under it. Sources in the Mizoram food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department told this correspondent today that with the implementation of this scheme in the state, the requirement of foodgrain for AAY and priority families would be close to 5,397.12 metric tonnes, while Mizoram's total monthly requirement of rice would be around 9,814.95 metric tonnes. Sources added that the state government would have to buy 1,788.37 metric tonnes of rice from the Centre and 4,314.95 metric tonnes from the open market to meet the requirements. According to the act, in case of non-supply of the entitled quantities of foodgrain or meals to entitled persons, they shall be entitled to receive such food security allowance from the state government to be paid to each person, within such time and manner as may be prescribed by the Centre. MNF celebrates ""independence day"": The main Opposition political party, the Mizo National Front, today celebrated Mizo Independence Day to mark the day of declaration for an independent state in 1966. MNF president and former chief minister Zoramthanga paid tribute to all the people who were associated with the movement for a separate land for Mizo people."

The protesters under the banner of Fair Price Dealers' Association, led by district secretary Halim Khan, later handed over a memorandum to Dhanbad deputy commissioner Kripa Nand Jha. They also complained about the faulty process of allotment of ration cards to many undeserving families at the expense of BPL beneficiaries. Khan said over 23,000 PDS shop owners from across the state would stage a dharna in Ranchi next month followed by a gherao of the Assembly in March. ""We will also send postcards to President Pranab Mukherjee to apprise him of our pitiable condition. If the government fails to meet our demands, we will resort to an indefinite strike from Labour Day on May 1,"" said Khan. He added they welcomed implementation of the Food Security Act in Jharkhand, which mandated distribution of foodgrains like rice and wheat among the poor, but the dealers didn't even earn Rs 2,000 per month under the prevailing commission system. ""A commission of Rs 40 has been fixed on sale of one quintal of foodgrain and each shop owner gets 25 to 40 quintals. Thus, he earns somewhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,600. Income from kerosene oil is even less as only 10 paise commission is fixed for one litre. The transportation cost of each drum containing 200 litres of kerosene is Rs 350 while the income from commission is just Rs 20. Each dealer suffers a loss of Rs 330,"" he said<>,"" Khan said.

Paswan had yesterday called on Naveen at his residence here. Addressing a news conference here, the Union minister said: ""The ministry has received complaints about how the rich people have got the cards while the poor have been deprived of them. After the food security card came into existence, more than 4.5 crore bogus cards have been detected. A process has been initiated to make these cards defunct."" However, he also said: ""It is the state government which prepares the beneficiary list. The Centre is only giving the guidelines and releasing the food grains as per the demands of the states."" On being asked why the Centre is not taking action against the state government for its inaction to constitute a food commission, he said: ""According to the Act, the Centre is only a recommending agency. Instead of the ministry taking action, the media should play a pro-active role in bringing these issues to limelight."" He said wherever the subsidised rice was being provided to the state by the Centre, the state government, instead of giving due credit to the Centre, was trying to appropriate the credit by saying that they were offering the rice to the people. ""This has been noticed both in Tamil Nadu and Odisha,"" he said. To check pilferage of food grains, attempts have been made to digitise the ration cards. ""About 99.9 per cent ration cards have been digitised across the country. More than 42 per cent ration cards have been even linked with Aadhaar cards. Such measures will help make the public distribution system more transparent and leak proof,"" said Paswan. Paswan also assured the state government that its request to give the state more rice instead of wheat under the National Food Security Act would be considered. The state government's demand for supply of more rice at a subsidised rate to the SC/ST and backward classes will also be considered, he said. To check leakage and diversions of food grains and to facilitate direct cash transfer of food subsidy to the beneficiaries, the consumer affairs ministry has launched a pilot scheme in Chandigarh and Puducherry in September, 2015. As part of the scheme, in lieu of food grains, subsidy component is credited directly into the bank accounts of beneficiaries who will be free to buy food grains from anywhere in the market, he said. Prescription audit The state government has made it mandatory for the district headquarters hospitals to conduct regular audit of prescriptions. The move of the health and family welfare department came in view of irregularities by doctors who are allegedly reluctant to prescribe generic medicine available at Niramaya for the patients."

AAU vice-chancellor K.M. Bujarbaruah announced this ahead of his discussion with the professors of University of Aberdeen, UK, regarding a collaborative research programme with the department of biotechnology centre (DBT) of the varsity. ""It is a proud moment for us that India is clearing GM crops path through Assam Agricultural University. BT pigeon pea, developed by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Hyderabad, is the other GM crop that got recommendation for deregulation,"" he said. Director of DBT centre B.C. Sarmah, who developed the BT chickpea, resistant to pod borer infestation, said confined field trials had been conducted in Andhra Pradesh and an average of 25 per cent more yield than non-BT chickpea was achieved. The production was 41 per cent more than non-BT chickpea in other trial areas, he added. ""India imported 4.7 million tonnes of chickpea in 2014-15 and it cost $2.6 billion. Till January this year, 4.41 million has already been imported and it cost US $2.79 billion,"" Sarmah said. ""The BT chickpea, when deregulated, will help decrease its import, make our country self-sufficient in chickpea production and we will make profit,"" Bujarbaruah said. He added that the two-day discussion with the professors from the University of Aberdeen would chalk out areas where the intervention of biotechnology was required. ""The projects will be taken up on a collaborative manner. We will have to take into consideration how value addition can be done through biotechnology and otherwise,"" he said. Bujarbaruah said intervention into factors like rainfall would also have to be taken into consideration. Collaboration between the University of Aberdeen and fisheries, food and nutrition department of the College of Home Science under AAU could be explored, he added. The three professors from University of Aberdeen were rice geneticist Adam Price, who headed the delegates from UK, Sam Martin of aquaculture department and Alex Douglas of bioinformatics department. Bujarbaruah said the DBT centre, funded by the department of biotechnology, central government, had received an extension of five years because of its good research projects.

The state machinery swung into action after Sahebganj police seized two trucks, carrying consignments meant for PDS shops in the region, along Jharkhand-Bengal border on April 20. Taking a serious note of the incident, department's minister Saryu Roy rushed to Sahebganj on April 23 and ordered action against those responsible. Today, the minister asked deputy director Sanjay Kumar to do an in-depth inquiry into the case. ""We are in favour of a detailed probe either by a state or central agency,"" Roy said. ""At the department level, deputy director Sanjay Kumar will go to Sahebganj soon and look into the details of foodgrains lifted from the FCI godown in the district between October 15 last year and March 16. This apart, senior department officials will go for surprise visits to different districts. We will ensure a detailed probe into the smuggling of foodgrains from Sahebganj and Pakur districts."" During preliminary inquiry, it was found that 17 truckloads of rice had started from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godown in Barharwa of Sahebganj on April 20. The godown supplies grains to PDS dealers across Sahebganj, Pakur and Godda districts. The probe revealed that 13 trucks reached their actual destinations but four trucks were initially ""untraceable"". Later, two of the missing trucks were seized by the Sahebganj police along the Bengal border while two more trucks are still ""traceless"". An FIR has been lodged against the owners, drivers and cleaners of the ""seized"" trucks, besides transporter. After further probe, the government yesterday suspended State Food Corporation's (SFC) Sahebganj district manager Bhudev Mandal and lifting in-charge posted at the FCI godown Gurupad Sutradhar for their alleged involvement into the racket. Sources said that the seizure was only a tip of the iceberg, a pointer to a well-organised interstate racket, involving traders, transporters, middlemen and government officials. The racketeers, in connivance with PDS dealers and officials, take away the share of poor beneficiaries and send truckloads of foodgrains to Bangladesh via Bengal. ""Trucks load food grains from SFC and FCI godowns and many of them disappear midway and head towards Bengal,"" said a source from Sahebganj. ""The things have been going on in Sahebganj, Pakur and other Santhal Pargana districts for quite some time now, but the Sahebganj police's action has finally prompted the government to train its scanner on the racket."" During a meeting on April 11, Roy was amazed to know that many marketing officers and block supply officials were not ready to submit details of their property, which is mandatory for their promotion. The minister then directed all officials to provide details of their property by April 30, failing in which they would have to face departmental action."

A peace which the hustle and bustle of electioneering for the forthcoming polls in the state has not been able to upset. What is conspicuous by its absence in the villages is the angst, anger and animosity so perceptible in urban areas. They mostly spoke of food, shelter, roads and bridges. Nothing else mattered. For the majority of urban voters in Sivasagar, Jorhat and Golaghat, a fear of the demographic profile being overturned prevails, as it had been in eight districts in Assam with Hindus turning into a minority in their own state. ""Migration by Bangladeshis, illegally into Assam through the porous border, can only be stopped by the BJP and not the Congress which has always played vote-bank politics,"" said one voter. Issues such as the Subansiri lower dam project, land-swap with Bangladesh and the bringing back to India of the illegal wealth kept in foreign banks also found mention in the discourses, as did rising corruption and lofty promises of the BJP such as parivartan layenge (we will bring change) and achhe din ayenge (good days will come). Then there is the BJP supporters' favourite punching bag in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. In Jorhat, a voter stated: ""As long as Rahul Gandhi is at the helm of affairs of the Congress, I will vote for the BJP."" However, unlike the urban voter, for the rural voter, these issues - the NHPC big dam, land swap, development and demographic change - do not matter much. The story changes in the interior areas. ""More or less I am happy. We have got almost everything from the government - rice at Rs 3 and Rs 6 a kilo, engagement in the NREGA projects which gives us money for other essentials,"" said Prasanta Bora of Koasogoral, Pohubar, under Mariani constituency of Jorhat district on how he feels about the Congress's 15 years in power. Even former AGP loyalists in the remote areas seem to have done a turnaround. In the Chenijan area, Pradip Gogoi grudgingly admitted that though a pucca road had not materialised, the mud track laid under NREGA would suffice for the time being. In faraway Amguri and Nazira, the same reel is played out - in villages as well as the tea gardens dotting the countryside. A common refrain goes: ""The government has made a road in our village and given us blankets and weaving yarn."" Peace, they said, has a lot to do with the government intervention to boost the rural economy even though much remains to be done by way of monitoring and timely completion of projects. These are, according to government figures, generation of 7,941.49 man days in the past 14 years through implementation of various welfare schemes, utilising Rs 912,793.69 lakh. Then there is the construction of more than 16.55 lakh Indira Awas Yojana houses between 2001-2015 and operationalisation of 62,153 Anganwadi welfare centres, which make a huge difference to the lives of rural folk.

Telegraph pictures Agriculture output also grew by 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 against negative growth rate in the farm sector during 2000-01, a year before the Congress regained power in Assam. The Congress is busy trying to cash in on this peace to return to power in face of stiff challenge from the AGP-BJP-BPF combine and the AIUDF on the other. This is a plank chief minister Tarun Gogoi never tires of tomtoming. ""Development of our villages is a must for all-round development,"" the three-term chief minister says, subtly conveying which constituency he has been assiduously wooing in the ensuing battle of ballots."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Feb. 19: More than 2.52 crore people in Assam will now benefit under the National Food Security Act with digitisation of beneficiaries' records, Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan said today. Paswan, who was here to inaugurate the National Test House building, said implementation of the act in the state was delayed as digitisation of records of beneficiaries, which is mandatory for implementation of the act, was not done by the state. ""This has now been done and over 2.52 crore people will benefit with subsidised foodgrain,"" he said. The National Test House is a government laboratory for testing and evaluation of material and products of all engineering branches except food, pharmaceuticals and arms and ammunition. The test house will be upgraded in future with new facilities to cater to the demands of industries located in the Northeast, Paswan said. The minister urged the state government to speed up implementation of the act so that about 84 per cent of rural and 60 per cent of urban population, who are below poverty line, can get rice at Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2 per kg. He said the Centre was keen that the beneficiaries get their entitled foodgrain and it has notified rules for payment of food security allowance to the beneficiary in the case of non-delivery of foodgrain to them. Paswan said the benefit of subsidised foodgrain should also be passed on to tea garden workers, who were earlier not getting direct benefit of public distribution system (PDS) as bulk allocation of foodgrain was being made to tea garden management only. Tea garden workers have now been made eligible to receive foodgrain under PDS for the first time. Altogether 17.97 lakh tea garden workers will receive foodgrain under the act. The Centre is allocating 12,590 tonnes of foodgrain to the state every month for distribution among tea garden workers. Paswan said to make the system transparent and leak-proof, online allocation of foodgrain has been implemented in 20 states/Union Territories. Toll free helplines have been installed in 32 states/Union Territories and online grievance redressal implemented in all the 36 states/Union Territories. He said the Northeast was a priority area for his ministry and it would ensure adequate supply of foodgrain to the region using multi-modal transport - rail, road and waterway. A storage capacity of 62,650 metric tonnes of foodgrain has been created in the Northeast, he added."

Poster wars between the DMK and the AIADMK. Photo: V. GanesanWhen the principal political rivals mimic each other in policies and programmes, and not just failures and misdeeds, they leave space for the emergence of a powerful third force. Tamil Nadu is still some distance away from seeing a party other than the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of M. Karunanidhi and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) of Jayalalithaa coming to power, but the two parties are so cast in each others image that voters are increasingly beginning to feel that one is not an alternative to the other in any substantive sense.But things were not always so.From alternative to mirror imageIn 1972, when M.G. Ramachandran broke away from the DMK to start his own party, the Anna DMK, he did not exactly split the parent party vertically. While he took away a substantial chunk of the DMK with him, what hurt the party the most was the manner in which he managed to bring together all those opposed to it under his leadership. The DMK managed to retain much of its urban, middle class support base in the post-split period, but still lost to MGR, whose party subsumed the support bases of the Congress factions to emerge as its principal opposition.Thus, despite being a breakaway group of the DMK, the ADMK, which later labelled itself as the All India Anna DMK, had a very different support base. In contrast to the urban, organised working class and middle class base of the DMK, the AIADMK leaned heavily on the rural poor and unorganised workers. Both parties were Dravidian in name and invoked the achievements of the DMKs founder and first Chief Minister, C.N. Annadurai, but they catered to very different political and social constituencies. Ideologically and programmatically, the AIADMK was in every sense an alternative to the DMK. If the DMK stressed on governance and infrastructure, the AIADMK swore by welfare schemes and dole-outs.However, in recent years, the two parties have begun imitating each other: the AIADMK, during the second term of Ms. Jayalalithaa as Chief Minister between 2001 and 2006, gave up the populist schemes of MGR and embarked on a course of making public utilities more efficient and less subsidy-dependent. Although she rolled back some of the measures after the rout in the Lok Sabha election of 2004, the AIADMK was no longer the same party. It actively sought to cultivate the urban, educated middle class voters, promising greater efficiency in the management and delivery of government services, even if at a higher cost to the consumer.When the DMK returned to power in 2006, the party adopted the MGR formula of cultivating the rural poor with schemes that directly benefited them. Besides lowering the price of rice made available through the Public Distribution System, and strengthening the noon meal scheme, Chief Minister Karunanidhi ran a government of freebies, foremost among them being the handing out of colour televisions to every household with a ration card.Also, the rise of Mr. Karunanidhis elder son, M.K. Alagiri, within the party hierarchy in the southern districts coincided with the adoption of political patronage as an electoral device by the DMK leadership. The growth in the influence of lumpen elements within the DMK also increased around the same time, making the party indistinguishable from the AIADMK in this respect.In corruption, in misuse of power, the two parties began to mirror each other in their years in power in the new century.The leadership-base disjunctionIdeologically too, there was little to tell the two parties apart. The AIADMK began as a softer version of the DMK, on account of its assimilation of the Congress support base, by diluting its rationalist, and anti-Hindi nationalist rhetoric. But with the DMK itself diluting its stand on such issues, and forging politically-dependent alliances first with the Congress and then with the Bharatiya Janata Party, such distinctions no longer made sense. And as parties with a regional identity, they defied any slotting within the Left-Right spectrum, and often adopted policies that went against the interests of their support bases. The resultant leadership-base disjunction only increased the similarities between the two parties.Thus, if the two parties are beginning to look more and more like each other, it is because their support bases have, in some ways, coalesced into one amorphous mass that can shift loyalty from one election to another. This explains why neither party can claim to have its traditional bastions of support. The DMK can no longer be sure of winning in Chennai and other cities, just as the AIADMK cannot be confident of winning in the rural areas of the southern districts.There is certainly a high degree of voter fatigue with the two Dravidian parties; but an alternative will take a long time to build up. The Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) led by actor-politician Vijayakant does not inspire confidence, with the party seeking to be all things to all people at all times, a mishmash of identities. Just as its choice of name suggests, it sees no contradiction in laying claim to the nationalist, progressive and Dravidian legacies. The third front of the DMDK, the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a Dalit party, the two Left parties, and the Tamil Maanila Congress, reflects the same mishmash. It will certainly take a lot more political churning to throw up a viable alternative to the two major Dravidian parties.suresh.nambath@thehindu.co.inThe DMK cannot be sure of winning in the cities, just as the AIADMK cannot be sure of winning in the rural areas of southern districts"

Amongst them is an old lady, Saraswati Debi, who had stood up and threatened to visit explosive harm to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's tender body areas during the Mamata-led Singur agitation all those years (it feels like decades) ago. There are not too many people despite Didi being expected, maybe about 2,000. Near the stage, journalists discuss who has the courage to ask Didi why she didn't hold the rally at the site of the plant itself. Two journos shake their heads in fearful laughter, ' merey phelbey jodi jigyesh korey keu!', she'll kill anyone who asks that question. TMC songs are playing on the PA, one with a baul tune, one with traces of bhangra and, most galling for any supporters of the Left, an anthem sung to the tune of We Shall Overcome: ' Trinamul korbey jo-o-oyy, Trinamul korbey jo-o-oyy, Trinamul korbey joy - nishchoyy...' SUV convoys arrive, disgorging various worthies. The TMC campaigns seem exactly like their karyakartas - well-fed, tight-paunched, quietly belligerent. The chopper whisks by overhead. The women in front go wild. The crowd has swollen to maybe just under 4,000. The man who's speaking gives the drill: 'The underhand Jote has put up a candidate with a similar name, Rabin to our Rabindranath, don't make a mistake, press the number 3 button!' On the mike, a group starts to chant. Mmmataabannrjee swagatam-swagatam, Mmmmtabondhopadhyaay whelcum-whelcum... Mamata appears, the sari a round whirl, like a ball of white candy-floss in the middle of which moves the woman. People bend for her feet. She touches some cheeks, some shoulders, before sloughing everybody off, ' sha-go-tomm, sha-go-tomm!', till she's installed on a chair centre stage. The first thing she does after wiping her face with her pallu is to banish the branded water from the table. Someone hands her a bhaand instead. Mastermoshai, one of the two local TMC candidates, continues his speech. The Didi sits there, not looking up, rocking her smartie, tapping messages, scrolling up and down, controlling the world. The other candidate also keeps it brief: 'So many kilometres of roads, so many bridges built locally since TMC came to power, degree college, lots done for the local chaashi by this pro-farmer administration. And, who has so quickly forgotten the terror of the dastardly CPM? And the perfidious Congress? They are less than nothing. Under the leadership of our great netri, we have delivered...' At the mention of her name there is wide applause. Didi ignores this and continues to pester her phone. Saraswati Debi comes on stage with her flag and Mamata hugs her before the old lady goes and occupies a chair. When the Didi finally takes the wireless mike a ripple goes through the near-orbit crowd, especially in the women's enclosure. Now that she's front of stage you can see that her complexion is election-darkened - the March-April sun has left its mark. She looks fit but gaunt and a bit tired, with impatience barely repressed. In her speech too, she seems to have no time for frills. As she speaks, she looks at her phone for notes. To paraphrase: The weather is very hot but it is even hotter when I do meetings at noon, at one pm - those who sit in air-conditioning will not understand but we working people know what this heat means - ' weather-ta o ekhon bhishon vulnerable', the weather is also now very vulnerable. What day is it? I've lost track how long I've been campaigning - Singur is the mother-base of my politics, we all started from here, I don't have to come here to ask for votes, I've just come to see you - a list of the assaults she and they had suffered together - But! The Land! It may take a while to return it but the land is back in our hands! The wind whips her mike as she speaks. A swipe at these deluded Baamphont who are actually daring to ask to be let back into power - a list of their atrocities going back to Marichjhapi, the Ananda Margi massacre, Bantala, then Singur and Nandigram - no one's forgotten! - and here we've got you everything - a list - 'apnara ki paan ni, bolun?', what haven't you people got, tell me? Every now and then, like a musician or a master actor, she seems to be lost in her own dhun, looking sideways, cutting off all eye-contact, speaking almost to herself. Then she seems to remember Singur, the rapt crowd, and she whirls back. They are saying what about the land, what about the land? We will return the land! 'Koemittment is a koemittment is koemittment!' It's a freewheeling speech that seems to have no graph. There's no structure she seems to be following, just relaying thoughts as soon as they enter her head. Mostly her Bangla is straightforward but occasionally she switches to English, using quite sophisticated words, and you wonder who else she is addressing, besides the audience. At some point there is a rustle at the back of the crowd; people are filing out quickly, without waiting for her to finish. The master-communicator notices this and immediately asks all the women to respond to her with an ulu. Everyone gets up. The women in front enthusiastically trip their tongues into the high sound. The people leaving are obscured from any cameras. Mamata asks for 'Jora phuley shob vote', all votes for the twin flower symbol, and leaves. Driving back to the main highway, we pass the throngs from the meeting walking in line along the village road. No one goes right or left into the lanes as locals might do, everyone seems to be heading for the junction with the highway where the trucks and tempos are waiting to take them home. If the Mamata rally on Saturday had a sleekly organised feel to it, this rally at Boichipota in Singur has a more festive, a more cottage-industry, village mela feel to it. In a small clearing next to fields full of harvest, a small stage and some cloth spread on the ground for the voter audience. There is no shamiana cloth overhead and the trees and hedges are festooned with an odd combination of flags, the hammer and sickle on red nuzzling the Congress hand and tricolour. On the way here, another strange sight, or at least one not often seen in Bengal over the last four years - a line of young men on bikes, the red flag fluttering on the handlebars. We are expecting the Jote heavy hitters to come - Adhir Chowdhury from the Congress and Sitaram Yechury from the Reds. As villagers mill about, laughing and chatting, the press from Calcutta goes about its business, interviews, sound bites for national channels, photographers posing the groups for pictures. There are no smoothly recorded election anthems on the PA. Instead, a group of singers does its thing: a man and two women leading, a harmonium and a tabla guy; revolutionary songs rent the air, Ganasangeet classics starting with 'Hoshiyaar!' and newer material directly aimed at Mamata and the Trinamul, a list of the government's crimes in each stanza, ending with the sarcastic refrain ' uni bolen petty matter!', and she says it's a petty matter. They are strong voices, full of confidence, but every now and then one or the other singer goes off tune and you can hear the besur bits echoing across the green fields. Somebody remarks, 'Can you imagine? They haven't been able to sing these songs openly for four and half years!' If the TMC rally at Apurbapur was like a big, efficient machine, this bandobast has a much more frayed, informal feel to it. Rabin Deb, the CPM candidate, so roundly pilloried by the TMC speakers the day before as an outsider-monster from Ballygunge, stands here chatting to people without any pomp or preening. Spectacles, bush-shirt, complete with pen in top pocket, trousers, non-fancy sports shoes and, yes - there is no getting away from it - a jhola on his shoulder. On stage, old forms have to be adhered to. As the meeting starts someone proposes the name of the Chair of the meeting and someone seconds it, a quaint old men's ritual. Once the speeches start though, there is nothing quaint or ritualistic about the message being delivered. 'Twelve of our people have died since elections were declared. We will stand for a minute's silence in their honour.' And then, one by one, the blows are landed: TMC have delivered zero industry, starting with the betrayal of the people of Singur with the shutting down of the Tata factory; law and order have gone to hell in the state; instead of a Soumitra or an Uttam, in every para they've grown versions of Tapas Paul, and women are under threat everywhere; the Boys Clubs are being given lakhs of rupees, being told 'Play carrom, cards!' 'Drink, do what you like with the women, but just keep us in power, that's all!'; this is because the only industry that has expanded in this state over the last five years is the industry of thuggery. It is claimed good roads have been completed locally, but the big roads were already there under our administration - we intended Singur to be a major, connected transit hub for industry, in the absence of industry the mafia will use the hub for its own purposes. A biting line in the context of a state in the rural areas of which a chopper is still a thing of wonderment: people aren't coming to listen to the Netri's speeches, they aren't even coming to see her helicopter! Another sharp line, from Ardhendu Sen the former chief secretary open, challenging, unapologetic: 'Aar ek baar apnara manush chintey bhul korben aami maani na.' I don't believe you'll make the mistake of mis-reading these (Trinamul) people a second time. Adhir Chowdhury, the WB Congress boss, arrives. He's clearly a different species of political animal from the old style lefties on stage. His belligerence is different from the Trinamul heavies but he's a Strong Man nevertheless and wants everyone to know it. His voice renting like many people's do towards the end of election marathons, he lays into Didi and Trinamul. While doing so, he doesn't spare the CPM: Mamata sabotaged the Automobile Biplab at Singur, but the weak way in which Buddha-babu dealt with her then didn't help either - we have to face the truth. There is some applause from the listeners waving Congress flags. But he doesn't dwell on this, he moves straight into destroying the TMC claims: the rice at Rs 2 a kg came from... Delhi, in... 2013; while the rest of the country availed of that scheme right away it took the TMC till late 2015 to deliver; the 70 lakh jobs that have been created - if they have indeed been created - why hasn't a single member of any of the land-sale affected families in Singur been given a job? He mimics Didi from the previous day, commitment-commitment-commitment, yet she says it can take 50 years to return the land; she's lying - there is no legal route to returning that land. This is not a government of ma, maati, maanush, this is a party of mafia, syndicate and corruption. Watching the compact man's compact performance is like watching a short pugilist taking out someone much bigger. ' Amra Uttar Bangla tey oder ke puro dhuyediyechhi!' We have totally smash-washed them off in North Bengal, you also take water, soap and soda and wash them off here in the south! Hathuri dhorechhey haath! The hand is now holding the hammer! We are bound to win! Adhir Chowdhury departs to loud cheers. Sitaram Yechury arrives over a good hour later. There is obviously no question of the general secretary of the Politburo sharing a stage with the state Congress chief, though other constellations may be in the works. As people begin to wind their way back home we can hear his voice telling a joke about how Narendra Modi was seen feeling around for a aeroplane seat-belt when he recently sat down in the PM's chair in the Lok Sabha. On the basis of these last two meetings, there might be a few politicians in Bengal as well who are reaching for something to keep themselves strapped to their chairs.

Telegraph picture Imphal, April 25: Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today launched the National Food Security Act, fulfilling a long-standing demand of the people of Manipur. The state government has prepared a list of 21,31,652 beneficiaries, which is 74.54 per cent of the entire population, to bring them under the act. Initially, the act will cover only 14 Assembly constituencies of the twin districts of Imphal West and Imphal East and it will gradually extend to all the 60 constituencies in nine districts in a phased manner. Of the 14 constituencies, three are represented by Opposition members. The launch of the act came 38 days ahead of the June 2 election to the Imphal Municipal Corporation - the constituencies of which are in the twin districts. Ibobi Singh clarified that his government did not intend to take political mileage out of launching the act. He said the government was trying to ensure that people enjoyed the rights given by it. The Centre has provided 11,796.56 metric tonnes of rice as April quota. Principal secretary (consumer affairs), food and public distribution, M.H. Khan said the state's wheat quota was also converted to rice. The state government is expected to spend Rs 120 crore per year in implementing the act. The beneficiaries will get 5kg of rice at Rs 3 per kg per month. Distribution of 5,21,210 ration cards is in progress. To mark the launch, Ibobi Singh flagged off trucks, which would transport the rice to the fair price shops in the 14 constituencies. Official sources said it would take 15 days for the beneficiaries to get the rice from the shops. Ibobi Singh said there was a provision of coverage of 87 per cent of the state's population under the act. ""There are left-outs in both urban and rural areas. They will also be issued ration cards very soon. The state government is committed to ensure that the right to food is enjoyed by the people in the state,"" the chief minister said. Saying the chance of misuse is high because of the high profit margin, the chief minister appealed to MLAs and elected representatives of urban and rural bodies to closely monitor the distribution system to ensure that the rice reaches the beneficiaries. The Centre has set September as the deadline for computerisation of the distribution system of at least 40 fair price shops in Manipur. The principal secretary said the government has been working hard to meet the deadline."

Picture by UB PhotosGuwahati, April 22: Hailstorm, rather than rain, has caused ""unprecedented damage"" to crops across Assam, state agriculture minister Rakibul Hussain said today, quoting field reports. Hussain said the exact nature and extent of the damage would be known tomorrow once the two committees set up by him submit their reports. ""The reports will be subsequently submitted to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority and the revenue department on Sunday for extending prompt relief to the affected farmers. Funds are not an issue,"" he told The Telegraph today. Field reports from Nagaon district and farmers in Samuagaon, Batadrava and Sakelahat, which Hussain visited, say the damage has been more owing to hailstorms than rain lashing the state for the past 10 days. ""The farmers we interacted with, particularly the older ones, said the prevailing weather was unprecedented and they had never witnessed such intense and sustained hailstorms. The saddest part is that ripe vegetables, maize and boro rice have been damaged. But we want to assure them (the farmers) that they need not worry. We will provide them with necessary relief,"" Hussain said. In Nagaon, he said, 3,786 hectares of cultivated boro rice, jute, vegetable, maize and pulses have been damaged. ""We will get the full report by tomorrow. With heavy rain lashing most parts of the state, the damage is likely to be substantial,"" he added. Vehicles navigate a submerged street in Jorhat on Friday. Picture by UB Photos The State Disaster Response Force today carried out surveillance of the flood-affected Arunamukh area in Jhanji in Jorhat district, where a ring bund constructed by the District Rural Development Agency was breached last night. Teok circle officer said 2,500 people had been affected but they did not require relocation as most of them resided in changghars (houses on stilts). Relief materials have been sought from the district administration, which will be sent by boats. Communication has been affected as the ring bund was used as a road. The Jhanji river was, however, receding and the sluice gate damaged in floods yesterday was repaired in the adjoining Bonai area. In Jorhat town, Carmel School was closed today because of severe water-logging on its premises. Large tracts to the east of the Garali (Jorhat-Mariani highway) witnessed flooding, including the school, as the road had been elevated and the drainage was only partially complete on the under-construction three-lane highway. In Golaghat district and elsewhere, paddy fields have been submerged. Rainfall was sporadic and the day cloudy today. In Dhemaji district, all the rivers were in spate because of continuous rainfall. The Jiadhal has inundated about 10 villages under Naruathan gaon panchayat. In Lakhimpur district, the dyke on the Ranganadi has been breached, inundating 12 villages of Kadam gaon panchayat. Both the district administrations have put the disaster management teams on alert. In Dibrugarh, the Brahmaputra has risen to 103.98m, compared to last year's 102.98m during the monsoon. The total recorded rainfall till April is 456.97mm while last year it was 257.2mm during the same period. Incessant rain for the past couple of days and the rising river is posing a serious threat to the residents of Dholahatigulia in Tinsukia district and Rohmoria in Dibrugarh. In Dholahatigulia, the water is just 10 metres from the embankment. ""The residents are fearful because if the embankment gets breached, 23 villages will be washed away. We have seen their plight and the rising Brahamaputra is posing a serious threat to lives and property,'' said Binod Kedia, chief adviser, Flood Erosion Resistance Struggle Forum. In Rohmoria, fresh erosion of 100m land is causing worry. Additional reporting by Smita Bhattacharyya in Jorhat, Vinod Kumar Singh in Dhemaji and Avik Chakraborty in Dibrugarh"

Pictures by Sarat Sarma This is the story of 250 Assamese Sikh households in a remote village, some 15km from the district headquarters of Nagaon and 120km from Guwahati, and their aspirations. The community has been demanding a two per cent job reservation in the government for Assamese Sikhs in the state for a long time. ""But nobody takes the matter seriously because we are so few in number. We don't count for much in the elections,"" said Rajbir Singh, a leader of the Sikh Kalyan Parishad. Nearly 500 Sikh soldiers, led by captain Chetan Singh, came to Assam to fight for Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha in the 1816 Indo-Burma war at Hadirachaki. A few of them, including Chetan Singh, died in the battle, while some returned home after it ended. A few, led by subedar Ram Singh, came to Chapamukh by crossing the Kopili river and later shifted to Borkula to start a new life. Singh married two Assamese girls - first a Brahmin from Hatigarh and subsequently a Koibaitya from Kampur. Granthi Jagat Singh After 200 years, the subedar's family, accompanied by some others (who had earlier settled in other places) expanded to almost 250 households in Borkula. According to the villagers, there was a time when getting a job in police and other administrative posts was easier for the youths of the community in Assam but that ended a long time ago. ""Our people are working in higher ranks in different government departments but the new generation is facing an acute job crisis. We are considered minorities but that is not considered when we ask the government to provide for our development,"" said Jagjit Singh, an activist of Borkula's central Gurdwara. These Assamese Sikhs' links with Punjab and New Delhi were forged only after Independence. Former president Giani Zail Singh visited Borkula in 1979 and former Union agriculture minister Surjit Singh Barnala came in 1982. ""Zail Singh gave us Rs 25,000 as aid to erect a library here. Barnala established links with the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) from where Giani Bhagat Singh was sent to Borkula permanently to teach Gurmukhi,"" said Jagjit. After Bhagat Singh, the Delhi Gurdwara management committee sent one Jaspit Kaur to teach the children Gurmukhi. ""Jasprit left Borkula three months ago,"" Jagjit said. ""We even moved former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh several times demanding some support, an economic package for overall development of the region, but it did not materialise,"" he added. Borkula is basically an agriculture belt, known for its rice and sugarcane. This belt is under Sadar Assembly constituency of central Assam's Nagaon district. Like Borkula, most parts of Sadar constituency are underdeveloped. The rural area of the constituency is dominated by religious minorities, goldsmiths and Scheduled Castes. Sitting Congress MLA Durlav Chamua, the BJP's Rupak Sarma and AIUDF candidate Kartik Saha are in the fray for the polls on April 11. The Sikhs of Borkula are hoping their prayers will be heard this time."

Thinking out-of-the-box is Bharali's USP and helps him come up with such innovations. ""My main motive is to bring back educated rural youths back to their roots - agriculture. The youngsters, after completing their education, do not want to dirty their hands working in the fields. This will help grow paddy saplings and transplant them without working for hours,"" he said. Bharali has come up with two mechanisms. One uses a rod, spoons and forks to transplant four saplings at a go. The other is one in which seeds are sown in tumblers. Once the saplings grow, the tumbler which acts as a mould is removed. Subsequently, the saplings are placed in a device and dropped at regular intervals in the field. Later, the field can be irrigated with tubewell water or be rain-fed. Bharali calls the entire process encapsulated paddy transplanting. ""Since the device does not have a motor, it does not require a battery, fuel or electricity to run. It is simple and cost-effective,"" he said. Bharali said he had demonstrated the device in a Technology Education Design fest held in Cuttack last year. He also used the equipment to transplant paddy on an experimental basis to see how it works. ""The feedback has been very good. The Regional Agricultural Research Station, Assam Agricultural University, North Lakhimpur, has said it has achieved as much yield as other methods of cultivation and was faster,"" he said. K.K. Sharma of the research station said the device would reduce the drudgery of women involved in transplanting and that the machine would be very useful in transplanting paddy seedling in system of rice intensification. ""This system is also called the Madagascar method. Minimum water is required and only one sapling is planted at a greater distance than the usual method. Also, saplings of eight to 12 days are planted and production is increased. Bharali's gadget will aid in this,"" Sharma added. ""Since it does not use fossil fuels, it is cheap and can be used manually. The machine transplanting was observed to be 1.5 times faster than manual planting but with practice, the speed is likely to increase. The yield of paddy in machine-planted and manually-planted rice is on a par,"" Sharma said. He said the device would be launched among farmers in North Lakhimpur on March 21. Bharali, whose pomegranate de-seeder has gone global, is also busy in philanthropic work of designing artificial arms and devices so that people who lost the use of their arms can feed and clean themselves. ""A man who has lost one arm in Jamuguri wants me to make an arm so that he can wear his trousers,"" Bharali said. He makes these devices for free. Bharali has opened the UKD Trust through which he gives a monthly pension of Rs 1,200 each per month to six widows, while three physically challenged persons get Rs 2,500 each per month. He also takes care of all the needs of 21 families, including health, education, food and clothing."

(AFP) Tokyo, April 16 (Reuters): Japanese rescuers were digging through the rubble of buildings and mud today to reach dozens believed trapped after a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck a southern island, killing at least 32 people and injuring about a thousand. The shallow earthquake hit in the early hours, sending people fleeing from their beds on to dark streets, and followed a 6.4 magnitude quake on Thursday which killed nine persons in the area. Rain and cold were forecast overnight, adding extra urgency to the rescue effort. Television footage showed fires, power outages, collapsed bridges, a severed road hanging over a ravine and gaping holes in the earth. Residents near a dam were told to leave because of fears it might crumble, broadcaster NHK said. ""I felt strong shaking at first, then I was thrown about like I was in a washing machine,"" said a Tokai University student who remains isolated in the village of Minamiaso in Kumamoto province on the island of Kyushu. ""All the lights went out and I heard a loud noise. A lot of gas is leaking and while there hasn't been a fire, that remains a concern,"" the student, who is sheltering in a university gym with 1,000 other students and residents, told Japanese media. Many frightened people wrapped in blankets sat outside their homes while others camped out in rice fields in rural areas surrounding the main towns. About 422,000 households were without water, and about 100,000 without electricity, the government said. Troops were setting up tents for evacuees and water trucks were being sent to the area. The National Police Agency said 32 people were confirmed dead. The government said about 190 of those injured were in serious condition. Heavy rain and wind were forecast, with temperature expected to drop to 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit) overnight. Firefighters handed out tarpaulins to residents so they could cover damaged roofs. ""The wind is expected to pick up and rain will likely get heavier,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a government meeting. ""Rescue operations at night will be extremely difficult ... It's a race against time."" Self defence forces personnel in the town of Mashiki, close to the epicentre, were providing food and water. ""I don't mind standing in line. I'm just thankful for some food,"" said a man in his 60s waiting for a meal. Japan is on the seismically active ""ring of fire"" around the Pacific Ocean and has building codes aimed at helping structures withstand earthquakes. A magnitude 9 quake in March 2011 north of Tokyo touched off a massive tsunami and nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima, contaminating water, food and air for miles around. Nearly 20,000 people were killed in the tsunami. The epicentre of today's quake was near the city of Kumamoto and measured at a shallow depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. The shallower a quake, the more likely it is to cause damage. The quake triggered a tsunami advisory which was later lifted and no irregularities were reported at three nuclear power plants in the area, a senior government official said. The city's 400-year-old Kumamoto Castle was badly damaged, with its walls breached after having withstood bombardment and fire in its four centuries of existence. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda, speaking at a G20 event in Washington, said it was too early to assess the economic impact but bank operations in Kumamoto were normal. The USGS, which is a government scientific body, estimated that there was a 72 per cent likelihood of economic damage exceeding $10 billion, adding that it was too early to be specific. Major insurers are yet to release estimates. Electronics giant Sony Corp said a factory producing image sensors for smartphone makers would remain closed while it assessed the damage from the quakes. One of its major customers is Apple which uses the sensors in iPhones. Toyota Motor Corp halted production at three plants producing vehicles, engines and trans axles in Fukuoka. Toyota said there was no damage at its plants, but it was checking the status of its suppliers. It will decide tomorrow whether to resume production. Nissan stopped production at its Fukuoka plant which produces vehicles including the Serena, Teana, Murano and Note."

As the procurement deadline got over on March 31, the BJP demanded that the state government talk to the Centre to extend it by another 15 days to lift the paddy remaining with the farmers. It has also sought a reply from the government over the issue on Monday. The issue was raised by BJP MLC Lal Babu Prasad, who pointed out that 18 metric tonnes or just 60 per cent of 30 metric tonnes was procured. He moved an adjournment motion at the beginning of the Question Hour to discuss it by suspending the normal business of the Upper House. Though council chairman Awadhesh Narain Singh rejected the adjournment motion, the matter was raised again by BJP legislators during Zero Hour. Leader of Opposition Sushil Kumar Modi said: ""Paddy procurement during the financial year 2015-16 has been less even in comparison to the financial year 2014-15 during which 24 metric tonnes paddy was lifted by primary agriculture credit societies (PACS)."" The worst sufferers are districts like Rohtas, Kaimur, Buxar which are known as the rice bowl of the state. Only around 55 per cent paddy has been procured against the target in these districts. The BJP legislators trooped into the Well of the council and shouted anti-government slogans for not paying attention on paddy procurement. The chairman called for ""a reply by the government over the issue on Monday"" and adjourned the House till post-lunch session. Paddy is cultivated in all 38 districts of Bihar and is the main crop of kharif season for over 80 per cent population engaged in agriculture in the state. Barring five districts - Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura, Gaya and Arwal - procurement has been less than the targets fixed for them. PACS procure paddy at Rs 1,360 per quintal from farmers and sends it to rice mills, which then supplies the rice back. It is finally sent to state food corporation for use in public distribution shops. ""Less procurement of paddy means that there will be less rice for PDS shops and Bihar will have to bring the foodgrain from other states. It will lead to a loss of several crores to the state exchequer. Already Rs 600 crore is due and the state government should make immediate arrangements for its payment,"" Sushil added. The senior BJP leader also pointed out that the state government had procured just 8 lakh metric tonnes paddy till March 1 and the remaining 11 lakh metric tonnes over till March-end. ""This shows that the government could have achieved the procurement target had it been serious about it. The farmers would not have been forced to sell their crop at throwaway prices to middlemen,"" Sushil added."

Lokur and Justice R.K. Agrawal asked the Union agriculture secretary to hold meetings with counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Chattisgarh to evolve a coordinated strategy to tackle the problem.The bench passed the direction while dealing with a PIL filed by an NGO, Swaraj Abhiyan, through counsel Prashant Bhushan complaining that no proper succour was being provided by most states and Union territories except Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Apart from 5kg of rice/wheat per person every month, the petition said each family should be provided 2kg of dal and at least 1kg of edible oil.The NGO also urged the apex court to ensure that children are provided free milk or eggs under the mid-day meal scheme, so they get adequate protein.Bhushan told the court that under the National Food Security Act, 2013, the government provided 5kg of rice per person per month only to BPL households.Bhushan pointed out that the rural job scheme provided guaranteed employment for only 100 days to a rural household. He pleaded that the number of days be increased to 150 to tackle the drought crisis.Solicitor-general Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Centre, said that since data relating to rainfall and drought relief were with the states, he needed time to collate it for placing it before the bench.According to Kumar, the Centre had earmarked Rs 61,200 crore under the state disaster response fund for the five-year period of 2015-2020. It was for the states and Union territories to utilise the funds effectively, he added.Justice Lokur, heading the bench, then asked the states concerned to consider the measures suggested by the NGO when their representatives meet the Union agriculture secretary."

Telegraph picture Sambalpur, April 5: Social stigma and superstition about leprosy led Baipali villagers to boycott the funeral of a 70-year-old woman, whose husband had died of the disease several years ago. The boycott forced daughters of Dei Pradhan, the deceased, to shoulder her bier to the crematorium on a charpoy and perform her last rites yesterday. As no one came forward to lend shoulder to take the bier of Pradhan, because her late husband had suffered from leprosy, her daughters, Chandrakanti, 35, and Rechi, 30, carried the bier to the crematorium. Chandrakanti is married and her husband was among the three pall-bearers. Prdahan, whose husband had left the village around 25 years ago because of leprosy and died somewhere else, breathed her last yesterday around 9am. Chandrakanti, Rechi and Chandrakanti's husband waited for their relatives and villagers to arrive and help them carry the body to the cremation ground. However, the body lay in the house till the evening as no one turned up. Even Pradhan's brothers, who live at nearby Sarkanda village, did not come to the rescue of the family. When nobody turned up, the two sisters and Chandrakanti's husband carried the body on a charpoy to the cremation ground where the elder girl lit the pyre. ""My mother died due to old age and illness. However, nobody wanted to carry her body to the cremation ground. We had no option but to do the job ourselves,"" said Chandrakanti, adding that she was not even aware of the disease her father had suffered from. A social worker, Surendra Meher, who stays at the nearby Sarakanda village, had gone to Baipali after coming to know about the boycott, said: ""We requested the Baipali villagers to help the family. However, no one responded. My friend also made a call to the local sarpanch's husband and informed him about the incident. However, he also did not come forward to help. We offered to help the sisters carry their mother's body to the cremation ground, but they refused and carried it themselves. Later, we made the arrangements for cremation."" Sohela block development officer Biswajit Mohapatra said: ""The deceased was getting old age pension. We have also given Rs 2,000 to the family under the Harischndra Yojna. Steps will also be taken to provide rice to the unmarried daughter of the deceased."""

The school education and literacy department is yet to implement the safety norms as envisaged in the National Food Security Act-2013 that was officially rolled out amid much fanfare across Jharkhand on September 30 last year. Under the Act, cooked midday meals, collected randomly from all government schools, must be tested by accredited labs every month to check quality and prevent any untoward incident. Further, the school education department, in coordination with the health department, is supposed to carry out sampling and checking of the cooked food from time to time, apart from ensuring hygiene at school kitchens. However, despite a directive from the Union ministry of human resource development last year and several reports of children falling ill after eating midday meal, the department is yet to swing into action. Secretary (school education) Aradhana Patnaik said it was difficult to test midday meal cooked at schools located in other districts. ""The state's sole food testing lab is in Namkum. Bringing cooked food from other districts to the lab for testing is tough. By the time the samples will reach the lab, they will become stale. Hence, members of the mother's committees (responsible for cooking and serving food at schools) are directed to taste the meals before serving them to children,"" she said. However, she added that the department had already prepared standard operating procedures, containing guidelines of the food security act, for the district superintendents of education of all 24 districts. ""Also the chief medical officers (CMOs) of all the districts have been directed to visit schools and test cooked food from time to time. Nevertheless, we do send raw lentils and rice to the lab in Namkum for testing from time to time,"" she added. Chief food analyst at the Jharkhand Food Testing Laboratory (Namkum) J.K. Singh said they had not yet received any kit for collecting cooked rice, daal and vegetables either. ""We have not received midday meal samples as of now. And if in future, we are directed to test cooked food from schools, we have to be very careful in packing the samples as they are perishable,"" he added. Principal of Government Model Middle School, Hindpiri, Amarkant Pathak said this type of physical tests wasn't enough to ensure proper quality. ""They just taste the food in haste and serve it to children. In the past, we have seen children falling ill after eating foods that were tasted by the mother committee members,"" he added."

PHOTO: BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTWith the last two decades being one of complacency not only in India but also across the world as far as food security was concerned, there are ample challenges before farm scientists and farm science students, which, in turn, will pave the way for many opportunities, Additional Secretary of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare of the Union government Ashok Dalwai said here on Wednesday.He was delivering the 29{+t}{+h}annual convocation address of his alma mater , University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad.Referring to the various challenges in agriculture, Mr. Dalwai said: Geographical information system, remote sensing and crop modelling all need to be emphasised to generate new concepts, tools and methodologies. Agronomic research will have to support small and marginal farmers by developing new cropping systems and crop diversification models consistent with sustainable use of land, water and other natural as well as purchased production resources.He said that frontier technologies that involved genetic modification and crop physiology also needed due attention and there was a need to focus on research and development programme on transformation of C3 plants into photosynthesis efficient C4 plants as the latter had 50 per cent higher radiation-use efficiency compared to the former. He said that food security could be better if C3 rice was transformed into C4 rice.Referring to the impact of climate change, he said that a variation of one degree in temperature would result in a decrease of 4 to 10 per cent in yield and farm scientists had to tackle this challenge.Elaborating on the scope of farm science, he said: Agriculture is a subject of all times and it is the harbinger of change in the country, and it will continue to be the harbinger of the changes to come.Mr. Dalwai told students that life was not science alone and there was much more to life than just science. Referring to the life and contributions of Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda and the achievements of two great farm scientists M.S. Swaminathan and Verghese Kurien, Mr. Dalwai urged students to have the courage to follow their destiny. You can arrive wherever you want to, provided you are willing to walk the first half of the distance, he told them.Earlier, after Vice-Chancellor D.P. Biradar welcomed the gathering and presented a brief report, Governor Vajubhai Vala declared open the convocation.Pro Chancellor and Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda conferred various degrees to 1,003 candidates.

BTC deputy chief Kampa Borgoyari, who is also the in-charge of the forest and tourism department, inaugurated the three-day festival in front of dignitaries and an enormous gathering of people, which included a sizeable number from neighbouring Bhutan. Perched at 1,491 feet above sea level, Baukhungri peak is about 10km from Kokrajhar town. The hill is tucked away within Chakrachila wildlife sanctuary, which is home to the endangered golden langur. Since time immemorial, local residents have been climbing Baukhungri hill on Sankranti, the final day of Chaitra - the last month of the Hindu calendar year. According to Bodo legend, Baukhungri hill is the sacred abode of Sibrai (Lord Shiva) and a number of other deities. Earlier, the festival was celebrated mainly by Bodos but now thousands of people, irrespective of caste and creed, scale the peak in festive mood to welcome Bwisagu festival. The event was traditionally known as baukhungri jajw gakhwnai or climbing of Baukhungri hill. But over the past four years, the tourism department of the BTC organises the annual Baukhungri festival in a grand way. The department has made various additions to the festival, like adventure sport, cultural programmes, ethnic food festivals and indigenous sporting events to attract tourists. At the food festival, visitors can taste mouth-watering ethnic dishes like napham, onla curry, narzi and sobai curry and wash them down with sweet rice beer prepared by the members of the Bodo community. The trek up the hill also provides some stunning views. The hill is flanked by the beautiful Deeplai Beel and part of Dheer Beel. The lower reaches of the hill are covered with magnificent sal trees and semi-evergreen trees. The area within the sanctuary, a snaking hilly tract running from north to south, has many sites of historical and religious importance."

If it loses, the people will lose."" Speaking at a workers' meet of the Trinamul Youth Congress in Kalchini the previous day, on March 31, the national president of the TMC's youth wing, Abhishek Banerjee, had played on the similar-sounding words, kshamata (power), janata (people) and Mamata (Banerjee, Bengal's chief minister) to underscore the interdependence of the three. Who are these people, about whom the ruling party of the state seems to be so concerned? The population of Alipurduar is made up of the tea tribes (descendants of the indentured labourers brought by the colonial planters from the Chhotanagpur plateau region to work in the tea gardens), Gorkhas, Bengalis, Biharis, migrant settlers from Bangladesh, and members of a few other ethnicities, races and tribes. Much of the area of Alipurduar is covered by the tea gardens, many of which have shut down since the early 2000s, when the tea industry went into a slump. This means that a huge percentage of the plantation workers - largely comprising the tea tribes, Gorkhas and Bengalis - are out of jobs. It has been easy for political parties to use the people's discontent to their advantage over the years. Tea workers' unions - most of which were once controlled by the Left parties - were partly responsible for the lockouts in the gardens. Several trade union leaders made money out of the unrest even as the workers, whose cause they were supposedly espousing, suffered unemployment, malnutrition, starvation, sometimes death, as a result of the closures. A new twist was added to the narrative in 2008, when the leader of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, Bimal Gurung, renewed the agitation for Gorkhaland, demanding that certain areas of the Dooars also be included in the proposed hill state. The GJM's attempt to infiltrate the Dooars was met with fierce protests from the tribal people. There had been violent clashes between Morcha supporters and anti-Gorkhaland organizations in 2008-2009. The polarization of votes on the basis of racial identity was proved by the success of the independent candidate from Kalchini, Wilson Champramary, who was supported by the GJM in the 2011 assembly elections. Champramary, who is allegedly linked to the timber mafia and is as famous as Abhishek Banerjee for vituperative outbursts, joined the TMC in 2013. At the workers' meeting in Kalchini on March 31, Abhishek Banerjee had pronounced what seemed like a threat, ""If the GJM comes to power, the Dooars will burn [alluding to possible clashes between the Gorkhas and the adivasis]. No change will ever come to the life of the tea garden workers."" On April 7, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who has a profound relation with tea, had proclaimed at a rally in Alipurduar's Madarihat: ""I will not allow welfare of the tea workers to stop."" Can the tea labourers, especially of the closed gardens, dare to hope for change then? Or should ""change"" be interpreted to mean only a change for the worse? *********************** The seven tea estates of Duncan Industries Limited have been the latest addition to the long list of ailing tea gardens. They stopped functioning in April-May 2015. A year later, the Duncan garden in Birpara looks like a forgotten country. The tea bushes are unpruned, the hedges are running wild, the electric supply is off, and the factory gate is firmly padlocked. A few workers have come together to form a cooperative, which is buying the leaves plucked from the garden at Rs 5 per kilogram and selling them to the bought-leaf factories. The latter are tea-manufacturing units unattached to any tea estate, which usually have their own processing factories. Incidentally, the proliferation of the bought-leaf factories in North Bengal has often been cited as one of the reasons behind the deterioration of the tea industry there - assembling tea leaves from all over the region, these factories usually do not follow any strict measure of quality control. After being left untreated for almost a year, the tea bushes of Birpara are already termite-ridden. One can imagine what the standard of the leaves would be. But it is the sale of these leaves that is keeping the workers alive. The first thing that Kamala Kujurnag, 52, one of the workers who have assembled at the counter of the tea estate in Birpara to sell their share of leaves to the members of the cooperative, says is that she has to buy tea now. It is perhaps the height of misery for a tea worker to have to buy from the market the tea she plucks everyday - in the operating tea gardens, tea is part the workers' ration. Kamala has high blood pressure and her husband is diabetic. With the hospital inside the garden closed for months now, she has no access to medicines. Kamala says that her co-workers are dying of constant anxiety and lack of treatment. She points to a few young girls gathered at the counter and says that they have dropped out of school to make money by plucking. Has the state government been of any help? Kamala makes a face and says that the rice they got at Rs 2 per kg under the Centre-implemented National Food Security Act (but the state government is trying hard to pass off the distribution scheme as its own) was so substandard that many fell ill on having it. They have not received any other benefit which workers of closed tea gardens are supposed to get because, on paper, the garden is still open - it has undergone neither a lock-out nor suspension of work. The workers have not been paid since April 2015. Mamata Banerjee had threatened to take over the gardens in November 2015. Not to be outdone, the Centre authorized the Tea Board to take up the management of seven gardens of Duncan Industries in January 2016. As the Central and the state governments lob the issue of the Duncan gardens to and fro, the question remains whether neither had seen the catastrophe coming. A slim book, The Tea Crisis: Unfolding the Reality, by Tamash Ranjan Majumdar mentions the fact that Duncan Industries has been a sick industry listed with the Board for Industrial and Financial Restructuring since 2006. So the ailment of Duncan Industries is public knowledge. Even if tea exports have fallen somewhat since the 2000s, the domestic demand for tea has been on the rise. If the yield of the Duncan gardens has been steadily falling over the last few years, it is because there has been little or no investment in replanting the bushes or in providing better irrigation facilities to increase productivity. The Tea Board's notification for the takeover of the seven Duncan estates acknowledges that they have ""failed to comply with the obligations under the Tea Act, 1953"". Swarup Dutta, who worked as a clerk for 17 years in the Birpara factory before it stopped functioning, thinks that in the absence of proper supervision from the owners, the management had grown corrupt. A succession of managers have made a fast buck and disappeared -trade union leaders have often been complicit in this for their own gains. This is the usual story of downfall that does the rounds in all the closed tea gardens, not just in those belonging to Duncan. Dutta points out that the middle-class members of the gardens' staff are worse off than the workers now. Unlike the workers, they cannot find employment as contractual labour in other gardens, quarry stones in rivers or construct roads in nearby Bhutan. But Dutta will vote, as will Kamala. Dutta is looking up to the prime minister, who, he hopes, will revive the closed gardens. Kamala is waiting for the candidates to come calling at her hut: she will make up her mind in accordance with their willingness to lend an ear to her grievances. Given the prevailing poverty, votes can also be bought easily. They usually come cheap at less than Rs 1,000 per head. *********************** Sina Oraon, 30, is an ex-worker of the Dheklapara tea estate in the Madarihat-Birpara block. The garden shut down in 2002. The labourers look after the garden and sell the leaves to middlemen. Sina makes Rs 35-40 a day selling the leaves. She is also quite an entrepreneur - not only does she earn money by sewing but she has also started selling paneer to a restaurant in town. In the 14 years since the garden closed up shop, a lot of government schemes for the benefit of unemployed labourers have become functional. Sina's family gets Rs 1,500 month under the scheme of Financial Assistance to the Workers of Locked Out Industries (earlier, a garden had to be declared closed for a year for FAWLOI to be operative: the state government has now reduced the time period to three months). The houses of the workers in the labour line of the estate have been built under the Indira Awas Yojana - the construction seems to be a never-ending process since the houses are frequently demolished by elephants that come from the nearby forests looking for food. The residents of the garden get subsidized rice and wheat under the Centre's Antyodaya Anna Yojana. There is pension for the retired workers. Sina has got a lot to do with the fact that the workings of these schemes have become regularized in recent years. She had sustained an injury while working at a nearby brick kiln in her childhood. Her legs would swell up and she had shooting pains. ""I felt dead,"" Sina says. Her own troubles inspired her to alleviate the problems of others around her. She has appealed to the block administration, the district administration, even travelled to Calcutta in 2012 to meet the erstwhile minister of industry, Partha Chatterjee - all to make sure that the Dheklapara labourers get the support of the government schemes. As a result of her efforts, there is now relative prosperity not only in her family but in the entire labour line. She is now campaigning for an ambulance service to the estate; the nearest town hospital is six kilometres away and the roads are swallowed up by rivers each time it rains hard in the foothills. Adversity seems to be creating heroes like Sina in the closed tea gardens. Hundreds of labourers have gone missing from the Madhu tea gardens in the Kalchini block even since it closed down 14 months ago. It had been ailing for years. While the men have left with the aim of working in other parts of India or in Bhutan, several children and women have been trafficked. Nagina Lohra calls herself an expert in tracking down missing people. But there is not much with which they can be welcomed back - Nagina, the detective, says that there is no food, no potable water - "" kuchh bhi nahi hain"". Some are getting work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, but the payment is often delayed. In the absence of savings to fall back upon, the labourers prefer to get daily wages. *********************** A permanent worker of a flourishing garden gets a daily wage of Rs 132.50. They also get subsidized ration, free housing, educational and medical facilities, electricity, firewood, tea, provident fund payments, bonuses and pension as per the provisions of the Plantations Labour Act, 1951. But much of this is in theory. In several gardens, workers have not been paid for two or three years. The non-monetary compensations can also be tweaked. For instance, if marauding elephants break down a worker's hut -which happens often in the Dooars - the next accommodation he or she gets from the management may well be in a tarpaulin tent. Garden owners prefer to hire casual labourers, who do not have to be given the wages and benefits the permanent workers are entitled to. When deprived workers agitate for their entitlements, the management simply packs up and leaves. A survey report on the 273 tea gardens in North Bengal brought out by the state labour commissionerate is revealing of the conditions prevailing in tea estates. It says that the drinking water provided for the workers is often inadequate and of poor quality; many workers do not have housing facilities; only 166 tea gardens have hospitals, of which 110 hospitals depend on visiting doctors. Moreover, in 2012-13, ""[Forty-one] Tea Estates did not deposit any amount towards Provident Fund contributions."" Non-compliance with the provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund Schemes, 1952, is a criminal offence. Although it is common for garden owners not to put in their share of the provident fund, there has hardly been any instance of criminal proceedings being initiated against them. The Calcutta High Court has ruled that the Centre's bid for a takeover of the seven Duncan gardens remains valid. It has also directed the Centre, the state government and the Tea Board to do the needful for keeping the gardens going, reinstating the displaced workers and clearing their dues. With luck, the Duncan gardens may start operating again. But what about the other locked-out gardens? Will the politicians think twice about them once the elections are over? Can they hear Kamala's plea, delivered with the calm authority of a long-suffering victim: ""Reopen the gardens, we must work""?"

The future of the two boys is uncertain as their mother does not have the resources to fund their education. Sushanto's parents don't have money to buy medicines. The family members of Sushanto Ghosh, who committed suicide. Picture by Partha Protim Koner The exact reason behind Sushanto's suicide is not known as the family's version that he killed himself to escape indebtedness has no takers in the administration and hence, no government support. ""What do I say? We lost everything because we are farmers,"" she says. Her torn green sari bears signs of penury. Some neighbours listen to her conversation with this correspondent with rapt attention on a sultry afternoon of April, the harvesting time for the boro crop. Asked why they aren't in the fields, most of them say they haven't sown the seeds. ""Why should we? Farming means losses,"" replies Panchu Gopal Ghosh, who has been farming for at least four decades. The veteran offers a rough calculation to explain the lack of incentive in farming. Such answers from members of farmer families in Galsi block - the top rice producer for years in Bengal and regarded as the Granary of Burdwan, which itself is the state's granary - may surprise outsiders but not the people of the district, where 70 per cent of the population has something or the other to do with agriculture. ""There is no point talking about what it was before and how happy and prosperous we farmers were.... Today, it is even better to be a manual labourer,"" says Swapan Ghosh, who has given up farming and become a mason. This approach of farmers - seen and heard in the rice belt of the district, including Galsi, Bhatar, Raina and Khandaghosh, and the potato belt covering Memari, Manteswar and Jamalpur - has become a worry for the ruling Trinamul ahead of tomorrow's elections, when 16 Assembly constituencies of rural Burdwan will go to the polls. If slogans in Burdwan are any indication, the writing on the wall captures the mood. Sample this: "" Kake vote dilam kaka? Mill- e dhan, bank-e taka, chashir haat sudhui fanka (Whom did we vote, dear friend? Mills are stocked with paddy, banks stashed with money, but the farmers' hands are empty)."" In the 2011 Assembly polls, Trinamul had won nine of the 16 seats. Mamata Banerjee's Maa-Mati-Manush slogan had worked wonders in the district as Trinamul swept the panchayat polls of 2013. There were, however, complaints of electoral malpractice. The trend continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with Trinamul candidates leading in 13 of these constituencies. Aroop Biswas, the Trinamul observer for the district, says the summer of 2016 will not be an aberration either but several lower-level party functionaries feel otherwise. ""The CPM is building its campaign on the agrarian distress and it's striking a chord with common people.... Our target of sweeping the district will not be met,"" a Trinamul leader in Burdwan said. According to him, the CPM's campaign, highlighting a list carrying names, addresses and other details of over 140 farmers who committed suicide in the past few years, has caught on in the region. Trinamul sources concede the chief minister is aware of the discontent brewing in rural Burdwan and she tried to tackle it by holding Mati Utsav in the district, where some farmers were given cash awards and certificates for excellence in production. ""But that hasn't helped much,"" admits the source, adding that the list of problems has only grown for farmers. One of the recurring complaints heard across rural Burdwan is the Mamata government's failure to ensure remunerative price for farm produce while the cost of agriculture has galloped because of a rise in fertiliser prices and a subsequent increase in electricity tariff. ""A 60kg sack of rice used to yield anything between Rs 850 and Rs 900 till 2011. But now the farmers are getting between Rs 620 and Rs 650 per sack. There is genuine discontent,"" says Arup Kumar Chattopadhyay, a professor of economics at Burdwan University. Although on paper the farmers are getting Rs 814 a sack because that's the minimum support price for paddy, price realisation is much less, several farmers have said. ""Now that the panchayats play a role in procurement, they deduct charges like cost of collection of paddy from farmers' homes and various other handling expenses.... Such deductions weren't made during Left rule,"" says Abdur Rezzak Mondal, the district secretary of the CPM's peasant wing. The state government's plan to ensure payment through cheques has boomeranged as most farmers are complaining of delay in payment, which adds to their interest burden on the capital they borrow from money lenders. Scarcity of water is the other problem. The ripples of the discontent in rural Burdwan can be felt in Burdwan town as well. Traders complain of poor sales in the past few years because of the agrarian distress. ""Burdwan doesn't have any industry.... The surplus from agriculture sustains trade here but the flow of money has stopped and all the traders are suffering,"" said Sumit Dutta, the convenor of a traders' body in Burdwan. Agrarian distress and its negative impact on the economy are not unique to Burdwan or any other district in Bengal as a host of factors - some beyond the control of the state government - have made agriculture unviable. But the CPM has made it a poll issue in Burdwan and the hope for the party's revival is riding on the farmers' discontent. The focus on farmers' issues has already helped the CPM as its leaders have managed to build up resistance against Trinamul in the run-up to the polls by campaigning in areas like Raina and Khandaghosh and even finalising the list of polling agents to be stationed in the booths tomorrow. In contemporary Bengal, the finalisation of the list in itself is an achievement. ""We have made a turnaround because we have exposed how the ruling party has ruined agriculture in Burdwan.... Tomorrow is the final and we are ready to resist Trinamul goons if they try to loot votes,"" said CPM state committee member Amal Halder. The similarity with the summer of 2011 cannot be missed. Mamata had then played the farmers' card to her advantage. Amid questions whether the CPM can reap similar benefits, it is almost certain that Trinamul will fare worse than in 2014 in rural Bengal and it will be a blow to Mamata in central Bengal.

Telegraph picture Jorhat, Aug. 4: A death went unlamented and a birth unheralded at Malowkhat, on the outskirts of Jorhat town, as the respective families struggled to survive after the swirling waters of the Bhogdoi wreaked havoc in the area. Though the events took place a few days apart at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital, they went unreported as the place was far from the scenes of high drama caused by the floods. Dul Dutta and Uma Sharma's families had taken refuge in relief camps after their houses were submerged. Dul said his mother Bhanu fainted as soon as she saw the waters of the Bhogdoi engulf the kitchen and the granary. ""Our house is very near the breach and we had to shift to a relative's pucca house on high ground. From there, she saw the kitchen and the granary submerge and fainted. With the help of other people, I carried her to the boat brought by the State Disaster Response Force and shifted her to JMCH. The shock had sent her into coma and she did not recover. After a week, she died,"" Dutta said. He said her body had to be taken directly to Rajakhat samsan (crematorium) as they could not bring her home because of the waist-deep floodwaters. ""I had to perform the shraddh ceremony on the road,"" he said. On July 20, Uma's wife Kobita Das Sharma gave birth to Chandni. She was rushed to JMCH by her family from Kaibarta Gaon in Malowkhat, which had been flooded by the Bhogdoi. A couple of days later, she was released from hospital and had to wade through knee-deep water to reach her brother-in-law's house, a pucca building built on higher ground. ""It was not possible to come back to the relief camp as my newborn could be exposed to disease and our house was still under water. Therefore, we brought her here,"" Uma, a daily wage labourer said. He had shifted from Nowboicha in Lakhimpur district about four years ago in search of work. Uma's mother-in-law Dhaneswari complained that they had not yet received a mosquito net to protect the baby. Dul said the administration provided enough rice and lentils but the NGOs who had brought relief materials usually distributed them to people living in makeshift shanties on the road and the people in interior villages were left out. He lamented that about 10 bighas of land on which he had sown paddy had been submerged and it would be difficult to feed his family, comprising his wife and three children. One of his daughters is married."
58f4f63d7be9e018510a057c,Dark spots,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160804/jsp/opinion/story_100354.jsp,2016-08-04,"""India is the one bright spot in a gloomy world economy"", so said the World Bank president in June while praising the prime minister's style of governance. The ruling party is overjoyed and is confident of conquering the world with Modi's pet theme of 'Make In India'. Never mind the vast army of jobless youth, inflation in essential items, malnutrition and absence of basic medical facilities in rural India. So who will 'make in India'? A few pet industrialists and the highly trained, highly paid workers in information technology, pharmaceuticals and auto-parts sectors - the three Indian segments that compete successfully in the world market. What about the vast majority of the lower middle class, poor and undernourished semi-literate youth? What world-class products will they make? Malnutrition has reached alarming proportions. A body mass index that is lower than 18.5 indicates chronic malnutrition. Thirty seven per cent of adult Indians, half of them belonging to the scheduled tribes, and 60 per cent of adults of the scheduled castes reportedly have BMIs below 18.5. In 2012, a report by the Global Hunger Indexplaced India at the 67th position among 80 countries having the worst hunger situation. India is placed lower than North Korea and Sudan on the index. A quarter of the world's hungry people live in India. Seventy two per cent of infants and 52 per cent of married women have anaemia. Grim reality Various surveys have given the same horrifying picture of child malnutrition in scale and intensity. Despite a substantial rise in national income since 1991, more than one-third of the world's malnourished children live in India. Apart from the fact that they are prone to infections and other diseases, they cannot learn their lessons well in school. So they get less productive jobs with meagre pay. This, in turn, traps them in a vicious cycle of poverty and malnutrition, leading to gross inefficiency in the economy. This is especially true of India, where labour is the major factor of production thanks to the vast unorganized sector. A 2005 survey shows that nearly half of India's children below five years were malnourished. The estimates varied widely across the states. Madhya Pradesh (with low female literacy) has the highest rate while Kerala (with the highest female literacy) has the lowest figure. Although India's economy grew between 2001 and 2006, its child-malnutrition rate dropped by just one per cent. The country is lagging far behind other nations with similar growth rates. However, the statistics hide the grim reality of the remote areas. A recent survey shows that in Nagada, a village in interior Odisha, a third of the children are suffering from malnutrition and another 17 per cent are only marginally better off. Nagada, with 275 inhabitants, has no anganwadi centre or school. So children are deprived of nutritious lunches. With no fair price shops, the people do not receive subsidized rice from the State. It lacks a health sub-centre and is not even accessible by motorable roads. The nearest health centre is five forested kilometres away; the nearest hospital is 18 km away. This could be an extreme case, but there are hundreds of such villages all over India. The reasons are not far to seek. These villages are not important vote banks. Hence, the political parties couldn't care less. Further, the only means of livelihood here is manual labour in the mines or in the fields of a well-off individual. Since dire poverty reduces the bargaining power of labourers vis--vis employers, the latter have a vested interest in sustaining the penury of the former. The employers are an integral part of the rural power elite and are in collusion with the politicians. And the rest follows from there."

The invitations came after Sharmila ended her 16-year fast last week, announcing that she would contest the 2017 Manipur Assembly elections to take forward her struggle against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. Written invitations from Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachao Andolan and several others, including National Alliance of Peoples Movement, were sent to her through Imphal-based environment activist Ram Wangkheirakpam. The letters were handed to Ram during a two-day National Energy Consultation programme at Bhopal recently. Ram, who returned in Imphal yesterday, passed them to Sharmila, who is still at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences. Ram said Sharmila, though wanting to respond to the invitations, had not taken a final decision, given her health. Sharmila, who is now on bail, will appear before an Imphal court on August 23. Till then she is expected to stay at the hospital. Supporters staying with her at the hospital said her health had improved. ""She ate cooked rice and fruit today for the first time,"" a supporter said. ""Today, when she is free we invite her to be part of all people's movements,"" Medha Patkar said in her letter. On the decision to contest the election, Patkar said her new path should be towards ""people's power and not state power"". A joint letter signed by more than 30 civil society groups from different states said they welcomed her to visit every corner of India to take forward movements for human rights, environment issues, economic and social justice, civil and political rights. Sharmila's immediate plan is to contest the Assembly election against chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh from his constituency of Thoubal. Sources said Sharmila wanted to visit Ukhrul and meet people there after representatives of Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights ""requested"" her to visit there. Meanwhile, Arambam Robita Leima, who ""disappeared"" last evening after she had gone from her fasting place near Manipur University in Imphal West ostensibly to Kongba in Imphal East, resurfaced today in Ukhrul town. Robita began her indefinite fast yesterday to take off from where Sharmila left. She was supposed to continue her fast at Kongba town. However, because of the presence of a large number of police personnel there she did not make it to the site and disappeared. This morning she surfaced at Ukhrul town and met some activists there. Robita left Ukhrul for Imphal in the evening, sources said. She is still fasting."

Jharkhand is a State where God has given it all. Its the countrys richest State and there are so many possibilities in every sector. Jharkhand is called a rich State but poverty thrives in its lap. We want to finish that poverty.A large number of our children go to Bombay, Delhi and other places working for just Rs.5,000 to Rs.7,000 a month, where they face physical and mental exploitation. We want to free Jharkhand from this, so we will have to provide jobs for them.What are you telling investors about reforms in the State?We are bringing reforms in all sectors. We have come out with a food processing policy for cashing in on our rich horticultural output. We have come up with ten new policies since I took charge, to encourage industry, exports, solar energy and medical education. We are finalising a policy for the IT and automobile sectors as well as startups, over the next month and a half. The automobile policy is about to be taken to the cabinet. We have Asias largest cluster of 400 auto component industries. I have spoken to Tata group chairman Cyrus Mistry that they should start automobile units in the State. He agreed, but these things take time. The State can only progress if we have a long-term strategy. We want to go ahead of Maharashtra and Gujarat.In the ease of doing business ranking of States, we are number 3, but in labour reforms, we are already ahead of Gujarat and are ranked first in the country. We got a 100 per cent score as we made everything online and removed inspections in many cases. The emphasis is on self-certification. If a boiler is not safe in a factory, we will hold them responsible but cant subject everyone to inspectors.Could we expect the State assembly to ratify the Constitutional amendments for the Goods and Services Tax regime soon?GST is good for the country and the State. We will take a call on when to introduce the Bill after we speak to the Centre. If they want it to be done early, we will call for it in the next session. If they say, we have three-four months, we can get it passed in the Winter session.You have agreed to be the first State to launch direct benefits transfer in kerosene?Yes, from October 2, we are starting it by linking it to Aadhaar. We plan to link everything to Aadhaar and give money straight to the people to buy kerosene, rice, etc. We are one of the few States with 92 per cent Aadhaar coverage and are now focusing on children up to the age of six years.We have started a pilot project in Ranchi where we are paying them to buy rice directly under the food security program, and for kerosene, we are starting with five districts. Some officers said people will drink alcohol with the cash. I said: If someone wanted to drink, he could still do that by selling the 30 kg rice we give him. But the corruption and siphoning off would stop.Its a good idea to issue the benefits to the woman in the household. At the time of school admission, we only ask for fathers name. We should make it mandatory to give mothers name and make the fathers name optional.What are your plans to tap the States mineral wealth?Eighteen auctions have been conducted for coal mines by the Centre.

""A three-member team of Indian experts, led by a Bangladesh retired chief conservator of forests, reached the scene at Sharishabari (of northern Jamalpur) to launch the rescue drive jointly with our forest officials and experts,"" chief conservator of forests Mohammad Yunus Ali said. He added that the joint team with veterinary surgeons as members was equipped with tranquillisers and other equipment, including medicines, to rescue the elephant, which was languishing in marshy land along the river. ""India will take it back if possible, otherwise we will keep the elephant,"" Bangladesh's forest chief said, pointing out that in the past two cases in 2004 and 2013, one attempt to return an elephant succeeded while another died on its way back. Ali said India kept in touch with Bangladesh's forest department since the animal, weighing around four tonnes, crossed the Brahmaputra on June 27 and soon grabbed media attention as it was followed by hundreds of people in boats every day requiring police deployment to keep it undisturbed. It was roaming along the river shoals and swamps in three northern districts. A forest official, who was stationed at the scene to monitor the elephant's behaviour and activities, said it remained calm though it showed some signs of abnormal behaviour as it was forced to live in swamps for weeks despite being habituated in hilly forest environment. ""The elephant looks tired and weak as it is finding limited items of food like rice or sugarcane plants or some banana trees supplied by us. Yet it remained non-violent,"" said an official over phone. The official said the elephant could not rest on a dry piece of land as higher land in the neighbourhood was occupied by people, who were forced to take refuge there leaving their inundated homes. When contacted by The Telegraph, Dhubri divisional forest officer A.S. Talukdar said the Assam government sent a forest department team to Bangladesh a couple of days ago, led by Goalpara divisional forest officer S.U. Choudhury and two elephant experts - Kaushik Barua and Ritesh Bhatta. They are now camping in Bangladesh and trying to bring back the jumbo with the help of Bangladesh forest department through the Bengal border soon. The elephant,reportedly swept by river currents from Kaziranga, finally swam to the neighbouring country through the Indo-Bangladesh riverine international border on June 26. The Assam forest department had tried to rescue the animal for about 10 days since it was first spotted swimming in the Brahmaputra near Guwahati. A wildlife team of Assam forest department, consisting of doctor, experts and field staff, failed to capture the elephant in Goalpara. Dhubri divisional forest officials, along with phandi (expert in elephant capturing) and field staff, too failed to bring the elephant in from the sar to the forest area. In Bangladesh, the elephant reportedly killed a villager, injured two others and destroyed homes at Silgram village."

Addressing a news conference here, the veteran Nationalist Congress Party leader said: ""The allocation of Rs 35,984 crore for the agriculture is a camouflage. Out of this, Rs 15,000 crore is for interest subvention. ""This amount used to be shown under the banking department previously. The actual allocation for agriculture sector is Rs 20,984 crore. This has been now shifted from banking to agriculture. That's camouflaging."" Pawar explained: ""Budgetary allocation for interest subvention was started during the UPA time but that was not under the agriculture head. An impression is being created that the government has come up with the biggest vision for agriculture. This is a false impression. ""The only good thing is support shown to MGNREGA against the backdrop of the Prime Minister and others ridiculing this welfare scheme. They were questioning the viability of this programme."" Pawar added: ""Because of the substantial rise in the minimum support price (MSP) during the UPA regime, India became the largest exporter of rice in the world and the second largest exporter of wheat, sugar and cotton. This government has taken no concrete decision on MSP. Production is going down for two years and it is worrisome."" He also questioned the government's claim about doubling of agriculture income in a particular time frame, saying: ""This is a hollow statement. For agriculture income to double, we need a 14 per cent rise every year. Figures don't match."" He also asked the Centre not to claim credit for crop insurance started by the UPA. Speaking on the JNU row and communalism, Pawar accused the Narendra Modi government of providing ""direct and indirect"" support to divisive forces. ""What happened in Hyderabad University and JNU are not good for the country,"" Pawar said. ""Communal temperatures are deliberately being pushed up. Society is being polarised to create fear psychosis among the minorities. Some forces got emboldened under this regime."" Asked about the Prime Minister's silence, he said, ""The Prime Minister does not speak on any such issue.... His Mann ki baat has no place for such concerns."""

The allocation was made after the state government requested the Centre to provide only rice and convert its quota of wheat into rice, an official source said. Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh had launched the act on April 24. The state government earmarked Rs 30 crore in the budget of the present fiscal to implement the act. ""Identification and digitisation of households and beneficiaries have been completed. Distribution of ration cards is on in the districts through district supply officers,"" the source said. Manipur BJP president Thounaojam Chaoba Singh accused the state government of committing irregularities in the selection of beneficiaries and of failing to distribute ration cards and opening fair price shops on time. He said the government should provide the list of beneficiaries to the local bodies. Reacting to the allegations, the source said the government was preparing to add genuine beneficiaries left out in the list of identified beneficiaries in the following months. The list of beneficiaries so far digitised can be seen on the official website of supply department, he added. Under the provisions of the act, 75 per cent of the rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population should benefit from the subsidised food grains. In Manipur, of the total population of 28,55,794 as per the 2011 census, 25,05,651 people will be covered by the act if these 63,600 families come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojna. Of the total beneficiaries,17,90,364 live in rural areas and 7,15,287 in urban areas. Below the poverty line category beneficiaries will get 5kg of rice per head per month at Rs 3 per kg while AAY families shall be entitled to 35kg of rice per family per month at the same price.

Ruma Chakraborty, who had acted as Mamata Banerjee in two jatra productions, is now Indira Banerjee in the forthcoming film Baghini (Tigress). Indira Banerjee and the Bengal chief minister have everything in common, except the first name. Ruma, who began as a theatre actor, says how her husband, a journalist who was also a theatre actor once, took her through the grind. ""He would come back at 1.30am, and we would go out to the streets,"" says Ruma. ""Walk like a woman who isn't afraid. Walk like someone who feels 'I do whatever I think is right',"" Ruma's husband told her as they stepped out of their one-room Beleghata home. He would follow her from a distance, scrutinising every step she took, even as men on the desolate streets threw lewd remarks at a lone woman. He told her that when Didi raised her hand, her fingers were splayed, and when she raised her index finger, it often did not point up, but sideways, and how Didi draped the anchal around her shoulders. ""Walk like someone who thinks she is the last word,"" he said. As Ruma sits quietly in a corner chair in Baghini director Nehal Dutta's office, she appears to have Didi's body language and posture, but there the similarity seems to end. Ruma's expression is gentle. Her smile, which does not go away, is gentle too. She cannot stop speaking, however, about the role that changed her life. (Left) Mamata Banerjee; Ruma Chakraborty Five years ago, when Mamata had just come to power, Ruma had got the offer to act as the new chief minister in a jatra. Banglay Khomota Ebar Mamata (Mamata is the power of Bengal) was her first performance as Mamata. The jatra, a huge success, ran for a year. Standing on the stage without a prop and looking at her vast audience, she felt, even if momentarily and vicariously, the power that one can have over people. ""People used to come to me with their problems after a performance,"" says Ruma. They would cry and touch her feet. In 2014, the same company produced Didi Tomar Jobab Nei (There's no one like you, Didi), and it was a great hit too. Now, Ruma is pinning her hopes on Baghini, which should be ready for release this month. Director Dutta allays fears that the movie would get into controversial issues. Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are both featured in the film, but no controversy, he insists. The film begins with a seven-year-old Indira/Mamata playing with friends when a car hits one of them. The little girl protests, saying the car owner can leave only over her dead body. The chief minister will be invited to the premiere, though there is no clarity on the release date. Ruma has not yet had Mamata attending any of her performances, though she has heard that recordings of her jatras have been given to the chief minister. Has the role changed her? Standing in front of the film's flex banner, Ruma thinks for a while and says: ""I was very soft. Now I can assert myself more.""

Millie Bhattacharyya, a Cheshire-based education consultant who grew up in Calcutta and migrated to the UK 37 years ago, no longer has family ties in town. But she makes multiple trips every year just to check on her four-legged friends. Millie Bhattacharyya cuddles a furry friend while another takes a nap and a thirdawaits its turn at her Ritchie Road residence It's hard to not trip over tails and paws and snouts at Millie's three-storey home. On any given day, there's Bichhu, Shada, Uncle Sam and Baghi sprawled around the house. Other dogs come and go as they see fit. They flock around to eat their meals and have their wounds dressed. ""I try to not name all of them, because once they're better, I like to let them out again,"" Millie said. She employs a help to look after the dogs when she's in the UK. While the help occasionally changes, she is a constant in the lives of the dogs. She extended her trip this summer by weeks to find and train a replacement for a help who had left at short notice. It was in November 2010 during a trip to organise her younger son's wedding that Millie first opened her house to a stray. Three puppies gambolling outside her house had caught her eye. They seemed happy, except for the fact that one's back had caved in and the other had sores all over. ""I wondered if a chocolate bomb had gone off on one and whether hot water had been poured on the other. One day the puppy with the least wounds got run over and I noticed that the others were beginning to hide themselves away, as they do when they feel they are about to die. That's when I took them in,"" recounted Millie. Little did she know that one act of kindness would mark the beginning of a new chapter in her life. Her golden retriever Leo, who lived in her home in Cheshire, passed away recently and Scamp, the puppy with the hollowed-out back, whose fate took him across the seas to a home he will always be safe in, is still getting over the loss of his friend. Showing old photographs of Leo and Scamp together, Millie said: ""I miss Scamp terribly when I am here, but he and my husband have been getting along very well. In fact, he has a better life there, with the woods to run around in. Here, all the dogs are closeted in apartments and that's unfair."" Millie with Scamp and Leo during a trip to Anglesey in WalesIs Millie's husband, a paediatrician, annoyed by his wife's frequent absences from home? ""He understands. He's seen some of the victims; so he knows how helpless they are. And my boys, in Australia and in the UK, wish that I had more time to visit them but they are animal lovers too."" While she's in Calcutta, not all of Millie's neighbours are happy with the dogs milling on the street. ""They think the dogs are here because I feed them and are scared for the safety of their children. So, I have vaccinated a lot of them against rabies, but I can't keep it up without funds. To collect funds, I have to go back to work in the UK but I can't leave them here to starve."" Before returning to the UK this month, she gave all the dogs around Maddox Square the DHPP vaccine that works for Parvo and Distemper. She has built six cubicles on her terrace for the dogs, especially the injured ones. ""I would like to request everyone to gather funds in their areas for these vaccinations. It's not impossible if everyone contributes. And it's easy to keep aside a little bit of fish and rice for the dogs or water in bowls outside the gate,"" Millie said. Sitting in her drawing room, cradling Bichhu while Baghi nuzzled her ankles, Millie said she often felt homesick. She wants to return home to Scamp, to her husband and work for a few more months before scheduling another visit to India, but too many lives depend on her. ""We pray to stone idols but we won't leave water out for a living thing. There's too little compassion and too much malice. I don't intend this to be a permanent home for dogs; I would love for them to find good homes so I can go home too,"" she said, albeit certain in the knowledge that every week she will open her gate to a new pair of melting brown eyes while her husband and Scamp await her return.

Pictures by Prem Singh.New Delhi, Aug. 13: Santosh Kumar chuckled at the thought that the Trinamul Congress was allotted the plot that is his home in Delhi but dropped it like a hot potato. It was bound to happen, the 34-year-old squatter from Bihars East Champaran district said. Ive been here for long years and have seen thousands come, measure the land and leave. No one ever came to stay. Santosh is one of 1,500-odd encroachers who live in shanties in a 6,000sqm patch of land off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg in central Delhi, from where the Centre recently offered Trinamul a 1,886sqm plot to build an office.But the party was horrified when it found that the plot is home to two temples  one to Sai Baba and the other to Shiva  and refused to accept it. Does Naidu (Venkaiah Naidu, the urban development minister) want us to demolish temples now? Trinamul member Sudip Bandyopadhyay had told The Telegraph on Wednesday night while conveying the partys rejection of the allotment.Santosh is certain that the central government had sold Trinamul a fast one. It was a political ploy, he said. People like us always find plots that lie between temples and mosques to live in  we know that no one will ever touch the area. Some Trinamul sources too said they had a feeling that Naidus ministry had tried to short-change the party by offering it a piece of land that no one wanted. Trinamul sources said the Centre had promised the plot in the days ahead of the passage of the goods and services tax bill, when it needed their partys support, but the allotment came after it was passed. They said that Naidu had been on his best behaviour with senior Trinamul MPs when they approached him for a plot, asking an official in front of them to show the party clean areas to choose from. The area off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg is prime real estate, located a few kilometres from Parliament and a stones throw from the headquarters of most of the big political parties. But for decades, its been home to rickshaw-pullers, mostly migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal. The rows of parked rickshaws take up a large slice of this tract of land, which has four temples of which two stand bang in the middle of the plot offered to Trinamul. Several eateries stand on the plot: they serve chicken curry and rice to their mostly labourer customers. There are multiple grocery stores and tea stalls, and a barber shop-cum-residence that caters to the nearby slum dwellers. Then theres Santoshs makeshift public telephone booth, which also serves as a ticket counter for travellers and an online service centre that helps the rickshaw-pullers pay their bills and send money home. This land is not ours, and well no doubt have to get out if the government tells us to. It hasnt happened in 20 years, though, said Mahesh Shah, 45, who came from Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh. Shah, a rickshaw-puller, lives on a part of the 1,886sqm plot the Trinamul was offered. Sudip had said that the residents had confronted Trinamul MPs staff when they went to see the plot on Wednesday, prompting them to escape with their lives. But the encroachers this newspaper spoke to denied having had any exchanges with the Trinamul representatives.Sudip said Trinamul was determined to assert its right. They were trying to shuffle on to us a plot no one else wanted. Why should we take such a plot? he told this newspaper on Thursday. What we have asked for is our legitimate right and we should get it. We have conveyed this to Naidu and he has promised that more plots will be shown and we can decide which one to take. This newspaper tried to contact Naidu over the phone at his offices in Parliament and at Shastri Bhavan on Thursday and Friday but his staff said he was busy with meetings. A source close to the minister said that Naidu himself had been surprised that Trinamul had been provided a plot with temples and had advised Sudip not to take it. He has promised him two more plots to choose from, the source said. Sudip confirmed this. But the encroachers are thanking the temples. These temples have saved us. Only someone willing to demolish them will get the plot, but who is going to do that? said Naresh Thakur, 50, the barber who runs his shop adjacent to the Shiva temple and opposite the Sai Baba temple. Nowadays, temples alone are the saviours of the poor, he signed off."

Hence, the personnel attached to 1,449 shops - 1,006 full-time shops and 443 part-time shops  in the district are being trained in the new system and registration of cardholders details in the system is now going on.Details of about 8,73,907 ration cards in Tirunelveli district has been registered under the newly introduced system. Since the Aadhar card numbers are being linked with the ration cards, bogus cards will get easily weeded out.This would avert irregularities in the sale of essential commodities and encourage paperless transactions"
58f4f87aa3d24b0b70c1b9e7,Golden rice isn’t ready yet,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Golden-rice-isn%E2%80%99t-ready-yet/article14552975.ece,2016-08-04,"Recently 110 Nobel Laureates issued a strongly worded plea to Greenpeace to abandon their campaign against [genetically modified organisms] in general and Golden Rice in particular. This is not the first time notable scientists have waded into the controversy surrounding genetically modified (GM) crops. What is remarkable about this latest foray, however, is their poor grasp of the facts surrounding Golden Rice.Golden Rice is an orange-yellow-coloured rice, genetically modified to produce beta-carotene, the precursor of Vitamin A. Advocates claim it is a powerful way to combat Vitamin A deficiency, the cause of diseases like childhood blindness, and deaths, particularly among the poor in Africa, South and Southeast Asia. Golden Rice was first developed around 1999 by two European scientists, Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer. The transnational agribusiness corporation Syngenta currently holds commercial rights to it. Moved apparently by humanitarian sentiments, Syngenta decided in 2004 to sub-license it free of charge (subject to several conditions, not all of which are straightforward) to agricultural research institutions in developing countries, through an entity named the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board. The project of taking Golden Rice to developing countries is housed within the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Philippines.The Nobel Laureates argue that the reason this innovation has not started saving lives yet is Greenpeaces criminal opposition. This narrative of conspiracy glosses over the rather more straightforward explanation: As IRRI itself admits on its website, Golden Rice is not ready for farmers, yet. There are above-board reasons for this which have little to do with anti-GM activists.The Laureates say that Golden Rice has  the potential to reduce or eliminate much of the death and disease caused by Vitamin A deficiency (emphasis added). This statement begs the question: Under what conditions might that potential be actualised? At least two conditions need to be met for Golden Rice to work as hoped: it should be suitable for cultivation by farmers; and it should be bio-available, that is, the digestive system should be able to extract the beta-carotene and make it available to the body, thus improving Vitamin A levels. Questions remain on both counts.Suitability for cultivationThe two versions of Golden Rice developed so far, Golden Rice 1 and 2, are both Japonica (sticky, dryland) rices, while people in areas with Vitamin A deficiency in South and Southeast Asia generally cultivate and consume the non-sticky, submerged Indica paddies. Japonica varieties are easier to modify genetically, but do not perform well in Asian fields. IRRI is still in the process of crossing Golden Rice into Indica varieties. In 2014, IRRI stated, Results of the first round of multi-location trials of Golden Rice showed that yields of candidate lines were not consistent across locations and seasons, prompting research direction toward assessing [other] Golden Rice versions. This is hardly a rice ready for cultivation by farmers  it has not even entered the stage of biosafety evaluation by government regulatory institutions.The question of bioavailability is even more vexed. The body does not necessarily absorb beta-carotene because one eats Golden Rice. The Golden Rice Humanitarian Boards website quotes a study published in 2012 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition for establishing the effectiveness of Golden Rice. On July 29, 2015, the journal retracted this paper citing ethical concerns.Even assuming that ethical concerns do not detract from the papers findings, the study design merits attention. The study saw middle-income, healthy Chinese children consuming a total of 210 grams of pork and other foods over breakfast and lunch daily, with 40 per cent of their total calorie intake coming from fat. Fats help the body absorb beta-carotene, since the latter dissolves easily in fats. Unlike customary practice, the Golden Rice fed to the children had been stored at minus 70{+o}C after drying for three days, to avoid any decline in beta-carotene levels with time. Thus, the study design favoured Golden Rice, rather than reflecting the actual lives and habits of poor Asians and Africans, who generally cannot afford fat-rich meals every day. So far, there is no answer to the real question: How will Golden Rice perform as part of meals that poor people, typically malnourished, actually eat?The Nobel Laureates accuse Greenpeaces campaign of raising the regulatory bar for GM crops. The facts above suggest that neither Greenpeace nor regulatory hurdles have delayed Golden Rices release. In fact, in 2009, the distinguished biotechnologist, Dr. Swapan Datta, former Deputy Director-General (Crop Science) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, who had worked on Golden Rice at IRRI, categorically stated, The regulatory system is not the barrier to releasing Golden Rice in India. IRRI itself, in its last update released in 2014, said: Golden Rice will only be made available broadly to farmers and consumers if it is successfully developed into rice varieties suitable for Asia, approved by national regulators, and shown to improve Vitamin A status in community conditions.Let us, for the moment, ignore the political aspects of Golden Rice and GM crops. Let us overlook the fact that many sciences (other than physics, chemistry, and medicine represented in the letter) have something to contribute to the debate over GM crops  in India, agricultural scientists, ecologists, nutritionists, and sociologists, among others, have insightfully contributed to the debate. Let us instead ask two basic questions. Is Golden Rice ready to be cultivated by farmers? IRRI itself answers no. Does Golden Rice improve Vitamin A levels among people as they actually live and eat? We dont know yet.Aniket Aga is Assistant Professor, School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Mr. Sangoli told Medical Education Minister Sharanprakash Patil, who is also the district in-charge Minister, that his complaint to the officials and the Chief Minister about the misdeeds committed by the officials did not have an impact and action had not been taken so far. The Minister gave a patient hearing to the pleas of the farmer and said that action would be initiated after proper inquiry based on the written complaint.Beneficiaries of the Anna Bhagya, Mytri, Mansvini, Vidyashree, Bidayi, Ksheera Bhagya, Ksheera Dhare and Runamukta Schemes showered praises on the government and the implementing agencies for bringing change in their lives.Subhash S. Dhole from Jewargi taluk, who is a beneficiary of Anna Bhagya, was all praise for the supply of free rice and wheat. The government should include toor dal in the scheme, he added. Mohammad Ajeem Rukmuddin wanted the Food and Civil Supplies Department to set up more coupon counters for kerosene distribution to eligible ration cardholders.Vaishali, a Class 8 student of Government Higher Primary School in Kalaburagi, wanted milk to be supplied to students daily instead of three days a week. The Minister told the girl that the government was considering introducing supply of milk for six days and a decision would be taken soon.Nazima Begum and Azmat Begum, beneficiaries of Bidayi scheme, wanted the assistance to be doubled to Rs. 1 lakh from Rs. 50,000 to meet the expenses.Mounesh Yallappa, a transgender benefited by the monthly pension of Rs.500 under the Mytri scheme, said that all the transgenders in the district were not getting the benefits of the scheme. Finding fault with the census data which showed that there were 450 transgenders in the district, Yallappa said that as per the figures available with him, there were 1,658 transgenders, but the pension was being extended only to 57. Yallappa demanded that the government conduct a comprehensive survey of transgenders and extend the pension to all of them. The pension amount should also be increased to Rs. 3,500 taking into account inflation.Dr. Patil said that directions had been issued to officials to collect information on the total number of transgenders and extend pension to all of them. He said that the demand to increase the pension amount would be placed before the government.Deputy Commissioner Ujjwal Kumar Ghosh, Kalaburagi Mahanagara Palike commissioner P.

The onus of imparting coaching will be on former India No. 3 shuttler J.B.S. Vidyadhar, who dominated the Indian badminton in the early 2000.Vijayawada which was once a badminton hub lost its sheen when the activity was shifted to Hyderabad. Pullela Gopichands academy began to attract youngsters from all over (united) Andhra Pradesh and with citys celebrated senior coach P.U. Bhaskar Babu shifting to Hyderabad as Saina Nehwal coach the game was put on a ventilator.Arjun awardee and former international shuttler Chetan Anand made his bit to revive the game by launching an academy but it failed take off.I went on to play for the country from Vijayawada. I got everything because of the game and I want to give it back to the game. So far I had spent Rs. 10 lakh, says Vidyadhar, who is an officer in the Indian Oil Corporation Limited.Former legislator Yalamanchali Ravis role in sprucing up the coaching unit is laudable for he gave his rice mill free of cost. The mill took a new shape in less than a month with technical personnel from Chennai laying the synthetic courts. The height of the hall is 30 feet which is sufficient for the beginners, felt Vidyadhar.Nearly 40 players will start practising from Friday and soon the hall will have three coaches to train the kids. In one year I want to produce a couple of champions.Along with Mr. Ravi, Badminton Association of India secretary (events) K.Ch. Punnaiah Choudary, ACP Central Zone Satyanand and several other badminton administrators will take part in the inaugural function.Incidentally, Vidyadhar was part of the Indian team at Thomas Cup twice and he also took part in the prestigious all-England championship and Asian Games at Doha in 2006. During 2002 and 2006, he was part of the Indian team at Singapore, France, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Canadian Opens."

A vivacious man enthusiastically catering to the food requirements of his few customers, Karma earns his livelihood by selling indigenous food from his non-descript Fani and Tani Hotel at the Tripura Tribal Autonomous District Council headquarters at Khumlung. ""I have my wife and three sons - the eldest one, Bijay, is an MA (history), the middle one, Ajay, is a graduate and the youngest one, Sujay, is Madhyamik plucked. What I earn from this 25-year-old hotel help us have three square meals a day,"" said Karma. But beneath his quiet yet vibrant nature lies a nostalgic anguish as the indigenous food he serves in his hotel, which is slowly but steadily being discarded by his tribal brethren for more modern, spicy and oily food consumed by non-tribal people. Tripura's tribal or indigenous society, believed by political scientists and sociologists to have already graduated to a nationality, is on the crossroads. High-level Westernisation, heralded by the Church, Evangelisation and growing influence of modernity have been alienating the indigenous people fast from their roots. This is reflected in changing food habits. Karma prepares only indigenous dishes sought after by locals, often even by non-tribal customers or occasional tourists. He perceives a creeping change in the preferences of his customers. Much like anything else communitarian tribal life and culture, including food habits, centred on what was available from the pristine nature. ""Dry fish is our staple. The most common and popular dish godhak, which is prepared with a variety of vegetables boiled together with dry fish and then crushed with onion pieces and dried green chilly. It tastes delicious,"" said Karma. Godhak still retains its popularity even among non-indigenous people but what is unpopular now is a delicacy called bangoi which is a lump of sticky binny rice packed in a special bangoi leaf boiled on vapour and then consumed with pork and dried green chillies. Since it lasts a few days, it was a favourite lunch item for jhum (shifting cultivation) farmers. Similarly, chakhoi is a preparation of boiled vegetables with soda and eaten with pork in thick gravy. Another popular item is berma prepared with a melange of boiled rice, dry fish and vegetables together. Almost similar is awandru , a boiled preparation of rice, dry fish and wheat flour in thick gravy made hot by green chillies. Variety is added by laitang, prepared with the inner part of a banana tree, dry fish and garlic, pasted together after boiling. A similar preparation is mufir which is a very hot preparation because of burnt green chillies added to it. For flavour and taste, batima and wakereng are famous as these are boiled preparations of rich pork, green chilly and special forest leaves. Muchhi is a spicy flavoured forest tree-leaf, which is mashed after boiling in water. Dry fish is added to this with green chillies. But another indigenous dish, popular with the non-indigenous people also, is sutumi merisedeng, which has raw tamarind paste, dry fish cooked with diced garlic and onion. ""All these things are pristinely pure and drawn from nature, with no spicesor oil and are good for health also. But the present generation take interest in other non-indigenous foods,"" said Karma. His ""Fani and Tani' and two other non-descript hotels proudly keep the flag of indigenous food aflutter. A nostalgic Karma also recalls the days of yore when he used to accompany his parents to do jhum cultivation for rice, vegetables and all other culinary necessaries."
58f4f8f27be9e018510a0967,Chew on this: rice fortified with iron,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160130/jsp/nation/story_66591.jsp,2016-01-30,"New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Narendra Modi government wants to fortify not just mid-day meals in school for children, but many other staples that Indians eat. The government, after proposing to supply fortified ready-to-eat packaged meals for children in anganwadi centres, is now mulling a plan for mass fortification of several staple food items on the lines of iodine-fortified salt. Prime Minister Modi last week heard a presentation from secretaries of the ministries of agriculture, food and public distribution, commerce, health and the women and child development, which has proposed mass fortification across the country. The proposal, officials said, would be to add certain essential micronutrients to rice, wheat, milk and edible oils, and distribute such food items through the public distribution system to address malnutrition. ""The idea is to begin small by supplying such fortified products in mid-day meals and anganwadi centres. The next step would be to take it further for use in the public distribution system. The last phase would be to take it to every citizen,"" said an official of the women's ministry, which is spearheading the project. According to the proposal, wheat would be fortified with iron, rice with iron and Vitamin D, milk and edible oils with Vitamin A, and salt - fortified for over three decades with iodine - will now be double-fortified with iodine and iron. Child health and nutrition specialists have, however, questioned the rationale for the proposal, saying the government appears to be rushing into some mass fortifications whose public health benefits have yet to be adequately demonstrated. ""There is no scientific evidence in India to show that some of these fortification proposals have any functional benefits. For example, fortification with iron should show benefit for those with anaemia. Except for iodine and folic acid, no micro-nutrient has shown to have any public health benefit. There is no third example,"" said Umesh Kapil, professor of nutrition at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The group of secretaries, officials said, are likely to have another round of meetings before a final decision is taken, after which the Food Safety Standard Association of India (FSSAI) - which is under the ministry of health - will notify the standards. After the FSSAI notification, all producers and those packaging the products will have to follow the norms prescribed. Some child specialists fear mass fortification will do little to address the long-standing challenges of water, poor nutrition and sanitation. ""In the absence of basics like water, food and sanitation, boosting food items with micro-nutrients will not address malnutrition. Fortification is not the route to follow in a country where basic nutrition is absent. In most districts in the country, even supplementary nutrition under the Integrated Child Development Scheme is absent,"" said Vandana Prasad, a community paediatrician and the founding secretary and national convener of the Public Health Resource Network. Worldwide, around 84 countries supply fortified food to their citizens to address nutritional loss in transit from harvesting to milling to packaging to distribution, and also due to excessive use of chemicals. ""To introduce large-scale fortification, the government also has to ensure there is no increase in cost of the food. There is no point if the cost of food for the poor increases because of the micro-nutrients,"" Kapil added. In India, pilot projects on fortification are already underway at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, and the Centre's department of biotechnology in Delhi. ""These two institutions have the requisite technology and can start production in nine months to a year,"" said the WCD ministry official. Rice fortified with iron is already available and is distributed in around 1449 schools in Odisha's Gajapati district, while IIT Kharagpur has a project running on similar lines. Many commercial manufacturers are already offering varieties of fortified wheat flour. Both Prasad and Kapil say that a decision to fortify staples should be taken only after careful and prolonged consultation with experts as in many cases fortification - like in the case of wheat - may lead to adverse effects on the diet. Activists also say that technological interventions in food for reducing hunger and malnutrition should be protected from commercial interests. The changes should be carried out through public institutions, based on transparent processes, public debate and scientific evidence, with extensive safeguards against profit motives and conflict of interest. ""The problem is that the government is showing a lack of focus in getting the basics sorted out. We can only deduce that these strategies (fortification) are being created for corporates to get into the fray. Fortification is a centralised process with debatable impact on micronutrient deficiencies. This becomes a centralised process of production and distribution where people have no control or ownership over what they eat,"" Prasad said."

Telegraph picture Imphal, April 6: Thadous in Manipur today began their first cultural festival in Senapati district, in an attempt to provide a common platform for the community where it can discuss culture, welfare and progress. The three-day festival with the theme ""My culture, my identity"" was inaugurated by Assembly Speaker Thokchom Lokeshwar Singh at the village ground of Ngahmun in Sadar Hills, about 45km from here today. Thadou, a recognised Scheduled Tribe, belongs to the Kuki community and the organisers included irrigation and flood control minister Ngamthang Haokip, Congress MLA Nemcha Kipgen and several prominent Thadou leaders. The festival aims to safeguard and preserve the culture and identity of the community. Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh was to be the chief guest of the programme. However, as Ibobi Singh is away in Delhi to meet party leader Sonia Gandhi, he sent the Speaker to represent him. The main highlights of the cultural extravaganza are presentation of songs, dances, holding of seminars, narrating folk tales, a beauty pageant and sports among others. Jumping over a standing mithun, which will be held on the last day, would be one of the main attractions. Mithun embodies the cultural life of the Thadou community and is the mascot of the festival. In the old days, Thadous used to kill mithuns and enjoy the beef with rice beer and other forms of merry making such as songs and dance. As part of the festival, an exhibition of traditional tools, equipment, ornaments, weapons and household items was held. The traditional weapons included a canon. Stalls presenting Thadou apparel were also opened. Seminars and lectures on the tribe's history, culture, tradition and way of life will be held during the festival, organising secretary Mangboi Kipgen said. A short play depicting the Anglo-Thadou war during World War II was staged today. Addressing the gathering, the Speaker called on all communities to come together, work and make Manipur a strong state. ""Manipur is a land of many cultures. So, we should protect our culture and identity. Therefore, I am happy to attend a cultural festival of the Thadou community. Let's shun differences and live together,"" Lokeshwar Singh said. Nemcha Kipgen, who presided over the programme, described the festival as an umbrella under which the community could unite. She also appealed to the state government to extend support in organising the festival."

If the assault-cum-sniffer dog wins the gallantry award, bestowed for ""individual acts of exceptional devotion to duty or courage"", it can look forward to a comfortable post-retirement life when its 10 years of service are over. Rocky is a member of the dog squad of the National Security Guard (NSG), a federal contingency force that reports to the Union home ministry. The NSG had led the operation against the terrorists who attacked the Pathankot airbase on January 2. Army dogs have won gallantry awards but no NSG dog has done so yet. Even Lt Col E.K. Niranjan, leader of the NSG's bomb disposal squad who died during the Pathankot operation, was not recommended for a gallantry award. Military authorities have explained that Niranjan was a ""battle casualty"" but was not killed in combat. Ahead of the Republic Day gallantry awards this year, the Centre had overlooked six of the seven soldiers killed in the Pathankot attack barring a sepoy who had physically fought one of the terrorists before being killed. Rocky is an assault dog that hunts for people in hiding, but is also trained to sniff out explosives. Dogs like Rocky are paid between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 a month, which is spent on their food and medical expenses. Decorated dogs continue to get their salaries after retirement. ""We have recommended Rocky as he helped NSG commandos collect evidence at Pathankot and suffered burns during the operation,"" a home ministry official said. Rocky had been the first to enter the smouldering remains of the two-storey building that was blown up with cannons to eliminate two terrorists holed up inside. ""Rocky was sent inside almost 10 hours later. After 20 minutes of search, the dog dragged a pouch out of the gutted building. The pouch, containing a grenade pin, belonged to one of the terrorists,"" an NSG official said. Rocky suffered burns on its left leg from a portion of the structure that was still burning. The paramilitary forces and the army used to shoot their old dogs after they became unfit to serve. But the Supreme Court recently banned the practice following pleas from NGOs and directed that the retired dogs should be rehabilitated. ""Rocky loves rice and chicken. If the dog wins the award it will be looked after well and can continue to enjoy the delicacy even after retirement and live in a separate home instead of being auctioned among dog lovers,"" an NSG official said. Another NSG official said: ""Rocky is ferocious and scary. The dog weighs 34kg and communicates through a nod of its head and not by barking."" He recalled how Max, a Mumbai police Labrador, was awarded a gold medal for its bravery during the November 2008 attacks. The sniffer dog had saved many lives by detecting 8kg RDX outside the Taj Hotel. The NSG has over a dozen Belgian Malinois dogs, a breed that each of India's paramilitary forces covets for its qualities. Its sense of smell is 40 times stronger than humans' and it can walk 30km without a break unlike German Shepherds or Labradors. ""The Malinois is the best in sniffing out explosive devices and humans,"" an NSG official said. It was a Malinois that had helped a US Navy SEALs team track down Osama bin Laden in his Pakistani hideout in May 2011."

Photo : C. VenkatachalapathyIn the heart of Vellore city is its commercial zone  Long Bazaar and surrounding areas. But traders and shopkeepers are unhappy over the lack of basic facilities for the markets and say the commercial hub is plagued by problems of traffic congestion and poor sanitation.Long Bazaar, also known as Kripananda Variyar Salai, is home to an old market  Nethaji Market  that has stood the test of time through several decades. While shops in Nethaji Market and Long Bazaar primarily sell fruits and vegetables, several lanes in and around the area deal with specific commodities.Mandy Street has shops selling pulses, rice and other groceries, B.S.S. Koil Street deals with textile shops, while Gandhi Road is home to jewellers and Chunambukara Street has shops selling plastic items, hardware and electrical appliances.But the commercial hub of Vellore Corporation is devoid of any development, according to traders. With the local body polls round the corner, traders say the Vellore Corporation should pay attention to their demands.We have been asking for a one-way route for lorries that enter the market for unloading goods for the last 30 years but nothing has been done till date. The lorries have to return on the same route, and this causes congestion. If a one-way route is earmarked, it will be easy for the vehicles to exit from the market, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.Poor sanitation is one of the major problems that are plaguing the commercial hub. Accumulation of garbage is a problem here. The Vellore Corporation should engage more number of sanitary workers to remove garbage from the market areas on shift basis. Many of the workers, who had retired, are yet to be replaced, he added.There are demands to renovate the shops in Nethaji Market too. There are a total of 750 shops in Nethaji Market, besides 250 vendors, according to traders.The market has minimal toilet facilities, they said. Mandy Street has only one toilet. As a result, the area suffers from poor sanitation due to open defecation, said C. Janarthanam, secretary of Vellore Navathaaniya Mandi Vyabarigal Sangam.Traders said that there is one pay-and-use toilet facility opposite the old fish market but there was need for at least two more free public toilets.Long Bazaar and its surrounding lanes also suffer due to lack of parking spaces. Mr. Balu recalled how many customers having cars have stopped coming to the market for want of space to park the vehicles.R.B. Gnanavelu, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vannigar Sangagalin Peramaippu, said many textile shops on B.S.S. Koil Street have been facing hardship in getting customers due to lack of parking space. The Vellore Corporation should establish parking lots somewhere close to the market zone such as at Mandy Street or old bus stand, he said.With the Vellore Corporation establishing a separate facility at the old fish market to relocate street vendors from Long Bazaar, he said that the stretch must be made free of congestion to enable people to walk freely.As the Corporation plans to modernise the Nethaji Market, he said, As per rules, newly constructed shops should be auctioned. But the market has traders, who have been running shops for three to four generations. The Corporation should amend its rules and allot the new shops once the market is modernised to the existing shopkeepers on priority basis, he said.He wanted the traders to be exempted from the solid waste management charges."
58f4faa17be9e018510a0bee,Cocktail pill for cholesterol,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160130/jsp/nation/story_66589.jsp,2016-01-30,"New Delhi, Jan. 29: A cocktail of black pepper, grape seed and red yeast rice powders combined with a heart-friendly lifestyle can lower blood cholesterol by up to 30 per cent, a clinical trial in India has suggested. The trial, although based on a small number of human #volunteers, has found that a 12-week course of treatment with a pill containing these herbal products and two vitamins lowered cholesterol to levels comparable with reductions observed through statin therapy. Cardiologists have underscored the need to validate its results through larger studies, but say these preliminary findings suggest the pill - sold in the US as a nutritional supplement - could serve as an alternative to statins for at least some patients. They also say studies on nutritional supplements may be relevant to countries such as India where, earlier studies have estimated, only about five per cent of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease take statins regularly. ""What we've seen is encouraging, we're now planning large-scale and longer trials,"" Ravi Kasliwal, the chair of clinical and preventive cardiology at Medanta, The Medicity, a private hospital in Gurgaon and principal investigator of the trial, told The Telegraph. A paper by Kasliwal and his colleagues describing the trial was published today in Nutrition, an international research journal. The doctors have called it the first ""randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study"" to assess the safety and efficacy of a nutritional supplement against a cardiovascular risk factor in India. In a double-blind study, neither doctors nor patients know who is taking the drug and the placebo, and is a rigorous way of evaluating drugs. ""As a cardiologist, I routinely prescribe statins to many patients, but the reality is - there are some patients who are averse to taking statins because they're concerned about lifelong therapy, and some patients turn away because of their side-effects,"" Kasliwal said. The doctors tested an over-the-counter nutritional supplement that is sold in the US and contains red yeast rice powder, grape seed powder, black pepper powder, and two compounds from the Vitamin B group - niacinamide and folic acid. Earlier medical studies have established niacinamide as a cholesterol-lowering agent. Red yeast rice, made by fermenting a type of yeast over red rice, has also has been shown in some studies to reduce cholesterol. Several US companies promote red yeast rice as a dietary supplement to treat high cholesterol and cardiologists say similar nutritional supplements claimed to reduce cholesterol are also sold across India although their safety and efficacy have not been adequately tested. The US Food and Drug Administration had in 2007 warned consumers not to eat three specific red yeast rice products after FDA testing found that these products contained lovastatin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient and a prescription drug used to treat high cholesterol. The product tested in India was not among the three products censured by the US FDA. Kasliwal and his colleagues from hospitals in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Jaipur, Mumbai, Pune and Triruvammalai (Tamil Nadu), divided 180 patients with high cholesterol into two groups - one group received the cocktail pill, the other received a placebo, or sham treatment. All patients were also asked to adopt a healthy diet and walk about 30 minutes a day. After 12 weeks therapy, patients who received the pill showed a 29 per cent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, also called bad cholesterol, compared to an average of four per cent reduction among patients who received the placebo. Total cholesterol among the patients taking the pill dropped by about 22 per cent, compared to a seven per cent drop among the patients on placebo. Some cardiologists point out that changes in blood cholesterol levels need to translate into measurable clinical benefits such as lower incidence of heart attacks. ""These preliminary results could be viewed as a proof-of-principle,"" said K Srinath Reddy, a senior cardiologist and president of the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, who was not associated with the clinical trial. ""For proof-of-clinical benefit, we will need studies to demonstrate that such blood chemistry changes actually result into a lower incidence of cardiac events - this could take much longer and a greater number of patients."""
58f4faffa3d24b0b70c1bc31,Tearing the curtain of darkness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Tearing-the-curtain-of-darkness/article14518209.ece,2016-07-31,"he story goes, not apocryphal, that every time Mahasweta Devi visited Jharkhand, she would demand that Birsa Munda be unshackled. In Ranchi, on Birsa Munda Chowk, theres a statue of this fiery tribal leader who died in jail during British rule in 1900. The statue shows him wearing a turban and dhoti, his hands in chains. Officials would tell her that the British photographed him in chains and that perhaps became a reference point for all depictions of the tribal hero who died at 25. The chains also symbolised his struggle for freedom, they claimed.An old Ranchi hand recalls her saying:  Shaddhin deshe keno shekole bandha (why is he still in chains when India is free)? as she gathered for a meeting of bonded labourers in the 1980s. Last month, the Jharkhand government decided to free Birsa Munda of his shackles, 116 years after his death, and several years after the writer and activist voiced her demand. She may not be around to see a free Munda, but the downtrodden  tribals, dispossessed, marginalised, landless  and those who are fighting against injustice and are still in chains know that she is there in spirit.Mahasweta Devi had woven a historical fiction around the legend of Birsa Munda in her 1977 novel Aranyer Adhikar (Rights of the Forest), which chronicles the turbulent period of the late 19th century, and particularly the tribal armed uprising against the British led by Birsa Munda to rid the forests and hills of usurpers. She received the Sahitya Akademi award for it in 1979, though Mahasweta Devi, the political and social activist and conscience-keeper, wouldnt bother herself too much with the awards and accolades (Padma Shri, Padma Vibhushan, Jnanpith, Magsaysay) bagged by Mahasweta Devi, the writer.Yet her books sold well. Her stories of the subaltern will live forever as long as theres oppression in the world and the poorest of the poor need a voice. In todays atmosphere of growing intolerance, its imperative to read her work and remind ourselves of her lifelong fight for those who are sought to be silenced.Her compassionate crusade through art and activism to claim for tribal peoples a just and honourable place in India's national life got her the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1997. Accepting it, she had said: My India still lives behind a curtain of darkness. A curtain that separates mainstream society from the poor and the deprived.For justice and honourAs justice and honour still elude a large slice of tribal peoples across Wet Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and the north-eastern States, her narratives on their shackled lives are more relevant than ever.Hajar Churashir Maa (Mother of 1084), one of her most widely read books, was adapted for theatre and film. Even though it was written in the turbulent 1970s at the peak of the Naxalite movement, its message is perhaps even more powerful in the prevailing atmosphere of a million mutinies between state and people.The novel begins with the death of a son and his mother waking up to the terrible fact of him being reduced to a number. Its a chilling portrayal of a social movement that wasnt quite successful, put down by brutal force; and we suffer along with the mother, Sujata Chatterjee, who tries to understand a revolutionary movement that took her son Brati. Her journey is also one of self-discovery and her place in a feudal world.Writing and activism were in Mahasweta Devis genes. Her parents were writers, her uncle Ritwik Ghatak, her husband Bijon Bhattacharya, a radical Left playwright and a member of the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA). At 28, she toured parts of backward Rajasthan alone, to research for a biography on Rani of Jhansi, her first book. From the bonded labourers of Palamu to the denotified tribes of Bengal  Lodhas of Medinipur, Khedia Shobors of Purulia, Dhikaros of Birbhum  Mahasweta Devi spent three decades of her life listening to them to tell us about these lives, outside the margins of society.As Irom Sharmila decides to call off her fast in Manipur, with the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act yet to be repealed, we are drawn to another of Mahasweta Devis famous stories, Draupadi. In a powerful retelling of this Mahabharata character, we have Draupadi, or Dopdi, as a rebel who is cornered by the police in a bid to suppress forces she represents.Draupadi begins with a short exchange between two men in uniform. Whats this, a tribal called Dopdi? The list of names I bought has nothing like it! How can anyone have an unlisted name? The other man responds: Draupadi Mejhen. Born the year her mother threshed rice at Surja Sahus at Bakuli. Surja Sahus wife gave her the name.Since Mahasweta Devi rooted her stories and plots on events she saw or read about, her writing incorporates tribal languages and dialects, folk tales and oral histories. She elevated these stories with her imagination, using various genres and styles. Her prose is brutal and lyrical, her tone ironic, sarcastic.The power of DopdiNo miracle can save Dopdi, and she doesnt want it either. As Dopdi is pursued by her abusers, she stands up to them, laughing hysterically as she tears up her sari, exposing her nakedness in a chilling act of defiance akin to what we saw in Imphal in 2004 when women protested the killing of Thangjam Manorama.In another story, The Breast Giver, the protagonist Jashoda is paid to nurse a brood of children of her master and mistress. This helps her to support her poor disabled family. In yet another story, Pterodactyl, she explores why Adivasis are so misunderstood. For her, the Adivasis were civilised and cultured, and her own class hypocritical.Throughout her life and her writing, Mahasweta Devi tried to ensure that the plight of suffering spectators of a fast developing country didnt go unnoticed. She was drawn to people who led a subhuman existence, people with no access to education or health care or roads or income. Many of them may not be able to read her work yet, but its because of her that their stories are out there.She was not one to shy away from the difficult path. Despite her obvious Left links, during the Singur and Nandigram agitations in West Bengal, Mahasweta Devi, well in her 80s, launched a vehement protest against appropriation of land by the state. Her frail frame at a rally in Kolkata against police firing in Nandigram helped energise the Opposition and Mamata Banerjee to bring about  poribortan  in the State. But then again, when the newly elected Mamata Banerjee government refused permission to the Association for Protection of Domestic Rights to hold a rally in Kolkata against government action against Maoists in Lalgarh, she protested.For Mahasweta Devi, it was imperative to make an attempt to tear the curtain of darkness, see the reality that lies beyond and see our own true faces in the process. With her writing and activism, Mahasweta Devi holds up a mirror to society.But are we looking?Sudipta Datta is a Kolkata-based journalist.Mahasweta Devi, the activist and conscience-keeper, wouldnt bother herself too much with the accolades bagged by Mahasweta Devi, the writer."

The Telegraph had published a report - ""PDS rice denied to HIV+ children"" - on March 17, highlighting the plight of the orphan duo. The orphaned siblings at a remote village were denied ration under the government's food distribution scheme by a retailer, because of the fear of contracting the disease from the HIV+ children. The incident grabbed the headlines and triggered widespread condemnation across the state. Human rights activist Biswapriya Kanungo, who had moved the rights panel, said the commission had taken cognisance of The Telegraph report and issued directions to the government for submission of action taken report to the commission. The commission's ruling said: ""Considering the gravity of the matter, the commission directs secretaries of the health and family welfare, food supplies and consumer welfare and the women and child welfare departments besides the Kendrapara collector to institute an inquiry and furnish reports within four weeks."" ""The government agencies should also reflect in their reports the action taken by them in sensitising and educating the people with regard to misconception on persons afflicted with HIV positive. The concerned government agencies need to initiate more vigorous and stringent steps to combat such a situation in the larger interest of protecting human rights of persons afflicted HIV/AIDS,"" the commission observed. The infected siblings had incidentally lost their parents to the killer disease in 2005. The plight of the orphaned HIV carrier siblings had also drawn presidential intervention after the duo wrote to the then president, APJ Abdul Kalam, and narrated their tale. Moved by the letter, Kalam had dispatched a draft of Rs 20,000 in June 2005 and also spurred the local administration to come to the rescue of the siblings. Kendrapara collector Debraj Senapati, refusing to elaborate the findings of the inquiry, said: ""Various government agencies, including the health and the food supplies, are inquiring into the incident. Besides the District Child Welfare Committee is also carrying out a separate inquiry."""
58f4fe1460de470aa339e3fa,Paddy politics: nose cut off to spite face,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160122/jsp/bengal/story_65242.jsp,2016-01-22,"Jan. 21: The Mamata Banerjee government's plan to buy 45 lakh tonnes of paddy directly from farmers to boost food security has hit a roadblock as ruling party activists have prevented farmers loyal to the Left from selling their produce. The procurement target was increased by over two fold compared to last year's target of 22 lakh tonnes as Mamata has plans to bring more people under the subsidised rice scheme when the National Food Security Act is introduced in the state on January 27. Two Nadia farmers, Sushil Ghosh and Samar Ghosh in Hanskhali block, have lodged complaints with the district authorities saying they were prevented from selling paddy on January 18 when they went to a government kisan mandi. Sources said several other farmers from other blocks in Naida also alleged that they were being prevented from selling paddy because they were CPM supporters. Under the food security act, 6.01 crore people would get subsidised rice from the Centre. The state would give cheap rice to another 1.7 crore people. Till now, a total of 3.2 crore people in Bengal used to get subsidised rice, but from January 27 the number of beneficiaries would increase to 7.7 crore. The state has to procure 45 lakh tonnes for all the beneficiaries. Senior government officials said the state needed more farmers to come up to sell their produce so that it could achieve the procurement target. ""To procure 45 lakh tonnes of paddy, you require at least 1.5 lakh farmers to sell 30 quintals of paddy each to the government.... There are lakhs of sympathisers of Left parties in rural areas. It is not possible to meet the target by bypassing those farmers,"" said a senior food department official. Jyotipriya Mallick, the food and supplies minister, said he was ""not aware of this particular case. But farmers cannot be divided based on political identity."" As the elections approach, the ruling party cannot afford to be selective in terms of reaching out to farmers. Before coming to power, Trinamul used to question the faulty BPL lists of the Left government, saying the Front was selective in giving benefits to the poor. ""It had left an impact in rural areas and was reflected in the results of 2011 polls when the Left parties lost their support base,"" said a senior state minister. ""The finance department has already sanctioned a sum of Rs 1,000 crore.... But politics at the ground level could put the entire exercise in trouble,"" said a minister. The momentum for procurement has been slow, said government sources. Reports of the food and supplies department till Wednesday showed that 12.9 lakh tonnes of paddy was bought, when the state needed to procure the maximum quantum of paddy between November and January. ""The kharif crop, harvested between October and November, produces 110 lakh tonnes of 155 lakh tonnes of total paddy grown in Bengal. If we cannot buy the maximum quantum by January, we may fall short of the target as small farmers sell off their paddy in the local market even at a cheaper rate as they have to repay loans,"" said a senior official. In Nadia's Hanskhali, farmer Sushil Ghosh said Trinamul Krishnaganj MLA Satyajit Biswas was to blame for the paddy sale block on Left-sympathiser farmers. Biswas denied the allegations, saying it was ""conspired by the CPM to malign me before the polls. I just told the officials not take rice which has dust."" He said he had told officials ""to prepare a list so that they (farmers who were turned away) could be given a fresh chance before procurement is finished."" From September last year, the government started procuring paddy across the state through the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation Limited at a rate of Rs 1,410 a quintal. If the farmer brings the paddy to a kisan mandi, he gets Rs 15 more for each quintal as the state wants to promote the rural markets for such direct sale. Sushil said when he went to the mandi with 18 quintals of paddy on January 18, some Trinamul activists did not let him enter the market. Sushil said he somehow managed to speak to the procurement officer, who told him his paddy could not be bought. Sushil, who is a CPM member in the Hanshkhali panchayat samiti, said he had taken paddy to the mandi after cleaning it. ""First of all, I was not allowed to enter. Second, none of my sacks was opened and examined. I am not a dishonest person to contaminate my rice with dust."""

When the state government announced rice for garden workers at 45 paise a kilo, it said garden owners would procure the rice under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) that is given out to the poor at Rs 2 a kg. The owners would then sell the rice at 45 paise a kg to the workers, and bear the Rs 1.55 subsidy per kilo. Three closed gardens - Dheklapara, Bundapani and Joybirpara - and the eight ailing estates of the Duncans group do not have owners to run the day-to-day affairs of the gardens. Hence, no one to bear the subsidy. In open gardens that have owners, rice is being given to workers at 45 paise a kilo. The 11 ailing and closed gardens, where over 35,000 garden workers and their families reside, are in the Madarihat constituency in the Dooars, which other than the Darjeeling hills is a big tea belt area in Bengal. ""Workers and their families in none of the closed and sick tea estates in the Dooars, including the Madarihat block, are getting rice at the rate of 45 paisa per kilo, unlike those who are residents of tea gardens which are open and functional,"" said Robinson Kuzur, a worker in the Birpara Tea Estate owned by the Duncans group in Alipurduar district. Birpara is one of the seven tea estates of the Duncans which the Centre has acquired by invoking the Tea Act. Madarihat has the highest concentration of closed and sick gardens in the Dooars at 11. Administrative sources said there are around 35,000 voters in these 11 tea estates and many are angry with the state government. ""There is a technical problem which the state government has failed to resolve so far. As it was decided to introduce NFSA in the tea gardens where planters used to provide ration to the workers, the planters were told by the state to procure food grains at Rs 2 a kilo and distribute it at 45 paisa per kilo. They were to bear a subsidy of Rs 1.55 per kilo,"" a political observer said. ""The government campaigned that it is providing the food grains to the entire tea population at a cheaper rate than the NFSA rate which is Rs 2 a kilo. That, however, is not the truth,"" he added. ""In the closed and sick tea estates, it was decided that self-help groups would be engaged in distributing rations. As there is no tea planter in the closed and ailing gardens to bear the subsidy, the state should have borne the subsidy. However, no directive came to the food and supply departments in the tea producing districts that the state will bear the subsidy. As a result, self-help groups are distributing rations among the workers and their families at the rate of Rs 2 per kilo,"" the political observer said. Diptesh Oraon, a worker of Birpara, said the cheaper rice went to gardens that are open and healthy, while workers in gardens where ""we need it the most"" were left out. Some of the workers said that Mamata had announced in November that the state would acquire the Duncans gardens. ""It turned out to be an empty promise and eventually, the Centre had to step in and acquire the gardens,"" Suresh Mahali, a worker of the closed Bundapani Tea Estate, said. Local leaders of the BJP have found an opportunity in the rice subsidy disparity and highlighted this in their campaign before Narendra Modi's rally in Birpara on April 7. ""We are waiting for the Prime Minister and hope he will speak on these issues,"" Ramesh Kami, a worker of Demdima Tea Estate that is a Duncans garden acquired by the Centre, said. In Madarihat, the BJP candidate had come second in the 2011 Assembly polls, losing to the RSP candidate by 7,909 votes. Also, in the 2014 Parliament polls, the BJP was in top position in this Assembly segment. Trinamul, which eventually had won the Alipurduar Parliament seat, was in the third position here. This year, RSP has fielded departing MLA Kumari Kuzur and the BJP Manoj Tigga. Trinamul has fielded Padam Lama. Gopal Pradhan, an RSP leader based in Birpara, however, said the BJP would not be able to leave much impact this time. ""We are also highlighting these disparities and faulty policies of the Trinamul government which have left jobless workers deprived of benefits. Trinamul would not be able to score much in Madarihat seat this time. The political circumstances were different in 2014. In the upcoming elections, the BJP would not be much of a factor here. Also, we have the support of Congress this time and it is known that Intuc has a support base in the tea estates in this constituency,"" Pradhan said.

On Friday, the police had failed to produce Left-backed Independent councillor Debojyoti Roy during the voting despite an order by Calcutta High Court. The Congress lost the vote but the allegations of Trinamul masterminding the abduction and the police's alleged inaction, against which Debojyoti's wife had moved the high court, galvanised the Congress and the Left and prompted them to launch a joint protest. Debojyoti and his wife Santana, another Left-backed Independent councillor, had pledged support to the Congress. Had the abducted leader managed to vote, the party would have been tied with Trinamul at nine votes each and a toss would have been required to decide the winner of the no-confidence motion. State Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury said the councillor's rescue was ""staged"". Subdivisional police officer Indrajit Sarkar said a police patrol jeep intercepted the stolen Indica at Burwan, 15km from Kandi, around 1am today. ""Seeing the police, the driver stopped the car and ran away with another person who was in the vehicle. A motorcycle was in front of the car. The rider left the bike behind and scooted through a field. Looking inside the car, the police found Debojyoti Roy. His hands and feet were tied and he was gagged and blindfolded,"" Sarkar said. Debojyoti told journalists that his abductors had planned to take him to Jharkhand. ""They blindfolded me and took me to a house. At night, they used to make me walk from one village to another. I was given only puffed rice and chapatti,"" he said. ""They did not even allow me to go out to relieve myself. Last night, they took me out and put me in a car. I overheard them saying they would go to Bolpur for refuelling and then take me to Jharkhand. I am sure they would have murdered me,"" Debojyoti added."

The political equations have changed in Jhargram, where the CPM is not supporting the Congress candidate but the Jharkhand Party (Naren) nominee. The JKP (Naren) had in 2011 joined hands with Trinamul to help it snatch the Assembly seat from the CPM, which had held it for over three decades. ""JKP (Naren) supporters have understood that Mamata Banerjee has not done anything for them.... I want to fight against her party and I am happy the CPM is supporting me,"" said Chunibala Hansda, the JKP (Naren) candidate from Jhargram. The CPM's support for Chunibala hasn't come easy. It involved meetingsover weeks at Alimuddin Street before the Left leadership agreed to back a party it has fought for around four decades. The CPM and the JKP (Naren) had clashed with each other often, causing deaths and injuries. Chunibala herself was at the forefront of the battle against the CPM. She had defeated the Left party in 2000 and 2006 in the adjoining Binpur Assembly seat. Mamata has visited Jhargram at least 15 times since coming to power and tried to win people's hearts with promises of rice at Rs 2 a kg, bicycles and footballs. ""People are not happy with just rice. They are demanding other facilities such as drinking water, proper roads and houses,"" a CPM source said. Trinamul minister Sukumar Hansda, who has been re-nominated from the seat, is said to be relying on a split in the Opposition votes. Although the Congress has put up a candidate in Jhargram, the CPM thinks Chunibala is a more formidable force to take on Trinamul. Dahareshwar Sen, a CPM leader in West Midnapore, said: ""Congress candidate Subrata Bhattacharya is an outsider and hardly has any influence over the voters here."""

Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Bhubaneswar, March 18: The state government has earmarked Rs 300 crore towards its premium share of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The premium rates, to be paid by farmers, have substantially been brought down, so that more farmers can get insurance cover against crop loss on account of natural calamities. Finance minister Pradeep Amat announced the government's decision while tabling the agriculture budget of Rs 13,181.89 crore in the Assembly. The amount is 20.89 per cent more than the outlay for the previous year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his February visit to Bargarh, where from the largest number of farmer suicides has been reported, had urged the farmers to adopt the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme. He also urged the state governments to support the programme. The scheme will come into effect from the coming kharif season this April. Under the new scheme, farmers will have to pay a uniform premium of 2 per cent for all kharif crops and 1.5 per cent for all rabi crops. For annual commercial and horticultural crops, farmers will have to pay a premium of 5 per cent. The remaining share of the premium, as in the previous schemes, will continue to be borne equally by the Centre and the respective state governments. Amat also announced that the state would provide Rs 800 crore towards its premium share of the existing National Agricultural Insurance Scheme, which is implemented in the state on a modified version. ""There is a need for quick relief through adequate compensation and insurance cover to mitigate their financial hardships,"" said Amat. The state government has been bringing a separate budget on agriculture since 2012-13 fiscal. The agriculture budget includes budget for water resources, co-operation, fisheries and animal resource development and agriculture departments. The highest budgetary allocation was made for the water resources department, which stood at Rs 7,241.66 crore in 2016-17 - an increase of about 16.57 per cent. To provide water to farmers, the state government has planned to revive the defunct lift irrigation projects. It aims to revive the irrigation potential and ayacut created over the years that has been lost due to siltation of reservoirs, deterioration of the distribution system and drying up of the water sources of lift irrigation projects. To encourage the tribal to go for production of millets, the state government has decide to launch special programme for millet in the tribal areas to enhance production and productivity of millet. Another scheme has been launched to support the integrated farming system in tribal districts to enhance the farmers' income in the watershed areas. Amat also announced that a new programme, called development of agriculture in collaboration with international institutions, would be launched. The government will take help of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, International Rice Institute, International centre for Agriculture Research Dry Areas and the International Potato Centre for this on knowledge sharing basis. The agriculture department also decided to launch special programme for ""Promotion of Gender Friendly Tools for Farm Women in Odisha"" to improve their efficiency. The government also introduced a new scheme ""Support to Farmer Producers Organisations"" with the objective of mobilisation of farmers to enhance their production. It has also earmarked Rs 100 crore to build godowns. The panchayati raj department will be the executing agency for this instead of the co-operation department. The state government also aims to produce one crore eggs per day and 1 lakh metric tonnes broiler meat per annum by 2020."
58f4ffcb7be9e018510a1396, off menu at Simhastha stations,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160413/jsp/nation/story_79903.jsp,2016-04-13,"Bhopal, April 12: The pilgrims have started arriving but an old favourite has been stopped in its progress. Poha, an easily digestible breakfast staple, has been banned from platforms in all Western Railway divisions. There's no official place for it at stations where hundreds have been arriving every day for Simhastha 2016. Prepared from flattened rice and highly recommended by nutritionists, poha is popular across central and western India and has united the nation just as other regular breakfast options, such as upma, dosa, paratha and puri- sabzi. But Western Railway authorities apparently ""forgot"" to add poha in their official list of edible items permitted to be sold on platforms. So when general manager G.C. Aggarwal came to inspect and review preparations for the Simhastha, he objected to the sale of poha at the railway station in Ujjain, the Madhya Pradesh pilgrim centre that hosts this year's Kumbh mela. This means that while the Kumbh pilgrims search for salvation, the poha - available for anything between Rs 5 and Rs 10 a plate - has been blocked in its humble pilgrimage through the human system, although nutritionists say it is 98 per cent digestible. The Simhastha begins on April 22 and over five crore pilgrims are expected to gather for a dip in the holy Kshipra river. It is called Simhastha because of a rare configuration of planets that occurs once in 12 years when the Sun enters the zodiac sign Aries and Jupiter is in Leo (Simha rashi). Thousands of pilgrims have already arrived in Ujjain but those who were looking forward to have poha in Ujjain, Indore and the 13 other railway stations that fall under Ratlam division were in for a disappointment following the ban order. Poha lovers have hit back. A group on Facebook, named The Indori Page, posted a picture that said "" Pohe hum sharminda hai, tere dushman zinda hai ( poha, we are sorry, your enemies are still alive)"". Another post read "" tum kitne pohe ban karoge, har ghar se pohe niklenge"" (how much poha will you ban, it will emerge from every home). Western railway authorities are now trying to play down the lapse after railway vendors wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, railway minister Suresh Prabhu and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Jayant Joshi, public relations officer, Ratlam division, claimed it was a ""printing mistake"". ""As of now, it ( poha) is not in the list so its sale is not permitted. We are writing to the competent authority to include in the list.... Its sale will resume again at all railway stations,"" Joshi said. Pankaj Chaturvedi, a member of the district railway users consultative committee, said he was ""outraged"". "" Poha is not merely a breakfast option. It is an integral part of our culture and heritage. I would request Suresh Prabhuji to personally get a probe done to know why poha was kept out in the first place? Is it aimed at benefiting some multinational or food chain? It cannot be a printing error,"" Chaturvedi said."

Hours earlier, after a meeting between Union home minister Rajnath Singh and Jat leaders, the BJP had declared a bill would be moved soon in the Haryana Assembly to grant Other Backward Classes status to Jats in the state. Protesters began lifting blockades at some places following the assurances but violence continued at some other places. ""Just now, we have formed a committee,"" Rajnath said late tonight, shortly after discussions with foreign minister Sushma Swaraj and defence minister Manohar Parrikar. ""I appeal to the people of Haryana to help maintain calm and peace."" A brief BJP statement said party president Amit Shah had formed the committee under Naidu and that its other members would be BJP vice-presidents Satpal Malik and Avinash Rai Khanna besides Union ministers Mahesh Sharma and Sanjeev Balyan. ""This committee will study all aspects of Jat reservation and hear out all sides and submit its report to the party chief and the Centre at the earliest,"" it said. Normality was reported to be returning to some cities such as Kaithal, where curfew was lifted. Officials expect the situation to improve considerably by tomorrow. Those who attended the meeting with Rajnath included Jat leaders from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi besides central minister Balyan, Haryana minister Abhimanyu, BJP parliamentarian and former Mumbai police commissioner Satyapal Singh and Lt Gen (retd) Raj Kandyan, a former army deputy chief. Jat Sangharsh Samiti leader Jaipal Sing Sangwan said the discussions had been positive and appealed ""to everyone to call off the agitation"".

Das said one person was killed in Sonipat today and another in a clash between Jats and non-Jats in Hissar. He added that protesters had damaged some dhabas along the Delhi-Ambala highway in Sonipat. Jat agitators vandalised a college owned by an MP, a hotel, a rice mill and a railway station in Sonipat, while torching shops, buses and motorbikes. In Bhiwani, buses were set ablaze and BJP parliamentarian Dharambir's house was ransacked.

Altogether 150 people have been injured in the nine-day-old agitation. The state government tonight shifted the Rohtak Range inspector-general of police, Sirikant Jadhav, without assigning any reason. Road and rail traffic remain paralysed, with the supply of essentials such as fuel, milk and vegetables severely hit. ATMs are running out of cash, officials said."

58f503027be9e018510a18b7,An astute and diplomatic chooser,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161202/jsp/opinion/story_122409.jsp,2016-12-02,"Robert Gates, the former American secretary of defence, with the author CHOICES: INSIDE THE MAKING OF INDIA'S FOREIGN POLICY By Shivshankar Menon, Penguin, Rs 599 In his story of ""the making of India's foreign policy"", Shivshankar Menon presents a ""practioner's view, not a theorist's"". He focuses on five specific diplomatic issues from India's recent history with which he was directly involved as a government official. Being a player in the apex echelon of State machinery, Menon needs to weigh seriously each and every word. 'Choice' is the crux of governance, and foreign policy decisions of every government revolve around multiple 'choices' wherefrom to choose. The border dispute with China took an enormously tortuous course that to this day remains unresolved, initiatives and experiments with several choices notwithstanding. For both China and India, there is still 'a prisoner of the past' scenario pertaining to territorial adjustment in which leaders of both sides may be flexible only at the peril of losing their power and position owing to domestic compulsions. After all, it was apparent that there were serious differences between China and India about the line of actual control in several areas. Nevertheless, it was the practical prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, whose Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Sino-Indian LAC reduced the tension that had persisted since the 1962 war. The agreement also led the two competing Asian nations to renounce the use of force in their settlement of the issue. Why did China agree to Rao's proposal of 'peace and tranquility'? Menon's take is that three pressing issues made Beijing's response to India positive: the Tiananmen Square massacre of its own people in 1989, the demise in 1991 of the mighty Soviet Union and the possibility of the United States of America targeting China to go the way of the USSR. The 1993 agreement seems to have succeeded in creating ""one of the most peaceful"" borders in India, the occasional pinpricks from the People's Liberation Army and the recent advent of an ""assertive Chinese policy"" notwithstanding. Trade, technology and tourism have taken precedence. Border conflicts can wait! China aside, the US was India's ""natural ally"" felt Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. His successor, Manmohan Singh, enacted the unprecedented Indo-US civil nuclear deal in 2005, giving shape to his predecessor's words and ending the 30-year US-led international nuclear and technology sanctions on New Delhi. There were hurdles galore, both internal and external, as politics reigned supreme. There emerged sharply divided opinion in Singh's team even on the eve of the announcement of the accords in his suite at Blair House, the official guest house of the US president. However, Manmohan Singh, with his ""steely resolve"", pulled it through. India did it. ""While unspoken by both partners"", Menon explains, ""China's rise was a factor that had created contiguous interests for both India and the United States."" At the end, though, a foreign policy issue had shaken the government of India in Parliament, as the domestic politics of a no-confidence motion had to be overcome. Opponents may still suggest that this apparent 'issue' is not an isolated one, but a question of the overall self-interest of the State and the future of the country. This dilemma is narrated in the book: ""On September 25, 2008, President Bush hosted a small private dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh"" (incidentally September 26 was Singh's birthday) ""in the White House for about ten persons, when the 123 Agreement was awaiting approval by the U.S. Senate. Secretary of State [Condoleeza] Rice leaned over and asked Singh when India would be ordering reactors from Westinghouse. Bush cut her off immediately and said that this was not about reactor sales but about much bigger things. Singh did not have to reply."" The importance of this anecdote stands stark when seen in the light of Menon's assessment of US policy towards India: ""to expect the U.S. government to behave differently would be unreasonable, in my estimation, as it has to follow its own calculus of U.S. interests rather than satisfy Indian desires."" True. No doubt. But then the same logic applies to India's calculus too, and in retrospect it is clear that ""The Civil Nuclear Initiative removed the detritus of the past from the bilateral relationship, opening the way for the transfer of dual-use technology and enhanced cooperation on defense."" In the South Asian context, the brutal confession that ""India-Pakistan relations are one of the few major failures of Indian foreign policy"" could, however, lead to divided opinion. Why? Because in the words of the author himself: ""Pakistan has consistently used terrorists and infiltrators against India since 1947... sent 'tribal raiders' to try to take Kashmir in 1947, infiltrators into Jammu and Kashmir in 1965, soldiers posing as mujahideen into Kargil in 1999 to occupy the heights, Khalistani terrorists into the Indian Punjab in 1980s, and the LeT and others into Jammu and Kashmir right through this period."" As if the 20th century were not enough, the ultimate happening was the 26/11 Mumbai attack and ""the incompetence that India's police and security agencies displayed in the glare of the world's television lights for full three days"". A 10-man Pakistan-based terror group massacred scores of innocent people. How can India tackle the cross-border menace from Pakistan, notwithstanding that it does not pose an ""existential threat""? Through ""dialogue"". Why? Because ""an Indian policymaker must deal with several Pakistans-with civil society, the Pakistani business community, civilian politicians, the army and the ISI, and the religious right (which extends from political parties to jihadi tanzeems)."" Not all of them share similar attitudes towards India! Menon's view is sure to be controversial. Nevertheless, a central problem emanates from failure of the United Nation's proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism to define a terrorist. On the southern front, these candid confessional words too are unlikely to be well received in certain quarters: ""It is hard to see the Indian intervention in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s as anything but an inexorable tragedy. India had very few choices, and no good ones, in 1987."" But Menon's detractors should ask themselves a few questions: how did India get from the ""non-interference"" of Panchsheel to intervention in Sri Lanka? Had India changed? If so, why? Did it help, or harm, national interest? At the end, the sheer force of the Sri Lankan State eliminated a terror outfit, though not the ideas it espoused. Regarding Menon's fifth and final foreign policy issue, the ""no first use"" doctrine regarding nuclear weapons, it appears, he writes, ""fundamentally realistic and sober"" based on a security calculus that is unique to India. India's decisions certainly can be both ""strategically bold"" and ""tactically cautious"". As many of the issues discussed in Choices have not been resolved, surely the last word is yet to be written. Nevertheless, the insight and analysis displayed by Menon are superb. Whether one agrees with the contents of his book matters little. It is a must for friends and foes alike."

He was speaking at the public meeting here on Thursday.

58f509007be9e018510a2001,80-year journey of struggle & success,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160401/jsp/odisha/story_77585.jsp,2016-04-01,"1936-1946: The first decade of Odishas separate existence as a state was under British rule. The national movement for an independent India was still continuing. Prominent leaders such as Harekrushna Mahatab, Biswanath Das, Nabakrushna Choudhury, Biju Patnaik and others had joined the struggle. The Eram firing in 1942 by the British force in Bhadrak, termed as one of the worst massacres, killed 29 freedom fighters. On the other hand, steps were also being taken for the states development under the ministry, led by Krushna Chandra Gajapati (see picture). In 1946, construction began for the Hirakud dam with the foundation stone laid by Hawthrone Lewis, the then governor of Odisha, and the Central Rice Research Institute was established in Cuttack. A major highlight in this decade was the advent of films with Sita Bibaha becoming the first Odia film released on April 28, 1936. 1947-56: Mahatab was the Odisha chief minister when India became independent in 1947. Biju Patnaiks daring act of rescuing Indonesian leaders won him admiration across the country and outside. Also, princely states merged with Odisha. The foundation stone for a new capital was laid in Bhubaneswar in 1948 and the capital of Odisha was shifted from Cuttack in 1949. Orissa High Court and All India Radio were founded in Cuttack. Biju Patnaik (see picture) donated 1,000 pounds to Unesco to institute the Kalinga Award in 1952. The Official Language Act was passed in the Assembly to introduce Odia in official work. Nabakrushna Choudhury was the chief minister from 1950 to 1956. 1957-66: This was a significant decade with big projects coming up and establishing Odishas prowess in the industrial sector. The Hirakud dam (see picture) was inaugurated and foundation stones for Paradip port and Talcher-based Thermal Power Station were laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, while the Rourkela Steel Plant also started functioning. Culture and education, too, started developing. The Odisha Sahitya Akademi and the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya were established. Also, Binod Kanungo published his incomparable work Gyanamandal  the Odia encyclopaedia. The Rourkela Engineering College (now National Institute of Technology), Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology and the Sainik School were established, while the Utkal University building was inaugurated and the VSS Medical College also began functioning in Burla. Also, the Similipal forest was declared as national park in 1957. The Odisha State Archives, Barabati Stadium and the Nandankanan Zoological Park were established and the present Odisha Legislative Assembly building was inaugurated in 1961. Mahatab had been the chief minister from 1956 to 1961 followed by brief stints by Biju Patnaik, Biren Mitra and Sadashiv Tripathy, leading to political instability.This was a significant decade with big projects coming up and establishing Odishas prowess in the industrial sector.

Mahatab had been the chief minister from 1956 to 1961 followed by brief stints by Biju Patnaik, Biren Mitra and Sadashiv Tripathy, leading to political instability. 1967-76: Natural calamities had always cast their destructive spells on Odisha. In 1972, a severe cyclone hit the state. Coalition governments found it difficult to sustain with Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo, Biswanath Das and Nandini Satpathy (see picture) becoming the chief ministers in short phases. The positives were that Berhampur and Sambalpur universities started functioning and also a naval training centre at Chilika and the Salt Water Crocodile Research Centre at Bhitarkanika were set up. 1977-86: On the political front, the decade saw initial struggle in stability with Binayak Acharya and Nilamani Routray taking charge between 1976 and 1980 after which J.B. Patnaik (see picture) emerged chief minister for two terms from 1980 to 89. Nalco in Angul and Ordnance factory at Saintala in Balangir were set up by Indira Gandhi, who also addressed her last public meeting in Bhubaneswar. The Odisha Science Academy and the Pathani Samanta Planetarium were established to boost scientific research in Odisha.On the political front, the decade saw initial struggle in stability with Binayak Acharya and Nilamani Routray taking charge between 1976 and 1980 after which J.B.

The Odisha Science Academy and the Pathani Samanta Planetarium were established to boost scientific research in Odisha. 1987-96: This decade saw the rearrangement of the 13 districts into 30. Cuttack Doordarshan started Odia newscast in 1988 that helped the state connect with the world more easily. The Bhubaneswar Stock Exchange started functioning, too. Millenium ceremony of Cuttack was celebrated. The state also caught the nations attention with the first test of ballistic missile Agni conducted at Chandipur. Sports was also in focus. As part of the initiatives, the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium was built in Cuttack. Hockey legend Dillip Tirkey (see picture) was part of the Indian team in Atlanta Olympics in 1996. After a short stint by Hemananda Biswal, stalwarts in Odisha politics, Biju Patnaik (1990-1995) and J.B. Patnaik (1995 to 1999) came to power one after another. 1997-2006: The Kargil war was a challenge for the nation during this period, but Odisha was also shaken by a political controversy like never before. The then chief minister, J.B. Patnaik, had to step down in 1999 in the wake of the Graham Staines murder and amid rumours of giving shelter to a prime accused in the rape of the estranged wife of an IFS officer. But, this year is remembered around the globe for the ferocity of the super cyclone (see picture) that spelled disaster in Odisha. The then chief minister, Giridhar Gamang, could not gain the trust of the people in the aftermath of the natural disaster and Hemananda Biswal managed only a few months in power. But, this decade was to see the emergence of the most popular leader of the state ever who would break all records in wining elections. The Biju Janta Dal was formed after Biju Patnaik died in 1997, creating a political void.That is when Naveen Patnaik took charge of a cyclone-ravaged and economically bankrupt Odisha in 2000. He continued to be in power winning the elections in 2004. This term, however, also witnessed upheavals. After the Odisha government signed an MoU with Vedanta for an alumina plant at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi in 2004 and Posco for a steel plant at Govindpur in Jagatsinghpur district in 2005, both big foreign investments turned into major controversies and the industrialisation process hit major roadblocks subsequently. The Kalinga Nagar firing that claimed 13 lives gave another jolt to the industrialisation drive. Maoist activities also increased in the state in this decade such as the R Udaygiri attack in 2006. Dillip Tirkey had become the Indian captain and played two more Olympics, while athlete Anuradha Biswal took part in the Sydney Olympic Games. Technical education also saw growth with emergence of private engineering colleges in large numbers in the state establishing Odisha as a hub for engineering students. 2007-16: Maoist menace proved to pose challenges for the Naveen government with major blasts in Nayagarh, Koraput. Later in this decade, there were abductions such as Malakangiri collector R. Vineel Krishna, MLA Jhina Hikaka and Italian tourist Paolo Bosusco in separate incidents in 2011 and 2012. The Kandhamal communal violence in 2008, mining scam that surfaced in 2009, and in the last part of the decade, the Pipili gang-rape and murder case, deposit collection scam, Nabakalebar (see picture) Brahma Paribartan controversy and nabbing of self-proclaimed godmen were some major worries for Odisha people. Also, a political coup, the more recent Dhal Samant brothers case, arrest of members of terrorist outfits and farmer suicides kept Odisha busy this decade. Posco and Vedanta protests continued for most part. But there was also some good news. On the education front, an IIT, IIM, AIIMS, NISER, IISER, National Law University and the Central University have been founded in the state boosting its academic and scientific education and research as well as medical facilities. Private health care and IT industry also saw a growth in Odisha. The name of the state was changed from Orissa to Odisha, and in 2014, Odia language received the classical language status."

The residents of open gardens are getting food grains at 40 paise per kg. Food minister Jyotipriyo Mallick today admitted the gap and said he would look into the matter. ""Workers in open tea gardens are getting food grains at the rate of 40 paise per kilo but in the closed and sick plantations, the unemployed workers, who are living amid abject poverty, are getting the same at Rs 2 per kg. It has happened because of a technical gap which, we believe, the state has failed to understand,"" an official of the state food and supplies department said on condition of anonymity. Before the food security act was implemented in tea gardens earlier this month, each resident of an open garden was receiving 3.7kg food grains a week at 40 paise per kg from the management. As NFSA was introduced, the management was asked to give the rations in some gardens, while self-help groups were given the responsibility in other gardens. The management needs to buy the food grains at Rs 2 per kg and distribute it among workers at 40 paisa per kg. It was also decided that each worker's family would receive 35kg food grains a month and the management would bear the subsidy of Rs 1.60 per kg. ""However, the state has forgotten that there is nobody to bear the subsidy of Rs 1.60 against each kg of food grains in ailing and closed gardens. The workers and their families in closed and ailing gardens have to pay Rs 2 per kg because of this technical gap,"" said a source in the state food and supplies department. As of now, there are 14 ailing tea estates of the Duncans' Goenka Group and 10 closed gardens in north Bengal. The total number of beneficiaries in the 24 gardens is around two lakh. Bappaditya Chanda, the district food controller of Alipurduar, where a number of Duncans' gardens and closed gardens are located, said: ""We have received an order where it has been mentioned that the management will bear the margin and workers will be provided with food grains at the same subsidised rate (40 paisa per kg) as they used to get earlier from the management. But nothing has been mentioned as to how the subsidy will be given in closed and sick tea estates. We have sought a clarification from senior officials."" A representative of a self-help group, formed in a Duncans garden in Alipurduar district, said if the food grains were distributed at 40 paise per kg, there was no guarantee that the state government would pay the margin money. Minister Mallick admitted that the issue had been overlooked. ""The state government is determined to keep its commitment and will provide food grains at subsidised rates to the entire tea population. In case of closed and sick tea estates, workers will receive food grains at the rate of 47 paise per kilo and the state will bear the subsidy of Rs 1.53 per kilo. We will shortly come up with a relevant notification in this regard,"" he told The Telegraph. It is not clear why the minister said the food grain would cost 47 paise per kg, while the prevailing rate is 40 paise per kg. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY OUR ALIPURDUAR CORRESPONDENT"

58f50a077be9e018510a210e,There is a new flame in the forest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/opinion/story_77293.jsp,2016-03-31,"The term, Jangalmahal, is a misnomer. On my way to Gopiballavpur from Jhargram, I spotted several bald patches in the sal forests on either side of the silken highway that snaked its way through the green canopy that is no longer dense. Bands of sunlight flooded the forest floor where trees had been felled. I was in West Midnapore to get a feel of the imminent elections. Voting would take place in six constituencies in Jangalmahal, including Gopiballavpur, Salboni and Nayagram, on April 4, the day assembly elections begin in West Bengal. Elections energize metropolitan journalists. They suddenly muster the energy to travel to remote areas in a bid to bring to public attention the gaps that exist between the State's claims of development and the bleak ground reality. Their reports, which examine the chasm between promise and delivery of Constitutional entitlements - food, shelter, education, employment - are a democracy's tool-kit to assess the performance of an elected dispensation. But I was travelling in Jangalmahal's pockets - Lodhasuli, Gopiballavpur, Nayagram, Salboni and Jamboni - with a different agenda. I wanted to understand the differences in the way development is perceived by the State and by Jangalmahal's adivasi citizens. My first stop was the Subarnarekha College in Gopiballavpur. The college, which takes its name from the river that lay dry and lifeless nearby, is spacious. But the infrastructure, especially some of the rooms meant for teachers, are small and shabby. Two teachers led me to a lecture room so that I could interact with the students. Many of them, I was told, live in distant villages and had to travel some distance to reach the college. The conversation, expectedly, started with an appraisal of the Trinamul Congress's performance in the constituency. (Chudamani Mahato of the TMC is the sitting MLA.) The students appeared to be satisfied with the condition of the roads, even though buses are not available in some parts after dusk, making commuting difficult, especially for the infirm and for patients. The girl students admitted that some of them had faced harassment - bureaucratic delays as well as insensitive remarks by officials - during their visits to panchayat offices to claim funds under the Kanyashree scheme. A super-speciality hospital has come up in Gopiballavpur (picture, below). But skilled doctors rarely take up postings here. (I visited the hospital the same evening, but could not find either the superintendent or a senior physician to corroborate the allegation.) Other places in West Midnapore have also witnessed frenetic construction activities after the near-annihilation of the Maoist movement. Metalled roads are no longer a dream. Lalgarh, over 60 kilometres away from Gopiballavpur, now has a polytechnic institute as well as a training centre for nurses. Nayagram and Salboni have received new colleges and stadiums and have also been promised modern healthcare. Yet, it was evident that the first glimpses of the State's version of the development process have not weakened the resolve of some segments of adivasi society to express their anxieties concerning the survival of their identity and of indigenous culture. Santhali had been included in the Eighth Schedule years ago (2003). The students voiced their anger with the government's neglect of local dialects and scripts. (The manifesto of the TMC is available in Alchiki though.) The State's attempts to revive vanishing performance arts traditions were also dismissed as elitist and cosmetic. A student who had participated in the Jangalmahal Utsav admitted that she had found the experience of performing on a concrete stage quite alienating. There were also complaints of interventions on the part of the organizers that had led to scripts and performances losing their authenticity during the extravaganza. Their experience of cultural alienation reopens an older debate concerning the reorganization of states. Purulia, which was carved out of adivasi-dominated Manbhum, was made a part of West Bengal. The students were critical of not just the apathy that is causing the slow death of languages but also the government's neglect of heritage structures. Interestingly, not all of these mansions are built by rulers from the adivasi community. In Jhargram, where I was based, I had been struck by the effort - a joint initiative between the state government and the resident royal family- to restore the rajbari. But Chilkigarh palace and the ancient temples on its premises - they can be reached after a brief trek through a forest that was alive with the calls of playful langurs - lie in a state of ruin (picture, below). My conversations with the respondents - students, villagers and activists - made it apparent that a fine line still separates the people from the State. For instance, the former held back from welfare projects that do not complement adivasi sensibilities. Some among them have also begun to differentiate between fundamental rights and political allowances. The cynicism of the students towards subsidized food grain, as opposed to their popularity in Amlasole, is a case in point. Equally telling was the propensity to perceive the manifestations of State welfare - especially the cultural festivals - as dubious initiatives to pollute and co-opt the remaining segments of a shrinking society that has resisted adulteration by modernity. The anxiety is emblematic of the state of siege - real and imagined - that pervades the community's consciousness. The willingness of Jangalmahal's tribal people to insulate - fortify is a better term - themselves from some kinds of State intervention probably stems from a heightened awareness of the pitfalls of identity politics. Adivasi identity was the plinth that supported the Lalgarh movement that had initially been led by the Peoples' Committee Against Police Atrocities. But its appropriation by the Maoists, and, later, its disintegration under political and military pressure has made the community wary of institutional efforts to revive indigenous culture. These tensions are inevitable, given the State's refusal to view development as a layered, but organically linked, idea that brings with it not just motorable roads, schools and hospitals but also helps nurture the fraying links between a community and its culture. From Gopiballavpur, I headed for Nayagram, near the border with Odisha. The landscape changed dramatically. The pucca road turned into a dirt track; agricultural fields gave way to shrub land; only the thinning forest remained unchanged. (The forest officials I met later attributed their inability to check felling to the lack of manpower and funds as well as the nexus between the political establishment and the timber mafia.) In Bihankuria village, I had expected the adivasi families to talk about such measures as the provision of 35 kilogrammes of rice at two rupees or the decision to raise the price of kendu leaves. Instead, the animated discussion turned towards the falling water table, the disappearance of local trees such as piyal, the proliferation of the eucalyptus, and sand mining that has ravaged the Subarnarekha. The ecological crisis in Jangalmahal has gone unrepresented in the political manifestos of all contending parties. Before I left the village, I was given mahua fruits that were being dried. I asked my host if this was a ritual associated with departure. He laughed and said that this was not a gift, but a relic. If I were to visit him again, he was not sure if I would find the mahua trees. I was expected to visit Jamboni and Binpur the following day. As I made my way back from Nayagram, I wondered whether the day's conversations were indicative of an emerging charter of development, one which was far more holistic than the model that has been imposed upon the people by the State. Health and education are priorities. So is employment. Data from the government suggest that over 30,000 people from Jangalmahal have found employment not in industry or agriculture but within the various tiers of the robust security apparatus that is still in place. (I was asked to produce my identity papers twice by the Central Reserve Police Force during my sojourn.) The devastation that has been wrought in Jangalmahal's environment and culture certainly registers in the people's engagement with the idea of development. Whether this consciousness is new remains unclear to me. It could be that the adivasi notion of progress is inherently inclusive. It could also be that education and improved connectivity with the city have brought about a sharpening of perception regarding their own needs. Or that the issues raised by the 'bon party' - the term used to describe Maoists - such as the community's rights over natural resources, linger in public memory. But I did get the impression that Jangalmahal has decided to renew its faith in the democratic apparatus, its limitations notwithstanding, in a bid to negotiate its demands with the State. The armed insurrection, and its crippling consequences, continue to haunt the people. The bon party's ideology and tactic stand discredited. The forest seemed to agree with my thoughts. On a road bathed in the falling light, I noticed the fire lines that had been lit by the forest department shimmering among the trees. Yet this was not the fire that had threatened to burn down the forest. This was a new kind of fire, a flickering flame, that had set the forest alight."

Shuja Pasha had admitted shortly after the Mumbai attacks in 2008, says former Pakistani Ambassador to the U.S. Husain Haqqani. The revelation, which appears in a forthcoming book on India-Pakistan relations, recounts the visit by General Pasha to Washington on December 24-25, 2008, where he made the startling admission.At the end of his meetings with his CIA counterpart Gen. Michael Hayden, General Pasha had reportedly visited Mr. Haqqani at the ambassadors residence. Pasha said to me  Log hamaray thay, operation hamara nahin thha , Mr. Haqqani writes in the book  India vs Pakistan: Why Cant We Just Be Friends?Speaking to T he Hindu over the telephone from Washington, Mr. Haqqani said Gen. Pasha had also told Gen. Hayden that retired military officers and retired intelligence officers had been involved in the planning of the attacks.The conversation between the chiefs of the ISI and CIA has been recounted in three books earlier  by then U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice in her memoirs, Bob Woodward in his book  Obama Wars  and earlier this year by Gen. Hayden himself in his autobiography, P laying to The Edge . However, this is the first time Gen. Pashas words corroborating the ISI link have been recorded by a Pakistani official.No prosecutionAccording to Mr. Haqqani, the link was confirmed by the fact that Pakistans government never prosecuted the accused.The fact that we never pursued the case against the accused [officers] in the 26/11 case despite all the evidence that had been provided: not just by India, but by the U.S., by the American NSA including intercepts of conversations during the attacks, that pointed a finger at us, at the Pakistan government, he said.According to Mr. Haqqani, who faced charges of treason in Pakistan in 2011 after the military accused him of writing a Memo to the U.S. government on the Osama Bin Laden killing, the Armys denial of any link to the 26/11 attacks was of a piece with their stand on other strikes all the way from the 1980s to Dawood Ibrahim."
58f50a3f7be9e018510a214b,Golden yields,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/opinion/story_77294.jsp,2016-03-31,"The recent budget talked about the government's plan to double farm incomes in the next five years. This will be done through investments in rural infrastructure, especially irrigation. About 50 per cent of land under foodgrain production in India is irrigated. This means that half of the foodgrain producing land in India faces weather uncertainties and, hence, those working on them face annual (seasonal) variations in income. These variations could be huge - from bumper harvests to complete wipe-outs if there is a flood or drought. Irrigation will at least mitigate the effects of a drought. Floods, however, can wreak havoc on both irrigated and unirrigated lands. The best interpretation of the government's promise, therefore, is one of doubling, in five years' time, the income earned by the farmer in a normal year. The Indian landmass has been historically described as highly fertile. However, if we are to compare India's land productivity with that of other countries, the picture is quite dismal. India ranks 27 in rice yield, behind Brazil and China and 19 in wheat yield, behind China and South Africa. There is, thus, a lot of scope in improving Indian yields; indeed, if India could reach Chinese yield rates, we need only half of the current land devoted to rice to produce what we are producing now. Irrigation will certainly go a long way in getting us there. However, public irrigation alone will not work. It also needs other inputs like fertilizers, seeds, labour and farm equipment. Farmers would also need better storage and marketing systems to move the produce off the farm and get the farmers sufficient value for their crops. All of these are costly and the farmers will need to have access to, and be able to afford the costs of, these complementary inputs. The recent budget does mention these though it is not clear how these would be addressed. The budget does talk of a uniform and modified Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act that states will be encouraged to pass. Such an act has been in the offing for quite some time now but, like the goods and services tax, all the states are not yet on board. If the problem was simply a technological and marketing issue, and the government over the next few years delivered on its commitment, the budget promise could materialize. Unfortunately, focusing on agriculture alone may actually reduce, rather than increase, farmer incomes. Increasing agricultural output will lead to a fall in prices. This fall in prices is often more than the increase in yield, leading to a fall in the revenue (price times quantity) and hence, income, to the farmer. This is especially true for foodgrains which suffer from what economists refer to as inelastic demand. This can be arrested somewhat by introducing minimum support prices for each type of crop. For the MSP to be effective, it has to be above the market price. The government will then procure at the MSP but release the produce to the market at a lower price. This will mean an increased subsidy bill. The MSP also has the added problem of distorting crop choice on land. This is evident in the falling water table experiences of Punjab which has become a major paddy producing area though it is, traditionally, not a paddy-producing region. Earlier, we stated that if India reaches China's yield rates, we will need only half the land that we now devote to rice in India. If the farmers on the other half of the land did not produce any rice, then the income of those continuing to produce rice, on land with China's yield rates, will indeed double. Herein lies the crux of the solution the government needs to work out to double farm incomes. We need to reduce the number of farmers, the amount of land cultivated and the number of landless labourers working in agriculture. The latest census tells us that more than 55 per cent of workers are either cultivators or agricultural labourers (sometimes both). Coupled with the observation that agriculture and allied activities (which is more than farming) contribute 17 per cent to the gross domestic product, it is not very difficult to understand why agriculturalists as a class are at the bottom of the heap in India. For those whose full-time economic activity is in agriculture, the most important asset is land. Ambedkar, writing as far back as 1918, had warned us of dire consequences if people were not taken out of agriculture. At that time, the British were held responsible for India's deindustrialization and forcing people back on to the land. Since land was the only valuable asset for a large proportion of the population, it was also the most important inheritance. Ambedkar was worried that, unless succeeding generations had other economic activities to turn to, land would continue to get sub-divided and fragmented and the farmers' lot would go from bad to worse with the passage of time. During Ambedkar's time, 71 per cent of the Indian population was in agriculture but many European countries also had more than 50 per cent of the population similarly occupied. If we are to assume that all households had the same size (number of members) and the same number of workers, then 71 per cent of the population will mean that 71 per cent of the workers were involved in agriculture around 1918. After about 100 years since Ambedkar's warning, close to 70 of which has been without the British in charge, we have reduced the dependence on agriculture to one where 57 per cent of the workers are either cultivators or agricultural labourers. So, we still have a huge pressure on land and it is getting worse by the day. This is because of two facts: (a) we have a growing population and (b) we are not adding new land to our land mass. The average holding in India in 1970-71 was 2.29 hectares; in 2010-11 it fell to 1.15 hectares. In 40 years, or in roughly two plus generations, the average farmer has half the land to cultivate. India describes its farmers as marginal (owning less than one hectare), small (between one and two hectares), semi-medium (between two and four hectares), medium (between four and 10 hectares) and large (above 10 hectares). In these 40 years, the number of marginal farmers have increased by 156 per cent, small by 84 per cent and semi-medium by 30 per cent. The numbers of medium and large farmers have fallen by 26 per cent and 65 per cent. And, the average holding in each of these categories has fallen, respectively, by 4, 1, 3, 5 and 4 per cent. In short, agriculture may not be the place where the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer. Focusing on agriculture alone to better the plight of farmers could become a lost cause. Since the amount of the productive asset owned by an individual is falling over time, the income earned by each owner is also decreasing. To arrest this decline, these owners must be given other productive assets, like education and skill and, of course, good health. This will enable them to sell off their land and move into other economic activities. Only then will those remaining in agriculture be able to earn higher incomes through higher yields. Otherwise, we will spend public money, increase yield and see our farm incomes continue to diminish. The author is Research Director, India Development Foundation"
58f50b52a3d24b0b70c1c98f,The price of populism in Tamil Nadu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-price-of-populism-in-tamil-nadu/article8511112.ece,2016-04-23,"The food is good. The place is clean. Actually, I prefer the cleanliness over the menu, P. Divaraj chuckles. The real reason Im here is because its the end of the month and Im running out of money. A 10-minute walk from his office to Amma Unavagam on Santhome High Road in Chennai and all it cost Mr. Divaraj, a software professional, was Rs.15 for a midday meal of curd rice, sambar rice and lemon rice.The canteen, inaugurated by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on February 19, 2013, was the first Amma Unavagam to be opened in the State. On a good day, says canteen supervisor S. Santhisree, its 16 staff members serve between 4,500 and 5,000 meals. There was even a time when the outlet would serve up to 7,000 meals a day. It came down when we stopped giving out parcels. People used to buy 10, 20 meals at a time and we had to turn many away, she says.Lunch, served between 12 and 3 p.m., is the busiest time of the day. Lemon and karuveppilai (curry leaves) rice are served on alternate days, sambar and curd are permanent fixtures; servings of 350 grams cost five rupees each. Breakfast, which usually sees 1,500 idlis and 150 plates of pongal served, is served from 7 to 10 a.m. Idlis go at one rupee each, pongal at five rupees. Things are calmer come dinner time: 500 chapattis  three rupees gets you two chapattis  and 3.5 kg dal suffice.Friday may not have been a good day. I think the heat is keeping people away, Ms. Santhisree says, constantly glancing at the timepiece behind the serving counter: one in the afternoon, when offices in the area begin their lunch breaks, had gone by. Queues of three and four keep forming outside the window where she sits, accepting cash in advance. Patrons wipe sweat off their brow as they bend over steaming rice in the tiles hall. Even as they eat, a large flat-screen television in the background beams exhortations of actors and sportsmen  ambassadors of the Election Commission to vote in the upcoming Assembly elections.There are the regulars such as Mariaselvi, a sweeper with the Chennai Corporation, who has dropped in for lunch after completing her shift. And there are seasonal patrons such as Mr. Divaraj.The clockwork precision of Amma Unavagams is a testament to how ostensibly populist government schemes end up positively impacting the common mans life. Framing welfare as the distribution of public and club goods  be it Amma canteens, subsidised salt, or goods such as grinders and mixers which have been distributed during the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) regime as also similar initiatives during the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) regime  helps it reach the people beyond sectional interests. The efficiency of the delivery of goods and services in both the regimes has been very high.Competitive populism, however, has a flip side to it, and its practice across the political divide in Tamil Nadu  along with the personality-driven politics of both AIADMK and DMK  has stunted the evolution of a genuine liberal democracy in the State. Formal aspects of a liberal democracy are adequately institutionalised, but the substantive aspect of choice and differentiation that is facilitated by difference in ideological and political positions is increasingly becoming a chimera.A differentiation lost in timeIt was not always like this in the past. From the very beginning, the AIADMK, under the leadership of popular actor and long-serving Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, used benevolent patronage and a pro-poor posturing as its calling card. The AIADMK has retained patronage  a form of governance where its political support is based on transactions between the client (the people) and the patron (the party in power)  to ensure support for itself. These transactions were either public goods and welfare in the form of subsidies that are not targeted, or club goods and services to clients across communities. Patronage politics had enabled the AIADMK to cater to large sections among Tamil Nadus poor and the MGR appeal, burnished through his well-spread fan associations, owed itself to the efficacy of this system.The DMK, on the other hand, was more of a cadre- and agenda-driven organisation that emphasised the need for a circulation of elites from middle castes and communities while empowering the state bureaucracy to implement public welfare. The DMK initiated a series of reforms based on affirmative actions that have had significant impacts in Tamil Nadu society over the years. The DMKs turn to benevolent populism or its strategy to also indulge in what is called the freebie culture was something new, adopted only in the late 2000s in order to emulate the AIADMK.Almost a decade of such patronage politics and populism of this kind has meant that there is virtually no political distinction between the DMK and the AIADMK. In fact, what distinguishes and differentiates the two is the leadership of the parties and the animus that they share for each other. The consequence of this form of competition is the reduction of the political contest to one of persona and leadership rather than issues and policies.Third front or more of the same?Even the emergence of a viable third front  with the coming together of the Peoples Welfare Front (PWF), the actor Vijayakant-led Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), and the Tamil Maanila Congress led by G.K. Vasan  ahead of the Assembly elections is unlikely to alter the picture substantially. The PWF, a more cohesive grouping which includes the Tamil nationalist Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a party representing a Dalit core in the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the Leftist forces in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India, seeks to present a progressive, programmatic alternative to the two Dravidian parties.But its dependence upon the DMDK and the projection of Vijayakant as its chief ministerial candidate has on the one hand shored up the possibility of a viable accretion of votes for the front and on the other hand reduced the significance of the PWFs differentiation.If the manifestos, the policy statements and the ideological positioning (or the lack of it) of these dominant players are considered, what emerges is the lack of a distinct differentiation.There is little to differentiate between the AIADMK, the DMK and the DMDK (or for that matter, the MDMK on economic and social issues that matter to the Tamil Nadu electorate) if one considers the left-right ideological/progressive-conservative social spectrums to place these parties.What is common to these parties is their insistence on populism, leader (and associated family) supremacy which entails the subsuming of the image of the party, its organisation and its political positions to the persona and authority of its supremo. Their political appeals are directed to all segments of society in varying degrees and there lacks a clear differentiator in respective support bases based on cleavages in society.The DMDK has not sought to stay away from the politics of populism either. In fact, its manifesto for the 2016 elections only takes the culture of patronage to an absurd degree. Competitive populism and the promise of patronage on coming to power remain the dominant mode of public engagement.The flip side of populismTo a certain degree, competitive populism, as the Amma canteens show, is not necessarily antithetical to public interest. But the flip side is the lack of intervention by the state to address social and economic inequities which cannot be simply wished away by patronage. Patronage- and personality-driven politics also bring along with them the problem of corruption. It reduces the electorate as passive recipients of welfare, who use elections as sites of transactions (social bribes). It is no wonder that the authoritarian attitudes of select leaders and dynastic nature of the Dravidian parties are taken for granted even by the electorate. This has reduced democracy to a shell in Tamil Nadu and does not augur well for a liberal democratic order.There is also the fiscal impact of distribution and subsidy programmes that leave little for the state to spend in productive and long-lasting investment that could transform the economy. Persisting grievances and lack of differentiation have resulted in the Dravidian parties taking turns in government despite the efficiency of patronage. That in itself should be a signal to the parties to shed patronage as the only manner of governance and political culture. As things stand, this does not seem possible at least in this round of Assembly elections.srinivasan.vr@thehindu.co.indeepu.sebastian@thehindu.co.inThe efficiency of delivery of goods and services cannot wish away the lack of intervention by the state to address inequities"

58f50b887be9e018510a2272,Grain for all after card snag,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160209/jsp/bengal/story_68313.jsp,2016-02-09,"Mamata Banerjee Calcutta, Feb. 8: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee today delinked digital ration cards from access to cheap foodgrain, seeking to quell discontent that was beginning to boil but prompting concerns whether the stocks available for the time being could keep pace with the resultant surge in demand. Lakhs of complaints had started to pour in from the districts that faulty cards were standing in the way of the scheme under the National Food Security Act, launched in the state on January 27. According to norms, digitised ration cards, commonly known as NFSA cards, are mandatory to claim subsidised foodgrain after the launch of the scheme. We could distribute 82 per cent of the cards so far and a few cards are faulty. All those who have the cards, who have applied for the cards and those who are yet to apply for the cards would get subsidised rice. We will correct the mistakes in the cards later, Mamata said at Nabanna today. Those who did not have the cards or who have faulty cards can claim the foodgrain from their ration shops by producing old ration cards, the chief minister added. But the move, officials said, could leave ration dealers as well as district-level officers vulnerable to a backlash if cheap rice is not supplied to all. Bengal had 6.01 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA. Each will get 5kg of foodgrain a month at Rs 2 a kg. In addition to the Centres count, the state had decided to bring another 1.49 crore people under the scheme, taking the total beneficiaries to 7.5 crore. This will entail an expenditure of over Rs 4,200 crore from the exchequer. Sources said the chief minister decided not to make the digital cards mandatory for now after she realised the snags potential to hurt her in rural areas ahead of elections. At least four lakh complaints have come in from the districts that people are not getting cheap rice because of faulty cards as soon as the NFSA was launched. Such grievances usually turn into big expressions of discontent. The chief minister did not take any chance, said an official. Sources said the controversy over distribution of BPL cards during the Left Front tenure was at the back of Mamatas mind while taking the decision allowing cheap rice for all. The officials are now worried whether the relaxation would cause chaos. According to sources, initially it was decided that about 7 crore people will get rice and wheat at Rs 2 a kg and another 50 lakh would get foodgrain at half the market price and the remaining 1.7 crore holders of regular ration cards would not get any subsidy on foodgrain. This could have been implemented based on the digitised ration cards. Now there could be trouble if everyone claims foodgrain at Rs 2 a kg, said a district magistrate. Ideally, the state should have waited a month after distributing the digitised cards to launch the scheme, the officials said."

The officer also requested the DGP to reconsider their postings to the civil supplies-CID.""All our batch mates have been promoted to inspectors and we are to assume charge. But, because of this issue, we are unable to do so,"" one of the woman officer posted to the civil supplies department said on the condition of anonymity.

The agency said it had also separately developed 21 varieties using Bt gene. Among these, the best are planned to made be available by 2018 for Rs150/kg.Four days days ago, Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh held a meeting to discuss the scenario if Monsanto carried out its threat to quit. The meeting also had representatives from the Bt cotton industry apart from research scientists from CICR. The institute is country's premier government research agency for cotton.CICR in its presentation to the ministry stated that the desi variety, Gossypium arboreum, originated from India and was being grown since thousands of years. It was tolerant to water logging, pests, highly suitable for non-irrigated areas, and ideal to combat effects of climate change. It also had lower cost of production, needed less fertilizer and was suitable for organic farming having a better ginning ratio compared American hybrids, CICR said.After the BJP came to power, the RSS and its allied organisations like Swadeshi Jagraan Manch have been strongly lobbying against genetically modified crops. Last year, field trials for gentically modified varieites of chickpea, maize, rice and cotton were put on hold by the Maharashtra government following questions raised by these organisations which had to be satisfied first. The researchers have already allayed their fears. Other farm activists have also been blaming Bt for farmers' suicides.CICR suggested that a separate minimum support price (MSP) should be fixed for the desi cotton. The rate had to be more than that available for the same staple length of American variety. The Cotton Corporation of India should have a special procurement scheme apart from starting a drive on Make in India.THe agency submitted a list of 12 purely Indian varieties of non-Bt cotton varieties saying these were best suited for Indian conditions being drought and pest resistant. They had longer staple length and were better than the Bt variety, CICR representatives told the meeting. ""A field test of the varieties will be held in 21 locations throughout the country. This is being done to ascertain which region a specific variety will be best suited to,"" said Dr Keshav Kranthi, director of CICR.Originally Indian cotton had short staple due to which the American variety was preferred. Over the years, longer staple indigenous varieties have been developed.The indigenous varieties mooted by CICR were developed during the last 10 years. Around eight varieties with 27 to 30cm staple length were developed in the last decade and those having a length of 30 to 32cm were developed recently.Monsanto entered the Indian market with Bt cotton in 2002 and currently its second version Bollgard II is available. There are plans to launch Bollgard III too. The company changed the very dynamics of cotton cultivation. Bt seed gave a higher yield due to its resistance to bollworm pest that takes a major toll on cotton crop. It also led to an increase in cost of production. Recently, the government recommended a cut in the royalty charged by Monsanto that led to the multinational threatening to withdraw from Indian market."

And over the years rice has been effectively used in the successive elections platforms of both DMK and the AIADMK. With the AIADMK government adopting universal subsidization of rice, the state has around 33,222 public distribution system (PDS) outlets as yet. This despite the fact that the Centre has been incurring hefty losses in procuring rice, wheat and other essential commodities at prices decided by the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices and supplying these to the state governments at highly discounted prices. Further there have been rampant complaints on the quality of items supplied under PDS and that only a small section of people above poverty line avails them. The system also faces a threat of PDS stocks being diverted to the open market.When the UPA government introduced the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 34 states and Union territories fell in line; but not Kerala and Tamil Nadu. These states continued to draw rice and wheat from the Centre at heavily subsidised prices, but sold them on their own terms. Tamil Nadu, for instance, supplied 35 kg of rice free and at `3 per kg for additional supplies to the Antyodaya Anna Yojana card holders. For another 18.63 lakh BPL cardholders, it supplied 20 kg of rice free and additional supplies at `5.65 per kg. For those above poverty line, the state sold rice at `8.30 per kg. The state had a total of around 2 crore cardholders.In the face of such delinquencies, the Centre's recent decision to hike the price of subsidized rice meant for APL families in TN came as a bold step. It is estimated that Tamil Nadu would have had to bear an additional cost of `2,700 crore if it continued to provide subsidised rice to all ration card holders under its existing scheme. The Centre's revision would have further inflated the already hefty food subsidy bill of the state. But the Centre is also in a severe resource crunch -a higher quantum of devolution as per the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission , increase in salaries and pensions as per the 7th Pay Commission, and a decelerated growth in tax revenues demand a sharper focus on subsidies.To avoid the additional cost, the state government has agreed to adhere to NFSA, but with certain modifications.

In the TN's budget three items -salaries and pensions to government employees, subsidies on various welfare measures and debt servicing -cost higher than the total annual revenue receipts.The state mobilises additional resources through public debt and access to multilateral institutions like the World Bank.

Here, he discusses the key issues in Tamil Nadu elections with Deepa H. Ramakrishnan.There is an opinion that freebies are unnecessary. But your manifesto has manyThe Chief Minister works on the logic that if certain necessities are provided without cost, the savings from that will be available for other expenses. The free 20 kg rice scheme, for instance, helps keep the State starvation-free.Similarly, the free laptop scheme has marked the beginning of a revolution. What was considered a rich mans possession is now available in a poor mans house. Once they get the hang of it, they will be better qualified and that will pave the way for more job opportunities.The Opposition alleges that the government was responsible for the floods in Chennai, and that Ms. Jayalalithaa did not meet people after the floods. Many people in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Cuddalore are yet to get flood relief. What is the partys view on this?The common man knows that it was an act of God. Rainfall usually recorded over a period of three months was received in just one day.Flood relief was carried out on a war-footing. People were moved to safer places; food, shelter and medicines were provided; and communicable diseases were prevented. Officials have enumerated those who are yet to get relief. But since the election notification came into force, we couldnt do anything. Immediately after the formation of the government, the Chief Minister will ensure that the relief reaches all.It is not correct to say she does not meet the public. During the floods, the CM was directing and monitoring flood relief measures 24x7. The actual physical work has to be done by a workforce and that was being overseen by officials and ministers and her. .Congress leader P. Chidambaram has levelled the charge that the AIADMK is the BJPs B team in Delhi and the BJP is your B team in Tamil Nadu Our partys policy has been constructive opposition and our support in Parliament has been issue-based. Issues that are beneficial for Tamil Nadu get our support and whichever affects our interests either directly or indirectly, we totally oppose. There is no A or B team in this.Freebies like 20 kg rice and laptop have a sound economic logic"

58f50dd77be9e01a17c91a41,Even Cambodia's dead prefer dollars,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Even-Cambodias-dead-prefer-dollars/articleshow/51773936.cms,2016-04-11,"One recent morning, Suon Sokhum, a colonel in the Cambodian army, was shopping for gifts for his ancestors.Qingming, the annual festival to honor the dead, was coming up, and throughout the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, people burn offerings to provide for their ancestors in the spirit world.At a stall on the southern fringe of one of the city's oldest markets, he browsed votive wares ranging from traditional red candles to glossy Lexus sport utility vehicles made of cardboard, finally settling on several sets of paper clothing and four neat stacks of replica $100 bills.Col. Suon Sokhum paid for the presents in local currency, the riel, but said he would never consider offering riel to his ancestors. They, like ghosts and spirits throughout Cambodia, prefer dollars.""It's too small,"" he said of the riel, which trades around 4,000 to a dollar. ""I want a bigger note. If we give the big note, the ancestors can get a lot of money. If we give them small money, they will need so many notes that they'll go crazy carrying them around.""So on the holiday this week, along with cardboard cars, cellphones and other supplies their ancestors might need, Cambodians burned millions of fake U.S. dollars, much to the chagrin of the government.The government has been trying to wean the economy off dollars, which are used here in tandem with the riel. Riel are usually used for small purchases, and dollars for most other things.The national bank has provided incentives for making deposits in riel and has waged a yearslong public relations campaign to promote its wider adoption.Still, many people prefer to keep dollars, wary of the volatility of local currency from years of war and political instability.And the biggest holdout may be the spirit world, where the dollar is king.""It's an indication that no one, even the dead, apparently, thinks the riel is regarded in high esteem,"" said Sophal Ear, an associate professor of diplomacy and world affairs at Occidental College, in Los Angeles, who has studied dollarization in Cambodia.He said he had vivid memories of burning spirit money with his family as a child. ""It's a kind of wire transfer to the afterworld,"" he said.At the Kambol graveyard on the outskirts of Phnom Penh last weekend, the air smelled of smoke and roasted pigs, and charred bits of dollars and the occasional euro littered the grass.""The dollar is valuable, so that's why we pay in U.S. currency,"" said Heng Panhawat, a clerk for a law firm, as he and his children tossed stacks of American currency, a fake jade bracelet and a paper iPhone 5 into the flames.""When I was young, we just paid respect to ancestors with gold paper and did not burn paper money, but now society has changed,"" he said. ""When something is valuable on the market, we buy it and burn it for the ancestors.""As economic development has taken hold here and Cambodians have more disposable income than ever before, the tastes of ancestor spirits have taken a turn for the luxurious.While in the past they drank traditional rice wine, they now crave imported beer and Hennessy cognac. As bigger and bigger SUVs have choked the streets of Phnom Penh, the spirits have developed a penchant for black Range Rovers driven by chauffeurs.The cars may appear to be cheap cardboard facsimiles, but that does not diminish their utility in the spirit world, which is believed to be a reflection of this one. In exchange for burning the goods, the descendants believe, they will be enriched in kind.Khao Sophy, who sells votive goods at the market, said preferences among the spirits clearly mirrored the tastes of her human customers. Over the past few years, for example, credit cards have been introduced, and houses have become bigger. As she spoke, a prospective buyer was fussing over the square footage of the paper mansions on display.""I'm going to shop around,"" the woman said. ""I need some garden space.""As recently as the early 1990s, ancestor spirits were happy to receive gold bars, crepe paper painted gold, to pay for their otherworldly purchases.But as dollars flooded the country during the United Nations protectorate from 1992 to 1993, ancestor spirits began to evince a preference for U.S. currency, especially $100 bills.Those who died before the fall of the Khmer Rouge government in 1979 still like gold bars, while younger spirits want dollars.Ty Song, a government agronomist, was sitting on a tarp in front of his mother-in-law's grave as his family prepared a host of offerings: the ubiquitous roast baby pig, a platter of jasmine buds, cans of beer and condensed milk, plump grapes and longan fruits, homemade noodles, pork and eggs stewed in palm sugar, a cage of live birds, and a three-story paper mansion with an Audi parked out front and a grinning butler popping out of the door.Although the paper goods are burned, the food is usually left out and later consumed by the family, while the birds are set free to create luck.To accompany this were stacks of fake $100 bills and a fake Cambodian passport, stamped with visas allowing the bearer to travel to Australia, France, Japan and the Netherlands. A realistic boarding pass for a flight from Taipei to Sapporo was tucked inside.Ty Song noted that, unlike riel, dollars are widely accepted around the world and can be easily converted to other currencies at money-changing stalls, making it easier for ancestor spirits to travel abroad, a luxury that many Cambodians are beginning to enjoy.""For dollars, it's easy to spend them and easy to save them,"" he explained. ""If we give them riel, it will be hard for them to convert it into dollars and spend it anywhere they go, but if we give them dollars they can spend it anywhere."""

It has acquired RH Agro 's rice mill in Sonipat, Haryana, for Rs 70 crore and has taken four other rice mills across the country on exclusive lease, which will help it launch 18 packaged rice brands by the end of this month.At present, Patanjali sells three variants of packaged rice  silver, gold and diamond. It meets its procurement needs by buying finished rice and packaging it at its Haridwar facility. The new mills will not only give the FMCG company the capability of producing 3.2 lakh tonnes of finished rice a year from paddy but will also allow it to produce region-specific rice variants that it plans to sell locally and export as well.""The acquisition will give us technical know-how in rice processing,"" said Acharya Balkrishna, MD of Patanjali Ayurved. ""We have partnered with thousands of rice farmers in many regions of the country to produce traditional variants.""Other than the mill in Sonipat, which will process basmati, Patanjali has leased two mills in Madhya Pradesh to process the pusa variety. Another mill in Telangana will produce the lightweight aromatic sona masuri to cater to markets in the south, while a mill in Fazilka, Punjab will process rice grains that are grown in the north. Around 150 varieties of rice are currently grown in the country, industry estimates showed.Patanjali, known for its best-selling products such as cow's ghee and ayurvedic toothpaste Dant Kanti, has drawn up an ambitious strategy to disrupt India's packaged rice market, which is currently dominated by brands such as India Gate, Kohinoor, Best Basmati and Daawat.

And age is the main factor determining amount of sleep.The research is based on data collected through the free smartphone app Entrain, launched in 2014 to help users fight jetlag.Scientists asked some 6,000 people, aged 15 and older, to send anonymous data about sleep, wake-up and lighting environment, enabling the scientists to obtain a large amount of data about sleep patterns worldwide.The app also asks users to input information about their ages, gender, countries and time zones.Sleep is driven by an internal circadian clock, a cluster of 20,000 nerve cells the size of a grain of rice located behind the eyes, and adjusted according to the amount of light captured, especially natural light.The average amount of sleep in the world varies from a minimum of seven hours 24 minutes in Singapore and Japan to a maximum of eight hours 12 minutes in the Netherlands, the study found.Although a difference of 48 minutes may seem inconsequential, a lack of sleep for half an hour can have significant effects on cognitive function and health, the researchers said.People who need sleep suffer a reduction in their cognitive abilities without really being conscious of it, the new study says.Health concernImpaired sleep presents an immediate and pressing threat to human health, it says.A recent report by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention found one in three American adults is not sleeping the recommended minimum of seven hours.Chronic lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, according to the CDC.The new study also found that women sleep 30 minutes longer than men on average by going to bed earlier and rising later, and that people exposed longer to natural light every day often go to bed earlier.

The drinking water scheme was not implemented properly, due to which many parts of this constituency continue to face water scarcity.The closure of railway level crossings at Mulluvadi Gate  Anaimedu area and at Ponnammapettai leads to frequent traffic bottlenecks in these areas.

No effort has been taken so far in this direction.Mr. Rajendran, who represented the now defunct Panamarathupatti constituency for one term, is highlighting these problems and assures completion of the IT Park works. He also highlights the promises made in the DMK manifesto on setting up Textile Park, introduction of milk in the noon-meal, free power supply for the powerloom and handloom weavers, subsidy for the purchase of autos etc.The DMK men also claim that Mr. Rajendran is having a good personal rapport with Mr. Stalin, and this will enable him to bring many development and welfare schemes to the constituency in the case of DMK forming the government after elections.The AIADMK party men claim credit for various schemes introduced in the constituency. But the DMDK men claim that the various new buildings, sinking of 80 borewells, construction of community halls, waiting hall at the super speciality hospital etc were all done by Mr. Mohanraj from his MLA fund, without the cooperation of the government authorities.R. Devodass, a former MP and TMC nominee, depends on the good work done by him as a MP of Salem constituency from 1996-98. He assures overall development of the constituency in all fronts.The Union Ministers M. Venkaiah Naidu and Suresh Prabhu campaigned for the BJP candidate R. P. Gopinath.The PMK candidate Kadir Ramachandran is involved in house to house canvassing of votes and is banking on the majority Vannia community vote bank. Among all the poll manifestos, it is the PMK manifesto which is hailed by the voters, he says. He assures steps for easing the traffic congestion."

As many as 11 travel grants to scientists and students, and 56 merit scholarships to undergraduate students of PAU and Gadvasu (Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University) were awarded on the occasion. Besides, one team award was bestowed on Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Patiala, for excellence in transfer of technology. On the occasion, PAU alumnus Dr Khush (father of the rice revolution); PAU vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon; former vice-chancellors Dr Khem Singh Gill and Dr Manjit Singh Kang; and Gadvasu vice-chancellor Dr AS Nanda were present.Padma Bhusham awardee Dr Sardara Singh Johl, chancellor, Central University, Bhatinda; who was invited for a guest lecture on 'Socio-Economic Stress in Rural Sector: Some Policy Options', said: ""There is a need to generate employment by spreading industry in the rural areas of Punjab, as two-third of the operational farms are under stress in Punjab. They do generate enough income and gainful employment, are capital starved, cannot meet social and economic needs, are incapable of making investments, cannot adopt improved technology, cannot afford good education and health benefits, and thus the farm workers indulge in drugs out of frustration. Farmer suicides are also a matter of concern."" Suggesting creation of simple support complexes, like playgrounds in villages, and libraries with good books, Dr Johl also underlined the need for developing farm-level entrepreneurship, and encouraging the 'hub and spoke system' of production, processing, and marketing. ""These policy options will give regular employment and income to farmers and their families, leading to low diversion of loans,"" he added.Dr Khush, while congratulating the students, said: ""You are fortunate enough to study in the best agricultural university of the country. The efforts of all vice-chancellors, since its inception, have provided excellent leadership and financial resources to the university, giving it a good reputation."" Encouraging students to achieve their dreams, Dr Khush said: ""PAU has produced scientists who have served in various international organizations."" Dr Dhillon lauded Dr Khush for his immense scientific knowledge, and expressed his indebtedness to him and his foundation for providing financial support to complement the students for their excellence in academics. Congratulating the students and the scientists, he exhorted them to work hard and help others."

The arrival of the first goods train from Silchar over the weekend with 1,250 tonnes of rice means that truckers will no longer have to drive down to Dimapur in Nagland to pick up the foodgrain on a highway that is often prone to blockades.This apart, they will be saving some 30 km each way.The train to Jirbam will run once a week and a similar service will ply to Tripura capital Agartala.Meanwhile officials said that the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will soon start stockpiling fuel at the proposed railhead at Mallom, 10 km from here. The newly-constructed depot can store 5,124 kilolitres (kl) of petrol, 11,796 kl of diesel and 5,055 kl of kerosene.There is another IOC depot at Chingmeirong near Imphal, but it can store only 840 kl of petrol, 3,341 kl of diesel and 2,528 kl of kerosene - enough for just a few days.Tribal groups in Nagaland have been calling frequent blockades, shutdowns and general strikes along the two national highways linking Manipur to Assam on many localised issues. On one occasion some Naga organisations had imposed a blockade for 103 days and it would have continued had it not been for the fact that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and then prime minister Manmohon Singh had visited Manipur ahead of the 2012 assembly elections.Officials said that the blockades apart, all vehicles from Manipur are forced to pay illegal taxes in the guise of goods tax, road tax and godown tax. Armed cadres of some outfits are seen openly extorting these taxes in some towns along the National Highway-2 (NH-2) that snakes through Nagaland. Anti-social elements also earn easy money by masquerading as foreign-trained insurgents, officials said.Drivers who refuse to bring money from the truck, bus and oil tanker owners are beaten up, the vehicle's documents seized, kidnapped and in some instances shot dead, officials said.Officials also said that once rice and fuel are stockpiled in Imphal the frequent blockades would not hit the people where it hurts the most.Whenever there are blockades, all petrol pumps go bone dry and ubiquitous roadside vendors sell one litre of petrol at Rs.150 or even higher. And, while most consumer items vanish from the market, the prices of those still available are jacked up with immunity."

They are also given free rice up to 20 kg, annual allowance to procure dresses from co-optex and allowance of Rs 250 in two years to procure utensils.The catch is that the refugees should be present in the camp for roll calls taken on the first and third Sundays of every month. The refugees, however, say the roll calls are not always taken on Sundays, but as per the convenience of The roll call was what made Ravindran take this drastic step, as he could not produce his sick son when it was taken. ""These roll calls restrict our movement. In spite of getting educated, we can't look for private jobs because roll calls may be taken any day . We are constantly watched and kept on surveillance,"" said a youth at the Vembakottai camp near Sivakasi.The refugees do not have valid citizenship, and Aadhar cards are given without the citizenship clause. They cannot buy vehicles. ""To put it short, we are treated like second class citizens, oppressed by officials and NGOs. In the name of serving refugees, all that the NGOs do is act hand in glove with officials and create a rift within the community,"" rues Vinayakamurthi.When the refugees reached here they were given thatched houses. Within two years, these houses had become dilapidated. Most of the camps lack proper drinking water or toilet facilities. If a refugee managed to construct a house on his own, he will have to surrender it to officials when he leaves and cannot offer it to his relatives still in the camp or sell it to inmates to repay loans taken for the construction.Justin Soysa of Mannar, like many thousands, returned to his homeland from here to build a future for himself after the civil war ended in 2009. ""At least in camps you get monthly assistance and can work outside to eke out a living. Such opportunities are not there back in their homeland.

The beneficiaries already get pulses, edible oil, salt and other food commodities at a nominal rate.The scheme is expected to feature in the gender budget under the Bhagya Jyothi scheme proposed by chief minister Siddaramaiah, sources said. Food and civil supplies minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said Karnataka is keen on implementing the Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana (recently announced by Union finance minister Arun Jaitely) by sharing the cost with the Centre. ""Funds are not a problem,"" he added.Under the proposed scheme, the government will provide a cooking stove and a domestic LPG connection to women members of each below poverty line (BPL) family. Karnataka has almost one crore BPL cardholders and roughly around 40% of them use kerosene, firewood, crop residue or cowdung cake.""Since the Centre is yet to release the funds, we have not been able to decide how much the project will cost the state treasury and how many families will be accommodated,"" Rao said. Officials said the government hopes to offer least one lakh connections in the first phase.The Union cabinet has earmarked Rs 8,000 crore for the Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana for three years. Karnataka had earlier launched a similar scheme to make it a kerosene-free state by providing LPG connections to BPL families, who get their quota of kerosene from fair price shops. Now it will be extended to those who use firewood, crop residue or cowdung cake to cook.Anna stalls on lines of Amma canteensIf everything goes according to plan, Karnataka will start Anna food outlets on the lines of Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu. The stalls will dish out hot idlis, upma and rice at just Rs 5.

You will be welcomed by chirping of hundreds of sparrows around the house of Edwin Joseph , a retired BEML employee - as if all the sparrows that have vanished from Bengaluru, have assembled here.Fondly known as the "" Sparrow man"" in the neighborhood, Edwin, 65, has been nurturing the sparrows for years. And his house compound is nothing short of a bird sanctuary with over 200 sparrows assembling there every day.While the little birds have been slowly disappearing over the past few decades owing to rapid urbanization, the number of sparrows visiting Edwin's house has been going up.""It was abou t 12 years ago. My wife, Sarah, saw a few sparrows in our compound to feed on the disposed off rice granules and enjoy the tree shade. We started loving them and started putting more grains. And their numbers started growing. Once we constructed a house at a vacant space, I realized, the birds can't survive without tree cover. I planted saplings which grew up to give them shelter at night. Today I wake up to the chirping of hundreds of sparrows,"" he added.Sarah, 65, explains they have put up artificial nest like pot so that sparrows can lay eggs, and 10 feeders wherein they can feed their little ones. ""Also, we have created a rain shelter for them. We have a schedule to feed them, like grains at 7 am, rice and chapati at 9 am, snacks like mixture at 11 am, etc. We also give them Indian sweets. This schedule will help people who occupy the house after we pass away,"" she added.Edwin terms his act a part of humanity and that there's nothing special about it. ""To bring back sparrows to Bengaluru, we should take out some time to care for them. Keeping little food (grains) and water outside your house and balconies can invite birds. If people say they don't have time for this, I think it's a stupid excuse,"" he added.The Sparrow Man has become a source of inspiration for neighbours. ""We bring children of our relatives to Edwin's house to introduce them to the real sparrows, which are missing in Bengaluru. His love for birds is immense and he does create awareness among residents,"" said Surendra P, a bank manager.Edwin said he has open invitation for the public to visit his house and see the sparrow world. ""I don't want anything in return. Even I have written to the BBMP commissioner asking him to visit the place so that we can spread the message to save sparrows for future,"" he added on the eve of World Sparrow Day (March 20)."

Deka's small land holding makes him ineligible for the scheme.Like hundreds of poor farmers in lower Assam, Deka hopes that political parties will pay heed to his demands in the run-up to the election.Insufficient irrigation, collapse of traditional methods of farming, heavy promotion of hybrid seeds instead of natives ones, non-implementation of policies aiming at boosting cropping intensity and double cropping, non-promotion of native types of paddy, lack of policies for landless farmers and climate change are some of the issues farmers have been crying hoarse over for years.Simanto Kalita, programme coordinator of the Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Assam, a national institution with a mandate to promote environment awareness, said political parties should include farmers' issues in their election manifestos. ""In Assam, traditional methods of farming are dying. There is need for political intervention to prevent this. Climate change is another issue that needs to be addressed,"" Kalita added.Both farmers and organizations working with them said the preservation and conservation of native varieties of rice through sustainable agriculture, especially in lower Assam, is something politicians needed to think about seriously. With the government's aggressive championing of high-yield variety of rice, there is hardly any scheme for the preservation and conservation of native varieties like Joha, Kola Joha, Mainagiri, Phool Pakhori, Tengre, Samraj, Boka Dhan, Tulsi Joha, Konkoni, Biru, Kajali Bah, Bordhan, Kalamdani, Manohar Sali, Phulgaz and others.""Irrigation facility is inaccessible in some areas. There are schemes for farmers but making them reach the intended targets is important,"" said Tapan Baishya, secretary of Lotus Progressive Centre (LPC), an NGO working with farmers in Morowa.""Political leaders should realize that schemes meant for marginalized farmers are not reaching them. Instead, beneficiaries are being selected improperly,"" said an adviser working with another farmers' group."

It wasn't always like this. In 2006, when the Singur dream unfolded, this was one of the many thriving ventures near the project site.Now, a movement, a change-of government and a scrapped project later, Bharat Hotel wears the decrepit look visible all around. Owner Rajesh Singh had an advantage: His 10-cottah plot was opposite the main gate of the Tata Motors site. Engineers and site officers came for their meals.With 16 employees, Singh catered to at least 300 clients daily, making Rs 25,000 a day. ""I started building rooms on the first floor. Outstation officers without families were ready tenants,"" he said. Singh is one of the many locals who had jumped into the restaurant-and-lodge business immediately after the Singur project was announced.Now, the rusted locked gates, the wilderness behind it and the factory sheds stand witness to the excitement and the subsequent heartbreak. But none of this seems to be helping CPM  which had proposed to set up the Tata factory  to wrest the seat from TMC. Canvassing is yet to pick up here. Minister Rabindranath Bhattacharya, who has been winning here since 2000, takes on CPM's Rabin Deb.He seems sure of a win. The retired schoolteacher remains popular. But this time, the buzz is that the collective depression will shrink his margin but he'll still beat Deb. Those who lost land to Tata's stillborn project are united today. ""We were against the project and had faith in Didi's movement. We thought we'd get back our land, or at least a higher price or it. I made a mistake declining the cheque,"" rues Subol Das, a farmer from Beraberi.His 8-cottah plot was ""taken away"". Some 3,700 people refused cheques. Today, they get 16kg rice and Rs 2,000 as special state dole. Bib- has Ghosh, a willing farmer from Gopalnagar, echoes Das: ""Today, everyone realises that had we supported the project, we would've been better off. But the ruling party gags all dissent."" Apartments mushroomed at Singur in 2007-08. They are ghost houses now. ""Single rooms were rented out at Rs 10,000 a month and real estate prices had zoomed to Rs 4,000 a sq ft,"" said Arun Kumar Das, a cinema owner who gave up four acres.Now, there are simply no takers. At least six nationalized banks had started branches at Singur to cash in on the proposed Rs 1,000-crore project, backed by at least 49 ancillaries. Earlier, only UBI and Allahabad Bank were there. Now, the additions, such as Central Bank, SBI, Allahabad Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Axis Bank and Bank of Baroda, complain they survived only on deposits from state projects such as Kanyashree, NREGA and widow pensions."
